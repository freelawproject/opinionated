We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The court reasonably could have found the following facts, which are relevant to our resolution of the issues on appeal. On August 22, 2005, Detective Fred Wil-coxson of the Stratford police department parked his vehicle at St. Michael\u2019s Cemetery on Stratford Avenue in Stratford to monitor the activities at the Stratford Motor Inn (motel), which is located across the street from the cemetery. The defendant, driving a green Chevrolet Lumina, drove into the motel parking lot and exited his vehicle, leaving open the driver\u2019s side door of the vehicle. His passenger, Roy Jones, remained in the vehicle. The defendant walked quickly and entered room four. Just a few minutes later, he returned to his vehicle and drove out of the parking lot. Wilcoxson became suspicious and followed the defendant\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Shortly thereafter, the defendant stopped his vehicle at a traffic light, and Wilcoxson drove alongside him. Wilcoxson then observed the defendant drinking from a bottle of beer. Wilcoxson contacted Stratford Officer Ulysses Munoz via the walkie-talkie component of his cellular telephone, asking him to intercept the defendant because the defendant was drinking beer while operating a motor vehicle. Wilcoxson and Munoz spoke several times while Munoz was en route to the defendant\u2019s location. Before Munoz had the opportunity to stop the defendant\u2019s vehicle, the defendant parked on Yale Street several feet from the curbing. Munoz, without activating the siren or emergency lights, parked approximately one car length behind the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>vehicle and approached it on foot. As Munoz approached the driver\u2019s side door, he saw the defendant hand a Heineken bottle to his passenger. Munoz asked the defendant for his license, insurance card and vehicle registration. The defendant stated that he did not have a valid driver\u2019s license, but he gave Munoz the other documents that he had requested. Munoz then walked to the passenger side of the vehicle and requested that the passenger provide identification, which he did. Munoz saw two Heineken bottles behind the legs of the passenger, and he asked the passenger to exit the vehicle. As the passenger exited, Munoz saw Wilcoxson approaching the vehicle. The defendant then began moaning, complaining of cramps, while bending over toward the passenger\u2019s seat and fumbling around in his waistband. Wilcoxson asked the defendant to put his hands up, but the defendant did not comply. Wilcoxson then told the defendant to exit the vehicle; the defendant complied but continued to hunch over and fumble around his waistband. When the defendant stood straight up, a bag of crack cocaine fell from his shorts and landed on the ground. The defendant tried to stomp on the drugs. After a brief scuffle, Wilcoxson and Munoz handcuffed the defendant and placed him under arrest. When the defendant stood up after being handcuffed, several more bags of crack cocaine fell from his shorts.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Wilcoxson and several other officers went back to the motel and questioned employees about the occupants of room four. The employees showed Wilcoxson a picture of the defendant, and they confirmed that the motel key card seized from the defendant was for room four. Wilcoxson and other officers then went to room four and knocked on the door. A young boy answered the door, and Wilcoxson saw a woman, later identified as the defendant\u2019s girlfriend, SharondaTuck, and two bags of marijuana lying on a nightstand in plain view. Tuck admitted that the marijuana belonged to her, and she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>was arrested. Wilcoxson and the other officers searched the motel room and found other drugs and drug paraphernalia and a pistol.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">On the basis of these facts, the defendant was convicted of transporting cocaine with intent to sell, two counts of possession of cocaine with intent to sell and interfering with an officer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">On appeal, the defendant first claims that the court improperly denied his motion to suppress after concluding that the police had not subjected him to a seizure or concluding, in the alternative, that the police had a reasonable and articulable suspicion justifying a seizure. The defendant claims that the seizure violated article first, \u00a7\u00a7 7<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 9,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the constitution of Connecticut. Although we conclude that the court improperly found that the defendant was not subjected to a seizure at the time Munoz asked him for his driver\u2019s license, insurance card and vehicle registration, we agree with the court\u2019s alternative finding that the investigatory seizure was justified because the police had a reasonable and articulable suspicion of illegal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">Our rules of practice provide: \u201cUpon motion, the judicial authority shall suppress potential testimony or other evidence if it finds that suppression is required under the constitution or laws of the United States or the state of Connecticut.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 41-12; see also General Statutes \u00a7 54-33f. \u201cOur standard of review of a trial court\u2019s findings and conclusions in connection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>with a motion to suppress is well defined. A finding of fact will not be disturbed unless it is clearly erroneous in view of the evidence and pleadings in the whole record .... [W]here the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision .... We undertake a more probing factual review when a constitutional question hangs in the balance. ... In [a] case, in which we are required to determine whether the defendant was seized by the police, we are presented with a mixed question of law and fact that requires our independent review.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Burroughs, </em>288 Conn. 836, 843-44, 955 A.2d 43 (2008). \u201cWhen considering the validity of a . . . stop, our threshold inquiry is twofold. . . . First, we must determine at what point, if any, did the encounter between [the police officer] and the defendant constitute an investigatory stop or seizure. . . . Next, [i]f we conclude that there was such a seizure, we must then determine whether [the police officer] possessed a reasonable and articulable suspicion at the time the seizure occurred.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Santos, </em>267 Conn. 495, 503, 838 A.2d 981 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">The defendant claims that the court improperly concluded that he was not subjected to a seizure. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">Our Supreme Court recently articulated \u201cthe legal test used to determine when a person is seized within the meaning of article first, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 9, of our state constitution. ... [A] person is seized when, by means of physical force or a show of authority, his freedom of movement is restrained. . . . The key consideration is whether, in view of all the circumstances surrounding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave. . . . The inquiry is objective, focusing on a reasonable person\u2019s probable reaction to the officer\u2019s conduct. See, e.g., [id., 503] ([i]n determining the . . . question of whether there has been a seizure, we examine the effect of the police conduct at the time of the alleged seizure, applying an objective standard . . .).\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Burroughs, </em>supra, 288 Conn. 844-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">We begin by determining whether there was a sufficient show of authority by the police to constitute a seizure. \u201cA proper analysis of this question is necessarily fact intensive, requiring a careful examination of the entirety of the circumstances in order to determine whether the police engaged in a coercive display of authority such that a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position would not have felt free to leave. . . . In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mendenhall, </em>[446 U.S. 544, 554, 100 S. Ct. 1870, 64 L. Ed. 2d 497 (1980)], the Supreme Court listed a number of factors that, \u2018in view of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident,\u2019 might indicate a sufficient show of authority to create a seizure. \u2018Examples of circumstances that might indicate a seizure, even where the person did not attempt to leave, would be the threatening presence of several officers, the display of a weapon by an officer, some physical touching of the person of the citizen, or the use of language or tone of voice indicating that compliance with the officer\u2019s request might be compelled.\u2019 Id.; see also <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Chesternut, </em>486 U.S. 567, 575, 108 S. Ct. 1975, 100 L. Ed. 2d 565 (1988) (\u2018[T]he police conduct involved . . . would not have communicated to the reasonable person an attempt to capture or otherwise intrude upon [the] respondent\u2019s freedom of movement. The record does not reflect that the police activated a siren or flashers; or that they commanded [the] respondent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>halt, or displayed any weapons; or that they operated the car in an aggressive manner to block [the] respondent\u2019s course or otherwise control the direction or speed of his movement.\u2019).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Burroughs, </em>supra, 288 Conn. 846-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">In <em>Burroughs, </em>our Supreme Court determined that the defendant in that case was not subjected to a seizure when two officers approached his vehicle, one on each side of the vehicle, because there was no showing of authority or use of physical force. Id., 840-52. The court did explain, however, that its conclusion would be different if the police had parked behind the defendant\u2019s vehicle and activated the police siren, thereby demonstrating their authority: \u201c[A] reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position would not have felt free to leave if . . . the officers . . . had demonstrated their authority by pulling up behind the defendant\u2019s vehicle and activating their patrol car\u2019s overhead flashing lights.\u201d Id., 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">We also find informative the recent holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Silva, 285 </em>Conn. 447, 939 A.2d 581 (2008). In <em>Silva, </em>our Supreme Court determined that a refusal to produce motor vehicle documents when requested by an officer, in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 14-217, may constitute a violation of \u00a7 53a-167a, interfering with an officer.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Id., 456-57; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Aloi, </em>280 Conn 824, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>832-33,911 A.2d 1086 (2007) (refusal to provide identification to police when asked may interfere with officer\u2019s ability to perform duty and thus may violate \u00a7 53a-167a).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">In the present case, we conclude that once Munoz approached the defendant\u2019s vehicle and requested that the defendant produce his documents, thereby exercising police authority, the defendant was not free to leave and was under seizure. Pursuant to \u00a7 14-217, the defendant was required to produce those documents under penalty of law. A refusal to produce them may have subjected him to a violation of \u00a7 14-217, as well as a misdemeanor charge of interfering with an officer pursuant to \u00a7 53a-167a. Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant was under seizure once Munoz requested that he produce his documents; no reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position would have felt free to leave. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Burroughs, </em>supra, 288 Conn. 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">Having determined that the defendant was subjected to a seizure once Munoz requested that he produce his documents, we next must determine whether Munoz possessed a reasonable and articulable suspicion at the time of the seizure. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Santos, </em>supra, 267 Conn. 503. The defendant argues that the \u201ccourt improperly concluded that Munoz had a reasonable and articulable suspicion based on: (1) the transmission from Wil-coxson regarding [the defendant\u2019s] drinking while driving in [the] defendant\u2019s car; (2) Munoz\u2019 observation, when approaching the [defendant\u2019s vehicle], of [the] defendant handing the passenger a Heineken bottle and (3) parking illegally in violation of a Stratford town ordinance.\u201d He also argues that the stop was pretextual. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">\u201cPursuant to <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889 (1968), a police officer has the authority, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>under the fourth amendment to the United States constitution, to stop the operator of a car if the officer has a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the operator has engaged in illegal conduct. In furtherance of this constitutional principle, our Supreme Court has held that a police officer has the right to conduct a <em>Terry </em>stop even if the reason for the stop is only that the officer observed an infraction under our traffic laws. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>209 Conn. 98, 122, 547 A.2d 10 (1988).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cyrus, </em>111 Conn. App. 482, 483, 959 A.2d 1054 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\u201cReasonable and articulable suspicion is an objective standard that focuses not on the actual state of mind of the police officer, but on whether a reasonable person, having the information available to and known by the police, would have had that level of suspicion. . . . What constitutes a reasonable and articulable suspicion depends on the totality of the circumstances. . . . The determination of whether a specific set of circumstances provides a police officer with a reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity is a question of fact for the trial court and is subject to limited appellate review. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">\u201cAn appeal challenging the factual basis of a court\u2019s decision that a reasonable and articulable suspicion exists requires that we determine, in light of the record taken as a whole, (1) whether the underlying factual findings of the trial court are clearly erroneous; and (2) whether the [court\u2019s] conclusion that those facts gave rise to such a suspicion is legally correct.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>98 Conn. App. 542, 548-49, 909 A.2d 969 (2006), cert. denied, 281 Conn. 910, 916 A.2d 53 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">In the present case, the trial court concluded that the seizure of the defendant was not pretextual and that Munoz had a reasonable and articulable suspicion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>based on the court\u2019s findings that (1) Wilcoxson reported to Munoz that he saw the defendant drinking while operating his motor vehicle, which is a class C misdemeanor punishable by a maximum of three months imprisonment pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-36 and 53a-213, (2) as Munoz approached the defendant\u2019s vehicle, he personally observed the defendant handing his passenger a Heineken beer bottle and (3) the defendant parked his vehicle more than one foot from the curb in violation of a Stratford town ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The defendant contends that the court initially found some inconsistencies and credibility issues in the testimony of Munoz and Wilcoxson, especially related to the timing of Wilcoxson\u2019s observation of the defendant drinking and the fact that the officers did not secure the beer bottles for evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He then contends that the court\u2019s stated findings in its articulation on the issue of reasonable and articulable suspicion were at odds with its initial findings, which, he claims, demonstrates that there is a fundamental flaw in the evidence. The defendant further argues that the court\u2019s finding that he was parked illegally was clearly erroneous because he was parked for only two to three minutes while in the vehicle, and the parking ordinance at issue \u201cpresumes that an owner or operator will <em>not </em>be in the car when notice of the violation issued.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) He asks that we conclude that the court improperly found that he parked illegally under these facts or, in the alternative, that such illegal parking does not provide a constitutionally sufficient justification for a seizure. After thoroughly reviewing the record, we conclude that the court\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous, that the record supports the court\u2019s conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>that the seizure of the defendant was not pretextual and that Munoz had a reasonable and articulable suspicion justifying a seizure of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">As our Supreme Court has explained: \u201cA police officer has the right to stop a motor vehicle operating on a Connecticut highway even if the reason for the stop is only an infraction under our traffic laws.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 122. Parking more than one foot from the curbing on a public road is an infraction under General Statutes \u00a7 14-251<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and Stratford Town Ordinances \u00a7 203-8.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Here, Munoz testified that he observed that the defendant was parked \u201cseveral feet\u201d from the curbing, which testimony was credited by the trial court in its findings. <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Because this finding is supported by the record, we conclude that the defendant has failed to prove that it was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Next, we examine the defendant\u2019s contention that \u00a7 203-8 of the Stratford Town Ordinances does not apply if the driver remains in the vehicle while parked several feet from the curbing. The defendant attempts to distinguish <em>State </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>84 Conn. App. 519, 524-25, 854 A.2d 74, cert. denied, 271 Conn. 941, 861 A.2d 516 (2004), from the facts of this case. Similar to counsel in the present case, appellate counsel in <em>Gordon </em>had argued in his appellate brief that parking in a no parking zone did not give the police a reasonable and articulable suspicion warranting further investigation but, rather, that it simply authorized the police to leave a ticket on the vehicle\u2019s windshield. We conclude that the facts of this case are not distinguishable, in any meaningful way, from the relevant facts in <em>Gordon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">In <em>Gordon, </em>the defendant parked his vehicle on the side of the road in an area marked with several no parking signs and remained parked there for approximately three minutes. Id., 521. A police officer was concerned because of the hazards posed by parking in such an area, and he approached the defendant\u2019s vehicle to see if assistance was needed. Id., 521-22. After speaking with the driver of the vehicle, the police officer determined that the defendant was intoxicated and arrested him. Id., 522. The court found that \u201cthe defendant was parked illegally in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-251 when the officers approached his vehicle and concluded that that violation provided the officers with a reasonable and articulable suspicion that a crime was being committed.\u201d Id., 523. In upholding the trial court\u2019s determination, we explained that the police officer \u201chad a reasonable and articulable suspicion to approach the defendant\u2019s vehicle <em>because </em>it was parked in a no parking zone.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">In the present case, the defendant was parked illegally, \u201cseveral feet\u201d from the curbing on a public roadway. Munoz testified that he witnessed this and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>approached the vehicle. The defendant admits that he, like the defendant in <em>Gordon, </em>had been parked for two to three minutes. Accordingly, we do not find the facts of <em>Gordon </em>substantially distinguishable from the facts in the present case. Applying an objective standard to these circumstances, as we must, we conclude that the court properly found that the defendant parked his vehicle in violation of \u00a7 203-8 of the Stratford Town Ordinances and General Statutes \u00a7 14-251, and we further conclude, therefore, as we did in <em>Gordon, </em>that the police officer had a reasonable and articulable suspicion to approach the defendant\u2019s vehicle because it was parked illegally. On this basis alone, the investigatory seizure was justified. Accordingly, we need not review the additional basis for the court\u2019s conclusion, having concluded that there was a reasonable and articulable suspicion justifying the investigatory seizure because the defendant was parked illegally. We will examine, however, the defendant\u2019s contention that the seizure was pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The defendant also argues that, even if there was a reasonable and articulable suspicion on which Munoz could have effected a valid seizure, Wilcoxson followed the defendant and requested that Munoz stop him for pretextual reasons, raising an issue concerning what the defendant terms \u201cpreconceived culpability\u201d or the \u201cinsidious specter of profiling\u201d because the defendant \u201cis a young black male.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In effect, the defendant asks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>that we hold that it is the subjective intent of the officers that should govern our determination of whether a motor vehicle stop is pretextual. As the Supreme Court held in <em>Whren </em>v. <em>United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 116 S. Ct. 1769, 135 L. Ed. 2d 89 (1996), an objective standard is employed to test whether the action of law enforcement violates the fourth amendment to the United States constitution. Because Munoz had a reasonable and arti-culable suspicion, which objectively was based on investigating the defendant\u2019s illegally parked vehicle, Munoz\u2019 investigatory seizure was justified under the fourth amendment. Although the defendant argues that this allegedly pretextual stop also violated the state constitution, he provides no analysis under our state constitution. \u201cWe . . . repeatedly [have] apprised litigants that we will not entertain a state constitutional claim unless the defendant has provided an independent analysis under the particular provisions of the state constitution at issue. . . . Without a separately briefed and analyzed state constitutional claim, we deem abandoned the defendant\u2019s claim . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinvil, </em>270 Conn. 516, 518 n.l, 853 A.2d 105 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly denied his motion to suppress certain evidence after concluding that he did not have standing to challenge \u201cthe legality of items seized without a warrant in room four of the motel.\u201d The defendant argues that the court\u2019s ruling was improper because additional evidence \u201cadduced at trial confirmed that [he] had standing,\u201d and, therefore, the court improperly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to reconsider the ruling on his motion to suppress and improperly denied his motion to suppress.

This determination is made on a case-by-case basis. . . .

Further, the fact that a person does not have the exclusive use of an area does not bar his having a reasonable expectation of privacy that furnishes standing to object to a government seizure. . . . Accordingly, a person who makes a telephone call from a public telephone booth may challenge the state\u2019s warrantless interception of the call . . . and an overnight guest has the right to contest a warrantless entry into his or her host\u2019s home. . . . Thus, a person may have a sufficient interest in a place other than his home to enable him to be free in that place from unreasonable searches and seizures ... so long as the place is one in which society is prepared, because of its code of values and its notions of custom and civility, to give deference to a manifested expectation of privacy.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 93-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The following facts, discerned from the record, are necessary for our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. During the suppression hearing, the defendant called Wilcoxson to the witness stand for the purpose of \u201cshowing standing.\u201d Wilcoxson testified that he obtained a motel key card from the defendant during his arrest and that, after the defendant was arrested, Wilcoxson went to the motel office. He also stated that the key card he obtained from the defendant was for room number four. When asked if he saw \u201cany photographs ... of a resident of the [motel]\u201d upon inquiry at the motel office, Wilcoxson responded, \u201cI saw a picture of [the defendant].\u201d He further stated that the photograph that he saw of the defendant related to room <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>number four. After going to room number four, Wil-coxson testified, he knocked on the door, and a female answered; there also was a young child in the room. He then testified that it was the child who actually opened the door while the woman sat inside the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">In its April 4, 2006 oral ruling regarding the issue of standing, the court, <em>Hauser, J., </em>stated in relevant part: \u201c[T]he court further concludes that the defendant has not established standing in the search of unit number four nor in the items seized therein. The defendant points to the fact that he possessed ... a key card to that room . . . [and] to a picture of the defendant which was in the possession of the office of the [motel], and that picture related to unit number four. He finally points out that the inventory form filed by the police listed unit four as the defendant\u2019s home address. It should be noted that the tow form [for the defendant\u2019s vehicle] also made out by the police indicated Bridgeport as [the defendant\u2019s] address, as did the certified copy of the motor vehicle registration offered by the defendant. His [identification] card listed Waterbury as his address.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">\u201cThere is no evidence that [the defendant] was the one who actually rented room number four. There is no evidence that he paid for the room. There is no evidence that he ever stayed at the room. There is no evidence asserting that any personal property in the room belonged to him. The evidence indicates that his only personal contact with unit four came when he parked near that unit, went very quickly inside, leaving the car door opened, carrying nothing, and returned to his car in a very short time, again carrying nothing. There\u2019s no evidence that he used a key to open the door. . . . There was no evidence of the occupant sharing the room with him. There was no testimony from anyone concerning his asserted status.\u201d On the basis of these findings, the court concluded that the defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>not demonstrated that he had standing to challenge the legality of the search of room number four of the motel or the items seized therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The defendant claims that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in room four of the motel and, therefore, that the court improperly concluded that he lacked standing to challenge the search thereof. The defendant does not argue that the evidence he submitted at the suppression hearing alone was sufficient to establish that he had standing to contest the legality of the search of room number four. Rather, he argues that the court\u2019s denial of his motion to reconsider this ruling after further evidence was produced at trial was improper because that additional evidence proved that the defendant had standing. The defendant claims that, taking all of the evidence into consideration, the court improperly denied his motion to suppress the search of room number four and the evidence found therein. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">As the trial court, <em>Hauser, J., </em>observed in its April 4, 2006 oral ruling regarding the issue of standing, although the defendant had a key card for room number four and that was the address listed for the defendant on the police inventory form, the tow form and his motor vehicle registration listed Bridgeport as his address, and his identification card listed Waterbury as his address. The court also found that there was no evidence that the defendant was the person who rented room number four, paid for room number four or had any personal property in room number four.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">The defendant argues, however, that further evidence was presented at trial that established that he was, in fact, the person who had rented room number four and that it was \u201chis room.\u201d The defendant contends that this additional evidence, taken together with the previous evidence, was sufficient to establish his standing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>contest the search of room number four and the evidence seized therefrom and that the court abused its discretion when it denied his motion to reconsider the issue of standing and his motion to suppress. The state urges that we not consider the evidence offered at trial, before a different judge, in assessing the propriety of the initial ruling that the defendant did not possess standing to challenge the search of room number four. It argues that the defendant failed in his burden of proof at the suppression hearing and that any additional evidence offered at the time of trial should not be used to evaluate the earlier ruling. Accordingly, it contends that the only ruling we should consider is the ruling on the motion for reconsideration. Assuming, without deciding, that the evidence offered at trial properly may be considered when determining the propriety of the denial of a motion to suppress when the court has been asked to reconsider its ruling following the presentation of the additional evidence at trial; see generally <em>State </em>v. Lewis, 60 Conn. App. 219, 245 n.28, 759 A.2d 518 (recognizing that to determine whether a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights have been infringed, appellate court must review record in entirety and not just evidence before trial court at time of ruling, but finding it significant that defendant never asked trial court to reconsider findings made at suppression hearing in light of trial testimony), cert. denied, 255 Conn. 906, 762 A.2d 911 (2000); we conclude, on the basis of the entire record before us, that the defendant has failed to prove that the court, <em>Thim, J., </em>improperly ruled that there remained insufficient evidence that the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in room number four.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The defendant directs us to the trial testimony of Tuck, his then girlfriend, which he claims \u201cstanding alone proves that [he had] a legitimate expectation of privacy in room four of the motel.\u201d The defendant contends that Tuck testified that she and her son \u201chad been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>living with the defendant for approximately thirty days in room four\u201d and that \u201cit was his room.\u201d The state responds by arguing that \u201cthe trial court implicitly rejected Tuck\u2019s testimony when it stated, after listening to her testify, that it did not hear anything that would cause it to change Judge Hauser\u2019s decision.\u201d The state also argues that because \u201cthe trial court was free to reject Tuck\u2019s testimony, it did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">During trial, defense counsel argued that, in addition to being the defendant\u2019s then girlfriend, Tuck also was his codefendant, charged with possession of the same narcotics for which the defendant was charged, those found in room number four. Defense counsel explained that Tuck was \u201cbeing offered leniency for her testimony\u201d against the defendant. After being called to the witness stand, Tuck testified at the defendant\u2019s trial in the presence of her attorney. She stated that on the evening of August 22, 2005, she and her son were in room number four of the motel and that she awoke to find several police officers in her room. The officers asked her for permission to search the room, and she granted them permission. She stated that the police first found two bags of marijuana on the top of the nightstand and that the marijuana belonged to her. After searching further, the police found a gun, crack cocaine and a scale, and, she stated, those items did not belong to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Tuck further testified that she and her son had been in room number four for approximately thirty days, and she acknowledged that \u201cthe defendant [had] come to that room on other days before the day of August 22, 2005.\u201d She also stated that she had never seen the defendant do anything with the items that the police found during their search. She testified that she did have an agreement with the state that she would \u201ctestify to the stuff that does not belong to [her and own] up to what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>belongs to [her]. That\u2019s the marijuana.\u201d She further stated that a charge of risk of injury to a child, a weapons charge and a possession of crack cocaine charge \u201cwould be throw[n] out\u201d and that her testimony at the defendant\u2019s trial would not be used against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">When cross-examined by defense counsel, Tuck testified that she lived in room number four but that she had no knowledge of the gun hidden between the box spring and the mattress or the crack cocaine hidden inside the nightstand. She had never seen those items nor had she seen the defendant with those items. When asked by defense counsel: \u201cSo, you didn\u2019t know it was there. You don\u2019t know if he knew it was there, right?\u201d She responded: \u201cIt was his room. If it was \u2014 it\u2019s not mine, so who else would it have been?\u201d She then stated that she was living and sleeping there and that the defendant was staying with her in that room.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Following Tuck\u2019s testimony, the defendant filed a motion to reconsider his motion to suppress and asked the court to be heard on the motion. During oral argument on the motion, defense counsel stated that he \u201cobviously [did not] want to waive any claim that [he might] have to asking Judge Hauser to reconsider his ruling on the motion to suppress.\u201d Nevertheless, he argued the merits of the motion before Judge Thim and did not request that it be heard by Judge Hauser. The defendant argued that Tuck\u2019s testimony that the room belonged to him provided the additional evidence necessary to prove that he had standing to challenge the search of room number four. Following argument, the court stated: \u201cJudge Hauser\u2019s ruling is the rule of the case, and I have seen \u2014 I have heard nothing before me such that I should change his decision. So the motion for reconsideration is denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">The defendant contends that the mere words of Tuck stating that \u201cit was his room\u201d sufficed to establish the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>defendant\u2019s standing. We are not persuaded. Tuck admitted that she was given leniency in exchange for her testimony against the defendant. She also testified that she was motivated to testify, at least in part, by the thought of her three children. Although, during cross-examination, she stated that it was the defendant\u2019s room, she also stated that she and her son lived and slept in that room and that she had no knowledge of the gun or the crack cocaine that was found in the room. There is nothing in the record to indicate what portion, if any, of Tuck\u2019s testimony the court found credible. It is the province of the trial court to accept or reject, in whole or in part, the testimony of a witness. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Goodspeed, </em>107 Conn. App. 717, 728-29, 946 A.2d 312 (\u201cIn conducting our review, we are mindful that the finding of facts, the gauging of witness credibility and the choosing among competing inferences are functions within the exclusive province of the [finder of fact], and, therefore, we must afford those determinations great deference. . . . The [finder of fact] can . . . decide what \u2014 all, none or some \u2014 of a witness\u2019 testimony to accept or reject.\u201d [Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]), cert. denied, 287 Conn. 920, 951 A.2d 570 (2008). Accordingly, we are unable to conclude that the court improperly concluded that Tuck\u2019s testimony did not provide sufficient additional evidence to establish the defendant\u2019s standing to challenge the search of room number four.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b276-10\"> The defendant was acquitted on a charge of interfering with a search in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 54-33d as set forth in count five of the long form information. The court also found that the state had failed to prove that the defendant was a persistent drug offender pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 21a-277 and 21a-278 as charged in apart B information. Following the defendant\u2019s conviction, the court merged counts one and two \u2014 illegal transport of cocaine and one count of possession of cocaine with intent to sell \u2014 for purposes of sentencing. The defendant then was sentenced to a total effective term of sixteen years incarceration, suspended after ten years, with five years of probation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b279-10\"> See footnote 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b279-11\"> Article first, \u00a7 7, of the constitution of Connecticut provides in relevant part: \u201cThe people shall be secure in their persons, houses, papers and possessions from unreasonable searches or seizures . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b279-12\"> Article first, \u00a7 9, of the constitution of Connecticut provides: \u201cNo person shall be arrested, detained or punished, except in cases clearly warranted by law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b282-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-217 provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person who is operating or in charge of any motor vehicle, when requested by any officer in uniform . . . may refuse to give his name and address or the name and address of the owner of the motor vehicle or give a false name or address, or refuse, on demand of such officer, agent or other person, to produce his motor vehicle registration certificate, operator\u2019s license and any automobile insurance identification card ....
