We agree with the plaintiffs and, therefore, reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment of dismissal and remand the matter for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>The following facts are relevant to the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. They filed a six count complaint against the defendant. In the complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that Steven Talenti had been an employee of the defendant for approximately twelve years when he failed a mandatory company drug test and was summarily discharged at the defendant\u2019s corporate headquarters in Greenwich. Immediately thereafter, the defendant, acting through an employee, sent an e-mail from that office to all of its employees in Connecticut, New York and New Jersey, advising that the plaintiff had failed a drug test and had been discharged. In counts one through six of the complaint, the plaintiffs alleged (1) a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 31-5 lx,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (2) a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 31-51u,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (3) invasion of privacy, (4) a prima facie tort, (5) intentional infliction of emotional distress and (6) loss of consortium. The complaint also alleged that the lawsuit \u201carises under and is governed by the laws of the state of Connecticut.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">The defendant moved to dismiss the complaint in its entirety on the ground of a lack of personal jurisdiction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>The defendant alleged that because it is a foreign corporation,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the plaintiffs must use the Connecticut corporate long arm statute, General Statutes \u00a7 33-929 (f),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to obtain personal jurisdiction over it but are unable to do so because they are not residents of Connecticut or persons having a usual place of business in this state, as required by the statute. The plaintiffs, in their memorandum of law in opposition to the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, argued that they obtained personal jurisdiction by serving process on the defendant\u2019s vice president, Jeffrey Morgan, at his home in Riverside, and on the defendant\u2019s executive vice president, Brian Clark, at the defendant\u2019s corporate headquarters in Greenwich. The plaintiffs asserted that they did not utilize the corporate long arm statute, and, therefore, they did not have to meet its residency requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">At oral argument before the trial court, the defendant argued that because the corporate long arm statute required that the plaintiffs be residents of Connecticut, \u201c[t]he jurisdictional issue [that was] raised in [their] motion to dismiss is probably erroneously described as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>an issue of personal jurisdiction. . . . Whether or not a plaintiff can bring an action tinder the long arm statute is truly an issue of subject matter jurisdiction because it goes to the standing of the plaintiff to commence the lawsuit.\u201d In response, the plaintiffs maintained that it was an issue of personal jurisdiction and that the court had such jurisdiction. After hearing argument from both the plaintiffs and the defendant, the court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, stating: \u201cThe court finds that (1) the plaintiffs are not Connecticut residents, (2) they do not maintain a usual place of business in Connecticut or (3) their statutory claims are not within the scope of General Statutes \u00a7 33-929. Accordingly, they can not maintain an action against a New York corporation [in Connecticut].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Our review of the court\u2019s dismissal is governed by certain well settled principles. \u201cA motion to dismiss . . . properly attacks the jurisdiction of the court, essentially asserting that the plaintiff cannot as a matter of law and fact state a cause of action that should be heard by the court. ... A motion to dismiss tests . . . whether, on the face of the record, the court is without jurisdiction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ertel </em>v. <em>Rocque, </em>108 Conn. App. 48, 51, 946 A.2d 1251, cert. denied, 289 Conn. 926, 958 A.2d 158 (2008). \u201c[A] challenge to the jurisdiction of the court presents a question of law over which our review is plenary.\u201d <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Cerullo, </em>282 Conn. 109, 118, 918 A.2d 867 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">In this appeal, the plaintiffs concede that they are not residents of Connecticut, and, therefore, they are unable to take advantage of Connecticut\u2019s corporate long arm statute. They argue, however, that the court should not have applied that statute and its residency requirements to dismiss their complaint because the court instead acquired personal jurisdiction over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>defendant by virtue of the facts that the defendant maintains its principal place of business in Connecticut, is authorized to do business in Connecticut, accepts service of process in Connecticut and that it was served with process in accordance with \u00a7 52-57 (c)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and they seek redress for acts that took place in Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">In response, the defendant argues that the court correctly granted its motion to dismiss because \u00a7 33-929 (f) is applicable and pursuant to that statute, the plaintiffs lack standing to bring a lawsuit against a foreign corporation in Connecticut because they are not residents of Connecticut or persons having a usual place of business in this state, which implicates subject matter jurisdiction. The defendant concedes that its motion to dismiss was based on lack of personal jurisdiction and that the court treated \u201cthe issue before it [as] one of personal jurisdiction,\u201d but avers that \u201c[s]ince the trial court made the necessary findings to determine that [the] plaintiffs lacked standing [i.e., the plaintiffs are not residents of Connecticut] the judgment can and should be affirmed on this alternate ground [of subject matter jurisdiction].\u201d The defendant also maintains that because the plaintiffs are nonresidents, the court lacked personal jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 33-929 (f) as well, and the plaintiffs cannot claim that the court acquired personal jurisdiction by service of process pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>\u00a7 52-57 (c) because the plaintiffs did not rely on that statute before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">We will first address the issue of standing because it presents a question of the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>In re Anthony A., </em>112 Conn. App. 643, 650, 963 A.2d 1057 (2009). We are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s argument that the court\u2019s decision to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint should be affirmed on the ground of lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the plaintiffs lack standing to pursue their causes of action in Connecticut. The defendant bases this argument on its belief that the plaintiffs can obtain jurisdiction over it only through the use of the corporate long arm statute, \u00a7 33-929 <em>(f), </em>which allows only a \u201cresident of this state or ... a person having a usual place of business in this state\u201d to subject foreign corporations to suit in Connecticut. General Statutes \u00a7 33-929 (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">\u201cThe issue of standing implicates [a] court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ragin </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>78 Conn. App. 848, 859, 829 A.2d 93 (2003). \u201c[I]n the absence of standing the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to determine the merits of the case . . . .\u201d <em>Sadloski </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>235 Conn. 637, 650, 668 A.2d 1314 (1995). \u201cStanding is not a technical rule intended to keep aggrieved parties out of court; nor is it a test of substantive rights. Rather it is a practical concept designed to ensure that courts and parties are not vexed by suits brought to vindicate nonjusticiable interests and that judicial decisions which may affect the rights of others are forged in hot controversy, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>each view fairly and vigorously represented. . . . These two objectives are ordinarily held to have been met when a complainant makes a colorable claim of direct injury he has suffered or is likely to suffer, in an individual or representative capacity. Such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy . . . provides the requisite assurance of concrete adverseness and diligent advocacy. . . . The requirement of directness between the injuries claimed by the plaintiff and the conduct of the defendant also is expressed, in our standing jurisprudence, by the focus on whether the plaintiff is the proper party to assert the claim at issue. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">\u201cTwo broad yet distinct categories of aggrievement exist, classical and statutory. . . . Classical aggrievement requires a two part showing. First, a party must demonstrate a specific, personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the [controversy], as opposed to a general interest that all members of the community share. . . . Second, the party must also show that the [alleged conduct] has specially and injuriously affected that specific personal or legal interest. . . . Statutory aggrievement exists by legislative fiat, not by judicial analysis of the particular facts of the case. In other words, in cases of statutory aggrievement, particular legislation grants standing to those who claim injury to an interest protected by that legislation. . . . Standing can be established by proving statutory or classical aggrievement.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>PNC Bank, N.A. </em>v. <em>Kelepecz, </em>289 Conn. 692, 705-706, 960 A.2d 563 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">In this case, the defendant does not claim that the plaintiffs cannot demonstrate aggrievement. Instead, the defendant argues that because the plaintiffs are nonresidents, they cannot take advantage of our corporate long arm statute, and, therefore, they are improper parties to initiate this action. The court rejects this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>\u201cSubject matter jurisdiction is the power [of the court] to hear and determine cases of the general [type or] class to which the proceedings in question belong.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>MBNA America Bank, N.A. </em>v. <em>Boata, </em>283 Conn. 381, 389, 926 A.2d 1035 (2007). Nothing bars the nonresident plaintiffs in this matter from bringing in this state the type or class of claims alleged in their complaint. Two of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are established by Connecticut statutes, \u00a7\u00a731-5 lx and 31-51u. The remaining four, namely, invasion of privacy, a prima facie tort, intentional infliction of emotional distress and loss of consortium, have long been recognized as causes of action, or subject matter, over which the Superior Court has jurisdiction. Undoubtedly, if the defendant were a Connecticut resident, or was otherwise amenable to service of process, as the plaintiffs allege, the Superior Court would have subject matter jurisdiction to decide this dispute. See <em>University of Connecticut </em>v. <em>Atlantic Coast Conference, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Tolland, Docket No. X07-CV-03-0082695-S (February 23, 2004) (36 Conn. L. Rptr. 623). Thus, the inability of the nonresident plaintiffs to take advantage of our long arm statute merely deprives them of the opportunity to use that statute to acquire <em>personal </em>jurisdiction over a foreign corporation. This impediment does not prevent the court from determining the case once personal jurisdiction over the defendant has been obtained by some other means. See id., 627.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">We will now consider the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the court improperly dismissed their complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction. Jurisdiction over the person is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>the legal power and authority of a court to render a personal judgment against a party to an action or proceeding. The exercise of this jurisdiction requires (1) the service of process on the defendant, or on his agent for the service of process, (2) the consent to the jurisdiction of the court by the defendant or (3) waiver of any objection to the court\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction by the defendant. See <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>91 Conn. App. 528, 536, 881 A.2d 497 (2005). The consistent constitutional rule is that a court has no power to adjudicate a personal claim or obligation unless it has jurisdiction over the person of the defendant. <em>Pennoyer </em>v. <em>Neff, </em>95 U.S. 714, 24 L. Ed. 565 (1878), overruled in part on other grounds by <em>Shaffer </em>v. <em>Heitner, </em>433 U.S. 186, 97 S. Ct. 2569, 53 L. Ed. 2d 683 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">The defendant argues that we cannot review the plaintiffs\u2019 claim because they did not bring \u00a7 52-57 (c)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to the attention of the trial court, and, therefore, their claim is unpreserved. In this appeal, the plaintiffs renew substantially the same claim that the trial court rej ected, namely: (1) the court has personal jurisdiction over the defendant because the defendant maintains its principal place of business in Connecticut, is authorized to do business in Connecticut, accepts service of process in Connecticut and was served properly with process and (2) the long arm statute should not be applied to their claim because they did not utilize it to obtain personal jurisdiction over the defendant. We are not persuaded, therefore, that in this particular case, the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to bring a statute to the trial court\u2019s attention renders their claim unpreserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">We find that there are two bases in this case for the successful assertion of personal jurisdiction over the defendant, decisional and statutory. First, when a foreign corporation complies with the requisites of General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 33-920<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> by obtaining a certificate of authority and complies with the requisites of General Statutes \u00a7 33-926<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> by authorizing a public official to accept service of process, it has consented to the exercise of jurisdiction over it by the courts of this state. <em>Wallenta </em>v. <em>Avis Rent A Car System, Inc., </em>10 Conn. App. 201, 207-208, 522 A.2d 820 (1987).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201cThis consent is effective even though no other basis exists for the exercise of jurisdiction over the corporation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 208. \u201cSuch a corporation has purposely avail[ed] itself of the privilege of conducting activities within [this] [s]tate, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 207. Therefore, when a foreign corporation is authorized to conduct business in this state and has appointed a registered agent, nothing in \u00a7 33-929 (f) limits the court\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction over the corporation. See id., 208 (because defendant consented to personal jurisdiction, plaintiff did not have to establish that defendant made itself amenable to suit). In the present case, there is no dispute that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>defendant has registered with the secretary of the state to conduct business in Connecticut, in accordance with \u00a7 33-920, and has authorized the secretary of the state to accept service on its behalf, in accordance with \u00a7 33-926, as the defendant acknowledged in its oral argument to the trial court. Therefore, the defendant has voluntarily consented to the personal jurisdiction of it by the courts of this state.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">The second basis for the assertion of personal jurisdiction lies in \u00a7 52-57 (c), which provides that in an action against a foreign corporation, service of process may be made on its vice president. In the present case, the defendant does not dispute that the plaintiffs served the defendant\u2019s vice president, Jeffrey Morgan, at his home in Riverside and served the defendant\u2019s executive vice president, Brian Clark, at the defendant\u2019s corporate headquarters in Greenwich. The court, therefore, acquired personal jurisdiction over the defendant by service in accordance with \u00a7 52-57 (c).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We conclude that both personal and subject matter jurisdiction exist in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b870-10\"> The individual defendant, Jeffrey Morgan, is not a party to this appeal, as he did not contest the court\u2019s personal jurisdiction over him.
