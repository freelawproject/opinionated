Following a trial by jury, the defendant was convicted of assault in the third degree pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61 (a) (l),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> risk of injury to a child pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53-21 (a) (l)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and criminal violation of a protective order pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-223 (a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The jury found the defendant not guilty of threatening in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-62 (a) (2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant claims on appeal that the court improperly admitted evidence of his prior uncharged misconduct. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The defendant and the victim lived together in Massachusetts in a difficult and violent relationship. They separated shortly after their only child was bom. Sometime in early 2006, after the defendant attacked the victim, the victim\u2019s brother brought her and the child to Connecticut. The victim and the child initially lived in West Hartford with her brother and subsequently moved into an apartment in Hartford.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">On March 19, 2007, when the child was one and one-half years old, the defendant entered the victim\u2019s apartment building, although he did not have a key card to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>enter it or a key to operate the elevator, and knocked on her door. The victim asked the defendant to leave \u201cbecause [she] wanted no problems with him.\u201d The defendant stated that he wanted to see his child, and the victim told him that he would have to go to court for that. When she attempted to close the door of her apartment, the defendant forced his way in. He started pulling the victim toward the kitchen and told her that he would kill her and that she had no escape. The victim managed to free herself, ran out of the apartment and knocked on her neighbor\u2019s door. The neighbor later testified that the victim screamed for help and told him that the defendant was trying to kill the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The defendant followed the victim to the neighbor\u2019s apartment. Holding the child in one hand and a knife in the other, he told the victim that he would kill himself and the child if she called the police. The neighbor, who witnessed the defendant making the threat, testified that he told the defendant to calm down and that no one was going to call the police. The defendant then proceeded toward the elevator with the child, and the neighbor followed him while the victim called the police. The neighbor followed the defendant downstairs and eventually took the child and brought him back to the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">During the trial and outside of the jury\u2019s presence, the court summarized its earlier discussion with both counsel about the state\u2019s offer of proof regarding three instances of the defendant\u2019s prior uncharged misconduct. The court explained that the state relied on <em>State </em>v. <em>Irizarry, </em>95 Conn. App. 224, 896 A.2d 828, cert. denied, 279 Conn. 902, 901 A.2d 1224 (2006), in which a defendant was convicted of threatening in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-62 (a) (2), and this court decided that prior uncharged conduct of that defendant was admissible on the issue of his intent to terrorize the victim. The court stated that <em>Irizarry </em>\u201crecognized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>that there must be a balancing between the probative value of the offered evidence and its prejudicial effect\u201d and that such \u201cbalancing can only be undertaken by the court following [the] offer of proof.\u201d The court also stated that if the testimony was admitted, limiting jury instructions would be required following the testimony and at the conclusion of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">The state made the following offer of proof. The victim testified that on May 17, 2006,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> she encountered the defendant as she and the child were returning from a doctor\u2019s appointment, accompanied by her male friend. The friend was holding an infant car seat with the child in it. The defendant told the friend that the child was his and ordered him to let go of the seat. The defendant then punched the victim\u2019s friend and left. The state asked the victim, \u201cDid he make any . . . threats of violence toward you?\u201d and she replied, \u201cHe was always making threats.\u201d The victim proceeded to testify about two additional incidents that occurred on September 21, 2006, and January 21, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">The state then argued that, in each incident prior to March 19, 2007, \u201cthere was a threat and it was followed by an assault . . . [and] the state\u2019s position is [that] it\u2019s reasonable for this victim, based on her prior incidents with [the defendant], to believe that he was going to follow through on that threat. . . . [0]ne of the only ways for the state to prove [the defendant\u2019s intent] is based on extrinsic evidence such as prior . . . uncharged misconduct.\u201d The state further argued that threatening in the second degree is a specific intent crime and that the defendant\u2019s prior misconduct was probative on the issue of whether the defendant intended on March 19, 2007, to put the victim in fear.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>The court decided that the victim\u2019s memory regarding the events of September 21, 2006, and January 21, 2007, was faulty and that her testimony about those events was not sufficiently probative to be admitted. The court concluded, however, that the May 17, 2006 event was sufficiently similar to the incident in which the defendant was charged because an assault or an injury was brought against a third person to threaten the victim. The court stated that the victim would need to testify about a specific threat that took place on May 17, 2006, for the evidence regarding that event to have probative value because her previous statement that \u201c[the defendant] was always making threats,\u201d was not sufficiently probative. The court also noted that the problem with the victim\u2019s testimony might have been a \u201ctranslation issue.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The state then asked the victim whether she remembered what the defendant did as she and her friend were returning from the doctor\u2019s appointment on May 17, 2006. The victim stated, \u201cHe came running and hit my friend. He was threatening; he talked about killing; he hit him in the face and he ran; if you don\u2019t remove your hand from my child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">The court then stated that it would allow the state to \u201cvery narrowly question on that one incident\u201d and that it would provide a limiting instruction right after the victim\u2019s testimony on that issue. The court concluded that the event of May 17, 2006, was \u201cprobative on the issue of intent with regard to threatening with the intent to terrorize\u201d because it \u201cinvolve[d] threats [and] an injury to a third party.\u201d The court further decided that \u201c[a]s far as the prejudicial part of it . . . it would not unduly prejudice the defendant, in that, it is certainly of less seriousness than the present matter.\u201d The court concluded that the probative value outweighed the prejudicial effect with regard to the May <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>17,2006 incident and that \u201c[it] is specific as to the intent in the threatening in the second degree, the intent to terrorize.\u201d The victim testified before the jury regarding the May 17, 2006 incident. She was asked, \u201cDid [the defendant] say anything specifically to you?\u201d and she replied, \u201cIt was to me that he said that he was going to kill.\u201d The court then gave the jury limiting instructions, stating that the evidence was \u201cbeing admitted solely to show, or establish, the defendant\u2019s intent regarding count three of the information . . . [which] alleges threatening in the second degree. The evidence is not being admitted to prove the bad character of the defendant or the defendant\u2019s tendency to commit criminal acts.\u201d The court told the jury that it may not consider such evidence as establishing a predisposition on the part of the defendant to commit any of the crimes charged or to demonstrate criminal propensity. The court reiterated that the jury may consider the evidence only on the issue of the defendant\u2019s intent as to the count charging him with threatening in the second degree and for no other purpose. During its final charge to the jury, the court gave a similar limiting instruction on the use of the victim\u2019s testimony. On November 9, 2007, the defendant filed a motion for a judgment of acquittal and a motion for a new trial, in which he argued, among other things, that the prejudicial effect of the evidence regarding his prior uncharged misconduct outweighed its probative value. The court denied both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">The defendant claims that the court improperly concluded that the victim\u2019s testimony regarding the May 17, 2006 incident was admissible under \u00a7 4-5 (b) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence and that its probative value outweighed its prejudicial effect. We are not persuaded. Although the defendant was acquitted of the charge of threatening in the second degree, he claims that the jury was unduly prejudiced against him with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>respect to the remaining charges, and we therefore address his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">We first set forth our standard of review. \u201cThe admission of evidence of . . . uncharged misconduct is a decision properly within the discretion of the trial court. . . . [E]very reasonable presumption should be given in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling. . . . [T]he trial court\u2019s decision will be reversed only where abuse of discretion is manifest or where an injustice appears to have been done.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McFarlane, </em>88 Conn. App. 161, 164, 868 A.2d 130, cert. denied, 273 Conn. 931, 873 A.2d 999 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">Pursuant to \u00a7 4-5 (b) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cevidence of prior misconduct is inadmissible to prove that a criminal defendant is guilty of the crime of which the defendant is accused. . . . Such evidence cannot be used to suggest that the defendant has a bad character or a propensity for criminal behavior. . . . We have, however, recognized exceptions to the general rule if the purpose for which the evidence is offered is to prove <em>intent, </em>identity, malice, motive, a system of criminal activity or the elements of a crime.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Erhardt, </em>90 Conn. App. 853, 858-59, 879 A.2d 561, cert. denied, 276 Conn. 906, 884 A.2d 1028 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">\u201cTo determine whether evidence of prior misconduct falls within an exception to the general rule prohibiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>its admission, we have adopted a two-pronged analysis. . . . First, the evidence must be relevant and material to at least one of the circumstances encompassed by the exceptions. Second, the probative value of such evidence must outweigh the prejudicial effect of the other crime evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 859.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">\u201cTo prove that the defendant was guilty of the crime of threatening in the second degree, the state was required to establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant <em>threaten[ed\\ to commit any crime of violence with the intent to terrorize another person. . . . </em>We previously have defined terrorize, as used in \u00a7 53a-62 (a) (2), as meaning to scare or to cause intense fear or apprehension. . . . Because intent is almost always proved, if at all, by circumstantial evidence, prior misconduct evidence, where available, is often relied upon.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Irizarry, </em>supra, 95 Conn. App. 233-34; see footnote 4. In the present case, therefore, the state sought to introduce the victim\u2019s testimony regarding the May 17, 2006 incident to prove that the defendant acted with the intent to terrorize her when he threatened to kill himself and the child on March 19, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">The defendant first argues that the prior uncharged misconduct from May 17, 2006, was not probative on the issue of his intent to terrorize the victim on March 19, 2007, because the defendant\u2019s threats on May 17, 2006, were directed at the victim\u2019s friend while his threats on March 19, 2007, were directed at the victim. The defendant argues that the May 17, 2006 misconduct is not relevant because it occurred ten months before the conduct for which he was charged and that his threats on that day were directed at the third party with whom, as far as he was aware, the victim had no emotional connection. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>The court concluded that the incident on May 17, 2006, was similar to the incident of March 19, 2007. In both instances, the victim and the child were closely involved in an altercation. The court specifically stated that it found the victim\u2019s testimony that the defendant \u201cwas always making threats\u201d not specific enough. The court, however, concluded, after hearing the victim\u2019s testimony that the defendant \u201cwas threatening\u201d and that \u201che talked about killing,\u201d that the threats were directed at her.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We therefore disagree with the defendant\u2019s argument that the victim\u2019s testimony indicated that the defendant threatened only her friend on May 17, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">This court has held that \u201c[t]he high degree of similarity required for admissibility on the issue of identity is not required for misconduct evidence to be admissible on the issue of intent.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Erhardt, </em>supra, 90 Conn. App. 860. \u201cEvidence is relevant if it has a logical tendency to aid the trier in the determination of an issue. ... All that is required is that the evidence tend to support a relevant fact even to a slight degree.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Irizarry, </em>supra, 95 Conn. App. 235. This court held in <em>Irizarry </em>that the evidence that the defendant previously threatened the victim was relevant to show his intent to cause her intense fear or apprehension and that by his actions he did not intend merely to annoy or to irritate her but, rather, to cause her intense fear or apprehension. Id., 237; contra <em>State </em>v. <em>Meehan, </em>260 Conn. 372, 395, 796 A.2d 1191 (2002) (court abused discretion in admitting evidence that defendant took money during search because that did not render it more or less likely that during subsequent and unrelated search of different person, defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>specific intent to appropriate another\u2019s money). We conclude that the May 17, 2006 incident, was relevant to show that the defendant did not intend merely to annoy or to irritate the victim on March 19, 2007, but that he intended to cause her fear and apprehension by threatening to kill her child. We therefore conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the victim\u2019s testimony regarding the May 17, 2006 incident was relevant to the issue of the defendant\u2019s intent to terrorize her on March 19, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">The defendant further argues that the court abused its discretion in concluding that the probative value of the victim\u2019s testimony outweighed its prejudicial effect because the court failed to directly balance the two. We disagree. We note that \u201c[a]ll adverse evidence is damaging to one\u2019s case, but it is inadmissible only if it creates undue prejudice so that it threatens an injustice were it to be admitted. . . . The test for determining whether evidence is unduly prejudicial is not whether it is damaging to the defendant but whether it will improperly arouse the emotions of the jury. . . . The court bears the primary responsibility for conducting the balancing test to detennine whether the probative value outweighs the prejudicial impact, and its conclusion will be disturbed only for a manifest abuse of discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>William C., </em>103 Conn. App. 508, 519-20, 930 A.2d 753, cert. denied, 284 Conn. 928, 934 A.2d 244 (2007). \u201cProper limiting instructions often mitigate the prejudicial impact of evidence of prior misconduct. . . . Furthermore, a jury is presumed to have followed a court\u2019s limiting instructions, which serves to lessen any prejudice resulting from the admission of such evidence.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">We disagree with the defendant\u2019s argument that the court did not directly weigh the probative value against the prejudicial effect. As we described previously, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>court thoroughly analyzed the probative value of the defendant\u2019s prior uncharged misconduct, namely, its relevance to the issue of his intent to terrorize the victim. Having analyzed the probative value of the evidence, the court then examined its prejudicial effect. It concluded that the defendant\u2019s act of threatening the victim and her friend and punching the friend on May 17, 2006, was a less serious matter than the act of holding the child and the knife and threatening to kill himself and the child. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Irizarry, </em>supra, 95 Conn. App. 238 (court did not abuse discretion in concluding probative value outweighs prejudicial effect when misconduct evidence no more shocking than evidence of crimes with which defendant charged); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Epps, </em>105 Conn. App. 84, 93-94, 936 A.2d 701 (2007) (court did not abuse discretion in admitting prior uncharged misconduct when uncharged misconduct not as brutal as conduct for which defendant charged), cert. denied, 286 Conn. 903, 943 A.2d 1102 (2008). The court further lessened the prejudicial effect of the victim\u2019s testimony by instructing the state to question her \u201cvery narrowly\u201d on that one incident and providing limiting instructions to the jury both immediately after the victim\u2019s testimony about the prior uncharged misconduct and during its final instructions to the jury. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Irizarry, </em>supra, 238 (court minimized potential prejudice by repeatedly giving limiting instructions on use of evidence); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>98 Conn. App. 673, 681-82, 911 A.2d 331 (2006) (same), cert. denied, 281 Conn. 908, 916 A.2d 52 (2007); <em>State </em>v. <em>McFarlane, </em>supra, 88 Conn. App. 166 (same). Upon reviewing the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the court properly balanced the probative value and the prejudicial effect of the victim\u2019s testimony and did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the former outweighed the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b731-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of assault in the third degree when: (1) [wjith intent to cause physical injury to another person, he causes such injury to such person or to a third person . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b731-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53-21 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who (1) wilfully or unlawfully causes or permits any child under the age of sixteen years to be placed in such a situation that the life or limb of such child is endangered, the health of such child is likely to be injured or the morals of such child are likely to be impaired, or does any act likely to impair the health or morals of any such child . . . shall be guilty of a class C felony . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b731-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-223 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of criminal violation of a protective order when an order . . . has been issued against such person, and such person violates such order.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b731-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-62 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cAperson is guilty of threatening in the second degree when ...
