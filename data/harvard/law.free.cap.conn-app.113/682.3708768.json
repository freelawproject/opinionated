The defendant claims that (1) his conviction must be reversed because the record contains no waiver of his right to a jury trial and (2) the evidence was insufficient to establish sexual assault in the third degree. We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The court reasonably could have found the following facts. L lived in Trumbull with her husband, two children and mother-in-law. On the morning of November 19,2004, L was in need of a ride to St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital in Bridgeport to pick up certain paperwork. At approximately 11:15 that morning, the defendant, a cousin of her husband, called. L explained her predicament, and the defendant agreed to give her a ride to the hospital during his lunch break.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">On the way to the hospital, the defendant asked L to perform fellatio on him when they returned to her home; L declined. He persisted with that request on the drive back to Trumbull to no avail. When they arrived at L\u2019s house, the defendant followed L into her bedroom and threw her onto the bed. When she got up, the defendant again threw L onto the bed, causing a part of the bed to break. L informed the defendant that he was scaring her. L managed to slip past the defendant, exiting the bedroom, but the defendant caught her in a hallway and forced her onto a bench. The defendant then \u201cput his legs over [L\u2019s] legs so that [she] could not move . . . .\u201d L testified that the defendant \u201cpulled his pants down . . . shoved his . . . penis in my face . . . started jerking off, told me to stick my tongue out, and I could . . . barely stick my tongue out and [he] continued to jerk off in my face and then ejaculated on my tongue, like sort of in my mouth, and then backed up, pulled his pants up and said: \u2018That\u2019s not how a pom star does it.\u2019 \u201d L testified that the encounter lasted \u201ca minute, maybe, two minutes.\u201d L subsequently reported the incident to the Trumbull police, and the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>was arrested and charged with sexual assault in the third degree and unlawful restraint in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">A court trial followed, at the conclusion of which the court found the defendant guilty on both counts. The court found that \u201cin the hallway, the defendant did in fact pin [L], by virtue of his size in comparison to her size, on the bench, and he did in fact masturbate, and he did in fact sexually assault her in the third degree. . . . [A]ll elements of that statute have been met, and ... all elements of the unlawful restraint charge have also been met beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The defendant thereafter filed a motion for a judgment of acquittal on the sexual assault count. In that motion, the defendant stated: \u201cThe state did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of sexual assault in the third degree because there is no evidence that there was \u2018sexual [contact,\u2019 meaning] that the defendant touched her with his penis. In addition, although there was evidence that the defendant ejaculated on her, ejaculate is not an \u2018intimate part.\u2019 To have \u2018sexual contact\u2019 under the statute there must be contact with an intimate part. Pursuant to [General Statutes] \u00a7 53a-72a and the definitions supplied [by General Statutes] \u00a7 53a-65 (3) and 53a-65 (8), the alleged facts, even if accepted in [total, do] not fit the charge.\u201d At the February 15, 2006 hearing on the motion, the state repeated its theory of proximity with the genital area and contact with ejaculate, arguing that ejaculate was included within the definition of sexual contact. The state further argued that the state had proven contact via L\u2019s testimony that the defendant had \u201cshoved his penis in [her] face\u201d and that he had pinned her down using his thighs. At the conclusion of the healing, the court reserved judgment on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">On March 14, 2006, the court ruled on the motion for a judgment of acquittal from the bench. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>articulated the factual basis of its decision, finding that the defendant used his superior weight to wrap his legs around L and pin her to the bench. The court stated that \u201cit is a reasonable and logical conclusion . . . that not only did the defendant place his inner thighs against [L], but also, he forced contact with his genital area with [L\u2019s] body.\u201d The court continued: \u201c[The defendant] then proceeded to masturbate and sprayed ejaculate onto her face. I think it\u2019s also a reasonable and logical inference for this court to find that at some point, there was contact between the defendant\u2019s penis and [L], but that\u2019s not . . . needed because he definitely had contact with his inner thighs and with his genital area just by the fact that he was straddling her and pinning her.\u201d The court stated that \u201cstraddling [L\u2019s] body with his legs, making contact with his inner thighs . . . the logical inference is that his genital area also came into contact with the victim. I don\u2019t see how it could not have.\u201d As such, the court found that the defendant\u2019s \u201ccontact with his inner thighs and genital area, statutorily designated intimate parts,\u201d constituted sexual contact. The court thus denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The defendant first claims that his conviction must be reversed because the record contains no waiver of his right to a jury trial. \u201cThe right to a jury trial in a criminal case is among those constitutional rights which are related to the procedure for the determination of guilt or innocence. The standard for an effective waiver of such a right is that it must be knowing and intelligent, as well as voluntary. . . . [T]he definition of a valid waiver of a constitutional right [is] the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right. . . . This strict standard precludes a court from presuming a waiver of the right to a trial by jury from a silent record. ... In determining whether this strict standard has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>been met, a court must inquire into the totality of the circumstances of each case. . . . When such a claim is first raised on appeal, our focus is on compliance with these constitutional requirements rather than on observance of analogous procedural rules prescribed by statute or by the Practice Book.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Ouellette, 271 Conn. 740, 751-52, 859 A.2d 907 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The defendant did not preserve his claim at trial and now seeks review under <em>State </em>v. Golding, 213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>In <em>State </em>v. <em>Gore, </em>288 Conn. 770, 955 A.2d 1 (2008), our Supreme Court held that \u201cbecause the right to a jury trial is uniquely personal to the defendant, an affirmative indication of the defendant\u2019s personal waiver of this right must appear on the record, and the defendant\u2019s silence or failure to object to defense counsel\u2019s purported waiver is constitutionally insufficient to demonstrate a valid waiver.\u201d Id., 783. As the record in that case did not reflect any indication from the defendant personally that he had waived his fundamental right to a jury trial, the court concluded that \u201cthe waiver expressed by defense counsel was insufficient to constitute a valid waiver, and that the defendant has satisfied the third prong of Golding.\u201d Id., 789-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>The state acknowledges that <em>Gore </em>controls the present case, conceding that there is no affirmative indication from the defendant on the record that he waived his right to a jury trial. We agree. On that basis, the defendant is entitled to a new trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">The defendant next claims that the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to establish sexual assault in the third degree.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He contends that there was insufficient evidence from which the court could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that sexual contact had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">We begin by noting that \u201cfor the purposes of sufficiency review after concluding that a new trial is required, we review the sufficiency of the evidence as the case was tried; in other words, we review the evidence in its improperly restricted state, impropriety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>notwithstanding. ... [A] claim of insufficiency of the evidence must be tested by reviewing no less than, and no more than, the evidence introduced at trial.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>73 Conn. App. 173, 179-80, 807 A.2d 500, cert. denied, 262 Conn. 923, 812 A.2d 865 (2002). \u201c[T]he [d]ue [p]rocess [cjlause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.\u201d <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970). The standard of review for a sufficiency of the evidence claim employs a two part test. \u201cFirst, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the [finder of fact] reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . This court cannot substitute its own judgment for that of the [finder of fact] if there is sufficient evidence to support [its] verdict.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Niemeyer, </em>258 Conn. 510, 517, 782 A.2d 658 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">It is axiomatic that \u201cthe [finder of fact] must find every element proven beyond a reasonable doubt in order to find the defendant guilty of the charged offense, [but] each of the basic and inferred facts underlying those conclusions need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . If it is reasonable and logical for the [finder of fact] to conclude that a basic fact or an inferred fact is true, the [finder of fact] is permitted to consider the fact proven and may consider it in combination with other proven facts in determining whether the cumulative effect of all the evidence proves the defendant guilty of all the elements of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . Moreover, it does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>diminish the probative force of the evidence that it consists, in whole or in part, of evidence that is circumstantial rather than direct. ... It is not one fact, but the cumulative impact of a multitude of facts which establishes guilt in a case involving substantial circumstantial evidence. ... In evaluating evidence, the [finder] of fact is not required to accept as dispositive those inferences that are consistent with the defendant\u2019s innocence. . . . The [finder of fact] may draw whatever inferences from the evidence or facts established by the evidence it deems to be reasonable and logical. . . . Finally, [a]s we have often noted, proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all possible doubt . . . nor does proof beyond a reasonable doubt require acceptance of every hypothesis of innocence posed by the defendant that, had it been found credible by the [finder of fact], would have resulted in an acquittal. ... On appeal, we do not ask whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence. We ask, instead, whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the [finder of fact\u2019s] verdict of guilty.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Calabrese, </em>279 Conn. 393, 402-403, 902 A.2d 1044 (2006). With that standard in mind, we turn to the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-72a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the third degree when such person (1) compels another person to submit to sexual contact (A) by the use of force against such other person or a third person . . . .\u201d The term \u201csexual contact,\u201d in turn, is defined as \u201cany contact with the intimate parts of a person not married to the actor for the purpose of sexual gratification of the actor or for the purpose of degrading or humiliating such person or any contact of the intimate parts of the actor with a person not married to the actor for the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>of sexual gratification of the actor or for the purpose of degrading or humiliating such person.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-65 (3). \u201cIntimate parts\u201d is defined as \u201cthe genital area, groin, anus, inner thighs, buttocks or breasts.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 2003) \u00a7 53a-65 (8).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">We consider first the court\u2019s conclusion that \u201cit\u2019s ... a reasonable and logical inference for this court to find that at some point, there was contact between the defendant\u2019s penis and [L] . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To establish the defendant\u2019s guilt under \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (1) (A), the state was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, inter alia, that the defendant subjected L to contact with an intimate part. Although the state presented evidence that the defendant masturbated directly in front of L, there simply is no evidence whatsoever in the record that contact occurred between the defendant\u2019s penis and L. The state never asked L if she came in contact with the defendant\u2019s penis, nor did she so testify.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In light of that dearth of evidence, we conclude that the element of contact via the defendant\u2019s penis was not established beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">We likewise conclude that the element of contact with an intimate part was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt by evidence indicating that the defendant ejaculated on L. Under \u00a7 53a-65 (8), as the 2003 revision of that statute reads, the definition of \u201cintimate parts\u201d does not include ejaculate or other bodily substance.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In his motion for a judgment of acquittal, the defendant raised that precise argument. The state concedes in its appellate brief that \u201cthe court . . . did not reach the legal issue of whether ejaculate in the face fell within the statutory definition of sexual contact.\u201d On appeal, the state does not contend that the statutory definition encompasses ejaculate. We are mindful that we \u201cmust refrain from imposing criminal liability where the legislature has not expressly so intended. . . . [C]riminal statutes are not to be read more broadly than their language plainly requires and ambiguities are ordinarily to be resolved in favor of the defendant. . . . [Ujnless a contrary interpretation would frustrate an evident legislative intent, criminal statutes are governed by the fundamental principle that such statutes are strictly construed against the state.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Davis, 255 Conn. 782, 788-89, 772 A.2d 559 (2001). Absent any argument to the contrary, we must conclude that the element of contact with an intimate part was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt in the present case by evidence that the defendant ejaculated on L.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">We next consider the court\u2019s determination that L\u2019s contact with the defendant\u2019s inner thighs constituted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>sexual contact. Apart from his claim of evidential insufficiency, the defendant contends that his due process rights under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the constitution of the United States have been compromised because he did not have notice of the charge and an opportunity to defend against it. The defendant concedes that his claim is unpreserved and requests <em>Golding </em>review. We review the defendant\u2019s claim because the record is adequate for review and the claim is of constitutional magnitude. See <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Arkansas, </em>333 U.S. 196, 201, 68 S. Ct. 514, 92 L. Ed. 644 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">\u201cIt is axiomatic that a conviction upon a charge not made or upon a charge not tried constitutes a denial of due process. . . . These standards no more than reflect a broader premise that has never been doubted in our constitutional system: that a person cannot incur the loss of liberty for an offense without notice and a meaningful opportunity to defend.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 314, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Sirimanochanh, </em>224 Conn. 656, 664, 620 A.2d 761 (1993). As the United States Supreme Court noted, \u201c[i]t is as much a violation of due process to send an accused to prison following conviction of a charge on which he was never tried as it would be to convict him upon a charge that was never made.\u201d <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Arkansas, </em>supra, 333 U.S. 201. Similarly, regarding theories of prosecution, \u201cit is well established that [o]ur rules of procedure do not allow a [party] to pursue one course of action at trial and later, on appeal, argue that a path he rejected should now be open to him. ... To rule otherwise would permit trial by ambuscade.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Scruggs, </em>279 Conn. 698, 718-19, 905 A.2d 24 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Upon the defendant\u2019s arrest, the state alleged in its short form information that he had violated \u00a7 53a-72a. The defendant then sought a bill of particulars identifying the \u201cspecific acts allegedly attributed to [him]\u2019\u2019and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>the \u201cspecific statutory subsection(s) and/or subsections^) alleged.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In response, the state filed a long form information that alleged in relevant part that \u201con or about the 19th day of November, 2004 [the defendant] did compel [L] to sexual contact with his intimate parts, to wit: <em>his genital area, </em>by the use of force against her, in violation of [General Statutes] \u00a7 53a-72 (a) (1) (A).\u201d (Emphasis added.) Although the definition of \u201cintimate parts\u201d provided by General Statutes (Rev. to 2003) \u00a7 53a-65 (8) includes \u201cthe genital area, groin, anus, inner thighs, buttocks or breasts,\u201d the state plainly did not allege sexual contact via the defendant\u2019s inner thighs, nor did it pursue such a theory at trial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Rather, it was only after the court rendered judgment and the defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal that the state raised the possibility that sexual contact was established by contact with the defendant\u2019s inner thighs. \u201cThe purpose of a bill of particulars is to inform the defendant of the charges against him with sufficient precision to enable him to prepare his defense and avoid prejudicial surprise.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>264 Conn. 1, 155, 836 A.2d 224 (2003), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 908, 124 S. Ct. 1614, 158 L. Ed. 2d 254 (2004). In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the defendant was not so informed.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">At the same time, \u201c[i]t is the defendant\u2019s burden on appeal to demonstrate that he was in fact prejudiced in his defense on the merits as a result of a material variance between the allegations in a bill of particulars and proof at trial, and that substantial injustice was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>done to him because of the language of the state\u2019s pleadings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.; <em>State </em>v. <em>Roque, </em>190 Conn. 143, 156, 460 A.2d 26 (1983). The defendant has not met that burden. His defense was predicated on an alibi witness, who testified that he was with the defendant at the time of the alleged assault. If the court, as fact finder, had credited his defense, he would have been acquitted of sexual assault in the third degree. That defense encompassed the claim of sexual assault via contact with his genital area as well as sexual assault via contact with his inner thighs. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Franko, </em>199 Conn. 481, 491, 508 A.2d 22 (1986). Our appellate courts have rejected similar due process challenges in the face of an alibi defense. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Milardo, </em>224 Conn. 397, 415, 618 A.2d 1347 (1993); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Sirimanochanh, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 664-65. Furthermore, during the prosecution of its case, the state presented evidence that the defendant pinned L to the bench by forcefully straddling her. There is nothing in the record to suggest that the defendant would have altered his alibi defense had he believed that the state was proceeding on a theory of contact with his inner thighs as opposed to his genital area. As a result, the defendant cannot demonstrate the requisite prejudice resulting from the state\u2019s failure to provide proper notice regarding sexual contact by his inner thighs.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Although the court\u2019s consideration of the issue of contact with the defendant\u2019s thighs was proper, we must also evaluate its conclusion thereon. The defendant maintains that there was insufficient evidence from which the fact finder could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that L made contact with his inner thighs. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">L testified at trial as to the manner in which the defendant physically assaulted her. After forcing her to a bench in the hallway of her home, L testified that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>defendant \u201cput his legs over my legs so ... I could not move even if I wanted to.\u201d L later described that positioning in greater detail and visually demonstrated how the defendant was positioned. She testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-5\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Now, you described his legs around your body.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-6\">\u201c[The Witness]: Yep. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-7\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Where were you seated?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-8\">\u201c[The Witness]: I was seated like this. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-9\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: . . .

In addition, L demonstrated to the court the precise positioning by which the defendant accomplished that restraint. The count expressly credited L\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-13\">As an appellate body constrained by a cold record, we have no way of reviewing L\u2019s visual demonstration in any meaningful way. As such, we must defer to the trial count\u2019s superior vantage of assessment. \u201cOur authority, when reviewing the findings of a judge, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>circumscribed by the deference we must give to decisions of the trier of fact, who is usually in a superior position to appraise and weigh the evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>LaVelle </em>v. <em>Ecoair Corp., </em>74 Conn. App. 710, 716, 814 A.2d 421 (2003); see also <em>Feen </em>v. <em>New England Benefit Cos., </em>81 Conn. App. 772, 780, 841 A.2d 1193 (noting trial court\u2019s \u201csuperior position to evaluate those factors as they coalesce at trial and the disparate ability of a reviewing court to glean such things from the written record\u201d), cert. denied, 269 Conn. 910, 852 A.2d 739 (2004); <em>State </em>v. <em>Salerno, </em>36 Conn.

Indeed, this court lacks any vantage point to review that evidence. Having observed L\u2019s physical representation as to the manner in which the defendant forcefully pinned her to the bench, the court, as the finder of fact, was in a better position to evaluate that evidence and draw reasonable inferences therefrom. That evidence undoubtedly informed the court\u2019s consideration of whether contact transpired between the defendant\u2019s thighs and L.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">In denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal, the court found that the defendant \u201cdid forcibly restrain [L] . . . straddling her body with his legs, making contact with his inner thighs . . . .\u201d Although the defendant, on appeal, argues that the height difference between L and the defendant suggests that he had \u201chis knees, and therefore his thighs, above [L\u2019s] knees and above her legs,\u201d we are mindful that \u201cwe do not ask whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence. We ask, instead, whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the [finder of fact\u2019s] verdict of guilty.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Calabrese, </em>supra, 279 Conn. 403. In reviewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>claims of evidential insufficiency, our role is limited. The question is not whether this court might have reached the same conclusion but whether the trial court could not reasonably have concluded as it did. Construing the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the trial court\u2019s finding, the cumulative effect of the aforementioned evidence supports the court\u2019s finding that sexual contact occurred beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, the court\u2019s denial of the motion for a judgment of acquittal was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b711-6\"> Under <em>Golding, </em>\u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate haxmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant\u2019s claim will fail.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 239-40. <em>Golding\u2019s </em>first two prongs relate to whether a defendant\u2019s claim is reviewable, and the last two relate to the substance of the actual review. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarrett, </em>82 Conn.

In his reply brief, the defendant abandons those claims in light of the state\u2019s concession that the record contains no waiver of his right to a jury trial, as they are unlikely to arise on retrial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b712-9\"> Although we conclude that the defendant\u2019s conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered, we address the defendant\u2019s evidential insufficiency claim because a finding that the evidence was insufficient to convict him would result in a judgment of acquittal as to that count. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Padua, </em>273 Conn. 138, 178-79, 869 A.2d 192 (2005) (\u201c[ijnterests of judicial efficiency, sound appellate policy and fundamental fairness require a reviewing court to address a defendant\u2019s insufficiency of the evidence claim prior to remanding a matter for retrial because of trial error\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Theriault, </em>38 Conn.

That claim was properly preserved by his motion for a judgment of acquittal. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Padua, </em>supra, 146 n.12. The defendant alleges only that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction of sexual assault in the third degree. He does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence with respect to his conviction of unlawful restraint in the second degree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b715-7\"> At trial, there was no allegation or evidence that the defendant made contact with an intimate part of L.
