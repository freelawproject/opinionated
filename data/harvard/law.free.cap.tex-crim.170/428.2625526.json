With such contention we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">The allegation that appellant was in performance of the act of driving an automobile \u201cacross a double stripe and highway marker\u201d was not an allegation that he was in the performance of an unlawful act. The driving of an automobile across a double stripe and highway marker may or may not be an unlawful act. The legality of the act would be made to depend upon the facts and circumstances existing at the time. There is no statute in this state making such an act, per se, a penal offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">The allegation was insufficient to charge that appellant was in performance of an unlawful act. Appellant\u2019s exception to the second count of the indictment should have been, by the court, sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">For the reason stated, the judgment is reversed and the prosecution ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-11\">Opinion approved by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-12\">McDonald, J., not participating.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
