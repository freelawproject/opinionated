On direct examination he testified that he had told the officers that any time they wanted to search his place \u201cJust go ahead.\u201d On cross-examination he confirmed his previous invitation to the officers to look over his place and even renewed his consent for them to do so while he was testifiying. A witness called by appellant supported his testimony that he possessed the whiskey for his own use.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-13\">The court in its charge applied the prima facie evidence rule in accordance with Art. 666 \u2014 23a (2), V.A.P.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-14\">The evidence is sufficient to support the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-15\">Appellant attacks the sufficiency of the search warrant and on that ground contends that the court erred in admitting testimony showing the search and also erred in permitting the introduction of the whisky found as a result of the search. While testifying, the appellant admitted his possession of the whiskey as shown by the state, therefore, he is in no position to complain of the search and the admission of the whisky in evidence.

Jur. 2d Sec. 446, pp. 707-708; 3 Branch 2d Sec. 1330, p. 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">It is contended that the charge to the jury in connection with the definition of prima facie evidence shifts the burden of proof to the appellant to prove his innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">An examination of the charge shows that the jury was instructed that if they found beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant possessed more than one quart of whisky then such finding raised a presumption that such possession was for the purpose of sale, which presumption may be overcome by evidence showing that such possession was not for the purpose of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">The court charged the jury on the presumption of innocence, the burden of proof, and the application of the law of reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">Appellant\u2019s contention is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">The other contentions presented have been considered and they do not show error.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">Opinion approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
