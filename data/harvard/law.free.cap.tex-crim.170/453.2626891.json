He was unable, because it was a rainy night, to testify whether a man or woman was driving, but did say that after the collision he saw only two people in the automobile, a man and a woman. He testified that he spoke to appellant at the scene, asked him what he was going to do about his car, and that appellant said he was not going to do anything. He stated that appellant remained seated in the automobile which had collided with him until the police arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">Mr. Giraud, the driver of a third automobile at the scene, testified as to the collision, that he saw only a man and a woman in the automobile, that after the collision the woman got out of the passenger\u2019s side, but the man remained seated in the driver\u2019s seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">Mrs. Giraud related her version of the collision and stated that a man was driving the automobile in question, a woman was seated on the passenger\u2019s side; that after the collision the woman got out but the man remained seated in the driver\u2019s seat, and there were no other people in the automobile unless they were lying down on the back seat out of her view.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">Accident investigator Rogers testified that when he arrived at the scene he found appellant and a woman who claimed to be his wife, with a cut on her lip. and that he saw blood on the dashboard of the automobile on the right side. On the issue of intoxication, he testified that appellant\u2019s breath smelled strongly of intoxicants, that his speech was incoherent, he was unsteady on his feet, but complained of no injury, that he found an empty vodka bottle in the car, and expressed the opinion that appellant was intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Rogers\u2019 fellow officers Woodruff testified that he smelled \u201csome sort of alcoholic beverage\u201d on appellant\u2019s breath, that appellant was unsteady on his feet and \u201cyou couldn\u2019t hardly understand what he was saying,\u201d and expressed the opinion that he was intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">Appellant did not testify or offer any evidence in his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">We have carefully examined the above facts and have concluded that they are sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding that appellant was the driver of the automobile in question and overrule appellant\u2019s contention in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">We now address ourselves to his contention that the state failed to establish the prior conviction as alleged. The indictment alleged the prior convictions as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">\u201c * * * and prior to the commission of the aforesaid offense by the said EUGENE ROBERT BOULTE, to-wit, on the 18th day of December, A.D. 1957, in the County Court at Law No. 3 of Harris County, Texas, the said EUGENE ROBERT BOULTE, in cause No. 125598, was duly and legally convicted, in said last named court of the offense of driving and operating a motor vehicle upon a public highway, while intoxicated, a misdemeanor, upon a complaint and information then legally pending in said last named court and of which the said court had jurisdiction, and said conviction was a final conviction. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">During the course of the trial, appellant, his attorney, and the attorney representing the state entered into the following stipulation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-9\">\u201cThat the defendant, Eugene Robert Boulte, is the same Eugene Robert Boulte, who on the eighteenth day of December, 1957, in the County Court at Law No. 3 of Harris County, Texas, in cause No. 125398, was duly and legally convicted in said last named court of the offense of driving and operating a motor vehicle upon a public highway while intoxicated, a misdemeanor, upon a complaint and information then legally pending in said last named Court, of which said Court had jurisdiction, and that said conviction was a final conviction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">It is appellant\u2019s contention that the variance as to the one number is fatal. Had the judgment and sentence in the prior conviction been introduced in evidence, another question would be presented, but here we are dealing with an oral stipulation; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>and, because of the exactness of the other details, it is apparent that the parties were stipulating as to the same prior conviction which had been alleged and that through error one digit was substituted for another in the dictation of transcription.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-3\">Finding the evidence sufficient to sustain the conviction and no reversible error appearing, the judgment is affirmed. \u25a0</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
