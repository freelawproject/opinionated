All the evidence, both for the state and the appellant, shows that the appellant did not, as alleged, drive his automobile into and against Gary Wilks thereby inflicting serious bodily injury restulting in his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">The failure of the proof introduced to support the material allegations in the information calls for a reversal.

Rep. 593, 331 S.W. 2d 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">Opinion approved by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">McDonald, J. not participating.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
