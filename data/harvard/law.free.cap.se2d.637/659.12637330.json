In each action, plaintiffs, appellees here, sought a judicial determination that it is unconstitutional to apply the newly enacted asbestos claims statute, OCGA \u00a7 51-14-1 et seq. (the Act), to their pending asbestos cases. After consolidated hearings were held, the trial courts issued virtually identical orders ruling that because the Act required asbestos plaintiffs\n   to provide proof that exposure to asbestos was a substantial contributing factor in their medical condition, it unconstitutionally affected appellees' substantive rights by establishing \"a new element to [their] claim, one that did not exist when the original cause of action accrued.\" Appellants, defendants in the underlying actions, requested, and the trial courts issued, certificates of immediate review of the courts' rulings. We granted the subsequent applications for interlocutory appeal, see OCGA \u00a7 5-6-34(b), and consolidated the appeals to determine whether the courts erred in holding the Act unconstitutional as applied to appellees' claims. Finding no error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   1. As found by the trial courts, the Act provides for the dismissal of any asbestos claim pending on April 12, 2005, unless within 180 days from that date the plaintiff in a pending asbestos claim establishes \"primafacie evidence of physical impairment\" with respect to the asbestos claim. OCGA \u00a7 51-14-5(a). To establish prima facie evidence of physical impairment, a plaintiff must provide proof in certain specified forms and from certain specified sources that exposure to asbestos was a\n   <em>\n    substantial\n   </em>\n   contributing factor to the exposed person's medical condition. See OCGA \u00a7 51-14-2(15); OCGA \u00a7 51-14-3(b). Under the express language of the Act, prima facie evidence of physical impairment is \"an essential element of an asbestos claim.\" OCGA \u00a7 51-14-3(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Appellants contend the trial courts erred by ruling that the Act affects substantive rights and therefore cannot be applied retrospectively\n   <strong>\n   </strong>\n   to claims which accrued prior to its April 12, 2005 effective date. \"Although legislation which involves mere procedural or evidentiary changes may operate retrospectively, legislation which affects substantive rights may operate prospectively only. [Cit.]\"\n   <em>\n    Enger v. Erwin,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1174550\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/245/753/#p754\">\n    245 Ga. 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 754,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=267%20S.E.2d%2025\">\n    267 S.E.2d 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980). See Ga. Const, Art. I, \u00a7 I, Par. X (constitutional ban on retroactive laws). \"Substantive law is that law which creates rights, duties, and obligations. Procedural law is that law which prescribes the methods of enforcement of rights, duties, and obligations. [Cits.]\"\n   <em>\n    Polito v. Holland,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1217695\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/258/54/#p55\">\n    258 Ga. 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 55(3),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1217695\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/258/54/#p55\">\n    365 S.E.2d 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988). The question before us, therefore, is whether enactment of the Act affected appellees' rights, duties or obligations with respect to their asbestos claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Prior to passage of the Act, in order to establish a claim for asbestos related injuries, a plaintiff was required to show only that exposure to asbestos was a\n   <em>\n    contributing\n   </em>\n   factor in his or her medical condition.\n   <em>\n    John Crane, Inc. v. Jones,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3757356\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/278/747/\">\n    278 Ga. 747\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3757356\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/278/747/\">\n    604 S.E.2d 822\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). Thus, by introducing the requirement that asbestos plaintiffs present prima facie evidence that asbestos was a\n   <em>\n    substantial\n   </em>\n   contributing factor to their medical condition, the Act imposes upon appellees a greater evidentiary burden than was required under the law in effect at the time their actions were filed. Contrary to appellants' argument, it makes no relevant difference that the Act does not alter appellees' burden of proof at trial because regardless of when it must be shown, the Act makes proof that asbestos exposure was a substantial contributing factor an essential element of an asbestos claim. OCGA \u00a7 51-14-3(a). See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3757356\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/278/747/\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at (b) (no person shall bring or maintain asbestos claim in absence of evidence asbestos was \"substantial contributing factor\" to physical injury).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the provisions of the Act requiring appellees to produce evidence establishing that exposure to asbestos was a substantial contributing factor to their medical conditions affect appellees' substantive rights and cannot retroactively be applied to their claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   2. Appellants contend that even if the \"substantial contributing factor\" language is unconstitutional as applied to appellees, the trial courts should have severed the offending language from the Act. \"Where one portion of a statute is unconstitutional, this court has the power to sever that portion of the statute and preserve the remainder if the remaining portion of the Act accomplishes\n   the purpose the legislature intended. [Cits.]\"\n   <em>\n    Nixon v. State,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1210198\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/256/261/#p264\">\n    256 Ga. 261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 264(3),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1210198\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/256/261/#p264\">\n    347 S.E.2d 592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986). If, however, \"`the objectionable part is so connected\n   <strong>\n   </strong>\n   with the general scope of the statute that, should it be stricken out, effect cannot be given to the legislative intent, the rest of the statute must fall with it.' [Cits.]\"\n   <em>\n    City Council of Augusta v. Mangelly,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1169047\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/243/358/#p363\">\n    243 Ga. 358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 363(2),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=254%20S.E.2d%20315\">\n    254 S.E.2d 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Here, the Act as a whole establishes with considerable specificity the procedure by which plaintiffs must prove their asbestos claim and delineates the evidentiary burden placed upon plaintiffs in such cases. The legislature decided to include the requirement that asbestos plaintiffs produce evidence that exposure to asbestos was a substantial contributing factor in the exposed persons' medical conditions and to place further restrictions on the form of such evidence. This decision demonstrates a clear intent to limit actionable asbestos claims to those situations in which a greater level of causation can be shown. These requirements and limitations are the heart of the Act, and their severance from the Act would \"result in a statute that fails to correspond to the main legislative purpose, or give effect to that purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    State of Georgia v. Jackson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1699005\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/269/308/#p312\">\n    269 Ga. 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 312,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1699005\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/269/308/#p312\">\n    496 S.E.2d 912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998). Accordingly, we cannot effectively sever the unconstitutional provisions from the Act and it must fall in its entirety. See\n   <em>\n    Georgia Franchise Practices Comm. v. Massey-Ferguson, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1171646\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/244/800/\">\n    244 Ga. 800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=262%20S.E.2d%20106\">\n    262 S.E.2d 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979);\n   <em>\n    Mangelly,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1169047\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/243/358/#p363\">\n    243 Ga. at 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=254%20S.E.2d%20315\">\n    254 S.E.2d 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The presence of a severability clause within the Act does not require a different result. As previously recognized by this Court:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [t]he presence of a severability clause reverses the usual presumption that the legislature intends the Act to be an entirety, and creates an opposite presumption of separability. However, the severability clause does not change the rule that in order for one part of a statute to be upheld as severable when another is stricken as unconstitutional, they must not be mutually dependent on one another.\n   <em>\n    Carter v.
