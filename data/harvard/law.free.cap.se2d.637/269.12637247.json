Swieter, Sr., Steven J. Swieter, Rebecca Pierucci-Swieter, Thomas Andrew Stahl, Virginia R. Stahl, Mark S. Swieter, Kimberly Swieter, Robert K. Swieter, Jr., Elaine G. Swieter (collectively \"the Swieter defendants\"), and Blue Ridge Mountain Spring Water Company, Inc. (\"the Water Company\"). The trial court concluded that defendants were entitled to: (1) an easement across plaintiffs' property for ingress and egress; and (2) an underground easement to maintain a water pipeline for transporting spring water from their property to a state road for sale. At oral argument before this Court, plaintiffs conceded that the Swieter defendants have an easement for ingress and egress. As a result, the primary issue remaining on appeal is whether the trial court properly concluded, as a matter of law, that defendants have acquired an easement for their waterline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Because the evidence establishes that Henry Woodring did not, as of the filing of the lawsuit, own any of the property over which the claimed easements run, we dismiss plaintiff Henry Woodring's appeal for lack of standing. With respect to the pipeline easement, we hold that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to defendants. The evidence in the record establishes no basis upon which defendants are entitled to an easement for their pipeline. Defendants were, however, entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff Gary Woodring's claims for trespass, nuisance, unjust enrichment, and unfair trade practices. Accordingly, we dismiss in part, affirm in part, and reverse and remand in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This case involves six pieces of real estate and one right of way. Three of the real estate parcels are presently owned by plaintiffs: a 23.5 acre tract owned jointly by plaintiffs Gary and Henry Woodring; a 28.62 acre tract owned solely by plaintiff Gary Woodring; and a 2 acre tract also owned solely by plaintiff Gary Woodring. These three tracts adjoin to create a rough vertical rectangle (the \"Woodring Tract\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Swieter defendants own three large adjoining parcels that form a rough \"horseshoe\" around the west, north, and east sides of the Woodring Tract (the \"Swieter Tract\"). The Swieter Tract is comprised of: a 50 acre parcel, adjoining the west side of the Woodring Tract and extending northward; a 43.941 acre parcel, adjoining the north side of the Woodring Tract; and a 51.645 acre parcel extending about one third of the way down the eastern side of the Woodring Tract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   State Road 1335 is located south of both the Woodring and Swieter Tracts. Access to the Swieter Tract is provided by \"Creek Road,\" which runs north/south between the lower western corner of the easternmost Swieter parcel and State Road 1335. As Creek Road heads south from the Swieter Tract, it curves slightly west into the Woodring Tract, traveling through it until reaching State Road 1335.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Although plaintiffs once resided on the Woodring Tract, they left North Carolina and moved to Texas in 1971. In 1978, certain members of the Swieter family acquired the 43.941 acre and 51.645 acre parcels of the Swieter Tract from their predecessors in interest, the Gilleys. The deed for this transaction included a conveyance of all \"right, title and interest\" the Gilleys had in any rights of way leading to the Swieter Tract. The parties agree that this conveyance refers to Creek Road, and, at oral argument, plaintiffs conceded that this did in fact convey a valid roadway easement, appurtenant to the Swieter Tract, over Creek Road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Shortly after acquiring the property in 1978, the Swieter family improved Creek Road, which was at that time substantially washed out, overgrown, and unreachable by car. The Swieters have since used Creek Road continuously as their only means of access to and from State Road 1335.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 1991, certain members of the Swieter family formed the Water Company to sell natural spring water found on the Swieter Tract. In 1992, the members of the Swieter family with ownership interests in the Water Company executed two easements to the Water Company: one granting access to the Swieter Tract via Creek Road and the other \"for the purpose of installing, inspecting, maintaining and repairing a potable water line\" along Creek Road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   An underground waterline was subsequently installed along Creek Road to transmit water from the Swieter Tract to a filling station installed by the Swieters pursuant to a lease on a third party's property near the State Road. During this project, the Swieters also improved Creek Road by widening the road and adding more gravel and culverts to facilitate proper maintenance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Water Company leased a 10 acre portion of the northern 43.941 acre parcel of the Swieter Tract in 1994. Since 1992, the Water Company has continuously inspected, maintained, and repaired Creek Road and piped water through the underground waterline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In 1998, plaintiff Henry Woodring returned to North Carolina for the first time since 1971 and discovered defendants' improvements and alterations on Creek Road. On 6 May 2004, plaintiffs filed suit against defendants in Watauga County Superior Court, alleging trespass, unjust enrichment, and unfair trade practices. Following discovery, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and, on 16 May 2005, Judge Zoro J. Guice, Jr. denied both plaintiffs' and defendants' motions with respect to the waterline easement along Creek Road, but awarded defendants summary judgment \"as to a roadway easement for ingress and egress.\" Following a motion by plaintiffs to reconsider, however, Judge Guice also awarded defendants summary judgment \"as to a waterline easement running along the roadway easement.\" Plaintiffs timely appealed to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We first address defendants' contentions related to plaintiff Henry Woodring's standing.

Henry deeded his interest in the 2 acre portion of the Woodring Tract to Gary Woodring in November 1998 and subsequently quitclaimed his interests in the 28.62 acre and 23.5 acre parcels to Gary on 3 July 2003. Plaintiffs Henry and Gary Woodring then jointly filed this suit on 6 May 2004. As Henry had conveyed any and all interest in the Woodring Tract to Gary prior to the filing of the complaint, Henry lacked standing to bring this action.\n   <em>\n    See Beachcomber Props., L.L.C. v.

Plaintiffs point to the fact that, on 15 April 2005, they filed a correction deed to this effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In the absence of some other fatal defect, deeds containing mutual mistakes are merely voidable and not void.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   23 Am.

The purportedly mistaken quitclaim deed thus was valid until the correction deed was recorded. As a result, at the time the complaint was filed, Henry had effectively conveyed all of his interest in the Woodring Tract to Gary, and Henry lacked standing to bring this claim. Henry's appeal is, therefore, dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We next consider plaintiff Gary Woodring's argument that, by failing to distinguish between the Swieter defendants and the Water Company, the trial court's summary judgment order effectively granted the Water Company ownership over the claimed easements. Plaintiff contends that because the Water Company was merely a lessee - rather than an owner - of a portion of the Swieter Tract, it could not own an easement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"[A]n easement appurtenant is incident to and exists only in connection with a dominant estate ..., pertains to the enjoyment of the dominant estate, and is incapable of existence separate and apart from the land to which it is annexed.\"\n   <em>\n    Coastal Ready-Mix Concrete Co. v.

It is also undisputed that the Water Company is a lessee and not an owner of the Swieter Tract. Accordingly, the Water Company could not have an ownership interest in the easements claimed by the Swieter defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The trial court's summary judgment order grants summary judgment to all the defendants without distinguishing among them. By failing to distinguish between the actual owners of the dominant estate and their lessee, however, the trial court's order necessarily grants the same rights in the easements to all defendants. Because the Water Company could not have ownership of an easement appurtenant to its landlord's land, we conclude this aspect of the trial court's ruling was error. As we are reversing for the reasons specified below, we instruct the trial court on remand to distinguish between defendants in any subsequent orders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiff next argues that the trial court erred in awarding defendants summary judgment, as genuine issues of material fact existed for each of defendants' four easement theories: easement by prescription under color of title, easement implied by prior use, easement implied by necessity, and easement by estoppel. Plaintiff contends alternatively that he was entitled to summary judgment with respect to defendants' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Summary judgment is proper if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with affidavits, show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

In response, defendants have pointed to no evidence suggesting that plaintiff or his father were aware that defendants had installed a waterline along Creek Road. None of the affidavits or requested admissions attached to defendants' motion for summary judgment indicate that plaintiff had such knowledge, and none of the evidence suggests that plaintiff led defendants to believe they had an easement that allowed installation of an underground commercial waterline.

We, therefore, dismiss Henry Woodring's appeal. Similarly, since the Water Company does not own any portion of the property to which an easement would be appurtenant, it cannot be deemed to own any easement. We reverse the trial court's order to the extent it can be construed to grant the Water Company an easement of any kind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   With respect to the Swieter defendants' claim for easements, plaintiff Gary Woodring has abandoned his appeal of the trial court's determination that an easement for ingress and egress along Creek Road exists in favor of the Swieter defendants. As for the claimed waterline easement underneath Creek Road, however, we hold: (1) defendants have not satisfied the requisite period for an easement by prescription and are not entitled to rely upon the shorter period provided by the doctrine of color of title; (2) as to implied easements, defendants have failed to show that the installation of a waterline was intended by the parties to the original transfer from common ownership or reasonably necessary to defendants' use of the property; and (3) defendants failed to forecast sufficient evidence that they are entitled to an easement by estoppel. The trial court, therefore, should have entered summary judgment in favor of plaintiff Gary Woodring regarding defendants' claim of an easement for their waterline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   With respect to plaintiff's claims for trespass, nuisance, unjust enrichment, and unfair trade practices, however, the trial court properly entered summary judgment in favor of defendants. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal in part, affirm the trial court in part, reverse the trial court in part, and remand for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Dismissed in part; affirmed in part; reversed and remanded in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Judges WYNN and HUDSON concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1.\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    We note that, although ownership of appurtenant easements cannot be conveyed away from their dominant estates, a lessee of a dominant tenement is entitled to utilize its appurtenant easements.\n    <em>\n     See Root v.
