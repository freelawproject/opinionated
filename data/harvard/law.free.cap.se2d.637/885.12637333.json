Applying our well-established case law, we hold it may not, and accordingly, we reverse the Court of Appeals and order a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   To safely accommodate increased traffic and promote public safety, the North Carolina Department of Transportation (\"DOT\") proposed improvements at the intersection of Garrett Road and Durham-Chapel Hill Road in Durham County. When DOT and landowner M.M. Fowler, Inc. (\"MMFI\") were unable to agree on a purchase price, DOT filed an eminent domain action to condemn a portion of MMFI's land for the construction project. MMFI's property, originally 47,933 square feet, contains a gasoline station and convenience store, which MMFI pays an independent contractor to operate. The DOT improvement project necessitated a 13,039-square-foot right-of-way as well as a 1,664-square-foot slope easement and a 6,166-square-foot temporary construction easement. After the permanent taking, the remaining property totaled 34,894 square feet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In its complaint, DOT requested a determination of just compensation for the taking in accordance with Article 9 of Chapter 136 of the General Statutes. Concurrently, DOT deposited $166,850 with the Durham County Superior Court as its estimate of just compensation. MMFI answered and demanded a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Prior to trial, DOT filed a motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   asking the court to exclude,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   \"[e]vidence concerning loss of profits or income, loss of business, loss of goodwill, or interruption of business.\" The trial court initially allowed the motion \"until [it] should rule otherwise.\" At trial, the court heard arguments from both parties on the issues and ultimately denied DOT's motion\n   <em>\n    in limine.\n   </em>\n   However, the trial court gave the following limiting instruction purportedly derived from\n   <em>\n    Kirkman v. State Highway Commission,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8568280\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/257/428/#p432\">\n    257 N.C. 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 432,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=126%20S.E.2d%20107\">\n    126 S.E.2d 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 110 (1962):\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"[L]oss of profits or injury to a growing business conducted on property or connected therewith are not elements of recoverable damages in an award for the taking under the power of eminent domain. However, when the taking renders the remaining land unfit or less valuable for any use to which it is adapted, that factor is a proper item to be considered in determining whether the taking has diminished the value of the land itself.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   MMFI's witnesses estimated the loss in value caused by the taking to be between $500,000 and $540,000. These estimates were based solely on capitalization of the company's alleged lost business profits. DOT's evidence indicated MMFI was entitled to approximately $169,000 to $225,700. The jury returned a verdict awarding $375,000 as damages for the permanent taking and $75,000 for the temporary construction and slope easements. On 8 October 2003, the trial court entered a judgment awarding MMFI a total of $450,000 plus interest from the date of the complaint until the date of judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   DOT appealed the jury's verdict on the permanent taking, arguing the trial court improperly admitted lost profits evidence. The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court, holding that, although our case law generally forbids evidence of lost profits,\n   <em>\n    Kirkman\n   </em>\n   creates a limited exception in a partial taking when access to the remaining\n   property is restricted or denied.\n   <em>\n    DOT v.

CONDEMNATION PROCEEDINGS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Our Court has stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The right to take private property for public use, the power of eminent domain, is one of the prerogatives of a sovereign state. The right is inherent in sovereignty; it is not conferred by constitutions. Its exercise, however, is limited by the constitutional requirements of due process and payment of just compensation for property condemned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    State v. Core Banks Club Props., Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8558632\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/275/328/#p334\">\n    275 N.C. 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 334,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=167%20S.E.2d%20385\">\n    167 S.E.2d 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 388 (1969) (citing\n   <em>\n    Redevelopment Comm'n v. Hagins,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8560151\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/258/220/\">\n    258 N.C. 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=128%20S.E.2d%20391\">\n    128 S.E.2d 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1962)). Both the state and federal constitutions limit the State's power of eminent domain. North Carolina's Constitution protects the rights of property owners through the \"Law of the Land Clause,\" which provides that \"[n]o person shall be . . . deprived of his . . . property, but by the law of the land.\" N.C. Const. art. I, \u00a7 19;\n   <em>\n    see also McKinney v. Deneen,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8630957\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/231/540/#p542\">\n    231 N.C. 540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 542,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=58%20S.E.2d%20107\">\n    58 S.E.2d 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 109 (1950) (citing N.C. Const. of 1868, art. I, \u00a7 17, the predecessor of the current N.C. Const. art. I, \u00a7 19). In other words, although the State can condemn land for public use, the owner must be justly compensated. As Professor John V. Orth has noted: \"`Notwithstanding there is no clause in the Constitution of North Carolina which expressly prohibits private property from being taken for public use without compensation . . ., yet the principle is so grounded in natural equity that it has never been denied to be a part of the law of North Carolina.'\" John V. Orth,\n   <em>\n    The North Carolina State Constitution\n   </em>\n   58 (Univ. of N.C. Press 1995) (1993) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Johnston v.

Similarly, the Federal Constitution guards the due process rights of property owners through the Fourteenth Amendment. U.S. Const. amend. XIV, \u00a7 1 (\"[N]or shall any State . . . deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law . . . .\");\n   <em>\n    see also Sale v. State Highway &amp; Pub.

Article 9 sets forth the procedure for acquiring land by condemnation. These proceedings commence when DOT files a complaint and declaration of taking accompanied by a deposit of the estimated just compensation in the superior court in the county where the land is located.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=167%20S.E.2d%20385\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 136-103(a) (2005).

It seems to us, in like manner, that the diminution of its value is a vaguer injury than the taking or appropriation with which the Constitution deals.

Awarding damages for lost profits would provide excess compensation for a successful business owner while a less prosperous one or an individual landowner without a business would receive less money for the same taking. Indeed, if business revenues were considered in determining land values, an owner whose business is losing money could receive less than the land is worth. Limiting damages to the fair market value of the land prevents unequal treatment based upon the use of the real estate at the time of condemnation. Further, paying business owners for lost business profits in a partial taking results in inequitable treatment of the business owner whose entire property is taken, in which case lost profits clearly are not considered.\n   <em>\n    See Williams,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8619482\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/252/141/#p146\">\n    252 N.C. at 148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=113%20S.E.2d%20263\">\n    113 S.E.2d at 269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Evidence of lost business profits is impermissible because recovery of the same is not allowed. 5\n   <em>\n    Nichols\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 19.06[1], at 19-36.

Application of\n   <em>\n    Pemberton\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In the present case, the only issue for the jury was the amount of damages DOT owed MMFI. To establish its estimate of fair market value, MMFI offered the testimony of two witnesses: (1) Marvin Barnes, MMFI's president, who detailed the business's lost profits; and (2) Frank Ward, the company's real estate appraiser, who used MMFI's lost business profits to develop a valuation of the land. Both witnesses stated the highest and best use of the property in question was and is its present use as a convenience store and gasoline station both before and after the taking. Mr. Barnes opined that DOT's condemnation impaired the remaining property and made it less valuable for these purposes. MMFI's evidence showed that DOT relocated one of the driveways providing access to its property from Garrett Road to Durham-Chapel Hill Road. The other two driveways were left in essentially the same location, although one was shorter and steeper after completion of the roadway project.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Following the trial court's limiting instruction, Mr. Barnes testified that MMFI lowered the price of gasoline, and consequently, the profit margin on each gallon sold dropped four cents in the five months following completion of construction. He believed the price reduction was necessary because of decreased customer access to the property resulting from DOT's alterations of the drive-ways. Mr. Barnes multiplied MMFI's alleged profit decrease by the number of gallons of gasoline sold each year at the station and arrived at a figure of $90,000 as the lost profits MMFI would suffer in the year following the taking. Mr. Barnes then assigned a before value of $1.3 million to the property and an after value of $800,000. He calculated\n   the after value using what he considered to be a \"conservative factor\" of six times his estimate of yearly lost profits, which resulted in a $540,000 reduction in value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Although the trial court properly admitted Mr. Barnes's testimony that DOT's condemnation made it more difficult for customers to enter MMFI's service station, it should have excluded the quantified estimate of lost profits and any valuation based solely on this evidence. One factor in determining the value of condemned property is the highest and best use of the land.\n   <em>\n    Kirkman,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8568280\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/257/428/#p432\">\n    257 N.C. at 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=126%20S.E.2d%20107\">\n    126 S.E.2d at 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Indeed, at trial in the present case, DOT conceded that the income capitalization approach was \"basically the best way to value a property, an income producing property, such as [defendant's property].\" (t 57) As this Court has emphasized: \"In condemnation proceedings our decisions are to the effect that damages are to be awarded to compensate for loss sustained by the landowner. `The compensation must be full and complete and include everything which affects the value of the property and in relation to the entire property affected.'\"\n   <em>\n    State Highway Comm'n v.

Witnesses for both DOT and defendant agreed that the highest and best use of the property was as a gas station and convenience store. Mr. Marvin Barnes, defendant's owner, stated that the property in question had been adapted and developed for use as a gas station. Mr. Barnes testified that over the past thirty years he had evaluated and purchased approximately thirty to thirty-five properties for use as gasoline stations or\n   combined gasoline station and convenience stores. Mr. Barnes indicated that convenience is one of the most important factors in determining the value of land used for a gas station. He testified at trial:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Q In evaluating a piece of property for purchase as a gas station site or a convenience store site, what factors do you look at to determine what the value of that site should be?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   A Well, we look at all the surrounding demographics, traffic count and influx and whether the site lays well. Whether or not it will be or can be made convenient for people to buy gasoline there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Q And what are the-Do you look at the orientation of the building . . . to the road?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   A Well we decide which roads. Generally we build on corner sites and we decide which way we want the store to face, which road it will face. And then we try to work out a configuration that will make the store easy for the public to come in to do business and then leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Q And is the orientation of the driveways that go in and out of the site, does that have any impact when you're evaluating the site for value?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   A Well, it's one of the most important factors. It's crucial. Gasoline is a commodity. And so people won't go out of their way to purchase it. You've got to make it easy for them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Q When you are evaluating a piece of property for, or making a determination about a potential value of a piece of property for purchase as a service-gas station or convenience store, do you take into or make any projections as to what you believe the potential sales volume of gasoline that that site might be able to make?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   A I do. I have to decide how many units or gallons a particular site can sell on an annual basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Mr. Barnes also gave extensive testimony detailing why, as a result of the taking, it was less convenient for customers to access the gas station. Before the taking, the property was served by three driveways that were very convenient for customers. The first driveway, which faced Old Chapel Hill Road and centered on the four gasoline dispensers and the convenience store itself, \"allow[ed] people to come in, get gas, [and then] either exit on Garrett Road or return to Old Chapel Hill Road.\" A second driveway, located on Garrett Road near its intersection with Old Chapel Hill Road, \"allowed people coming toward Durham on Old Chapel Hill Road to make a left-hand turn and go directly into the station in front of the [gasoline] dispensers to get gas and then leave by [a third driveway located farther from the intersection] on Garrett Road.\" Alternatively, customers entering on the second driveway \"who wanted to continue on down Old Chapel Hill Road toward South Square and Durham after getting gas again could turn around and go back out to Old Chapel Hill Road\" on the first driveway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Everything changed when DOT condemned a substantial portion of defendant's lot. The second pre-taking driveway, located on Garrett Road near its intersection with Old Chapel Hill Road, \"was done away with entirely.\" The other driveway on Garrett Road became \"more steep\" and less convenient to customers because it was shortened and the resulting grade became more severe. After the taking, the two driveways established by DOT on Old Chapel Hill Road were \"not as well positioned.\" According to Barnes, \"As you come up to the store from Durham . . . there is a gradual grade of a crest . . . just on the Durham side of the store. The truth is cars coming there can't see cars coming out of this lower driveway because it's down below them\" due to the new grade. Mr. Barnes also stated that the \"after taking\" driveway layout often forced customers to \"make a u-turn to go back out the way they came.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Mr. Barnes testified that this lack of convenience \"directly caused\" a drop in the margin that this particular property achieved of \"four cents\" per gallon of gasoline. Based upon this \"quantified\" data, Mr. Barnes could accurately calculate that gasoline revenues would fall $90,000 in the first full year after completion of the DOT project. Based on the income capitalization approach, which the state conceded was appropriate for income-producing property such as defendant's, Mr.\n   Barnes gave his opinion as to the fair market value of the property before the taking, $1.3 million, and after the taking, $800,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Similarly, defendant's expert appraiser, Mr. Frank Ward, testified that the property was worth $1.2 million before the taking and $700,000 after the taking. Mr. Ward stated that \"the reduction in income [caused by the taking] had diminished the value of the property.\" Mr. Barnes and Mr. Ward both testified that they based their \"after value\" on the loss in revenue directly caused by the impact of the taking on the property itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Accordingly, defendant's witnesses gave their opinion as to the before and after value of the property as required by N.C.G.S. \u00a7 136-112. They explained the bases of their opinions, which included the \"certain\" reduction in revenue resulting from DOT's taking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Twice, Judge Hobgood gave a cautionary instruction, admonishing the jury that it was not to award damages for any loss in business income. The language carefully selected by Judge Hobgood for this instruction was a mirror image of the language of\n   <em>\n    Kirkman,\n   </em>\n   far from the \"misreading of\n   <em>\n    Kirkman\n   </em>\n   \" asserted by the majority:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Loss of profits or injury to a growing business conducted on property or connected therewith are not elements of recoverable damages and an award for the taking under the power of eminent domain. However, when the taking renders the remaining land unfit or less valuable for any use to which it is adapted, that fact is a proper item to be consider[ed] in determining whether the taking has diminished the value of the land itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Having been properly charged under\n   <em>\n    Kirkman, see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8568280\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/257/428/#p432\">\n    257 N.C. at 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=126%20S.E.2d%20107\">\n    126 S.E.2d at 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , it was the jury's exclusive role to weigh the evidence, assess credibility where the evidence conflicted, and determine damages.\n   <em>\n    See Williams,\n   </em>\n   252 N.C. at 519,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=114%20S.E.2d%20340\">\n    114 S.E.2d at 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nothing in the facts of the instant case differentiates it from cases in which we have allowed evidence of lost rents or lost revenue to inform the market value determination. As noted by our Court of Appeals in the instant case, \"[t]he holding in\n   <em>\n    Kirkman\n   </em>\n   is not limited to instances where rental property is involved, as it was not a case involving rental property.\"\n   <em>\n    Dep't of Transp. v.

Specifically, the majority acknowledges that \"the trial court properly admitted Mr. Barnes's testimony that DOT's condemnation made it more difficult for customers to enter MMFI's service station,\" but objects to the introduction of a \"quantified estimate\" of lost revenue directly caused by DOT's taking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   If the majority is truly concerned about speculative evidence, then it makes little sense to allow\n   <em>\n    unquantifiable\n   </em>\n   evidence while excluding quantifiable evidence based on expert appraisal testimony. It was undisputed in this case that the real estate appraiser's qualifications were impeccable: he testified that he had been in the real estate appraising business for forty-two years, had been certified by the state ever since 1990, the first year certification was required, and had regularly appraised property for the State Department of Transportation for three decades. Given the reliability of the real estate appraisal here-which the state never challenged -it is difficult to find the logic or wisdom in a rule that would exclude the \"hard\" evidence provided by Mr. Ward, while allowing more speculative \"soft\" evidence of unquantifiable (and thus, largely unverifiable) losses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The majority further hypothesizes: \"[I]f business revenues were considered in determining land values, an owner whose business is losing money could receive less than the land is worth.\" This is a red herring. According to\n   <em>\n    Nichols:\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   If . . . the condemnor . . . seeks to bring out the actual income from the property, it should first be obliged to offer evidence that the use to which the land was actually put was one of the uses to which the land was best adapted. . . . It would, of course, be absurd to admit evidence of the income to be derived from raising potatoes on a valuable city lot, or renting it for a tennis court or for one-story booths, as evidence of the price it would bring as a real estate investment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <em>\n    Nichols,\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 19.01 at 19-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Perhaps most importantly, the General Assembly has not acted to amend the eminent domain statutes even after repeated decisions from this Court and the Court of Appeals over the course of many years indicating that evidence of lost revenue or lost profits may be used under these facts to inform market value. When, as here, the General Assembly has acquiesced in judicial construction of a statute, we must presume that it approves of the interpretation accorded to the statute by the courts.\n   <em>\n    See Rowan Cty.

Thus, the majority opinion not only alters a rule of law that has been in place for nearly half a century, but it also subverts legislative intent. If the General Assembly desired to change our law as the\n   majority does today, it could easily do so. Indeed, as the majority itself points out, the General Assembly is in fact currently studying this issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C. H.

Far from \"inflating\" awards, adhering to the well-settled\n   <em>\n    Kirkman\n   </em>\n   rule simply ensures that when citizens find themselves in the path of the latest DOT project, they receive \"just compensation\" for their lost property-as the United States Constitution and Constitution of North Carolina both require. Put simply, the majority's departure from\n   <em>\n    Kirkman\n   </em>\n   withholds essential valuation information from the jury.
