Evidence in the record tended to show that plaintiff-employee had worked in her present position as a police officer since June 1987, attaining the rank of corporal. At lunch time, following the standard sign-out procedures, she went to run some personal errands. She was not paid for her lunch break, and she drove her personal vehicle. She was accompanied by another officer. During plaintiff-employee's return trip to the police station, her car was struck from the rear by a vehicle driven by one Aaron Troy Sutton (\"Sutton\"), an intoxicated driver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff-employee emerged from her vehicle to evaluate the damage. As she began to walk back toward Sutton's car, it became evident to her that Sutton was planning to flee the scene. Following her training, she \"tapped\" the hood of the car in order to leave her fingerprints, threw up her hands and yelled for him to stop, while simultaneously trying to get out of the way. Sutton struck plaintiff-employee, who was flung across two lanes of traffic. Sutton then ran across plaintiff-employee's legs a second time while making his get-away. The first officer on the scene noted that plaintiff-employee appeared \"almost lifeless.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   An ambulance transported plaintiff-employee to Nash General Hospital. She was treated for multiple bruises and abrasions. However, she suffered no fractures. After her discharge, an orthopedic specialist advised her to continue with the medication, crutches and knee immobilizer she received during her hospitalization. She was also restricted in her work functions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff-employee returned to work on 6 January 2004. However, her work functions were circumscribed by the restrictions indicated above, which barred her from heavy lifting, climbing, and crawling. This limited her ability to perform crime scene investigations, her primary responsibility. These limitations caused some friction with her supervisor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff-employee was diagnosed with post traumatic stress, myofacial dysfunctional pain syndrome, bilateral occipital neuralgia, possible knee reflex sympathetic dystrophy, possible cervical herniated disc, depression, short term memory loss, lack of concentration, and adjustment disorder with mixed emotional features.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After her employer determined that her injuries were not related to her job functions, plaintiff-employee filed a Form 33 Request for a Hearing on 16 February 2004. Defendants responded with Form 33R on 5 March\n   2004. The deputy commissioner heard the case on 18 August 2004 in Nashville. On 26 January 2005, she entered an Opinion and Award, which\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   determined that plaintiff-employee's injuries arose out of her employment, that she had not reached maximum medical improvement, and directed that she be given additional leave and benefits to recuperate. Defendants appealed to the full Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On 29 September 2005, the Commission entered an Opinion and Award affirming the deputy commissioner's decision. This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-18\">__________________________________ <em>Standard of Review</em></pre>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Our review of the Commission's opinion and award is limited to determining whether competent evidence of record supports the findings of fact and whether the findings of fact, in turn, support the conclusions of law.\n   <em>\n    Deese v.

Defendants also challenge conclusions of law 2 and 3, that the plaintiff-employee was at increased risk of assault as a police officer and that her injuries arose out of her employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Turning first to conclusion 3, defendants contend that the Commission erred in determining that plaintiff-employee's injuries arose out of and in the course of her employment. Our Supreme Court has previously held that a determination that an injury arose out of and in the course of employment is a mixed question of law and fact, \"and where there is evidence to support the Commissioner's findings in this regard, [the appellate court is] bound by those findings.\"\n   <em>\n    Barham v.

This finding is critical for two reasons. First, as a matter of law, a mere automobile accident would represent \"a risk common to the traveling public and was not due to a hazard peculiar to a police officer.\" It would thus not be compensable as a work injury.\n   <em>\n    See Roberts v. Burlington Indus., Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2566796\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/321/350/#p358\">\n    321 N.C. 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 358,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=364%20S.E.2d%20417\">\n    364 S.E.2d 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 423 (1988) (holding that an injury is compensable only if \"the nature of the employment was a contributing proximate cause of the injury, and one to which the employee would not have been equally exposed apart from the employment\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Secondly, the Industrial Commission found that plaintiff-employee's injuries were sustained as the result of Sutton's assault and not as the result of the automobile accident. Significantly, the Commission stated in its findings of fact that the \"hit-and-run assault was a natural result of a risk reasonably associated with being a police officer\" and would not have occurred had plaintiff-employee not been in uniform. A fellow officer who was also involved in the accident, but not in the subsequent assault, does not appear to have been seriously injured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As noted above, the Commission's \"findings of fact are conclusive on appeal if supported\n   by competent evidence even though there is evidence to support a contrary finding.\"\n   <em>\n    Murray v.

Our Supreme Court has held that \"a police officer retains his official law enforcement officer status even while `off duty' unless it is clear from the nature of his activities that he is acting\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   on behalf of a private entity, or is engaged in some frolic or private business of his own.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Kentucky,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9002534\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/178/470/#p481\">\n    178 S.W.3d 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 481 (Ky.2005) (shooting of uniformed sheriff at fish fry constituted murder of police official engaged in his duties) (citing\n   <em>\n    Gaines,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2504044\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/332/461/#p472\">\n    332 N.C. at 472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=421%20S.E.2d%20569\">\n    421 S.E.2d at 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Logic would dictate that a worker's compensation claim for a uniformed police officer acting in accordance with her training presents at least an equally strong case as a criminal prosecution potentially entailing the death penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Here, plaintiff-employee testified it was after she emerged from the vehicle and was mid-center in front of the drunk driver's car that the latter attempted to flee. Other witnesses at the scene told the police that Sutton \"aimed\" his car at the \"police officer\" and proceeded to drag her. Defendants alleged that there is no evidence to support the Commission's determination that plaintiff-employee was attacked because she was a police officer, since Sutton, the only individual aware of his intentions at the time of the assault, stated that he did not know that she was a police officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We find this suggestion disingenuous. At the time of his statement, Sutton was faced with the prospect of being charged with a myriad of serious criminal offenses. Conceding that he had deliberately targeted a law enforcement officer would have exacerbated his already precarious position. Indeed, Sutton denied hitting plaintiff-employee's truck, denied ramming her, and denied leaving the scene. Against this background, we cannot fault the Commission for declining to take his statements at face value. We note that Sutton did concede he was aware that his victim was uniformed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We have previously noted that mental state is seldom provable by direct evidence.\n   <em>\n    State v. Campbell,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2645332\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/51/418/#p421\">\n    51 N.C.App. 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 421,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=276%20S.E.2d%20726\">\n    276 S.E.2d 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 729 (1981). Therefore, the willfulness of an individual's conduct may be inferred from the circumstances surrounding the events.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., State v. Agnew,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8573223\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/294/382/#p393\">\n    294 N.C. 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 393,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=241%20S.E.2d%20684\">\n    241 S.E.2d 684\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 691 (1978). Our Supreme Court has held that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Knowledge is a mental state that may be proved by offering circumstantial evidence to prove a contemporaneous state of mind. . . . It may be proved by the conduct and statements of the defendant, by statements made to him by others, by evidence of reputation which it may be inferred had come to his attention, and by other circumstantial evidence from which an inference of knowledge might reasonably be drawn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

Examining the circumstantial evidence around the attack on plaintiff-employee, including her testimony and that of other witnesses present at the scene, we hold there is sufficient evidence to support the Commission's findings that the assault was directed against the plaintiff-employee because of her status as a police officer, and not because of the traffic accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   It is this distinction that renders the defendant's chief case inapposite to the present one.\n   <em>\n    Dodson v. Dubose Steel, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8953713\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/159/1/#p12\">\n    159 N.C.App. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 12,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=582%20S.E.2d%20389\">\n    582 S.E.2d 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 395 (2003) (Steelman, J., dissenting),\n   <em>\n    rev'd per curiam,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2985645\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/358/129/\">\n    358 N.C. 129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=591%20S.E.2d%20548\">\n    591 S.E.2d 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004) (for reasons stated in the dissent), concerned a driver killed in a road rage altercation. The dissenting opinion adopted by the Supreme Court specifically noted that all drivers were at equal risk of confrontations arising from road rage, whether they were driving for employment or personal reasons.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=582%20S.E.2d%20389\">\n    582 S.E.2d at 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The determinative and distinguishing fact was that the decedent in\n   <em>\n    Dodson\n   </em>\n   was not attacked because he was a truck driver. By contrast, the Commission has specifically found that plaintiff-employee\n   in this case was targeted for assault because of her status as a police officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We also note, in the alternative, that the Commission found as a matter of fact that the plaintiff-employee was acting in her law enforcement capacity in her response to Sutton. The Commission alluded in particular to the undisputed fact that plaintiff-employee followed police procedure and \"tapped\" the hood of the assailant's car with her hands to provide prints for subsequent investigation. Plaintiff-employee also testified that, in leaving the prints, she was following her training and established police procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In this context, defendants have challenged some particular factual findings made by the Commission. For instance, the Commission relied on the fact that plaintiff-employee was on call during the incident as an underlying factor to support its determination that her injuries arose out of and in the course of her employment. Defendants challenge this finding, citing\n   <em>\n    Childs v. Johnson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9250316\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/155/381/#p389\">\n    155 N.C.App. 381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 389,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=573%20S.E.2d%20662\">\n    573 S.E.2d 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 667 (2002) for the proposition that being on call is insufficient to draw a government employee into the scope of employment while on a personal errand. The comparison is misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In the first place, the Commission unequivocally rejected plaintiff-employee's assertion that being on-call in and of itself placed her on duty:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   15. . . . Plaintiff has argued that she was on-call during her shift, that she had her radio on and with her throughout the time she was gone in case she was called into service ... 16. However, plaintiff was not at her workstation and was not engaged in any policy activity when her vehicle was rear-ended. . . . She was not paid for the lunch period, which was not considered to be a \"break\", a shorter rest period taken on site; nor was she paid mileage for use of her vehicle. Although she had her police radio on while she was gone, she had not been called into service during her lunch period but spent the time running personal errands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Secondly,\n   <em>\n    Childs\n   </em>\n   dealt with the denial of governmental immunity to a government official involved in an automobile accident whose job required him to be on call twenty-four hours a day.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=573%20S.E.2d%20662\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It was not a Workers' Compensation Act case. In\n   <em>\n    Childs,\n   </em>\n   we held that the mere fact that the official was on-call while running personal errands did not suffice to shield his conduct in a subsequent automobile accident via the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Its holding is tangential at best to the case at bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   More importantly, the Commission did not rest its determination that the attack occurred in the scope of employment exclusively on the fact that plaintiff-employee was on call.
