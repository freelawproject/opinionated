Joyce (defendant) were married on 3 May 1985. They lived together as husband and wife until 18 May 1997, when they separated. Plaintiff filed a complaint on 4 June 1998 seeking an absolute divorce and equitable distribution of the marital property. Defendant filed an answer on 2 July 1998 also seeking equitable distribution. An order of equitable distribution was entered 14 June 2005. From that order defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On 20 September 1993, defendant's father transferred ownership in one half of a mobile home park by deed. Subsequent to this transfer, the parties operated the entire mobile home park, consisting of nine mobile home lots and four apartments, and paid to defendant's father eighty-five percent of the monthly profits. Both parties were actively involved in the operation of the mobile home park; plaintiff maintained the books, leased lots, accepted rental payments, maintained the grounds, painted the units, and performed minor maintenance in the park. Defendant undertook the more physical maintenance tasks, including yardwork and repairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During the marriage and prior to the transfer of the mobile home park, defendant, who was working as a contractor, renovated his father's home. Defendant made a number of improvements, including: adding a new roof; extending the foundation of the house; enlarging a bedroom; adding a new bathroom and mudroom; painting and tile installation; replacing the sheetrock in the living room; and installing a new floor. Defendant completed this work over a nine month period, during which he was working on his father's house on a full-time basis, and for which he was paid a total of $2,000.00. In addition to remodeling his father's home, defendant worked on his father's farm throughout the marriage, for which he was paid $200.00 per week. This work included pouring concrete, constructing buildings, setting up equipment, and maintaining the yard. During the marriage, defendant also renovated portions of plaintiff's parents' house, for which he was paid approximately $300.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant makes four assignments of error, none of which pass muster: (I) the trial court erred by classifying the portion of the mobile home park deeded to defendant as marital property; (II) the trial court erred in sustaining plaintiff's objection to further evidence by defendant's father as to his donative intent; (III) the trial court erred in finding defendant received payment from plaintiff's parents for the improvements made by him to their home during the marriage; and (IV) the trial court erred in including the mobile home park in its equal division of the marital estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"Equitable distribution is vested in the discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of that discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Wiencek-Adams v.

Plaintiff then had the burden of proving that defendant's father lacked donative intent. In addition to presenting an extensive list of renovations, property maintenance and bookkeeping performed by the parties for defendant's father, plaintiff introduced into evidence the transfer document, a general warranty deed dated 20 September 1993. This deed states in relevant part that defendant's father, \"for a valuable consideration paid by the Grantee, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged . . . does grant, bargain, sell and convey\" the mobile home park to the defendant. This statement of payment and receipt of payment is\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   evidence of consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant presented evidence to contradict this\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   evidence, both by questioning defendant's father and by attempting to introduce a letter written by defendant's father in 2002, nine years after the transfer, corroborating his testimony that the transfer was intended as an \"early inheritance.\" The trial judge was unswayed, stating in his findings of fact:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The father testified at trial that he intended that this transfer be \"part of Richard's inheritance\". The Court found that this intent was documented post-transfer and obviously not drafted by an attorney. This Court was suspicious of the \"post-transfer document\" used to support the \"inheritance\" position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As the sole arbiter of witness's credibility, the trial judge was within his rights to be suspicious of the father's testimony and not to give it the weight desired by defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In light of the considerable amount of work performed by both parties for defendant's father during the course of the marriage, and specifically in connection with the operation of the mobile home park, and without credible documentation of the father's donative intent to contradict plaintiff's evidence of compensation, we must agree with the trial court that the transfer of the property was supported by adequate consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendant, in his second assignment of error, contends that the trial court erred in sustaining plaintiff's objection to further questioning of defendant's father as to his\n   donative intent. At trial, the following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defense counsel: Okay. And then, after the deed was-What was the purpose besides inheritance? Was there some sort of well dispute or well problem?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant: The water quality people came upon us and said, \"You're going to have to be under us-\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff's counsel: Your Honor, I'll object to this line of questioning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Court: Sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defense counsel: Alright, don't go into that then. Now, how man-If you know, how many bank accounts existed for the mobile home park.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   After the trial court sustained plaintiff's objection, defendant did not make an offer of proof concerning the significance of the excluded testimony. Instead, he began a new line of questioning. \"[I]n order for a party to preserve for appellate review the exclusion of evidence, the significance of the excluded evidence must be made to appear in the record and a specific offer of proof is required unless the significance of the evidence is obvious from the record.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thus, defendant has failed to preserve this issue for appellate review, and we dismiss this assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendant argues that the trial court erred in finding that he received payment from plaintiff's parents for improvements made by him to their home during the marriage on the ground that no competent evidence supports this finding. However, defendant, in his own brief, states that he \"received a total of $300.00 for a complete bathroom remodel.\" Although he may have been poorly compensated, by his own admission defendant was paid by plaintiff's parents for improvements to their home. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in its finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In his fourth assignment of error, defendant contends that the inclusion of the mobile home park in the trial court's division of the marital estate resulted in an unequal division of assets in plaintiff's favor. We have already determined that the trial court appropriately included the portion of the mobile home park deeded to defendant in the marital estate, thus rendering defendant's last assignment of error moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Finally, the plaintiff inserted in the record three cross-assignments of error, in which she contends that the trial court erred: (1) in concluding that the parties' leasehold interest in the hog farm had no net value on the date of separation; (2) in concluding that BB &amp; T account number 5116314179 was a marital asset; and (3) in denying plaintiff's motion to join defendant's parents as necessary parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \"Rule 10(d) of the North Carolina Rules of Appellate Procedure provides a means by which a party may except to and cross-assign as error a portion of an order from which his opposing party appeals.\"\n   <em>\n    Texaco, Inc. v.

Furthermore, through the passage quoted above, defendant's father fully explained the timing and justification for his deeding the property to defendant. Defendant's father offered his explanation, defense counsel did not follow up with any additional questions, and the essential content of the excluded testimony was allowed into evidence.
