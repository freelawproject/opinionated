However, the fourth contention necessitates a remand to the trial court for a determination of a factual issue necessary to the dispensation of a constitutional issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-15\">On the evening of March 14, 1974, two officers of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Yakima Police Department were conducting a surveillance of the apartment building in which the defendant resided. At approximately 10 p.m., one of the officers observed the defendant, whose identity was known to both of the officers, leave his apartment, look in both directions, and descend a stairway to the ground level. The defendant walked around the corner of the building, across the apartment parking lot to a gravel strip abutting the apartment building, knelt on the ground and dug with his hands in the gravel area. The officer was unable to determine whether the defendant placed anything in or took anything out of the hole. Defendant departed.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">The officers maintained their vantage point for approximately 1 hour before proceeding onto the property to examine the place where the defendant had been digging. They dug and discovered a plastic sack containing a substance they believed to be heroin. The sack also contained several small pieces of cut notebook paper. They covered the hole, returned to the police station, tested the substance and concluded it was heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">It was now about 2 a.m. They returned to the apartment building, without obtaining a warrant, found the hole reex-cavated and dirt scattered about the area. The officers went to the defendant\u2019s apartment. The outer door was partially open; they entered, but found no one in the immediate area. While there, they observed on a coffee table dirt of a similar color and consistency as that found in the hole outside the building and a small notebook in which several corners of the pages had been cut off. The defendant was not found within the apartment; the officers departed, taking nothing from the apartment. Later, the defendant was arrested. At trial, the officers testified as to the presence of the dirt and notebook within the defendant\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Defendant contends that there was insufficient evidence of constructive possession to submit the case to the jury. We disagree. As set forth in <em>State v. Sanders, </em>7 Wn. App. 891, 892, 503 P.2d 467 (1972):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>Possession of narcotic drugs may be either actual or constructive. <em>State v. Mathews, </em>4 Wn. App. 653, 484 P.2d 942 (1971); <em>State v. Cabigas, </em>3 Wn. App. 740, 477 P.2d 648 (1970). Constructive possession is proved when the person charged with possession had dominion and control of either the drugs or the premises upon which the drugs were found. <em>State v. Mathews, supra. </em>Even though there is not sufficient direct evidence to establish constructive possession such may be proved by substantial circumstantial evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><em>See also State v. Green, </em>2 Wn. App. 57, 70, 466 P.2d 193 (1970). The identity of defendant was known to the officers prior to their observation of the defendant. His leaving the apartment, walking directly to and digging a hole at the location where the officers found the heroin, is evidence that he was exercising dominion and control over whatever contents the hole may have contained. The circumstances provided substantial evidence from which the jury could conclude that the defendant was exercising dominion and control over the heroin found by the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Defendant contends the trial court erred in failing to suppress the evidence obtained from a search of the ground area outside of the apartment building. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">The area subject to the search was not reserved for the exclusive use of the defendant, but was available commonly to all tenants of the premises. The managing agent of the apartment building testified he had consented to the surveillance of the property and to the officers\u2019 presence on the premises, and further informed the officers that he desired them to perform whatever acts were necessary to prevent the illicit use of drugs on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">Where individuals have equal rights to access and use of common areas upon the premises, one assumes the risk that a search of such area may be consented to by an individual having equal authority over the common area.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-9\">[W]hen the prosecution seeks to justify a warrantless search by proof of voluntary consent, it is not limited to proof that consent was given by the defendant, but may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>show that permission to search was obtained from a third party who possessed common authority over or other sufficient relationship to the premises or effect sought to be inspected.7</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-4\">7Common authority is, of course, not to be implied from the mere property interest a third party has in the property. The authority which justifies the third-party consent does not rest upon the law of property, with its attendant historical and legal refinements, see <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>365 U. S. 610 (1961) (landlord could not validly consent to the search of a house he had rented to another), <em>Stoner </em>v. <em>California, </em>376 U. S. 483 (1964) (night hotel clerk could not validly consent to search of customer\u2019s room) but rests rather on mutual use of the property by persons generally having joint access or control for most purposes, so that it is reasonable to recognize that any of the co-inhabitants has the right to permit the inspection in his own right and that the others have assumed the risk that one of their number might permit the common area to be searched.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-5\"><em>United States v. Matlock, </em>415 U.S. 164, 171, 39 L. Ed. 2d 242, 94 S. Ct. 988, 993 (1974); <em>State v. Bellows, </em>72 Wn.2d 264, 432 P.2d 654 (1967); <em>State v. Smith, </em>12 Wn. App. 720, 724, 531 P.2d 843 (1975); <em>State v. Edwards, </em>5 Wn. App. 852, 854, 490 P.2d 1337 (1971); <em>State v. Breckenridge, </em>4 Wn. App. 328, 330, 481 P.2d 26 (1971); <em>People v. Hicks, </em>165 Cal. App. 2d 548, 331 P.2d 1003 (1958); <em>Commonwealth v. Connolly, </em>356 Mass. 617, 255 N.E.2d 191 (1970). We find the manager of the apartment, having consented to the officers\u2019 presence upon the premises and having informed the officers that they were entitled to utilize the premises in whatever manner they felt necessary, resulted in a consensual search of the property outside the building. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\"> The defendant contends that the court erred in failing to grant either a continuance or a change of venue based upon news publicity; the press reported the bombing death of Judge James Lawless, which occurred during the defendant\u2019s trial, speculating it may have had some connec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>tion with recent drug cases arising in the Benton-Franklin County area. Granting of either is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>State v. Braun, </em>82 Wn.2d 157, 509 P.2d 742 (1973). Counsel was given an opportunity to question the jury in regard to this publicity and elected not to do so. There is no evidence the jurors were in any way prejudiced by that tragic incident. <em>Cf. State v. Crudup, </em>11 Wn. App. 583, 524 P.2d 479 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">We find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to grant either a change of venue or a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">4</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Lastly, defendant contends for the first time that the testimony of the officers regarding the presence of the dirt and notebook within the defendant\u2019s apartment should have been suppressed as the product of an illegal entry.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Generally, issues raised for the first time on appeal are not subject to review. However, constitutional issues may be so raised. <em>State v. Lampshire, </em>74 Wn.2d 888, 893, 447 P.2d 727 (1968); <em>State v. Vining, 2 </em>Wn. App. 802, 472 P.2d 564 (1970); <em>cf. State v. Richard, </em>4 Wn. App. 415, 427, 482 P.2d 343 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">RCW 10.31.040 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-9\">To make an arrest in criminal actions, the officer may break open any outer or inner door, or windows of a dwelling house or other building, or any other inclosure, if, after notice of his office and purpose, he be refused admittance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">The statute does not differentiate between an arrest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>made pursuant to a warrant or an arrest made without a warrant based on probable cause. Because defense counsel did not raise the issue at trial, the record fails to evidence whether the officers complied, or failed to comply, with the requirements of RCW 10.31.040.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">This issue requires a factual determination necessitating a remand of this case to the Superior Court for a determination as to whether there was a compliance with the requirements of RCW 10.31.040. <em>State v. Richard, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Once challenged, a warrantless entry requires that the state bear the burden of demonstrating the officers were lawfully present upon the premises. <em>State v. Sanders, </em>8 Wn. App. 306, 309, 506 P.2d 892 (1973).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The issue having been raised, the State must demonstrate the officers\u2019 entry into the premises was either pursuant to the provisions of RCW 10.31.040, or, in the alternative, there existed exigent circumstances negating the officers\u2019 duty to comply with the provisions of RCW 10.31.040. <em>State v. Harris, </em>12 Wn. App. 481, 530 P.2d 646 (1975); <em>State v. Lowrie, </em>12 Wn. App. 155, 528 P.2d 1010 (1974); <em>State v. Dugger, </em>12 Wn. App. 74, 528 P.2d 274 (1974); <em>State v. Johnson, </em>11 Wn. App. 311, 522 P.2d 1179 (1974); <em>State v. Neff, </em>10 Wn. App. 713, 519 P.2d 1328 (1974); <em>Coleman v. Reilly, </em>8 Wn. App. 684, 508 P.2d 1035 (1973); <em>State v. Sanders, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\"> The State\u2019s contention that the officers\u2019 entry into the premises through an open door negated the necessity of compliance with the provisions of RCW 10.31.040, is without merit. <em>State v. Miller, </em>7 Wn. App. 414, 499 P.2d 241 (1972). Likewise, the position that the officers\u2019 entry was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>incident to a lawful arrest is without merit. There was no arrest of the defendant at the time of entry into the premises. A warrantless search incident to a lawful arrest must be contemporaneous with the arrest and must not go beyond the scope of the premises immediately under the control of the defendant. <em>Chimel v. California, </em>395 U.S. 752, 23 L. Ed. 2d 685, 89 S. Ct. 2034 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed as to the defendant\u2019s first three contentions; as to the search, this case is reversed for a factual determination consistent with this opinion. If the court concludes the entry was illegal, defendant is entitled to a new trial; if the court concludes the entry was proper, a record of the hearing shall be furnished, at public expense, and certified to this court for consideration and review.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">McInturff, C. J., and Green, J., concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b515-11\">The officers\u2019 testimony at the time of trial constitutes a matter subject to suppression should the entry be found to be illegal. <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 485, 9 L. Ed. 2d 441, 83 S. Ct. 407, 416 (1963):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-12\">It follows from our holding in <em>Silverman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>365 U. S. 505, that the Fourth Amendment may protect against the overhearing of verbal statements as well as against the more traditional seizure of \u201cpaper and effects.\u201d <em>Similarly, testimony as to matters observed during an unlawful invasion has been excluded in order to enforce the basic constitutional policies.

Ct. 507 (1967). \u201cThe exceptions are \u2018jealously and carefully drawn,\u2019 and there must be \u2018a showing by those who seek exemption . . . that the exigencies of the situation made that course imperative.\u2019 \u2018[T]he burden is on those seeking the exemption to show the need for it.\u2019 \u201d (Footnotes omitted.) <em>Coolidge v.
