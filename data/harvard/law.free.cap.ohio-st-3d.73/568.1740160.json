In both instances, West Bay contends that the record does not support the BTA\u2019s findings. We disagree with West Bay.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">\u201cWe will not overrule BTA findings of fact that are based upon sufficient probative evidence.\u201d <em>R.R.Z. Assoc. v. Cuyahoga Cty.

Lake Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 318, 319, 526 N.E.2d 64, 65. We have said repeatedly that \u201c[a]ppellant had the duty to prove its right to a reduction in value.\u201d <em>R.R.Z. </em>at 202, 527 N.E.2d at 878. See, also, <em>Ohio Region Senior Citizens Hous. Corp. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 489, 491, 628 N.E.2d 1362, 1364; <em>Crow v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 55, 57, 552 N.E.2d 892, 893; and <em>Zindle v. Summit Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 202, 203, 542 N.E.2d 650, 651.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">In this case, West Bay Manor had the duty to prove its right to a reduction in value. In determining the CON deduction, the BTA rejected Provencher\u2019s conclusion on the CON valuation as too subjective and discounted his testimony because he lacked credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">At the hearing, Provencher took the position that the $10,000 valuation was allocable in part to the CON and in part to goodwill, but he did not say how much went to which part. The BTA, also, found that Provencher did not properly explain the goodwill component because he \u201cdisplayed an ignorance of the licensing of nursing homes, in general.\u201d Further, in a prior appraisal of a different nursing home in the same city and for the same tax year as West Bay Manor\u2019s, Provencher opined that the CON value was $5,000 per bed. Finally, we note that the BTA\u2019s conclusion of $6,000 per bed fell within the range supplied by Provencher.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we do not find the BTA\u2019s valuation of the CON based on $6,000 per bed unlawful or unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-11\">As to the personal property deduction, the only evidence of the deduction claimed by West Bay is Provencher\u2019s testimony, which he did not support with any data. The BTA did not believe this testimony, and the BTA has wide discretion to grant or deny credibility to witnesses. \u201cAbsent a showing of an abuse of that discretion, the BTA\u2019s determination as to the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony will not be reversed by this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>court.\u201d <em>Witt Co. v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 155, 157, 573 N.E.2d 661, 663. We find no showing of an abuse of discretion by the BTA in disbelieving Provencher on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The decision of the Board of Tax Appeals is neither unreasonable nor unlawful and it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b681-7\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Wright, Resnick, F.E.
