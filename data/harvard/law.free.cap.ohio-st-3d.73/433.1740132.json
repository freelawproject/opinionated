Finding none meritorious, we affirm his convictions. We have also independently weighed the aggravating circumstance against mitigating factors, and compared the sentence to those imposed in similar cases, as R.C. 2929.05(A) requires. As a result, we affirm the sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">\n<em>Inaccurate Jury Sentencing Standard (I-IV)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">In propositions of law Nos. I through IV, Hill raises issues centered around his claim that the jury was fundamentally misled concerning the sentencing standard by which aggravating circumstances are weighed against mitigating factors. Yet, Hill did not object at trial to the faulty verdict form or the instructions, and thus waived all but plain error. \u201cThe failure to object to a jury instruction constitutes a waiver of any claim of error relative thereto, unless, but for the error, the outcome of the trial clearly would have been otherwise.\u201d <em>State v. Underwood </em>(1983), 3 Ohio St.3d 12, 3 OBR 360, 444 N.E.2d 1332, syllabus. Overall, we find the instructions adequate under the facts of this case and reject Hill\u2019s claims of plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-13\">As Hill correctly points out, the jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt that the \u201caggravating circumstances\u201d are \u201csufficient to outweigh\u201d those \u201cmitigating factors present in the case\u201d before recommending the death penalty. R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>2929.03(D)(2). Unfortunately, at least one life sentence verdict form used in this case, and possibly both, misstated this standard. Neither life verdict form is in the record. However, the trial judge told the jury that the life sentence verdict form involved the jury\u2019s finding that the \u201cmitigating factors are sufficient\u201d to outweigh the aggravating circumstance. Thus, in referring to that form, the trial judge asserted, \u201cThe second [form] is we, the jury, do find beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigating factors are sufficient to outweigh the aggravating circumstances present in this case.\u201d Additionally, the court and parties frequently and erroneously referred to \u201caggravating circumstances\u201d although only one aggravating circumstance was alleged or proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">In proposition of law No. II, Hill points out that the prosecutor in argument misstated applicable law by asserting that \u201cmitigating factors do not outweigh the aggravating circumstances.\u201d The prosecutor also misspoke by referring to \u201cany mitigating factor\u201d in the singular, and by referring to the jury recommending \u201cdeath in the electric chair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Notwithstanding the prosecutor\u2019s misstatements and the inaccurate life sentence verdict form, we deem it unnecessary to reverse this sentencing determination under the circumstances of this case. First, Hill failed to raise these issues before the court of appeals. We \u201cwill not ordinarily consider a claim of error that was not raised in any way in the Court of Appeals and was not considered or decided by that court.\u201d <em>State v. Williams </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St.2d 112, 5 O.O.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Second, Hill failed to object at trial. As noted before, failure to object to an instruction waives \u201cany claim of error * * * unless, but for the error, the outcome of the trial clearly would have been otherwise.\u201d <em>State v. Underwood, </em>syllabus. This principle applies equally to the faulty life sentence verdict form. \u201cNotice of plain error under Crim.R. 52(B) is to be taken with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">No plain error exists in this case. In fact, the record demonstrates the parties, including the judge in the instructions, generally did refer to a correct standard in the sentence proceedings. Thus, the jury understood the applicable sentencing standard and its sentencing responsibility. The trial court clearly and correctly instructed the jury more than four separate times in final penalty instructions that the aggravating circumstances had to outweigh mitigating factors before the jury could recommend the death penalty. The court defined the term \u201creasonable doubt,\u201d and specifically told the jury \u201cthe defendant has no burden of proof.\u201d The court specifically referred once to the state\u2019s burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the factors in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>mitigation. The court repeated the state\u2019s burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt when reading the death penalty verdict form. The court further told the jury that only if \u201cyou are firmly convinced\u201d that aggravating circumstances outweigh mitigating factors has the state proven its right to a death penalty verdict. If the jury was not \u201cfirmly convinced\u201d that aggravation outweighed mitigation, then the state was not entitled to a death penalty recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">In voir dire, the prosecutor repeatedly referred to the correct standard. Also, the jury never asked any questions. Moreover, the jury form that the jury agreed to and signed reflected the correct standard: \u201cWe, the Jury, in the issue joined, do find beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances [sic ] present in this case are sufficient to outweigh the mitigating factors and we therefore recommend that the sentence of Death be imposed on the defendant, Jeffrey D. Hill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">When the jury instructions including the verdict forms are viewed in their entirety, the trial judge adequately informed the jury of its responsibility under R.C. 2929.03(D)(2). <em>State v. Lorraine </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 414, 425, 613 N.E.2d 212, 221. Accord <em>State v. Landrum </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 107, 122, 559 N.E.2d 710, 727.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Moreover, we find nothing suggesting the aggravating circumstance and mitigating factors are in equipoise in this case. In fact, the aggravating circumstance strongly outweighs the scant mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, as discussed later. In essence, Hill asked the jury and this court to spare his life because he is a cocaine addict and confessed to police. Under those circumstances, the faulty form or instructions could not have affected the jury\u2019s decision so that \u201cbut for\u201d the faulty form, the \u201coutcome of the trial clearly would have been otherwise.\u201d <em>State v. Underwood, </em>syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Further, Hill\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s argument also waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Mills </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 357, 373, 582 N.E.2d 972, 986. No plain error resulted because the prosecutor did not deny Hill a fair trial or cause a miscarriage of justice. <em>State v. Combs </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 278, 282, 581 N.E.2d 1071, 1076; <em>State v. Landrum, supra, </em>at 110, 559 N.E.2d at 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">The prosecutor\u2019s reference to the electric chair was accurate, since the General Assembly had not yet authorized death by lethal injection. See R.C. 2949.22, Sub.H.B. No. 11, effective October 1,1993. The prosecutor\u2019s brief misstatements as to \u201cany mitigating factor\u201d and the weighing process were inconsequential. At times, the prosecutor correctly noted that the aggravating circumstance must outweigh mitigating factors to justify the death penalty. Moreover, the court told the jury it was the court\u2019s job to instruct the jury on the law, and the jury\u2019s duty to follow those instructions. As discussed, the court adequately instructed the jury as to its responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Additionally, our independent reassessment of the sentence could eliminate the effect of these errors. See <em>State v. Combs, supra, </em>at 286, 581 N.E.2d at 1079; <em>State v. Landrum, supra, </em>at 124, 559 N.E.2d at 729. Thus, we reject Hill\u2019s plain error assertions in propositions Nos. I and II.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">In propositions of law Nos. Ill and IV, Hill asserts he was denied the effective assistance of counsel at trial and before the court of appeals. In proposition No. Ill, Hill complains because his counsel did not object at trial to the verdict form or the prosecutorial misstatements, as discussed in propositions Nos. I and II. In proposition No. IV, Hill complains his appellate counsel failed to raise these issues at the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Reversal of a conviction or sentence based on ineffective assistance requires meeting the two-prong standard of <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. <em>Strickland </em>requires: (a) deficient performance, \u201cerrors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment\u201d; and (b) prejudice, \u201cerrors * * * so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.\u201d <em>Strickland </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d at 693. Accord <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">However, Hill fails to demonstrate either deficient performance or prejudice. Hill\u2019s counsel reasonably decided not to object to the prosecutor\u2019s brief, inaccurate comments. Objections \u201c \u2018tend to disrupt the flow of a trial [and] are considered technical and bothersome[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Campbell </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 38, 53, 630 N.E.2d 339, 352. A decision not to interrupt because of such' imprecise statements reflected \u201can objective standard of reasonable representation.\u201d See <em>State v. Bradley, </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus. Also, counsel could have believed the trial court\u2019s more than four correct references to the aggravating circumstances outweighing the mitigation factors negated these misstatements.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">As to the incorrect life verdict form or forms, all parties to the trial, including the two defense counsel, apparently overlooked that deficiency. Such an oversight is \u201cnot the kind of egregious and unprofessional conduct condemned by <em>Strickland.\u201d State v. Seiber </em>(1990), 56 Ohio St.3d 4, 11, 564 N.E.2d 408, 417. Accord <em>State v. Scudder </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 263, 273, 643 N.E.2d 524, 533. Overall, counsel\u2019s conduct fell within the wide range of reasonably professional conduct, and his counsel continued to function as the counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">Additionally, Hill has not established prejudice, \u201ca reasonable probability that, were it not for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the trial would have been different.\u201d <em>State v. Bradley, </em>at paragraph three of the syllabus. In fact, the aggravating circumstance strongly outweighs the scant mitigating factors beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>doubt, as discussed later. Thus, even if counsel had objected and thereby secured a correct verdict form or eliminated the prosecutor\u2019s misstatements, no reasonable probability exists as to a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">Appellate counsel\u2019s tactical decision not to raise in the court of appeals the claims in propositions Nos. I and II, or the ineffective assistance claim in proposition No. Ill, reflected reasonable professional judgment. The first two issues had been waived at trial and were unlikely to succeed. \u201cThis process of \u201cwinnowing out weaker arguments on appeal and focusing on those more likely to prevail * * * is the hallmark of effective appellate advocacy.\u201d <em>Smith v. Murray </em>(1986), 477 U.S. 527, 536, 106 S.Ct. 2661, 2667, 91 L.Ed.2d 434, 445. Additionally, Hill has not demonstrated prejudice. Propositions Nos. I through III create no \u201creasonable probability\u201d of a different result on appeal were it not for counsel\u2019s errors. <em>State v. Bradley, </em>at paragraph three of the syllabus. Hence, we also reject propositions Nos. Ill and IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">\n<em>Defective Trial and Appellate Sentencing Opinions (V, VI)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">In propositions of law Nos. V and VI, Hill argues the trial court, in its sentencing opinion, and the court of appeals, in its reassessment of the sentence, considered nonstatutory aggravating circumstances and ignored valid mitigation. We find no merit in either claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Neither the trial court nor the court of appeals relied upon nonstatutory aggravating circumstances. Both courts accurately identified the single aggravating circumstance. When a court does so correctly, that court is presumed to rely only on that circumstance, and not on nonstatutory aggravating circumstances. <em>State v. Rojas </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 131, 142, 592 N.E.2d 1376, 1386; <em>State v. Wiles </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 71, 90, 571 N.E.2d 97, 120. Neither the court of appeals\u2019 description of Hill\u2019s crime as \u201cheinous,\u201d nor the trial court\u2019s alleged \u201cdisgust\u201d for Hill\u2019s offense, created nonstatutory aggravating circumstances. The facts of the robbery form part of the aggravating circumstance. <em>State v. Lott </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 171, 555 N.E.2d 293, 305. Moreover, a court \u201cmay rely upon and cite the nature and circumstances of the offense as reasons supporting its finding that the aggravating circumstances were sufficient to outweigh the mitigating factors.\u201d <em>State v. Stumpf </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 95, 512 N.E.2d 598, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">As to mitigation, \u201cthe assessment and weight to be given mitigating evidence are matters for the trial court\u2019s determination.\u201d <em>State v. Lott, supra, </em>at 171, 555 N.E.2d at 305. The fact mitigation evidence is admissible \u201cdoes not automatically mean it must be given any weight.\u201d <em>State v. Steffen </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 111, 31 OBR 273, 509 N.E.2d 383, paragraph two of the syllabus. See, also, <em>State v. Stumpf, supra, </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus. The trial court could reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>ably assign whatever weight, if any, thought to be appropriate for Hill\u2019s drug dependency or cooperation with police.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">In discussing and evaluating the evidence, both the trial court and the court of appeals adequately explained why the aggravating circumstance outweighed any relevant mitigating factors. Even inadequate explanations do not require reversal. <em>State v. Fox </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 183, 191, 631 N.E.2d 124, 131; <em>State v. Lewis </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 200, 204, 616 N.E.2d 921, 925. Moreover, our independent reassessment can cure this asserted sentencing deficiency. <em>State v. Fox, </em>at 191, 631 N.E.2d at 131; <em>State v. Combs, </em>62 Ohio St.3d at 286, 581 N.E.2d at 1079; <em>State v. Maurer </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 247, 15 OBR 379, 386, 473 N.E.2d 768, 778.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">\n<em>Comment on Nonapplicable Mitigating Factors (VII)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">In proposition No. VII, Hill argues that the trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion justified the death sentence by noting the absence and irrelevance of certain statutory mitigating factors. We find no prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">Admittedly, <em>State v. DePew </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 275, 289, 528 N.E.2d 542, 557-558, recognizes that \u201cwhere the defendant does not raise a particular mitigating factor, that factor need not be considered in the opinions of the trial court and the appellate court or in the process of weighing[.]\u201d However, here, the trial court, in an effort to be conscientious and thorough, simply explained why certain statutory mitigating factors did not apply. We find no fault. By so commenting, the court did not convert inapplicable mitigating factors into nonstatutory aggravating circumstances. See <em>State v. Cooey </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 20, 39, 544 N.E.2d 895, 917; <em>State v. Combs, supra, </em>at 287, 581 N.E.2d at 1079.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">\n<em>Settled Issues (IX)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">Hill\u2019s proposition of law No. IX, challenging Ohio\u2019s death penalty statutes, is summarily rejected. See <em>State v. Bedford </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 122, 132, 529 N.E.2d 913, 923; <em>State v. Beuke </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 29, 38-39, 526 N.E.2d 274, 285; <em>State v. Poindexter </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 1, 520 N.E.2d 568, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">\n<em>Instructions on Intoxication (X, XI)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">In proposition of law No. X, Hill argues plain error because the trial court did not, <em>sua sponte, </em>instruct the jury to consider Hill\u2019s cocaine intoxication in deciding either his guilt or the recommended penalty. In proposition No. XI, Hill argues he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because defense counsel failed to ask for such jury instructions. We reject both propositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-13\">' First, Hill failed to request any instruction as to the effect of intoxication. Thus, Hill waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Underwood, supra, </em>at syllabus; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>Crim.R. 30(A), 52(B). The evidence of Hill\u2019s guilt, as well as the evidence supporting the death penalty, negates any claim that \u201cbut for the error,\u201d the trial result \u201cclearly would have been otherwise.\u201d <em>State v. Underwood, </em>syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Second, we have traditionally recognized a trial judge\u2019s discretion as to. whether to instruct a jury on intoxication as a defense. See <em>State v. Fox </em>(1981), 68 Ohio St.2d 53, 22 O.O.3d 259, 428 N.E.2d 410; <em>Nichols v. State </em>(1858), 8 Ohio St. 435, paragraph two of the syllabus. As <em>Nichols </em>stated at 439, we will not impose a requirement for a trial judge to so instruct a jury, since \u201c[ijntoxication is easily simulated\u201d and \u201coften voluntarily induced for the sole purpose of nerving a wicked heart[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Moreover, the evidence does not reasonably raise the intoxication issue. \u201c[IJntoxication is not raised as a defense to the element of purpose in a criminal prosecution merely because the evidence suggests reduced inhibitions, impaired judgment or blurred appreciation by the defendant of the consequences of his conduct.\u201d <em>State v. Hicks </em>(1989), 43 Ohio St.3d 72, 538 N.E.2d 1030, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">In this case, Hill drove away from his mother\u2019s house, obtained cocaine, and drove back. Then he stabbed her ten times, searched for and found money, and drove away again. When he left after killing his mother, he locked her door behind him. Then, he took the precaution of discarding the murder weapon. Three days later, he recalled and described the events of the murder to police. His careful, calculated steps refute any claim that cocaine use interfered with his capacity to entertain the purposeful intent to kill. See <em>State v. Slagle </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 597, 603, 605 N.E.2d 916, 924; <em>State v. Hicks, supra, </em>at 74, 538 N.E.2d at 1034.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">As to the penalty phase, the trial court fully instructed the jury on sentence deliberations and to consider all of the evidence and arguments presented. The trial court need not instruct the jury to give particular weight to any specific evidence, such as Hill\u2019s cocaine use. \u201cThe fact that an item of evidence is admissible * * * does not automatically mean that it must be given any weight.\u201d <em>State v. Steffen, supra, </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus. Also, Hill did not establish that his cocaine addiction qualified as a mental disease or defect under R.C. 2929.04(B)(3). See <em>State v. Cooey, </em>46 Ohio St.3d at 41, 544 N.E.2d at 919; <em>State v. Van Hook </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 256, 262-263, 530 N.E.2d 883, 889-890.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">We also reject Hill\u2019s proposition of law No. XI, claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. Defense counsel need not make fruitless requests for jury instructions, such as those on intoxication. Thus, counsel\u2019s decision not to request such instructions reflected professional judgment not falling \u201cbelow an objective standard of reasonable representation.\u201d <em>State v. Bradley, supra, </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus. Hill also failed to demonstrate prejudice. No \u201creasonable probability\u201d exists that the result of the trial would have been different if counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>had requested such instructions. <em>State v. Bradley, </em>at paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">\n<em>Defendant\u2019s Absence During Jury-View Instructions (XII)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">In proposition No. XII, Hill argues his conviction must be reversed because he was absent when the trial judge instructed the jury immediately prior to a jury visit to the crime scene. Admittedly, Hill has a fundamental right to be present at all critical stages of his criminal trial. Section 10, Article I, Ohio Constitution; Crim.R. 43(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">However, both Hill and his counsel knew about the jury view and the court\u2019s intention to briefly instruct the jury before the view. Neither Hill nor his counsel expressed any desire to be there, and Hill specifically waived his presence at the jury view. \u201cA party will not be permitted to take advantage of an error which he himself invited or.induced.\u201d <em>Hal Artz Lincoln-Mercury, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co. </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 20, 28 OBR 83, 502 N.E.2d 590, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>State v. Seiber, </em>56 Ohio St.3d at 17, 564 N.E.2d at 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">Moreover, a trial court\u2019s <em>ex parte </em>communication with the jury is not necessarily prejudicial error. <em>State v. Williams </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 281, 286, 6 OBR 345, 349, 452 N.E.2d 1323, 1330. To establish prejudice from such <em>ex parte </em>communications, \u201cthe complaining party must first produce some evidence that a private contact, without full knowledge of the parties, occurred between the judge and jurors which involved substantive matters.\u201d <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, at paragraph thirteen of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">Hill fails to meet the tests. The parties had prior \u201cfull knowledge\u201d and agreed to the contact. Moreover, the trial court\u2019s innocuous comments involved procedures during the view, not substantive matters. Any irregularity was harmless. <em>State v. Williams, </em>6 Ohio St.3d at 286, 6 OBR at 349, 452 N.E.2d at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">\n<em>Batson Claims on State\u2019s Peremptory Challenges (XIII)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">In proposition of law No. XIII, Hill argues the prosecutor exercised two peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner. <em>Batson v. Kentucky </em>(1986), 476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69, held that the United States Constitution\u2019s Equal Protection Clause precludes \u201cpurposeful discrimination by the state in the exercise of peremptory challenges so as to exclude members of minority groups from service on petit juries.\u201d <em>State v. Hernandez </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 577, 581, 589 N.E.2d 1310, 1313.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-12\">To make a prima facie case of such purposeful discrimination, an accused must demonstrate: (a) that members of a recognized racial group were peremptorily challenged; and (b) that the \u201c \u2018facts and any other relevant circumstances raise an inference that the prosecutor\u2019 \u201d used the peremptory challenges to exclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>jurors \u201c \u2018on account of their race.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Hernandez, supra, </em>at 582, 589 N.E.2d at 1313, citing <em>Batson. </em>If the defendant makes a prima facie case of discrimination, the state must then come forward with a neutral explanation. <em>Id. </em>A trial court\u2019s finding of no discriminatory intent \u201cwill not be reversed on appeal absent a determination that it was clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 583, 589 N.E.2d at 1314, following <em>Hernandez v. New York </em>(1991), 500 U.S. 352, 111 S.Ct. 1859, 114 L.Ed.2d 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">In this case, Hill established no prima facie case at trial. The facts and circumstances raise no inference that the state improperly used peremptory challenges to exclude potential jurors based on race. The prosecutor properly challenged one African-American for cause, and did not challenge another who served on the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">However, Hill complains about the prosecutor\u2019s peremptory challenges against two other African-Americans, Robert McDaniel and Gerald Hutcherson. Yet, McDaniel, a seventy-year-old veteran, emphatically and repeatedly asserted he did not want to serve on this jury. McDaniel explained he could not handle \u201ctoo much pressure.\u201d He had fought in combat for two and one-half years during World War II in China and Burma and \u201ccaught lead four different times.\u201d Because of this, McDaniel feared \u201cflashbacks\u201d and was \u201cshell shocked\u201d and \u201cjumpy.\u201d In fact, the prosecutor challenged him for cause, but the court rejected that challenge. Then, the prosecutor excused McDaniel with a peremptory, and Hill raised no <em>Batson </em>claim. Later, Hutcherson was examined and declared he could not think of any instance where the death penalty was warranted. Hutcherson also planned to continue working second shift, until 11:00 p.m., even while serving on the jury. Hill raised the <em>Batson </em>issue only after the prosecutor excused Hutcherson.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">Additionally, the prosecution voluntarily explained, in race-neutral terms, specific reasons for its peremptory challenges even in the absence of a prima facie showing. Thus, the trial court need not have interfered with the prosecution\u2019s peremptory challenges. <em>Hernandez v. New York, supra. </em>We find no merit in Hill\u2019s proposition No. XIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">\n<em>Admission of Defendant\u2019s Pretrial Statements (XIV)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">In proposition of law No. XIV, Hill urges that his pretrial statements were secured in violation of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights. Hill argues that the principle of <em>Edwards v. Arizona </em>(1981), 451 U.S. 477, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378, should be extended. <em>Edwards </em>established a bright-line rule that once an accused, in custody, asks for a lawyer, questioning must cease until his lawyer is present. Hill wants to extend <em>Edwards, </em>so that a person in custody for one offense cannot waive counsel as to another offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>However, Hill\u2019s claims that his Fifth or Sixth Amendment rights were violated lack merit. As to his Fifth Amendment rights, neither <em>Edwards </em>nor the further holding in <em>Arizona v. Roberson </em>(1988), 486 U.S. 675, 108 S.Ct. 2093, 100 L.Ed.2d 704, is relevant. Hill never invoked his Fifth Amendment right to counsel. When police questioned Hill on March 26 about his mother\u2019s death, he had been in custody for three days on unrelated matters, <em>ie., </em>an outstanding warrant, traffic violations and possession of the crack cocaine pipe. Police did not question him about those matters. In fact, no evidence of record exists that Hill asked to consult with counsel on those matters. Nor does the record establish that Hill had court-appointed or any other counsel to represent him as to the March 23 charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Instead, Hill asks us to assume that counsel had been appointed to represent him for the March 23 charges. Yet, even such an assumption would not have ' prevented police questioning on the unrelated issue of his mother\u2019s death. <em>McNeil v. Wisconsin </em>(1991), 501 U.S. 171, 111 S.Ct. 2204, 115 L.Ed.2d 158, held that an accused\u2019s Sixth Amendment right is offense specific. Thus, under <em>McNeil, </em>appointment of counsel with respect to one offense does not bar police questioning as to a second uncharged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">In this case, police fully advised Hill of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and secured a waiver of those rights, prior to questioning Hill about his mother\u2019s death. In fact, police separately advised Hill of his rights three times before obtaining his taped confession, and Hill was not then charged with any offense relating to his mother. Hill testified he asked for a lawyer, and the police told him he did not need one. However, the police testified Hill specifically told them he did not have and did not want an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The evidence supports the trial court\u2019s decision to admit Hill\u2019s confession as lawfully, freely and voluntarily made. Further, the trial court has the responsibility to weigh the evidence and determine the credibility of witnesses even during suppression hearings. <em>State v. Fanning </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 19, 20, 1 OBR 57, 58, 437 N.E.2d 583, 584; <em>State v. DePew, </em>38 Ohio St.3d at 277, 528 N.E.2d at 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">\n<em>Appointment of Sanity Examiners (XV) '</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">In proposition of law No. XV, Hill argues he was denied his right to an impartial mental-condition examination under R.C. 2945.39 because the same examiners had already evaluated his mental competency to stand trial. Hill argues those examiners, because of their prior opinions, could be prejudiced when evaluating his mental responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">In fact, the four examiners did not all agree on their evaluations of competency. Dr. Fisher found Hill not competent, but agreed malingering was possible. Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Fuess found Hill was malingering and was competent. Dr. Schmidtgoessling recommended further evaluation. After Hill was an inpatient at a mental health facility, Dr. DeMarchis found Hill made an \u201cextremely poor and naive attempt * * * at faking mental illness,\u201d and found him competent. Hill even threw a temper tantrum, overturning tables and chairs, after he was told he was malingering. After interviewing Hill again, Dr. Schmidtgoessling decided Hill was competent and malingering.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">In view of the circumstances, we find the trial court did not err in appointing the same examiners who had evaluated competency to evaluate separately mental responsibility. R.C. 2945.371(E) specifically authorizes appointing the same examiner to evaluate competency for trial and mental condition at the time of an offense. Separate reports must be prepared, but that was done here. Moreover, the examiners\u2019 reports are professional and thorough. Appointing the same examiners makes sense in view of the complexity of myriad details involved in mental evaluations. Hill\u2019s attempts to fake mental illness had already delayed the case, and appointing new examiners would necessitate further delay. In essence, Hill wants two sets of examiners so he can get \u201ctwo bites of the apple\u201d to evade responsibility. We find no abuse of discretion in reappointing the same examiners.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Further, the trial court need not have specifically asked Hill to recommend an examiner. Hill had no constitutional right to an examiner of his own choosing. See <em>State v. Esparza </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 8, 10, 529 N.E.2d 192, 195. Also, Hill invoked no rights at trial to recommend an examiner under R.C. 2945.39(A)(3) or secure an independent expert examination under R.C. 2945.39(C). See <em>State v. Hix </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 129, 527 N.E.2d 784, syllabus. We reject proposition No. XV.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">\n<em>INDEPENDENT SENTENCE ASSESSMENT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">In proposition of law No. VIII, Hill <em>argues </em>the death sentence is unwarranted because the aggravating circumstance does not outweigh mitigating factors. R.C. 2929.05(A) requires us to review Hill\u2019s sentence independently.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">After independent assessment, we find the evidence clearly proves beyond a reasonable doubt the aggravating circumstance for which Hill was convicted, <em>i.e., </em>murder during the course of an aggravated robbery. As to mitigating factors, Hill\u2019s apparent cocaine addiction is a mitigating factor as it relates to the offense. Aside from that addiction, we find nothing else mitigating in the nature and circumstances of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">We find Hill\u2019s history, character, and background provides nothing of significant mitigating value. Evidence as to Hill\u2019s steady work record was sparse. Dr. Fuess did verify that Hill suffered from \u201cpersonality disorders.\u201d Yet, we choose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>to give these disorders little weight, even including his \u201csubstance abuse\u201d disorder. See <em>State v. Slagle, </em>65 Ohio St.3d at 614, 605 N.E.2d at 931; <em>State v. Cooey, </em>46 Ohio St.3d at 41, 544 N.E.2d at 919. Hill also said he loved his mother and cared for his child, and the psychological evaluations confirm Hill was deeply depressed for killing her. We find nothing else about his history or background to be mitigating. Nothing in his character appears mitigating.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">No evidence at trial supports applying any of the statutory mitigating factors in R.C. 2929.04(B)(1) through (6). Despite Dr. Fridman\u2019s testimony, Hill did not establish that his personality or conduct disorders were a \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d under (B)(3). Cf. <em>State v. Seiber, </em>56 Ohio St.3d at 8, 564 N.E.2d at 415. As to \u201cother factors\u201d in R.C. 2929.04(B)(7), Hill\u2019s cooperation with police is a relevant mitigating factor entitled to slight weight. After initial denials, Hill admitted responsibility when faced with strong proof of his involvement. We find no expressions of remorse in Hill\u2019s statement worthy of any mitigating weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The aggravating circumstance strongly outweighs the slight mitigation present in this case beyond a reasonable doubt. Aside from Hill\u2019s cocaine addiction and cooperation with police, no mitigating factors of any consequence exist. At best, those two factors are entitled to only very little weight. In contrast, the facts of the aggravating circumstance are horrendous. When weighed against that circumstance, the mitigating factors and evidence pale into insignificance. Hill brutally robbed and murdered his own mother, an elderly, partially paralyzed woman, in her own bedroom, and then left her to die alone. She had done nothing to provoke or contribute to this vicious assault. No merit is found in proposition No. VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">The death penalty in this case is both appropriate and proportionate when compared with the penalty imposed in similar cases of felony murder. See <em>State v. Woodard </em>(1993), 68 Ohio St.3d 70, 623 N.E.2d 75; <em>State v. Lewis, </em>67 Ohio St.3d 200, 616 N.E.2d 921; <em>State v. Green </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 141, 609 N.E.2d 1253; <em>State v. Mills </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 357, 582 N.E.2d 972, including cases cited at 62 Ohio St.3d at 377, 582 N.E.2d at 989.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b558-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, F.E. Sweeney and Cook, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b558-10\">Wright and Pfeifer, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b558-11\">Wright, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A1J\">dissenting. I respectfully dissent from the opinion of the majority because I believe that the sentence of death is inappropriate, given the particular facts of this case. Although this court has upheld death sentences based upon a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>similar aggravating circumstance, I feel that this case has an entirely different character.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">Hill did not commit murder with prior calculation and design. The record reflects that Hill simply snapped due to his drug-induced state prior to the offense. He had been up all night smoking crack cocaine. He smoked crack cocaine in his mother\u2019s basement immediately before speaking with her the morning of the murder. After receiving twenty dollars from his mother, he bought and smoked more crack cocaine. Hill testified under oath that when he returned to his mother\u2019s house, he remembers speaking with her and the next thing he knew, she was on the floor. Hill testified that he did not remember stabbing his mother and told his brother that he did not mean to kill her. The state does not dispute this as part of Hill\u2019s confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Dr. Fridman, a licensed clinical psychologist, spoke on Hill\u2019s behalf during the mitigation phase. Dr. Fridman testified concerning a condition known as \u201ccocaine psychosis\u201d that develops during heavy use of cocaine. Dr. Fridman stated that this condition is characterized by mental confusion, irrational behavior, a paranoid state, irritability, rapid changes in perception, release of inhibition, and panic reactions. Dr. Fridman also testified that when cocaine is no longer available, the addict goes through a period known as \u201cabstinence syndrome.\u201d Dr. Fridman stated that during this period, the addict is \u201coften capable of behaving and doing anything to get their drug, behaving in very irrational ways. They can certainly be violent, aggressive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">With regard to Hill\u2019s use of crack cocaine, Dr. Fridman opined that Hill\u2019s addiction would be classified as \u201cchronic, long-term cocaine addiction,\u201d and that Hill \u201cwas an addict [and] had been an addict for some time.\u201d When asked whether Hill\u2019s actions on the night of the murder had any connection with the murder, Dr. Fridman testified that \u201ca crack addict who has just binged on a lot of crack, has an abstinence syndrome and his behavior at that time can be directed by his need, his overwhelming intense need for more of the drug, for more crack.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">It is undisputed that the offense occurred in large part as a result of Hill\u2019s drug use and dependency. In light of the foregoing, I question whether Hill was able to form the purposeful intent to kill and believe that his chronic addiction should be viewed as a significant factor in determining punishment in the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">By stating that Hill\u2019s drug use played a significant role in the murder of his mother, I am not advocating the proposition that drug use, standing alone, should be viewed as a substantial mitigating factor. I simply believe that under the particular circumstances of this case, Hill\u2019s drug use is \u201crelevant to the issue of whether the offender should be sentenced to death.\u201d R.C. 2929.04(B)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Hill cannot and should not be excused from punishment for his crime. The law of this state demands that a heavy penalty be imposed for the taking of a life. However, I cannot join in the decision of the majority to sentence Hill to death. For the foregoing reasons, I would uphold Hill\u2019s convictions, vacate his death sentence, and remand the case to the trial court for resentencing pursuant to R.C. 2929.06.</p>\n<judges id=\"b560-5\">Pfeifer, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
