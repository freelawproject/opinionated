S.Ct.Prac.R. XVTII(5) provides that the moving party shall be referred to as the petitioner and the party adverse to the petitioner shall be referred to as the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">In this court\u2019s order of June 28, 1995, setting forth the date for the filing of petitioners\u2019 brief, the caption of the entry incorrectly identified Janette Coleman et al. as petitioners.

It is further ordered that, in lieu of filing a new brief, respondents may file a notice of adoption of the brief filed on July 28,1995, as their answer brief, and, if desired, a supplemental answer brief, so long as the original brief and supplemental brief combined do not exceed fifty pages. The parties shall otherwise comply with the provisions of S.Ct.Prac.R. XVIII(7).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
