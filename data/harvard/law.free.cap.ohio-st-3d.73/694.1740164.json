On the first issue, we find that appellate courts may reverse a board decision if it is unlawful, unreasonable or against the manifest weight of the evidence. On the second issue, we find that fault is required for a termination to be made with just cause. Finally, unsuitability for a position constitutes fault sufficient to support a just cause termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b806-10\">In <em>Irvine v. Unemp. Comp. Bd. of Review </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 15, 17-18, 19 OBR 12, 15, 482 N.E.2d 587, 590, this court held that reviewing courts may reverse \u201cjust cause\u201d determinations \u201cif they are unlawful, unreasonable, or against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d This court noted that while appellate courts are not permitted to make factual findings or to determine the credibility of witnesses, they do have the duty to determine whether the board\u2019s decision is supported by the evidence in the record. <em>Id. </em>at 18, 19 OBR at 15, 482 N.E.2d at 590. This duty is shared by all reviewing courts, from the first level of review in the common pleas court, through the final appeal in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-11\">Former R.C. 4141.28(0), now renumbered R.C. 4141.28(0)(1), the statute setting forth the appeals process for unemployment compensation cases, does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>create distinctions between the scope of review of common pleas courts and appellate courts. To apply the same standard at each appellate level does not result in a <em>de novo </em>review standard. As this court stated in <em>Irvine, </em>\u201c[t]he fact that reasonable minds might reach different conclusions is not a basis for the reversal of the board\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Irvine </em>at 18, 19 OBR at 15, 482 N.E.2d at 590. The board\u2019s role as factfinder is intact; a reviewing court may reverse the board\u2019s determination only if it is unlawful, unreasonable, or against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">To be eligible for unemployment compensation benefits in Ohio, claimants must satisfy the criteria established pursuant to R.C. 4141.29(D)(2)(a), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-6\">\u201c(D) * * * [No] individual 'may * * * be paid benefits * * *:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-7\">\u00ab \u2021 \u2021 \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-8\">\u201c(2) For the duration of his unemployment if the administrator finds that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-9\">\u201c(a) He quit his work without just cause or has been discharged for just cause in connection with his work * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">In <em>Irvine, supra, </em>this court stated that \u201c \u2018[traditionally, just cause, in the statutory sense, is that which, to an ordinarily intelligent person, is a justifiable reason for doing or not doing a particular act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Irvine </em>at 17, 19 OBR at 14, 482 N.E.2d at 589, citing <em>Peyton v. Sun T.V. </em>(1975), 44 Ohio App.2d 10, 12, 73 O.O.2d 8, 9, 335 N.E.2d 751, 752. Just cause determinations in the unemployment compensation context, however, also must be consistent with the legislative purpose underlying the Unemployment Compensation Act. The Act exists \u201c \u2018to enable unfortunate employees, who become and remain <em>involuntarily </em>unemployed by adverse business and industrial conditions, to subsist on a reasonably decent level and is in keeping with the humanitarian and enlightened concepts of this modem day.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Irvine </em>at 17, 19 OBR at 14, 482 N.E.2d at 589, citing <em>Leach v. Republic Steel Corp. </em>(1964), 176 Ohio St. 221, 223, 27 O.O.2d 122, 123, 199 N.E.2d 3, 5. \u201c \u2018The [A]ct was intended to provide financial assistance to an individual who had worked, was able and willing to work, but was temporarily without employment through no fault or agreement of his own.\u2019 \u201d <em>Irvine </em>at 17, 19 OBR at 14, 482 N.E.2d at 589, citing <em>Salzl v. Gibson Greeting Cards </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 35, 39, 15 O.O.3d 49, 52, 399 N.E.2d 76, 79. Thus, while a termination based upon an employer\u2019s economic necessity may be <em>justifiable, </em>it is not a <em>just cause </em>termination when viewed through the lens of the legislative purpose of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-12\">The Act does not exist to protect employees from themselves, but to protect them from economic forces over which they have no control. When an employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>is at fault, he is no longer the victim of fortune\u2019s whims, but is instead directly responsible for his own predicament. Fault on the employee\u2019s part separates him from the Act\u2019s intent and the Act\u2019s protection. Thus, fault is essential to the unique chemistry of a just cause termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">While this court did hold in <em>Irvine </em>that \u201c[t]he determination of whether just cause exists necessarily depends upon the unique factual considerations of the particular case,\u201d <em>Irvine </em>at 17, 19 OBR at 15, 482 N.E.2d at 590, that does not compel the appellate court\u2019s abandonment of fault-based just cause analysis in favor of a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d examination. Instead, <em>Irvine </em>recognizes that the question of fault cannot be rigidly defined, but, rather, can only be evaluated upon consideration of the particular facts of each case. If an employer has been reasonable in finding fault on behalf of an employee, then the employer may terminate the employee with just cause. Fault on behalf of the employee remains an essential component of a just cause termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">In this case, the question is whether Hammad\u2019s unsuitability to perform the work required by the firm constituted fault for which the firm may have discharged her for just cause. The common pleas court held that an employee satisfies the fault requirement only upon a \u201cwillfid or heedless disregard of duty or violation of [employer] instructions.\u201d To rule that way is to ignore that <em>ability </em>is relevant in the workplace. There is little practical difference between an employee who <em>will not </em>perform her job correctly and one who <em>cannot </em>perform her job correctly. In either case, the performance of the employee is deficient. That deficiency, which does not result from any outside economic factor, constitutes fault on the employee\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">To find that an employee is entitled to unemployment compensation when she is terminated for her inability to perform the job for which she was hired would discourage employers from taking a chance on an unproven worker. Most employees need an employer to take a leap of faith when initially hiring them. An employer relies upon an employee\u2019s representations that she can adequately perform the required work. Likewise, an employee relies upon an employer\u2019s description of what the job will entail. The party that fails to live up to those expectations is at fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">Unsuitability for a position constitutes fault sufficient to support a just cause termination. An employer may properly find an employee unsuitable for the required work, and thus to be at fault, when: (1) the employee does not perform the required work, (2) the employer made known its expectations of the employee at the time of hiring, (3) the expectations were reasonable, and (4) the require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>ments of the job did not change since the date of the original hiring for that particular position.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">In this case, there is no dispute that Hammad continually made serious typing and proofreading errors requiring duplicative efforts by her and by attorneys at the firm. At every level in this case, Hammad was found to be unsuitable for the required work. The record establishes that the firm made reasonable efforts to avoid terminating Hammad, including verbal reprimands and warnings that she would be discharged unless her performance improved. Second, Hammad never claimed that she was unaware of the requirements of her job or of the demanding performance expected of her as a normal part of her employment. Third, testimony at the board hearing shows that a word processor hired at the same time as Hammad had fulfilled the firm\u2019s expectations and continued to be employed by the firm, demonstrating the reasonableness of the job\u2019s requirements. Finally, Hammad was not the victim of downsizing at the firm, nor was her original job description changed to a position different from the one she originally accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">That Hammad wished to perform better cannot obviate the plain fact that she could not fulfill the minimum standards the firm required of her. She was simply terminated because she could not do the required work. While that may not be her fault in a moral sense, it does constitute fault in a legal sense sufficient for her termination to have been made with just cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b809-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick and F.E.
