Sweeney, Sr., J.</author>\n<p id=\"AhRv\">Burke raises twenty-one propositions of law which we have fully reviewed and considered. (See Appendix.) However, in light of our recent decisions, we do not address each one in opinion form. See <em>State v. Poindexter </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 1, 3, 520 N.E.2d 568, 570; <em>State v. Scudder </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 263, 643 N.E.2d 524; <em>State v. Simko </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 483, 487, 644 N.E.2d 345, 350. We have also independently assessed the evidence relating to the death sentence, independently balanced the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors, and reviewed the proportionality of the sentence to sentences imposed in similar cases. We hereby affirm the convictions and sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b512-13\">GUILT PHASE</p>\n<p id=\"AVPJ\">Statements by Accomplice</p>\n<p id=\"b512-14\">In the second proposition of law, appellant contends that the trial court erred in disallowing relevant hearsay statements made by Tanner concerning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>murder. According to appellant, these statements were admissible under Evid.R. 804(B)(3) as declarations against penal interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">In order for Evid.R. 804 hearsay exceptions to apply, the declarant must be deemed unavailable. Although Tanner invoked his right against self-incrimination at the sentencing hearing, Tanner was not called as a witness during the guilt phase and cannot be said to have been unavailable during that phase. Thus, Tanner\u2019s statements were properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>State v. Landrum </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 107, 113, 559 N.E.2d 710, 719, is misplaced, since in that case the witness was deemed unavailable at the sentencing hearing because at that hearing he invoked his privilege against self-incrimination. Further, even in <em>Landrum, supra, </em>at 115, 559 N.E.2d at 721, where this court found that the exclusion of hearsay statements was erroneous, we did not find it prejudicial error in view of our independent assessment and reweighing of the evidence. Appellant\u2019s second proposition of law is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Confrontation Rights</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">In the fourth proposition of law, appellant argues that he was denied his right to due process under <em>Brady v. Maryland </em>(1963), 373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 1196-1197, 10 L.Ed.2d 215, 218, and was denied his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation as a result of the police losing the tape recorded statement of state witness Janaia Prysock.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">In <em>Arizona v. Youngblood </em>(1988), 488 U.S. 51, 58, 109 S.Ct. 333, 337, 102 L.Ed.2d 281, 289, the United States Supreme Court stressed that \u201cunless a criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of the police, failure to preserve potentially useful evidence does not constitute a denial of due process of law.\u201d Appellant fails to show bad faith on the part of police. Since there is no evidence that the police deliberately lost, concealed or destroyed the tape, appellant\u2019s due process rights were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">Further, the state produced a summary of the interview and Prysock testified at trial. Thus, appellant had the opportunity \u201cto be confronted with the witnesses against him\u201d as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. In fact, defense counsel took advantage of this right by questioning this witness as to any inconsistencies between the summary and her testimony on direct examination. For these reasons, appellant\u2019s fourth proposition of law is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-11\">Manifest Weight of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b513-12\">In the fifth proposition of law, appellant contends that the guilty verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence. Appellant argues that the evidence does not demonstrate that the victim died directly from stab wounds, and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>further, since there was no evidence to prove specific intent or purpose to kill, the killing constitutes involuntary manslaughter, not aggravated murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">However, there was testimony that McBride died as a result of being stabbed. The deputy coroner clearly stated that the victim\u2019s death was caused by an irregular beating of the heart as a result of all of the stab wounds to his body. Thus, the twelve stab wounds suffered by the victim collectively resulted in his heart failure and death.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">We likewise reject appellant\u2019s contention that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that he acted with a purpose to kill. Intent need not be proven by direct testimony. <em>State v. Lott </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 168, 555 N.E.2d 293, 302. Instead, an intent to kill \u201cmay be deduced from the surrounding circumstances, including the instrument used, its tendency to destroy life if designed for that purpose, and the manner of inflicting the wound.\u201d <em>State v. Robinson </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 213, 218-219, 53 O.O. 96, 99, 118 N.E.2d 517, 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">In this case, there was evidence that the victim was stabbed twelve times and five of the wounds showed evidence of healing consistent with someone prodding the victim with a knife an hour before the last wounds were inflicted. There was also direct testimony by state witnesses that appellant\u2019s hands and clothing were covered with blood as he left the victim\u2019s house. Although appellant testified that he and Tanner were at McBride\u2019s house for only ten or twenty minutes, the ransacking of the house suggests otherwise. Also, appellant\u2019s contention that McBride was stabbed only outside the house, by Tanner, is contrary to the deputy coroner\u2019s testimony concerning the healing wounds found on the victim\u2019s body. Obviously, the trier of fact weighed this conflicting evidence and assessed the credibility of witnesses in finding appellant guilty as charged. <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212, paragraph one of the syllabus. We believe there was sufficient evidence presented on which to convict appellant of aggravated murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Effective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">In the twentieth proposition of law, appellant cites ten instances of alleged ineffective assistance of counsel during the guilt phase. In the sixth proposition of law, appellant claims that defense counsel\u2019s waiver of closing argument at the mitigation phase also constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">Reversal of a conviction on the grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel \u201crequires that the defendant show, first, that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and, second, that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense so as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, paragraph two of the syllabus. None of the instances raised by appellant demonstrates prejudice or that defense counsel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>performance was so deficient that there is a reasonable probability that if it were not for these errors, the result would have been different. <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">As to defense counsel\u2019s waiver of closing argument at the mitigation hearing, we find that this may have simply been a tactical decision made by defense counsel to prevent the state from splitting closing argument and staging a strong rebuttal. (See <em>State v. Apanovitch </em>[1987], 33 Ohio St.3d 19, 24-25, 514 N.E.2d 394, 400-401.) We do not find that appellant has proven his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Consequently, we reject appellant\u2019s sixth and twentieth propositions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">In the seventh and ninth propositions of law, appellant contends that the trial court erred in failing to delete \u201cprior calculation and design\u201d from the specification language contained in R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) in its instructions to the jury at both the guilt and sentencing phases, and in relying on prior calculation and design in sentencing. Although it is improper for a jury to consider prior calculation and design and principal offender status as separate aggravating circumstances <em>(State v. Penix </em>[1987], 32 Ohio St.3d 369, 513 N.E.2d 744), we have recently held that a trial court may instruct the jury on prior calculation and design and principal offender status disjunctively in the same specification, as the court did here. <em>State v. Cook </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 516, 527, 605 N.E.2d 70, 82-83. However, the court erred in not instructing the jurors that they must be unanimous in agreeing on which of the alternatives Burke was guilty of. <em>State v. Johnson </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 96, 104-105, 545 N.E.2d 636, 644-645. We find the error harmless, since the guilty verdict on Count One of the indictment already showed unanimous agreement that Burke committed the murder with prior calculation and design.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Nor do we find error in the court\u2019s charge on voluntary manslaughter, as appellant contends in the eighteenth proposition of law. Since there was no evidence that the victim provoked appellant, the court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on provocation. See <em>State v. Lawrence </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 24, 26, 541 N.E.2d 451, 454. Further, defense counsel failed to object to these instructions. Consequently, we overrule these propositions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">Voluntariness of Police Interview</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">In his twelfth proposition of law, appellant contends that his videotaped statement to police was involuntary and that the trial court erred in admitting this tape into evidence and in allowing it to be played for rebuttal purposes to the jury-</p>\n<p id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>Defense counsel has waived all but plain error by failing to object to the admissibility of the tape. <em>State v. Williams </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St.2d 112, 117, 5 O.O.3d 98, 101, 364 N.E.2d 1364, 1367. Although the tape reveals that police failed to advise appellant of one of the consequences of waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights (specifically, that his statements could be used against him in a court of law), the admission of the tape was harmless and did not affect the outcome of the trial. <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Nor was appellant coerced into making a statement to police. While police made some false statements to appellant during the interrogation, this does not necessarily make his statements involuntary. <em>State v. Cooey </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 20, 27, 544 N.E.2d 895, 906-907. In fact, we find that despite these misrepresentations, \u201cdefendant\u2019s will to resist was not overborne by threats or improper inducements.\u201d <em>State v. Melchior </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 15, 25,10 O.O.3d 8,14, 381 N.E.2d 195, 202. Moreover, the trial judge specifically cautioned the jury that the videotape contained statements that were not testified to by any witness in the case and that it was only to be considered for the limited purpose of determining appellant\u2019s credibility. Appellant\u2019s twelfth proposition of law is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">PENALTY PHASE</p>\n<p id=\"AOTi\">Recorded Statement of Tanner</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">In the third proposition of law, appellant argues that the trial court committed prejudicial error by refusing to admit into evidence Tanner\u2019s videotaped interview with police. He also contends that this ruling prevented him from using the expertise of psychologist Dr. Reardon, who would have testified as to the meaning of Tanner\u2019s body language during the interrogation. We find appellant\u2019s arguments unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">The trial judge carefully listened to both sides on this issue before ruling that the videotape of Tanner was inadmissible. The tape reveals that Tanner agreed to answer questions concerning events that occurred earlier in the evening. However, he invoked his right to remain silent when questioned about the actual murder. Since the silence of a defendant is ambiguous and not probative of guilt (see <em>Doyle v. Ohio </em>[1976], 426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91; <em>State v. Combs </em>[1991], 62 Ohio St.3d 278, 281, 581 N.E.2d 1071, 1075-1076), the trial court did not abuse its discretion and appellant was not prejudiced by the exclusion of this videotape.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">For these reasons, we reject the third proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Postponement of Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">In the fifteenth proposition of law, appellant contends that he was denied his constitutional and statutory right to effective proportionality review by the court\u2019s refusal to postpone sentencing until the conclusion of Tanner\u2019s trial. Appellant submits that the trial court\u2019s action prejudiced him, since Tanner received only a life sentence for McBride\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">We have held previously that the disparity of sentence between accomplices does not justify reversal of a death sentence, where the sentence is neither illegal nor an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Green </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 141, 151, 609 N.E.2d 1253, 1261. We reject appellant\u2019s argument, since there is no showing that Burke\u2019s death sentence was either illegal or an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Further, we note that \u201ctrial courts have broad discretion to decide whether to grant a continuance.\u201d State <em>v. Powell </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 255, 259, 552 N.E.2d 191,196. Here, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to postpone sentencing until after Tanner\u2019s trial. See <em>State v. Unger </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 65, 67, 21 O.O.3d 41, 43, 423 N.E.2d 1078, 1080.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Appellant\u2019s fifteenth proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT OF SENTENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">As required by R.C. 2929.05(A), we now independently review the death penalty sentence to determine whether the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors and whether the sentence is appropriate and proportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-11\">After independent assessment, we find that the evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt the aggravating circumstances appellant was found guilty of: (1) that the murder was committed for the purpose of escaping detection, apprehension, trial or punishment for another offense committed (aggravated robbery) (R.C. 2929.04[A][3]); and (2) that appellant was either the principal offender or committed the aggravated murder with prior calculation and design (R.C. 2929.04[A][7]). Prior calculation and design was proven by the fact that the victim was brutally stabbed twelve times and that five of the stab wounds showed evidence of healing, consistent with a prodding of the knife into the victim at least an hour before the final wounds were inflicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-12\">We further find that the nature and circumstances of the offense provide no mitigating features. This was simply a cold-blooded murder of a seventy-two-year-old widower who unfortunately knew appellant well enough and trusted him to invite him into his home late at night. In their hunt for a gun, appellant and Tanner stabbed the victim twelve times and ransacked McBride\u2019s entire house. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>The two men were later overheard making light of the situation to family members by singing a song about going to Lucasville. Thus, under these circumstances, there is no evidence of mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Further, while appellant\u2019s \u201chistory, character, and background\u201d provide some mitigating value, we do not find it to be significant. Appellant\u2019s mother, who was an alcoholic, deserted the family when he was young. There was also evidence that because appellant\u2019s father and grandparents worked, he and his siblings were often left alone and were described as having raised themselves. Appellant also missed a great deal of school. Further, appellant was stabbed through the arm by his brother as a teenager. However, despite this negative family history, appellant was described by the minister who baptized him in 1988 as a \u201cgentle spirit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">As to the statutory mitigating factors, those factors listed under R.C. 2929.04(B)(1), (2), (4) and (5) have little or no weight. There was no evidence that the victim induced his attack. We further find that appellant was under no duress, coercion or provocation. Nor was his age of twenty-eight of any consequence. Finally, R.C. 2929.04(B)(5) has little applicability, since appellant had two prior theft convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">R.C. 2929.04(B)(3) deserves some weight since appellant\u2019s I.Q. score placed him within the \u201cborderline mentally retarded range of functioning loss.\u201d Nevertheless, Dr. Reardon, appellant\u2019s own expert witness, testified that appellant knew that he should not have gone to McBride\u2019s house the night of the murder and felt responsible for the death. Under these circumstances, we do not believe appellant lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">As to R.C. 2929.04(B)(6), the evidence is inconclusive as to who was the principal offender. Despite appellant\u2019s attempts to show that Tanner was solely responsible for the victim\u2019s death, his version of what occurred the night of the murder does not square with the evidence presented. Thus, appellant has not proven this factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">Under R.C. 2929.04(B)(7), the catchall category, we consider the testimony that appellant suffered from a \u201cborderline personality disorder.\u201d <em>State v. Davis </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 44, 51, 584 N.E.2d 1192, 1198. However, since it does not rise to the level of a \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d under R.C. 2929.04(B)(3) (see <em>State v. Seiber </em>[1990], 56 Ohio St.3d 4, 9, 564 N.E.2d 408, 415), and since we believe appellant knew right from wrong, this is entitled to little weight. See <em>State v. Hill </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 313, 335, 595 N.E.2d 884, 901. Nor should residual doubt be given any weight. The evidence clearly shows that appellant intended to kill McBride and that he was responsible for the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>In considering the manner in which the victim was repeatedly stabbed, the relationship between the victim and appellant as well as the fact that the victim was robbed of his property, we find that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Finally, we conclude that the death penalty imposed in this case is neither excessive nor disproportionate to other similar capital cases involving murder combined with aggravated theft offenses. See <em>State v. Green </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 141, 151, 609 N.E.2d 1253, 1261; <em>State v. Wiles </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 71, 571 N.E.2d 97; <em>State v. Lott </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 555 N.E.2d 293. The fact that Tanner was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment does not warrant reversal, since Burke\u2019s sentence was neither illegal nor an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Jamison </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 182, 191, 552 N.E.2d 180, 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we affirm the conviction and sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b519-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Wright, Resnick, Pfeifer and Cook, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">\u201cProposition of Law No. I[:] Prejudicial error occurs at the mitigation phase of the trial when the trial court refuses a request from the accused for an instruction on residual doubt and restricts defense counsel in commenting on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-12\">\u201cProposition of Law II[:] Prejudicial error occurs when the trial court refuses to allow relevant statements by the co-defendant into evidence during the first phase of the trial, when such statements are admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-13\">\u201cProposition of Law III[:] Prejudicial error occurs when the trial court refuses to permit the introduction of a previous recorded statement of the co-defendant at the mitigation phase of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-14\">\u201cProposition of Law IV[:] The accused is denied his right to confrontation contra the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution when a tape recording of a crucial witness is \u2018lost\u2019 by the police, and said tape would assist the finder of fact in its determination regarding residual doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-15\">\u201cProposition of Law V[:] Where the evidence demonstrates that the decedent did not die from stab wounds, the verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-16\">\u201cProposition of Law VI[:] The conduct of defense counsel during the conclusion of the penalty phase of the trial violated the appellant\u2019s right to effective assistance of counsel under the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>ments to the United States Constitution and Article I, Sections 9 and 10, of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">\u201cProposition of Law YII[:] The trial court committed prejudicial error in refusing to narrow the subgrouping in R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) by failing to delete \u2018prior calculation and design\u2019 from the specification, thereby denying the accused a fair trial contra the Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution and Article I, Section 10, of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">\u201cProposition of Law VTII[:] Prosecutorial misconduct during the penalty phase of the closing arguments denied the accused a proper hearing in violation of the Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article I, Sections 9 and 16, of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">\u201cProposition of Law IX[:] The trial court commits prejudicial error in considering improper aggravating circumstances in its written decision, thus denying the accused his Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">\u201cProposition of Law X[:] A.

B.
