Cf. <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Clark </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 145, 642 N.E.2d 611 (attorney\u2019s license suspended for two years, with one year suspended, for drafting vulnerable client\u2019s will to benefit himself or his family; for distributing funds in the client\u2019s personal or trust accounts as \u201cgifts\u201d or \u201cloans\u201d to himself, his sons and his law firm; and for losing the client\u2019s funds in a high-risk investment); <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Slavens </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 162, 586 N.E.2d 92 (attorney\u2019s license indefinitely suspended for drafting unrelated and vulnerable client\u2019s will to benefit himself and his family and for giving himself \u201cgifts\u201d that were not disclosed on gift tax returns or to the client\u2019s accountant, or to his co-executor after the client\u2019s death). But, see, <em>Mahoning Cty. Bar Assn. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number><em>Theofilos </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 43, 521 N.E.2d 797 (attorney\u2019s license suspended for one year due to his preparation of unrelated client\u2019s will in which he and his son were named as sole beneficiaries, and for being named in survivorship capacity on client\u2019s joint and survivorship bank accounts). We, therefore, publicly reprimand Joseph Patrick Sheehy for having violated DR 5-101(A).
