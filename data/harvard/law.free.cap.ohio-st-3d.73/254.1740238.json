Miami Valley Maintenance [Contrs., Inc.] </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 228, 551 N.E.2d 981, public-policy exception to the employment-at-will doctrine within the specific context of whistleblowing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">We are unable to reach the certified questions in this case for the simple reason that those questions were improperly certified. We say this because Haynes is a member of a union and not an employee at will. Thus, she cannot bring a <em>Greeley </em>cause of action. See <em>Greeley, supra, </em>paragraph two of the syllabus. The fact that she cannot bring a <em>Greeley </em>cause of action, of course, makes moot the question of whether R.C. 4113.52 provides the exclusive remedy for whistleblowers.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-13\">In <em>Greeley, </em>an employer allegedly had fired an at-will employee solely because of a court-ordered child support wage assignment of the employee\u2019s wages. Pursuant to R.C. 3113.213(D), which prohibits an employer from using an order to withhold personal earnings as a basis for discharging an employee, the employee sued the employer for his wrongful discharge. Stressing that R.C. 3113.213(D) merely imposes a modest fine against an employer who violates the statute and fails to provide a remedy for the aggrieved employee, this court held that the employee stated a cause of action in tort for wrongful discharge. <em>Id., </em>49 Ohio St.3d. at 233, 235, 551 N.E.2d at 986, 987. We reasoned that the absence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>a civil remedy for violations of R.C. 3113.213(D) would frustrate the policy and purposes of child support enforcement and that it was \u201cour job to enforce, not frustrate, that policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 233-234, 551 N.E.2d at 986. Within this context, we held that \u201c[p]ublic policy warrants an exception to the employment-at-will doctrine when an employee is discharged or disciplined for a reason which is prohibited by statute.\u201d <em>Id., </em>paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\"><em>Greeley </em>provides an exception to the <em>employment-at-will </em>doctrine. Thus, as stated above, in order for an employee to bring a cause of action pursuant to <em>Greeley, supra, </em>that employee must have been an employee at will. The identifying characteristic of an employment-at-will relationship is that either the employer or the employee may terminate the employment relationship for any reason which is not contrary to law. <em>Mers v. Dispatch Printing Co. </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 100, 19 OBR 261, 483 N.E.2d 150; <em>Boggs v. Avon Products, Inc. </em>(1990), 56 Ohio App.3d 67, 564 N.E.2d 1128. Haynes clearly does not qualify as an employee at will. As a member of a union, the terms of her employment relationship were governed by a collective bargaining agreement. That agreement specifically limited the power of the zoo to terminate Haynes and, as a result, took her outside the context of employment at will. Because she was not an employee at will, she is outside the class of employees for whom <em>Greeley </em>provides protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals with respect to the <em>Greeley </em>claim and enter judgment in favor of the zoo with respect to that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">\n<em>Cause dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b368-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Young, F.E.
