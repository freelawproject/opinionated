The first is whether the court of appeals erred in finding that appellees were entitled to summary judgment on Contreras\u2019s claim for violations of R.C. 4113.52, Ohio\u2019s Whistleblower Statute. The second is whether the court of appeals erred in finding that appellees were entitled to summary judgment on Contreras\u2019s cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>of action for wrongful discharge premised upon violations of public policy. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals but we decide only the first issue as our decision on the first issue moots the second issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Appellant\u2019s Statutory Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Ohio\u2019s Whistleblower Statute, R.C. 4113.52,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provides specific procedures an employee must follow to gain statutory protection as a whistleblower. R.C. 4113.52(A)(1)(a) addresses the situation where an employee in the course of his or her employment becomes aware of a violation of any state or federal statute or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>any ordinance or regulation of a political subdivision <em>that the employer has the authority to correct, </em>and the employee reasonably believes that the violation either is a criminal offense that is likely to cause an imminent risk of physical harm or a hazard to public health or safety or is a felony. Under such circumstances, R.C. 4113.52(A)(1)(a) <em>requires </em>that the employee orally notify his or her supervisor or other responsible officer of the employer of the violation <em>and </em>subsequently file with that person a written report that provides sufficient detail to identify and describe the violation. <em>If </em>these requirements have been satisfied <em>and </em>the employer does not correct the violation or make a reasonable and good faith effort to correct the violation within twenty-four hours after the oral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>notification or the receipt of the written report, <em>whichever is earlier, </em>the employee <em>may </em>then file a written report with the prosecuting authority of the county or municipal corporation where the violation occurred or with some other appropriate person specified in R.C. 4113.52(A)(1)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Clearly, the provisions of R.C. 4113.52(A)(1) contemplate that the employer shall be given the opportunity to correct the violation. The statute mandates that the employer be informed of the violation both orally and in writing. An employee who fails to provide the employer with the required oral notification and written report is not entitled to statutory protection for reporting the information to outside authorities. If the employee provides the employer with oral notification and a written report, the employee may be entitled to the protections of the whistleblower statute for reporting the information to outside authorities <em>only </em>if the employer has failed to correct the violation or make a reasonable and good faith effort to correct the violation within twenty-four hours after the oral notification or the receipt of the written report, whichever is earlier. R.C. 4113.52(A)(1)(b) contemplates that the employer will apprise the employee of its efforts to correct the violation. That provision mandates that if an employee makes a report to his or her employer under R.C. 4113.52(A)(1)(a), the employer, within twenty-four hours after the oral notification was made or the report received or by the close of business on the next regular business day, <em>whichever is later, </em>must provide written notice to the employee of any efforts the employer made to correct the alleged violation or hazard or of the absence of the alleged violation or hazard. Only after all these various procedures and requirements have been satisfied, and only if the employer has not corrected the violation or made a reasonable and good faith effort to correct the violation may the employee report the violation to outside authorities \u2014 but <em>only </em>those authorities specified in R.C. 4113.52(A)(1)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Therefore, to restate, R.C. 4113.52(A)(1) protects an employee for reporting certain information to outside authorities <em>only </em>if the following requirements have first been satisfied: (1) the employee provided the required oral notification to the employee\u2019s supervisor or other responsible officer of the employer, (2) the employee filed a written report with the supervisor or other responsible officer, and (3) the employer failed to correct the violation or to make a reasonable and good faith effort to correct the violation. Further, R.C. 4113.52(A)(1)(a) sets forth the <em>sole acceptable manner </em>in which the employee may \u201cblow the whistle\u201d to outside authorities. Specifically, the employee may file a written report that provides sufficient detail to identify and describe the violation with the proper prosecuting authority or other appropriate official or agency with regulatory</p>\n<p id=\"b359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>authority over the employer and the industry, trade or business in which the employer is engaged. An employee who fails to follow the specific requirements of the statute is not a protected whistleblower and, accordingly, may not bring a wrongful discharge action pursuant to R.C. 4113.52.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">Here, the situation encountered by Contreras was covered by the terms of R.C. 4113.52(A)(1)(a). That is, Contreras became aware in the course of his employment of an illegal inventory diversion that his employer had the authority to correct. However, Contreras did not orally notify his superior or other responsible officer of the corporation of the illegal inventory diversion before he involved outsiders to the corporation in an investigation of the criminal activity. Nor did Contreras provide the employer with a written report of the criminal activity until well after the matters had been revealed to a number of sources outside Ferro. Contreras never provided his employer with the opportunity to correct the illegal inventory diversion. Accordingly, Contreras clearly did not comply with any of the requirements of R.C. 4113.52(A)(1)(a) and, thus, may not avail himself of the protections of the Whistleblower Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Nevertheless, Contreras suggests that this case is governed by the provisions of R.C. 4113.52(A)(3), not 4113.52(A)(1)(a). However, we find that the provisions of R.C. 4113.52(A)(1)(a) are clearly applicable in the case at bar. Further, we note, in passing, that it is difficult to imagine a whistleblower fact pattern that would fall exclusively under the provisions of R.C. 4113.52(A)(3) without also involving the provisions of R.C. 4113.52(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Appellees contend that Contreras was not \u201can employee [who became] aware in the course of his employment of a violation\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 4113.52, since Contreras was the <em>recipient of information </em>(as opposed to a provider of information) concerning the illegal inventory diversion. However, we find that this distinction ignores the undisputed fact that Contreras was also in a position to be a reporter of information (and was, in fact, a reporter of information) when he reported the illegal inventory diversion to his superiors. Appellant was clearly an \u201cemployee\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 4113.52 because he performed services for the corporation for wages or other remuneration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> R.C. 4113.52 contemplates that there may be more than one protected reporter of information for any given event. Clearly, <em>each employee in the chain of command </em>who receives the information and reports it to his or her supervisor is protected from retaliatory action if the manner in which the information is reported complies with the requirements of the statute. Thus, Contreras could have been consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>ered a protected whistleblower had he complied with the terms of R.C. 4113.52(A)(1)(a) in reporting the information to his superiors.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">The court of appeals properly found that appellant did not comply with the procedures set forth in R.C. 4113.52. Specifically, the court of appeals held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-5\">\u201cAppellant\u2019s \u2018status\u2019 as a whistleblower depends on whether he followed the strict procedural steps as outlined by the statute. It is uncontroverted that appellant was informed of allegations involving felonies being committed at the Complas plant in Evansville. Upon receipt of the relevant allegations, appellant attempted to make a reasonable and good faith effort to ensure the accuracy of the information reported to him by instituting an investigation of the diversion of inventory as required by R.C. 4113.52(C). To this point, it would appear that appellant would be afforded protection under the \u201cwhistleblower\u2019 statute. However, in the course of his investigation, appellant notified outsiders [to] the corporation of the investigation, including Mr. Barrier, General Electric\u2019s general counsel, the Evansville police and the district attorney. Upon notifying these outsiders to the corporation, appellant\u2019s efforts to ensure the accuracy of the information took him outside the parameters of conduct permitted of employees in notifying the appropriate authorities. Had appellant investigated the allegations without notifying outside authorities prior to notifying his superiors, a material issue of fact may exist as to his status as a whistleblower. However, appellant\u2019s status as a whistleblower cannot be maintained as he notified outside authorities prior to notifying his superiors or other responsible corporate officers. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-8\">\u201cMoreover, appellant cannot maintain that a material issue of fact exists concerning the reasonableness of his investigation since he notified outside authorities during the course of his investigation of the relevant allegations prior to notifying his superiors. A holding to the contrary, allowing an employee to notify the appropriate authorities of an investigation to ensure the reasonableness of a report prior to notifying the employee\u2019s supervisor or other responsible corporate officer, would eviscerate the \u201cwhistleblower\u2019 statute and the clear legislative intent of requiring notification to the company before going to the appropriate authorities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">We agree with the court of appeals\u2019 conclusion that appellees were entitled to summary judgment on Contreras\u2019s statutory claim because Contreras failed to follow the requirements of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\"><em>Greeley </em>Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b360-12\">Appellant also contends that he has a common-law cause of action based upon <em>Greeley v. Miami Valley Maintenance Contrs., Inc. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 228, 551 N.E.2d 981. Given our discussion in Part I, <em>supra, </em>we find this issue to be moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>If appellant was entitled to maintain a <em>Greeley </em>claim, an issue that today we do not decide, then that claim would have to be based upon the public policy embodied in R.C. 4113.52. Since appellant did not comply with the statute in the first instance he would have no foundation for a <em>Greeley </em>claim if, in fact, he was entitled to assert such a claim. Therefore, in this case the issue is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Accordingly, we hold that in order for an employee to be afforded protection as a \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d such employee must strictly comply with the dictates of R.C. 4113.52. Failure to do so prevents the employee from claiming the protections embodied in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">The judgment of the court of appeals is, in part, affirmed. The judgment as to appellant\u2019s statutory cause of action is affirmed. The judgment of the court of appeals as to the propriety of a <em>Greeley </em>cause of action is moot and we leave judgment on this issue to another day when the issue is properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b361-10\">Moyer, C.J., Wright, Resnick and F.E.

R.C. 4113.51 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">\u201cAs used in sections 4113.51 to 4113.53 of the Revised Code:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-9\">\u201c(A) \u2018Employee\u2019 means any person who performs a service for wages or other remuneration for an employer.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b361-13\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ah3\">dissenting. I dissent from the majority decision in part because it incorrectly holds that Contreras\u2019s claim arises under R.C. 4113.52(A)(1). Instead, his claim arises under R.C. 4113.52(A)(3), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-14\">\u201cIf an <em>employee becomes aware </em>in the course of his employment <em>of a violation by a fellow employee </em>of any state or federal statute, any ordinance or regulation of a political subdivision, or any work rule or company policy of his employer and the employee reasonably believes that the violation either is a criminal offense that is likely to cause an imminent risk of physical harm to persons or a hazard to public health or safety or is a felony, the employee orally shall notify his supervisor or other responsible officer of his employer of the violation and. subsequently shall file with the supervisor or officer a written report that provides sufficient detail to identify and describe the violation.\u201d (Emphasis added.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-15\">It is obvious that R.C. 4113.52(A)(1) and (A)(3) are meant to address different situations and persons: (A)(1) contemplates an <em>employer </em>violation of law and (A)(3) involves an <em>employee </em>violation. It is just as obvious that (A)(3) governs Contreras\u2019s situation. No one has ever claimed that it was official Complas policy to steal customer property to fund employee drug abuse. The activity at issue occurred among employees acting completely outside the company\u2019s authority. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>is difficult to imagine a violation which could be more purely employee-oriented. R.C. 4112.52(A)(3) exists for a reason, and the actions of Complas employees fit squarely into the type of activity that the statute contemplates that a loyal employee might report.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The majority\u2019s suggestion that an (A)(3) situation must meet the reporting requirements of (A)(1) ignores the clear intent of the legislature to differentiate between reporting one\u2019s employer and reporting a fellow employee. The reporting requirements in (A)(3) are not as stringent as those in (A)(1) because the company itself is not the accused wrongdoer in an (A)(3) situation. The independent, illegal activities of employees, not company policy, are called into question. Requirements built in to protect the company become less necessary when the company itself is not culpable. Since Contreras fits into R.C. 4113.52(A)(3), he was not required to first notify the company before reporting his fellow employees to appropriate law enforcement officials. Had the General Assembly intended to impose such a requirement, it could have required, as it did in (A)(1), that employees wait twenty-four hours before contacting a prosecutor. However, the language of R.C. 4113.52(A)(3) is clear and unambiguous and contains no such requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">When he heard of possible illegal conduct by other employees, Contreras was bound by statute to investigate. R.C. 4113.52(B) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-7\">\u201cNo employer shall take any disciplinary or retaliatory action against an employee for making any report authorized by division (A)(3) of this section if the employee made a reasonable and good faith effort to determine the accuracy of any information so reported, or as a result of the employee\u2019s having made any inquiry or taken any other action to ensure the accuracy of any information reported under that division.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">Therefore, I would leave to the jury the question of whether Contreras was terminated for making the report or for taking actions to ensure the accuracy of the information he reported (or for going further than necessary to ensure the accuracy of the information), or for some other reason for which the statute offers no protection. The majority may not agree with the actions that Contreras took, but the protections uniquely afforded by R.C. 4113.52(A)(3) may mean something to somebody else someday. Unfortunately, the majority opinion has basically rendered those protections meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">I also dissent from the majority\u2019s holding that Contreras does not have a common-law cause of action. The issue is far from moot. Rather, even if Contreras did not meet all the statute\u2019s requirements, he still had a common-law cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">With its holding that an employee has to fall four square into the statute to receive common-law relief, the majority takes a backward leap into the world <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>created by this court in <em>Phung v. Waste Mgt., Inc. </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 100, 23 OBR 260, 491 N.E.2d 1114, which left an employee discharged for whistleblowing with no rights against his employer. The majority chooses to ignore the progress that the law has made since <em>Phung.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">In 1988, the General Assembly enacted the Whistleblower Statute, therefore enunciating the public policy against retaliatory discharges for reporting an employer\u2019s wrongdoing. In <em>Greeley v. Miami Valley Maintenance Contrs., Inc. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 228, 551 N.E.2d 981, this court found an exception to the right to terminate employment at will for \u201cany cause\u201d where the \u201cdischarge is in violation of a statute and thereby contravenes public policy.\u201d <em>Greeley, </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus. In <em>Painter v. Graley </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 377, 639 N.E.2d 51, we held that to state a claim of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy, a plaintiff is not limited to having to prove the violation of a specific statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Thus, even in cases where the statutory remedy does not apply, the question remains whether the public policy behind the statute is violated. In such cases, victims should have an opportunity to pursue civil remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">The Whistleblower Statute is the guiding light that <em>Greeley </em>instructs courts to follow in developing public-policy-based common-law exceptions to employment at will. The statute was the green light for the common law to develop in a way reflective of the public-policy concerns behind the statute. Thus, in this case, I would have allowed Contreras the opportunity to prove that the public policy behind the statute was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">I am encouraged that the majority has left open the question as to whether a person who fits within the Whistleblower Statute is limited to the recovery prescribed in the statute. The remedies that R.C. 4113.52 provides are deficient. The plum relief is reinstatement to the former position. In situations like the one at issue, the history of enmity, emotion and distrust between the parties, especially given their fiduciary relationship, makes the prospect of reinstatement unrealistic.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">Finally, I would instruct the trial court on remand to determine the applicability of the attorney-client privilege on a item-by-item basis. The attorney-client privilege is not absolute, and the societal interest in providing Contreras the right to pursue his suit may outweigh the societal interest in preserving the information shared in this particular attorney-client relationship.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
