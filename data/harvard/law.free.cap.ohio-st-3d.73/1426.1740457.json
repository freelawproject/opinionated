The court determines that a conflict exists; the parties are to brief the issue stated in the court of appeals\u2019 Decision and Entry dated June 8, 1995: \u201cThis matter comes before the court on the state\u2019s motion to certify the record in this case to the Supreme Court of Ohio as being in conflict with the decision of another appellate district. The state asserts, and we agree, that our decision in this appeal is in conflict with the decision of the Sixth District Court of Appeals in <em>State v. Lofties </em>(1991), 74 Ohio App.3d 824 [600 N.E.2d 744].</p>\n<p id=\"b896-37\">\u201cThe issue presented is whether a conviction for attempted drug abuse satisfies the statutory definition of an offense which creates a disability pursuant to R.C. 2923.13(A)(3). R.C. 2923.13(A)(3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1427\">*1427</page-number>imposes a disability upon any person who \u2018has been convicted of any offense involving illegal possession, use, sale, administration, distribution, or trafficking in any drug of abuse.\u2019 In <em>Lofties, </em>the Sixth District Court of Appeals held that a conviction for attempted drug abuse creates a disability pursuant to R.C. 2923.13(A)(3) when that section is read <em>in pari materia </em>with the statutory definitions of \u2018drug abuse offenses\u2019 in R.C. 2925.01(H)(l-4). On the other hand, we have held that attempted drug abuse, although it is a drug abuse offense, does not constitute an offense involving illegal possession or use of a drug of abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\">\u201cHaving found that a conflict exists, we certify the following question to the Supreme Court of Ohio for review and final determination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-5\">\u201cDoes a conviction for attempted drug abuse impose a disability pursuant to R.C. 2923.13(A)(3)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-6\">\u201cSO ORDERED.\u201d</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
