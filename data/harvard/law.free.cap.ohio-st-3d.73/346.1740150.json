Appellant claims that he was denied access to his trial transcript, which allegedly prevented him from discovering his appellate counsel\u2019s deficiencies in a timely manner. However, the basis of appellant\u2019s claim\u2014 counsel\u2019s failure to call certain defense witnesses to testify \u2014 does not require a transcript to be identified. See <em>State v. Bell </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 32, 652 N.E.2d 191. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the court of appeals as to the failure to show good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\"><em>Res judicata </em>may be applied to bar further litigation of issues that were raised previously or could have been raised previously in an appeal. See <em>State v. Perry </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 175, 39 O.O.2d 189, 226 N.E.2d 104. In <em>State v. Murnahan </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 60, 66, 584 N.E.2d 1204, 1209, we held that in some cases \u201ccircumstances render the application of <em>res judicata </em>unjust.\u201d In the case at bar, however, appellant has had prior opportunities to challenge the effectiveness of his appellate counsel. Furthermore, appellant provides no explanation as to why the application of <em>res judicata </em>would be unjust.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-12\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b457-13\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Wright, Resnick, F.E.
