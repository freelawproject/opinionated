An application for reopening shall be filed in the court where the appeal was decided within ninety days from journalization of the appellate judgment unless the applicant shows good cause for filing at a later time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>\u201c(2) An application for reopening shall contain all of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-5\">\u00ab $ * $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-6\">\u201c(b) A showing of good cause for untimely filing if the application is filed more than ninety days after journalization of the appellate judgment * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Because appellant\u2019s application was filed nearly three and one-half years after the decision he seeks to reopen, he must show good cause for the untimely filing. He contends he was previously denied access to a full trial transcript and that this constitutes good cause for his late filing. However, the bases of his claims\u2014 the alleged failure to prove the police-officer specification and the failure of the trial court to give the jury an accident-defense charge \u2014 do not require a transcript to be identified. Rather, they should have been evident at all stages of postconviction relief. Moreover, we note that petitioner had sufficient access to a transcript to cite it in his first <em>Mumahan </em>application. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the court of appeals as to the failure to show good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">Furthermore, we agree with the court of appeals that the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>precludes the appellant from raising these claims. In <em>Mumahan, </em>we stated that in some cases \u201ccircumstances [might] render the application of <em>res judicata </em>unjust.\u201d 63 Ohio St.3d at 66, 584 N.E.2d at 1209. This is not such a case. Before filing the <em>Mumahan </em>application on which this appeal is based, appellant filed an appeal of the court of appeals\u2019 affirmation of his conviction to this court, a motion for reconsideration in the court of appeals, a <em>Mumahan </em>application in the court of appeals, and an appeal to this court from denial of that application. On this record, he now claims it would be unjust to apply the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>to alleged omissions apparent since trial. Enough is enough. There is no injustice in applying the doctrine of res <em>judicata </em>on these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b144-11\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Wright, Resnick, F.E.
