It appears from the records of this court that appellees/cross-appellants, Ray R. Nemer and Melia Corporation, have not filed a memorandum in response/memoranda in support of their cross-appeals, due September 7,1995, in compliance with the Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court and therefore have failed to prosecute this cause with the requisite diligence. Upon consideration thereof,</p>\n<p id=\"b914-11\">IT IS ORDERED by the court that the cross-appeals be, and hereby are, dismissed, effective September 15, 1995.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
