We first determine that the court of appeals properly reviewed the trial court decision <em>de novo </em>because the interpretation of a clear and unambiguous insurance contract is a matter of law. Second, we conclude that a student who works part of the school day in an OWE program nevertheless qualifies as an \u201cemployee\u201d while at work.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">In his first proposition of law, Mercer argues that the judgment of the trial court was a factual determination rather than a legal interpretation, and that the appellate court\u2019s <em>de novo </em>review was therefore erroneous. Mercer contends that because the insurance contract failed to define \u201cemployee,\u201d the term is ambiguous and this ambiguity makes the interpretation one of fact rather than law.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">The mere absence of a definition in an insurance contract does not make the meaning of the term ambiguous. \u201cIf a contract is clear and unambiguous, then its interpretation is a matter of law and there is no issue of fact to be determined.\u201d <em>Inland Refuse Transfer Co. v. Browning-Ferris Industries of Ohio, Inc. </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 321, 322, 15 OBR 448, 449, 474 N.E.2d 271, 272. A court must give undefined words used in an insurance contract their plain and ordinary meaning. <em>Miller v. Marrocco </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 438, 439, 28 OBR 489, 491, 504 N.E.2d 67, 69. Here, the term \u201cemployee\u201d is not defined, but does have a plain and ordinary meaning. It is, therefore, unnecessary and impermissible for a court to resort to construction of that language. <em>Karabin v. State Auto. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 163, 166-167, 10 OBR 497, 499, 462 N.E.2d 403, 406. Thus, the interpretation of this insurance contract is a matter of law. Unlike determinations of fact which are given great deference, questions of law are reviewed by a court <em>de novo. Ohio Bell Tel. Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 145, 147, 593 N.E.2d 286, 287. We conclude that the court of appeals properly applied a <em>de novo </em>standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">In his second proposition of law, Mercer contends that because Donald was a full-time student in the OWE program, the policy exclusion of an \u201cemployee\u201d is inapplicable to him and Nationwide had to indemnify the farm on this claim. The policy exclusion provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\">\u201cThis insurance does not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-7\">\u201c(n) \u2018Bodily injury\u2019 sustained by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-8\">\u201c(1) Any employee (other than a \u2018residence employee\u2019) as a result of his or her employment by the \u2018insured;\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-9\">\u201c(2) Any \u2018residence employee\u2019 * * *; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-10\">\u201c(3) The spouse, child, parent, brother or sister of any employee as a consequence of \u2018bodily injury\u2019 to that \u2018employee.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">The policy defines \u201cresidence employee,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but does not define \u201cemployee.\u201d Because the insurance contract does not define \u201cemployee,\u201d this court must examine the plain and ordinary meaning of that term in conjunction with the facts to see if the exclusion encompasses Donald.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6 Ed.1990) 525, defines \u201cemployee\u201d as \u201c[a] person in the service of another * * *, where the employer has the power or right to control and direct the employee in the material details of how the work is to be performed. * * * One who works for an employer; a person working for salary or wages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-13\">The record demonstrates that between the fall of 1988 and summer of 1989, Donald worked for the farm at the wage rate of three dollars an hour. Then, in the fall of 1989, Donald\u2019s work at the farm qualified for school credit as a part of the OWE program through his high school. OWE is a program that allows students who will likely enter the job market, instead of college upon graduation, to gain work experience. Donald\u2019s participation in the program required the approval and ongoing review of both the school coordinator, Robert Hitchcock, and the farm. The farm paid Donald the same three dollars per hour wage he had been earning prior to participation in the OWE program. Hitchcock approved the plan of job duties as set by the farm. Donald generally went to work on school days after lunch and worked on weekends. The farm controlled the jobs Donald performed and directed his work, which remained essentially the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>same as it had prior to his participation in the OWE program. The farm could fire Donald at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Alternatively, the school\u2019s participation was minimal. Beyond a supervisory role that included filling out the initial paperwork, Hitchcock\u2019s role consisted of sporadic visits to the farm to evaluate the working relationship between Donald and the farm and ensure that Donald\u2019s attendance was satisfactory. The school\u2019s only controls consisted of determining whether to accept the farm as an appropriate employer or to dismiss Mercer from the program. Neither of these actions would change Donald\u2019s status at the farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Mercer\u2019s reasoning that being a student in the OWE program is mutually exclusive of being an employee lacks merit. Donald\u2019s classification as an OWE student goes to \u201cwhy\u201d he was allowed to work on the farm for school credit, rather than \u201cwhat\u201d activities he did on the farm and who controlled those activities. These undisputed facts compel a conclusion that despite Donald\u2019s dual status as a student and an employee, his student status was incidental to his primary function as that of an employee at the farm. For these reasons, Donald meets the common understanding of the term \u201cemployee\u201d as used in Nationwide\u2019s liability insurance contract, and Nationwide, therefore, is not obliged to indemnify or defend the action brought by Mercer.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b220-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Wright, Resnick, F.E.
