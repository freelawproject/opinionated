For the reasons to follow, the appellate court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-14\">In awarding permanent total disability compensation, the commission relied on the reports of Drs. Mortero, Grodner, Howard, and Holbrook. Dr. Holbrook\u2019s opinion was based not on personal examination, but upon a review of claimant\u2019s medical records. In related assertions, Dresser accuses Holbrook of: (1) consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>ering nonallowed conditions and (2) rejecting the factual findings of claimant\u2019s examining physicians. Neither contention is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">As to Dresser\u2019s first assertion, there is no express mention of claimant\u2019s preexisting psychiatric condition anywhere in Holbrook\u2019s narrative. Dresser alleges more subtle evidence of this fact, citing Holbrook\u2019s specific reference to Dr. Altman with whom \u201cthis position of permanent total impairment is shared.\u201d Because Dr. Altman has consistently based his permanent total impairment opinion, in whole or part, on claimant\u2019s pre-existing psychiatric condition, Dresser argues that Holbrook inherently considered that condition when he expressly concurred with Dr. Altman.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">We disagree. While Holbrook indeed mentioned Dr. Altman\u2019s report, he only \u201cnoted\u201d that Altman found permanent total impairment. Holbrook did not say that he based his conclusion on Altman\u2019s report. Moreover, review of the psychiatric findings cited by Dr. Holbrook reveals that almost all findings were taken from Dr. Howard\u2019s report, not Dr. Altman\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Holbrook specifically attributed permanent total impairment to \u201cthe combined effects of the allowed conditions of the industrial injury of 7-26-83.\u201d Again, there is no express reference to any nonallowed conditions. Coupled with the factors noted above, we decline to reject Holbrook\u2019s report on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">In a similar vein, Dresser contends that Dr. Holbrook did not accept the factual findings of claimant\u2019s examining physicians, thereby rendering the report fatally defective. This, too, fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">Dresser accurately recites the controlling law. Non-examining physicians must accept the factual findings of those who actually examined the claimant. <em>State ex rel. Lampkins v. Dayton Malleable, Inc. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 14, 542 N.E.2d 1105. It is apparent from Dr. Holbrook\u2019s factual recitation that the findings of other examiners were accepted. His report expressly so states.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">Dresser\u2019s real complaint appears to be with Dr. Holbrook\u2019s failure to adopt the impairment conclusions that others attached to those findings. Dresser essentially argues that Holbrook erred in assessing an impairment that exceeded the maximum industrial psychiatric impairment of thirty-five percent found by Drs. Altman and Howard. However, as <em>State ex rel. Frederick v. Galion Country Club </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 364, 365-366, 25 OBR 414, 415, 496 N.E.2d 905, 908, emphasized, \u201cthe reviewing physician must accept the <em>factual findings </em>of other examining physicians and specialists but need not be encumbered by their conclusions predicated upon such findings.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) </em>Holbrook was .therefore entitled to conclude that claimant\u2019s psychiatric symptoms indicated a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>Class III psychiatric impairment that foreclosed sustained remunerative employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b463-7\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Wright, Resnick, F.E.
