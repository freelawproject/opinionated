Comm. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 167, 173, 31 OBR 369, 374, 509 N.E.2d 946, 951, directed the commission to \u201clook at the claimant\u2019s age, education, work record, and all other factors, such as physical, psychological, and sociological that are contained within the record in making its determination of permanent total disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">Claimant has a nonallowed pre-existing condition that Dr. Howard described as a \u201cpassive aggressive personality disorder with explosive features.\u201d Claimant asserts that this condition falls within the \u201call other factors\u201d of which <em>Stephenson </em>demands consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">Claimant\u2019s position effectively nullifies the important distinction between allowed and nonallowed conditions by according the two equal consideration, the latter under the guise of \u201call other factors.\u201d Claimant\u2019s proposition also effectively permits a claimant to receive permanent total disability compensation by combining the most insignificant work injury with serious nonindustrial health problems. Being unable to ascribe either intent to <em>Stephenson, </em>we reject claimant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">Claimant also unpersuasively asserts a violation of <em>State ex rel. Noll v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 203, 567 N.E.2d 245. The citation of claimant\u2019s youth, educational attainment, and history of conservative medical care, however, is consistent with an order that we approved in <em>State ex rel. Hart v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 95, 609 N.E.2d 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b317-12\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Wright, Resnick, F.E.
