For the reasons to follow, we find that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-13\"><em>State ex rel. Zamora v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 17, 19, 543 N.E.2d 87, 89, stated that \u201cit [is] inconsistent to permit the commission to reject * * * [a] report at one level, for whatever reason, and rely on it at another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-14\">In this case, the commission expressly relied on Dr. Boutouras\u2019 report. Two elements of that narrative are relevant \u2014 his recitation of claimant\u2019s prior history and his assessment of zero-percent impairment. The latter was clearly rejected when the fifteen-percent award of permanent partial disability was made, so it could not be relied upon /later.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-15\">We recognize that the credibility of claimant\u2019s recited history does not depend on Boutouras\u2019 impairment assessment and is, thus, in a sense, severable from it. However, even if the recited-history element of the report was somehow preservable under an exception to <em>Zamora, </em>it would be insufficient to sustain the commission\u2019s decision. We are not convinced that the commission could have reached its decision without reliance upon the zero-percent impaired assessment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>that eliminated claimant\u2019s industrial injury as a potential source of claimant\u2019s renewed back problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">Finding that a crucial element of the commission\u2019s reasoning is unsupported by \u201csome evidence,\u201d the judgment of the court of appeals is hereby reversed and the writ of mandamus is allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and writ allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b674-6\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick and F.E.

Unlike the majority, I believe there is \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the Industrial Commission\u2019s decision to not reactivate relator\u2019s claim. Consequently, I dissent to the .majority\u2019s decision to reverse the court of appeals and grant a writ of mandamus in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">In deciding whether to reactivate relator\u2019s claim, the commission had before it the report of Dr. George D. Boutouras. As noted by the majority, Dr. Boutouras\u2019 report consisted of two parts. First, it recited relator\u2019s history of back problems. Second, it contained Dr. Boutouras\u2019 opinion, based upon a medical examination of relator, that relator suffered from zero percent permanent partial impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">The majority erroneously finds that based upon our decision in <em>State ex rel. Zamora v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 17, 543 N.E.2d 87, the portion of Dr. Boutouras\u2019 opinion setting forth relator\u2019s history of back problems cannot constitute \u201csome evidence\u201d in support of the commission\u2019s decision to not reactivate relator\u2019s claim. The majority reads <em>Zamora </em>broadly to stand for the proposition that if any portion of a report is rejected at one level of the commission, the commission cannot rely on any <em>other </em>portion of the report at the same or different level later in the life of the claim. However, the majority\u2019s broad interpretation excludes material in a report that is legitimately separate and distinct from the portion of the report that was previously rejected. Therefore, unlike the facts of <em>Zamora, </em>where the commission rejected a report at one level and then relied improperly on the same portion of a report at another level, it would not be inconsistent or unreasonable to allow the commission to reject a portion of the report at one level and rely on <em>another </em>portion of that report at another or the same level.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-11\">I believe this case falls within the above-mentioned exception to <em>Zamora. </em>The medical history of the relator, as set forth in Dr. Boutouras\u2019 report, is completely independent from Dr. Boutouras\u2019 opinion as to the percentage of relator\u2019s permanent partial impairment. The former is factual and the latter consists of an opinion based on Dr. Boutouras\u2019 examination of relator. As such, the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>portions of the report are independent and each may be accepted or rejected by the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The portion of Dr. Boutouras\u2019 report detailing relator\u2019s history of back problems constitutes \u201csome evidence\u201d to support the commission\u2019s decision not to reactivate relator\u2019s claim. The majority overreaches its proper role in concluding that this evidence is not sufficient because the majority is \u201cnot convinced that the commission could have reached its decision without reliance upon the zero-percent impaired assessment.\u201d Our role is limited to determining whether \u201csome evidence\u201d supports the commission\u2019s determination. <em>State ex rel. Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936, syllabus. Once \u201csome evidence\u201d is found in support of the commission\u2019s decision, which is the case here, our review should end.</p>\n<judges id=\"b675-6\">Pfeifer and Cook, JJ., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
