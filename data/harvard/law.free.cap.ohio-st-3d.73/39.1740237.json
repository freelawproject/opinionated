Appellant does not identify any specific instances of ineffective assistance. Therefore, his argument seems to be that, whenever a defendant retains counsel on appeal, he or she is entitled to a finding of ineffective counsel <em>per se </em>because there <em>must </em>have been some instances of it, and counsel was precluded from raising issues implicating his or her own effectiveness. App.R. 26(B)(5) requires reopening of an appeal \u201cif there is a genuine issue as to whether the applicant was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel on appeal.\u201d The court of appeals found no genuine issue. We concur. Appellant\u2019s theory of automatic ineffectiveness when trial counsel is retained has no merit. The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed for the reasons stated in its judgment entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b150-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Wright, Resnick, F.E.
