In <em>State ex rel. Fultz v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 327, 329, 631 N.E.2d 1057, 1059, we held that where, as here, evidence was omitted from the order\u2019s \u201cevidence considered\u201d list, the omission \u201c * * * leads to only one conclusion \u2014 the commission either inadvertently or intentionally ignored that evidence. Because these reports could be the key to the success or failure of claimant\u2019s application, the cause must be returned to the commission for further consideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">This ignored evidence is crucial for several reasons. First, there is medical evidence that claimant may be exaggerating her symptoms. There are also two years of surveillance which show that claimant participates in a very active life style with no outward problems. There is also evidence that suggests that claimant\u2019s absence from the work force is motivated by family concerns, not her injury. All this evidence is inconsistent with claimant\u2019s allegation of pain so incapacitating that she is unable to perform even sedentary work.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Second, Dr. McCloud\u2019s deposition suggests a repudiation of his earlier opinion that claimant was incapable of <em>all </em>work. <em>State ex rel. Walters v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1985), 20 Ohio St.3d 71, 20 OBR 402, 486 N.E.2d 94, held that a medical opinion which was later repudiated or equivocated upon in a later deposition was not \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting a commission decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed, and the cause is returned to the commission for further consideration and amended order.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b662-9\">Moyer, C.J., Wright, Resnick, Pfeifer and Cook, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b662-10\">Douglas and F.E.

I respectfully dissent. I would uphold the decision of the Industrial Commission and I would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals. This case is nothing more than a \u201csome evidence\u201d case and when the commission finds some evidence to grant (or deny) compensation to a claimant, then the case, as far as the courts are concerned, is over. Today\u2019s decision, I believe, changes that rule.</p>\n<judges id=\"b662-12\">F.E. Sweeney, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
