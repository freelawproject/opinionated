Sweeney, Sr., J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACi\">In a line of cases beginning with <em>State v. Poindexter </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 1, 520 N.E.2d 568, we have adopted the view that when we review death-penalty cases, we are not required to address all propositions of law in opinion form. <em>State v. Simko </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 483, 644 N.E.2d 345; <em>State v. Scudder </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 263, 643 N.E.2d 524; <em>State v. Hawkins </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 339, 612 N.E.2d 1227. Accordingly, we will not discuss the merits of many of appellant\u2019s propositions of law which have been resolved in other cases or which have not been properly preserved. However, while this opinion does not separately address each of the thirty-six propositions of law (see Appendix), we have fully reviewed the record and passed upon each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>proposition prior to reaching our decision. We have also independently assessed the evidence relating to the death sentence, balanced the aggravating circumstance against the mitigating factors, and reviewed the proportionality of the sentence to sentences imposed in similar cases. As a result, we affirm the conviction and death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">INDICTMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">In appellant\u2019s first proposition of law, he asserts that the indictment in this case did not specify a proper aggravating circumstance, without which a capital offense is not charged. Specifically, appellant argues that the error resulted in the trial court\u2019s lacking subject-matter jurisdiction over the case and, hence, also lacking the power to sentence the appellant to death. For the following reasons, we find that this argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">Initially, we note that appellant never challenged the sufficiency of the indictment at any time before or during his trial. An appellate court need not consider an error which was not called to the attention of the trial court at a time when such error could have been avoided or corrected by the trial court. <em>State v. Williams </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St.2d 112, 117, 5 O.O.3d 98, 101, 364 N.E.2d 1364, 1367. As a result, such error is waived absent plain error. <em>State v. Moreland </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 58, 62, 552 N.E.2d 894, 899. Plain error does not exist unless, but for the error, the outcome at trial would have been different. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">The grand jury issued a joint indictment against appellant and Bulerin. The indictment charged that the pair jointly and purposely caused the death of Ryan Young while committing or fleeing immediately after committing kidnapping. The indictment also contained a death-penalty specification based upon R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). The specification as stated in the indictment reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-10\">\u201cThe Grand Jurors further find and specify that the offense was committed while the offenders were committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing immediately after committing or attempting to commit kidnapping, and the offenders were principal offenders in the commission of the kidnapping in violation of the Ohio Revised Code, Section 2903.01(B) * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">In order to correspond with the statutory language of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), the last part of the specification should have indicated the offenders were the principal offenders in the commission of the aggravated murder, and not merely the kidnapping. However, while the indictment does not expressly correspond with the statutory language of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), we find that this error does not render the indictment invalid here since the record demonstrates that appellant had sufficient notice that he was being tried as a principal offender in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>commission of the aggravated murder of Ryan Young while committing kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Former Crim.R. 7(B) provided<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the indictment \u201c * * * shall contain a statement that the accused has committed some public offense therein specified. Such statement may be made in ordinary and concise language without any technical averments or any allegations not essential to be proved. It may be in the words of the applicable section of the statute as long as the words of that statute charge an offense, or in any words sufficient to give the accused notice of all the elements of the offense with which he is charged * *</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Thus, the indictment must adequately inform the defendant of the charge against him. In the present case, the indictment adequately charged appellant with the crime of aggravated murder, as it set forth the essential elements charging appellant with the offense of aggravated murder in violation of R.C. 2903.01(B). This indictment provided appellant with sufficient and adequate notice of the charge against him and the death-penalty specification alleged. Accordingly, the trial court had subject-matter jurisdiction over the appellant, as the indictment adequately charged appellant with the crime of aggravated murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The penalty for aggravated murder is life imprisonment or death. R.C. 2929.02. If the state desires to seek the death penalty for a defendant who commits aggravated murder, the indictment charging the offense must contain at least one of eight specifications enumerated in R.C. 2929.04(A)(1) through (8). R.C. 2929.04(A) provides: \u201cImposition of the death penalty is precluded, unless one or more of the following is specified in the indictment or the count of the indictment pursuant to section 2941.14 of the Revised Code and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d That section then sets out eight different aggravating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">The form of the specification is governed by R.C. 2941.14(C), which requires that the aggravating circumstance \u201cmay be stated in the words of the subdivision in which it appears, or in words sufficient to give the accused notice of the same.\u201d Thus, the language of the statute clearly provides that the specification is sufficient if the accused knows which subsection, or which aggravating circumstance of the eight listed in R.C. 2929.04(A) has been alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">While the specification in the present case contained a technical error, we cannot find that this error rendered the indictment invalid, as the correct language of the specification was clearly ascertainable to appellant. The indictment\u2019s aggravated-felony-murder count and specification recited an obvious and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>undeniable reference to R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) (the felony murder specification) as the capital specification pursuant to R.C. 2901.03(B) (aggravated-felony murder). The indictment informed appellant of all elements comprising the capital offense of aggravated murder under R.C. 2901.03(B), as the exact language of that section containing all the elements for that offense was correctly recited in the single count of the indictment. Following the count set forth in the indictment and pursuant to R.C. 2941.14, a capital specification was included, which stated verbatim the relevant language of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), except for the substitutional error in the last word of the specification. However, appellant certainly had sufficient notice from the wording of the specification that the aggravating circumstance set forth in R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) was being alleged. In fact, appellant, his attorneys, the prosecutor, and the trial judge treated the indictment as valid at all stages of the proceedings, never noticing any flaw in the indictment. Thus, the record demonstrates that the wording of the specification was sufficient to give appellant notice that the state was required to prove that he was a principal offender in the commission of the aggravated murder of Ryan Young pursuant to the specification contained in R.C. 2929.04(A)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Furthermore, appellant has not shown that he was prejudiced in the defense of his case from this substitutional error or that he would have proceeded differently had this error been corrected. Indeed, had the error been discovered, it was properly subject to amendment. Crim.R. 7(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Moreover, the jury verdict form correctly phrased the specification. The trial court read to the jury this verdict form, which contained the properly worded specification. The jury then signed each of their names to this verdict form, which correctly phrased the specification to them for the jury\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">In conclusion, we find that the flawed indictment sufficiently notified appellant of the charge against him and the death-penalty specification. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s proposition of law number one is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">GUILT PHASE</p>\n<p id=\"A_PY\">\n<em>Immunity of William Forest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">In proposition of law number two, the appellant asserts that he was denied a fair trial due to the appellee\u2019s failure to disclose exculpatory information pursuant to Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(f). Specifically, appellant argues that the trial court erred when it denied the appellant\u2019s motion for mistrial when it was discovered during trial that William Forest, a witness for the state, had been granted immunity and that the grant of immunity had not been disclosed to the defense. Appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>argues that voir dire and opening statement would have been conducted differently had the defense known of the immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(f) provides, in relevant part: \u201cUpon motion of the defendant before trial the court shall order the prosecuting attorney to disclose to counsel for the defendant all evidence, known or which may become known to the prosecuting attorney, favorable to the defendant and material either to guilt or punishment.\u201d In the present case, the state\u2019s granting immunity to Forest affected his credibility as a prosecution witness. Furthermore, Forest was a crucial witness to the prosecution\u2019s case. Thus, we agree with appellant that this information was properly discoverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Prosecutorial violations of Crim.R. 16 are reversible only when there is a showing that (1) the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose was a willful violation of the rule, (2) foreknowledge of the information would have benefited the accused in the preparation of his defense, and (3) the accused suffered some prejudicial effect. <em>State v. Parson </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 442, 445, 6 OBR 485, 488, 453 N.E.2d 689, 692. See, also, <em>State v. Moore </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 63, 66, 531 N.E.2d 691, 694-695. In the present case, there is no indication that the violation was willful. Furthermore, there is nothing in the record to indicate that had the fact of immunity or even the substance of Forest\u2019s testimony been disclosed prior to trial, the result of the proceeding would have been different. Moreover, while the evidence was not disclosed to the defense prior to trial, it was disclosed during trial. The record reflects that the trial court took many remedial measures at that time to ensure the fairness of the proceedings, including notifying the jury of the immunity upon the defense\u2019s cross-examination of Forest and, at the end of trial, admonishing the jury that the credibility of a witness to whom immunity had been granted must be examined with greater scrutiny. Thus, since there is no evidence that appellant suffered any prejudice from the initial nondisclosure of the information, proposition of law number two is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">\n<em>Sufficiency of Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Appellant was convicted of aggravated murder (R.C. 2903.01), which included a death specification for kidnapping, and was found to be the principal offender in the commission of the aggravated murder. In proposition of law number eleven, appellant contends that the conviction was based on insufficient evidence. For the following reasons, this argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">\u201cAn appellate court\u2019s function when reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction is to examine the evidence admitted at trial to determine whether such evidence, if believed, would convince the average mind of the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The record demonstrates that appellant was jealous of Ryan\u2019s relationship with Cara Wireman. In one letter to his ex-girlfriend Cara, appellant admitted that he had been secretly watching Cara and Ryan. Appellant also told Cara that he wanted her to stop seeing Ryan so that they could renew their relationship. Thus, appellant had a motive to kill the victim. On Tuesday, June 26, just prior to Ryan\u2019s abduction, the white Cutlass often driven by appellant was seen near Cara\u2019s home on Thayer Road as Ryan was about to leave. Appellant later admitted that he and Bulerin were driving around in Forest\u2019s white Cutlass on that night until about 2:30 a.m. Cara\u2019s neighbor, Rose Fetter, observed a white car with two occupants in it drive up and down Thayer Road at about 11:15 p.m. that night. Cara observed the car which matched the description of Forest\u2019s car pass her home ten to twelve times just after Ryan left. The vegetation across from Cara\u2019s home was found to be trampled down as if someone had been recently sitting in the area. Ryan\u2019s body was found buried on property owned by appellant\u2019s grandparents and on land with which appellant was familiar. The body was wrapped in Visqueen which matched Visqueen recovered from the job site at Indian Lake where appellant had been working. Forest stated that appellant had a black mask, and a black ninja mask was found under the body of the victim. Furthermore, Ryan suffered two stab wounds, either of which could have been fatal, and the knife always kept in the car was missing the morning of the disappearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Based on the above and all the other evidence in the record, we find that there was sufficient evidence adduced at trial to convince the trier of fact that appellant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the kidnapping and murder of Ryan Young and that he was the principal offender in the commission of the aggravated murder. While the evidence establishing appellant as a principal offender is circumstantial, circumstantial and direct evidence inherently possess the same probative value and, therefore, should be subject to the same standard of proof. See <em>Jenks </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus. The jury signed the verdict form containing the R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) specification that appellant was the principal offender in the commission of the aggravated murder. We will not disturb this determination, as sufficient evidence existed for a rational trier of fact to find that appellant was the principal offender, <em>ie., </em>actual killer, in the aggravated murder of Ryan Young beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>State v. Jenks, supra; State v. Green </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 141, 609 N.E.2d 1253. Accordingly, this argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>\n<em>Gruesome Photographs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">In proposition of law number twenty, appellant argues that the prosecution\u2019s introduction of a videotape of the crime scene, photographs of the crime scene, and slides of the autopsy were so gruesome and repetitive that any probative value was outweighed by unfair prejudice to the accused. This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">\u201cProperly authenticated photographs, even if gruesome, are admissible in a capital prosecution if relevant and of probative value in assisting the trier of fact to determine the issues or are illustrative to testimony and other evidence, as long as the danger of material prejudice to a defendant is outweighed by their probative value and the photographs are not repetitive or cumulative in number.\u201d <em>State v. Maurer </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 15 OBR 379, 473 N.E.2d 768, paragraph seven of the syllabus. The trial court has broad discretion in the admission of evidence and unless it has clearly abused its discretion and the defendant has been materially prejudiced thereby, an appellate court should not disturb the decision of the trial court. <em>Id. </em>at 265, 15 OBR at 401, 473 N.E.2d at 791.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">In the present case, six photographs of the crime scene were admitted into evidence, all showing different views of the body. These photographs were relevant, as they were used, in part, to corroborate the testimony of Inspector Daily concerning wounds inflicted on the victim. A videotape of the crime scene was taken, but the camera stopped working before the victim\u2019s body was unearthed. Thus, this videotape did not unduly prejudice appellant. In addition, nine autopsy slides were entered into evidence to corroborate the expert testimony of Dr. Amy Martin of the Hamilton County Coroner\u2019s Office. While some of these photos are gruesome, their probative value outweighed any danger of material prejudice to appellant. Accordingly, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">PENALTY PHASE</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">\n<em>Jury Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">In proposition of law number seven, appellant argues that the cumulative effect of alleged erroneous instructions to the jury requires reversal of the death sentence. For the following reasons, this argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-12\">First, appellant asserts that his sentence must be reversed because an imperfect specification was read to the jury at the beginning of the penalty phase. The trial court instructed the jury that the state charges in the specification that \u201c \u2018 * * * the offenders were the principal offenders in the commission of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>kidnapping.\u2019 \u201d Initially, we note that appellant did not object to this instruction at trial and, thus, it is waived absent plain error. <em>State v. Moreland, supra; </em>Crim.R. 52(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">In the present case, this error was cured, as the trial court subsequently read to the jury the correctly worded specification. The court began by stating: \u201cIt is now my duty to instruct you on the law which applies to this proceeding.\u201d The court then stated: \u201cIn the single count the aggravating circumstance is precisely set out in the specification. Completely stated, it is as follows: * * *.\u201d The trial court subsequently read the correctly worded specification to the jury. This correctly worded instruction was read immediately before the jury began its penalty deliberations. Thus, the jury was informed of the proper phrasing of the specification prior to undergoing its deliberations. Accordingly, we cannot find that the trial court\u2019s reading of the imperfect specification at the beginning of the penalty phase rises to the level of plain error, especially in light of the fact that the jury had already signed the verdict form which contained the correctly worded specification during the guilt phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Second, appellant argues that the trial court placed the burden on appellant to prove that death was not the appropriate penalty when, in its preliminary instruction, the trial court instructed: \u201c * * * the defendant will have the opportunity to offer evidence of mitigating factors to attempt to offset the affect [sic ] of the aggravating circumstance as set forth above and as found by you during the guilt determination phase.\u201d This instruction is not an incorrect statement of the law. See R.C. 2929.03(D)(2). Further, the jury was also instructed as follows: \u201c[Y]ou must determine whether the State of Ohio has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstance of which the defendant is guilty outweighs the mitigating factors.\u201d Thus, it is clear from a review of the instructions as a whole that the state of Ohio was not relieved of its burden of proof. This argument is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Third, appellant argues that the trial court improperly used the word \u201cblame\u201d when it instructed the jury that \u201c[m]itigating factors * * * may be considered by you as * * * reducing the degree of the defendant\u2019s blame.\u201d However, this argument is without merit, as use of the word \u201cblame\u201d alone did not constitute error where, as here, the jury instructions, taken as a whole, clearly indicate that the penalty phase was for punishment determination and not for assessment of culpability. See <em>State v. Lawrence </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 24, 29, 541 N.E.2d 451, 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">In conclusion, this court has reviewed all of appellant\u2019s arguments regarding erroneous jury instructions, and we have found that they do not amount to error either individually or collectively. Accordingly, proposition of law number seven is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>\n<em>Independent Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">In appellant\u2019s proposition of law number three, appellant argues that the aggravating circumstance here does not outweigh the mitigating factors. For the following reasons, we find that the trial judge properly determined that the aggravating circumstance outweighs the mitigating evidence presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Pursuant to R.C. 2929.05(A), we must independently determine whether the aggravating circumstance outweighs any mitigating factors that have been established and whether the sentence of death is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">The sole statutory aggravating circumstance in this case is that appellant murdered the victim while committing kidnapping. See R.C. 2929.04(A)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">Against the aggravating circumstance we weigh all mitigating factors drawn from the nature and circumstances of the offense; the history, background and character of appellant, and any other factors listed in R.C. 2929.04(B)(1) through (7) which exist in this case. The statutory mitigating factors include the youth of the offender (age nineteen at the time of the murder) and his lack of a prior criminal history or delinquency adjudications. The mitigating factors of R.C. 2929.04(B)(1), (2), (3), and (6) were not established. While appellant went to live with co-defendant Bulerin at the age of sixteen, we find no evidence to establish a showing of duress, coercion, or strong provocation impacting on the appellant sufficient to establish this as a mitigating factor. Also, appellant was not shown to lack the substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">Under R.C. 2929.04(B)(7), the catchall category, appellant claims as mitigating factors that he had a difficult homelife and a learning disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">When appellant was young his father spent time in prison and his parents divorced. His mother remarried but his stepfather was abusive to him. This evidence is entitled to little or no weight as a mitigating factor. See <em>State v. Seiber </em>(1990), 56 Ohio St.3d 4, 9, 564 N.E.2d 408, 415-416.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">Appellant\u2019s learning disability involved a difficulty with reading and writing in school, but appellant had a normal I.Q. and was permitted to graduate with his class. The psychologist, Dr. Wayne Graves, testified that appellant was shy and nonverbal and internalized his feelings and emotions. Dr. Graves also indicated that appellant had a good potential for rehabilitation. This evidence is subject to little or no weight as a mitigating factor. See <em>State v. Scudder, supra, </em>71 Ohio St.3d at 275, 643 N.E.2d at 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-12\">The facts and circumstances of this case are that appellant, motivated by jealousy, lay in wait outside his former girlfriend\u2019s residence, where the sixteen-year-old victim was then kidnapped after visiting the girlfriend. The victim was then subjected to cuts across his throat and fatally stabbed twice with a knife. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>Thus, the evidence is compelling that appellant committed kidnapping during the murder of Ryan Young.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">In weighing the aggravating circumstance against the mitigating factors, we conclude that the aggravating circumstance outweighs the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">\n<em>Proportionality Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">In proposition of law number four, appellant argues that the sentence of death is not appropriate in this case. In carrying out the analysis of whether the sentence of death is appropriate, we find that the sentence of death in this case is neither excessive nor disproportionate, but is appropriate, when compared with other felony-murder cases which involved kidnapping. See <em>State v. Simko </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 483, 644 N.E.2d 345; <em>State v. Fox </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 183, 631 N.E.2d 124; <em>State v. Spirko </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 1, 570 N.E.2d 229; <em>State v. Roe </em>(1989), 41 Ohio St.3d 18, 535 N.E.2d 1351.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b573-9\">Douglas, Resnick and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b573-10\">Moyer, C.J., Deshler and Cook, JJ., concur in part and dissent in part.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b573-11\">Dana A.

Richard Joseph was convicted of the crime of aggravated murder beyond a reasonable doubt. No prejudicial error occurred in the guilt phase of his trial. I partially dissent, however, because I am unable to reach a similar conclusion with respect to the death penalty specification. In my view, the indictment issued against Joseph by the grand jury did not contain a specification upon which a. death sentence could legally be based. I similarly do not find evidence in this record sufficient to support a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that Joseph was a \u201cprincipal offender\u201d in the death of Ryan Young, as that term has consistently been interpreted by this court. I therefore dissent from the majority\u2019s affirmation of Joseph\u2019s death sentence. I would remand this case ,to the trial court with instructions that Joseph be resentenced, in accordance with R.C. 2929.03(A),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>life imprisonment with parole eligibility after serving twenty years of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">The state concedes that the specification included in the indictment was flawed. The indictment<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> charged Joseph and Jose Bulerin (who was tried separately and sentenced to twenty years to life imprisonment) with aggravated murder (R.C. 2903.01[B]). The specification charged both Joseph and Bulerin as principal offenders in the commission of the <em>kidnapping </em>of Young rather than the principal offenders in the commission of Young\u2019s <em>aggravated murder. </em>However, where prior calculation and design has not been alleged, as it was not here, Ohio's statutorily defined aggravating circumstance of felony-murder requires that the defendant be \u201cthe principal offender in the commission of the aggravated murder.\u201d R.C. 2929.04(A)(7).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The specification included in the Joseph-Bulerin indictment simply did not give notice of that element, either by setting it forth in the words of the statute, or by including a reference to the statutory number of the felony-murder specification. I do not believe that the Ohio Constitution, governing statutes, or rules of procedure, or this court\u2019s precedent allows this flaw to be dismissed as harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The majority opinion asserts that Joseph\u2019s death sentence may be upheld because defense counsel never challenged the sufficiency of the specification in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>the indictment, and imputes to the defense knowledge of the elements of the felony-murder death specification. Our established precedent is clear that the \u201cprincipal offender\u201d requirement of the felony-murder specification set forth in R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) equates to a finding of \u201cactual killer.\u201d <em>State v. Penix </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 369, 513 N.E.2d 744; <em>State v. Wiles </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 71, 92, 571 N.E.2d 97, 122; <em>State v. Taylor </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 295, 308, 612 N.E.2d 316, 325. See, also, <em>State v. Doty </em>(1916), 94 Ohio St. 258, 113 N.E. 811; <em>State v. Rogers </em>(1938), 64 Ohio App. 39, 55, 17 O.O. 340, 347, 27 N.E.2d 791, 799 (\u201cAdams was the principal offender as the evidence discloses that he, Adams, was the one who fired the shot that killed the Dickey boy.\u201d). My review of the record supports the conclusion that inclusion in the indictment of the phrase \u201cprincipal offenders in the commission of the <em>kidnapping </em>\u201d of Ryan Young was more than a mere clerical or typographical error. The error indicates that this case was tried upon the mistaken theory that a death sentence based upon the statutory aggravating circumstance of felony-murder (R.C. 2929.04[A][7]) could be imposed upon Joseph irrespective of whether Joseph actually inflicted knife wounds on Young.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">This conclusion is evidenced most strongly by the prosecutor\u2019s own words. During his closing argument made to the jury at the conclusion of the guilt phase, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-7\">\u201cWe have to prove to you beyond a reasonable doubt that this crime, or crimes, was committed between the 26th day of June of this year and the 4th day of July. We\u2019ve got a time frame. Frankly, the State of Ohio can\u2019t prove to you exactly when the death occurred. We can tell you when [the victim] was last seen. We can tell you when the car was seen out there. We can tell you where the car was found. The State of Ohio doesn\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-8\">\u201cAnother thing the State of Ohio doesn\u2019t know and can\u2019t tell you, and it doesn\u2019t make any difference as long as you find the two people, Jose Bulerin and Richard E. Joseph, jointly committed these crimes, or this crime, the law is very clear in Ohio that if one person is an aider and abettor, no matter what part he has in it, if he plays a part in the commission of that crime then he\u2019s as guilty as the other guy. The State of Ohio can\u2019t tell you. I wish I could. I wish I could tell you exactly what happened. <em>I don\u2019t know who struck the death blow. </em>But, I believe the evidence is very clear that <em>it was one of the two that\u2019s charged here. </em>If you find one of them did it, or the other one did it, <em>they\u2019re both just as guilty as if each of them had their hands around the hilt of that knife when it was stuck in Ryan Young.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">Later in closing argument, the prosecutor argued to the jury: \u201cYou\u2019ll find that they took Ryan Young to some area. <em>Here again, it doesn\u2019t make any difference who did what; who did the cutting.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>During his rebuttal argument the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-5\">\u201c[Defense counsel] wants you to infer or surmise that this defendant was not there and it was somebody else. <em>We don\u2019t have to show that this defendant was the one who administered the fatal blows. </em>He was with him. <em>We don\u2019t know which one did it. </em>We don\u2019t have to prove that.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">These comments did not materially misstate the law in regard to obtaining a guilty verdict as to <em>the aggravated murder charge </em>against Joseph. An aider and abettor may be found guilty of aggravated murder even though he is not himself the actual killer. However, \u201c[t]he fact that, pursuant to R.C. 2923.03(F), a defendant who aids and abets another in committing an offense \u2018shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a principal offender\u2019 and so may be convicted of aggravated murder under R.C. 2903.01(B) does not make the defendant \u2018the principal offender\u2019 for- purposes of imposing the death penalty under R.C. 2929.04(A)(7).\u201d <em>State v. Taylor, </em>syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">It seems unlikely that the prosecutor in this case would have admitted the state\u2019s failure to prove the identity of the actual killer had he realized that such an admission precluded a guilty verdict as to the felony-murder death specification. Similarly, the fact that trial defense counsel never raised the issue of the indictment\u2019s flaw, and did not address, let alone focus, its defense on the absence of proof of Joseph\u2019s \u201cprincipal offender\u201d status, leads to the conclusion that the defense accepted the prosecutor\u2019s legal interpretation. In affirming Joseph\u2019s death sentence, this court enters dangerous grounds, by effectively holding that the state may obtain a death sentence based not upon what was <em>actually </em>charged in the indictment, but upon what the state <em>meant </em>to charge, or <em>should </em>have charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">The framers of the Ohio Constitution clearly were aware of the importance of grand jury review in criminal matters, and thus included Section 10, Article I, which provides in part: \u201c[N]o person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous, crime, unless on presentment or indictment of a grand jury.\u201d I find the majority\u2019s willingness to excuse the defect in this .indictment to significantly undercut the protection against unjust prosecution this constitutional provision was intended to guarantee. In that the prosecutor conceded at trial that it could not prove who actually killed Young, it seems more than simply academic to question whether the grand jury would have ever issued an indictment with a felony-murder specification in the first place had its members been aware that such a specification required proof that Bulerin, Joseph, or both, were \u201cprincipal offenders in the aggravated murder\u201d of Young rather than proof that they both were principal offenders in his kidnapping. This being the case, it is of little significance that the trial court prepared verdict forms consistent with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>statutory specification language.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Cf. <em>State v. Headley </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 475, 478-479, 6 OBR 526, 529, 453 N.E.2d 716, 720 (in light of Section 10 of Article I of the Ohio Constitution, \u201cwhere one of the vital elements identifying the crime is omitted from the indictment, it is defective and cannot be cured by the court as such a procedure would permit the court to convict the accused on a charge essentially different from that found by the grand jury\u201d). See, also, <em>State v. O\u2019Brien </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 122, 30 OBR 436, 508 N.E.2d 144; <em>State v. Dilley </em>(1989), 47 Ohio St.3d 20, 546 N.E.2d 937.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">In addition, in my view Ohio\u2019s statutes governing capital punishment preclude imposition of the death penalty in this case. Pursuant to R.C. 2929.03(A), where an indictment fails to contain one or more specifications of aggravating circumstances listed in division (A) of section R.C. 2929.04, a sentence of life imprisonment with parole eligibility after serving twenty years of imprisonment <em>must </em>be imposed where a defendant is found guilty of aggravated murder. R.C. 2929.04 provides that \u201c[i]mposition of the death penalty for aggravated murder is precluded\u201d unless one of the specifications set forth in subsections (A)(1) through (7) is specified in the indictment. R.C. 2941.14(B) precludes imposition of the death penalty for aggravated murder \u201cunless the indictment * * * specifies one or more of the aggravating circumstances listed in division (A)\u201d of R.C. 2929.04. Although R.C. 2941.14(C) provides for specifications to be stated \u201cin the words of the subdivision in which it appears, or in words sufficient to give the accused notice of the same,\u201d I do not believe that the specification included in the indictment issued against Joseph does either.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Similarly, the majority\u2019s reliance on Crim.R. 7(D),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which authorizes amendment of indictments in certain circumstances, is misplaced. The fact is that no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Crim.R. 7(D) motion was ever made in this case. Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the defect in the amendment was of a nature capable of correction by amendment, had that deficiency been noticed earlier and the provisions of Crim.R. 7(D) been invoked, the defendant would have been entitled by the express terms of the rule to ask for discharge of the sitting jury, and a reasonable continuance. In my view, an appellate court improperly precludes a defendant from invoking that right where the provisions of Crim.R. 7 are first asserted upon appeal. Nor is it our role, as a reviewing court, to determine in the first instance that it \u201cclearly appears from the whole proceedings that the defendant [was not] misled or prejudiced by the defect or variance in respect to which the amendment [was] made,\u201d or that the defendant\u2019s rights were otherwise fully protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The simple facts remain that the grand jury in this case issued an indictment which did not make factual allegations falling within the scope of a statutorily defined aggravating circumstance, nor did it reference R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) by statutory number. This deficiency was never corrected by amendment pursuant to Crim.R. 7 or otherwise. I believe that these factual circumstances, combined with a record which shows the case to have been tried pursuant to a misunder<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>standing of the law\u2019s requirements, constituted plain error, which, had it not occurred, might well have resulted in a different verdict as to the death specification. I therefore believe that this error precludes imposition of a death sentence upon Joseph.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">\n<em>Insufficiency of the Evidence Related to the Death Penalty</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">I agree with the majority to the extent that significant circumstantial evidence was produced by the state to support a finding that Joseph was involved in the murder of Young and that he was <em>either </em>himself the killer <em>or </em>was an aider and abettor in the murder, and that either finding would support a conviction of aggravated felony-murder. R.C. 2903.01(B); <em>Taylor, supra. </em>However, this record contains no evidence, either direct or circumstantial, as to who held the knife (or knives) that were thrust into Young causing his death. The state simply did not prove Joseph guilty of a felony-murder death specification beyond a reasonable , doubt. It instead conceded that it knew virtually nothing as to the precise circumstances by which Young was murdered, including the facts as to who was his actual killer (or killers).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">This court has decided past cases in which more than one individual have been deemed to be a \u201cprincipal offender\u201d in one murder. In those cases, however, there has been evidence supporting a finding that the physical acts of more than one defendant together contributed to cause death. In other cases the evidence supports the conclusion that only one actor was involved in an aggravated murder. See, <em>e.g., State v. Murphy </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 554, 584, 605 N.E.2d 884, 908. In those cases, the actor has been recognized to be death-eligible as the \u201cprincipal offender\u201d because, in the absence of an aider or abettor, a finding of guilt of aggravated murder necessarily requires a finding that the guilty party was also the \u201cprincipal offender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">The evidence produced by the state at this trial is unlike the evidence in these categories of cases. In this case only two people (Joseph and his co-indictee Jose Bulerin) know which of them \u201cactually killed\u201d Young, or whether they both did. Neither of them testified in this trial, nor did the state produce confessions to disclose those facts. The state never found the murder weapon; hence, the weapon could not be traced to one or both of the defendants through fingerprints or other circumstantial evidence. We do not know exactly where Young was killed (no evidence was presented of blood in either Young\u2019s car or the Forest car) or any other circumstances surrounding his stabbing. Perhaps most significantly, the state conceded in its arguments to the jury that it did not know who stabbed Young (\u201cI don\u2019t know who struck the death blow. * * * [I]t was one of the two that\u2019s charged here.\u201d \u201c[I]t doesn\u2019t make any difference who did what; who did the cutting.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>In short, the record is sufficient to support <em>speculation </em>as to who actually lolled Young. Clearly this defendant had a motive. However, proof of a motive is not proof of guilty conduct. On the other hand, testimony was presented that the co-defendant Bulerin (age late thirties) was highly involved with martial arts, and protective of \u201chis kid\u201d (Joseph). Forest confirmed that Bulerin had indicated that he would \u201ceither snap your neck or put a bullet through your head and throw you out alongside the road\u201d if you ever \u201cscrewed with or messed with\u201d him or Joseph. Joseph\u2019s mother testified that, on one occasion when her son was ill, Bulerin told her not to \u201cwaste [her] time\u201d in attempting to take Joseph home with her because she \u201cwasn\u2019t going to get [her] son.\u201d She testified that Bulerin had threatened to break into her home and take something, or kill her dogs. At Joseph\u2019s mitigation hearing, Bulerin\u2019s ex-wife testified that, while she could not believe Joseph actually killed Young, she could believe that behavior of Bulerin.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Unfortunately, however, the evidence produced by the state does not confirm either speculation. We simply do not know, on the basis of this record, who killed Young. Having complied with our statutory responsibility pursuant to R.C. 2929.05 to make an independent review of the record to \u201cdetermine if the evidence supports the finding of the aggravating circumstances the trial jury * * * found the offender guilty of committing,\u201d I do not find that this record supports a finding that Joseph was proven guilty of being a principal offender, <em>ie., </em>actual killer, in the felony-murder of Young. I therefore believe it is the duty of this court to disaffirm the sentence of death imposed upon Richard Joseph.</p>\n<judges id=\"b580-6\">Deshler, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b573-13\">.
