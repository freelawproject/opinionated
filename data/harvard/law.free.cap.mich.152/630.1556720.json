Every license shall be revocable by the council at pleasure, and when any license shall be revoked for noncompliance with the terms and conditions upon which it was granted or on account of any violation of any ordinance or regulations passed or authorized by the council, the person holding such license shall, in addition to all other penalties imposed, forfeit all payments made for such license, and no new license for the same purpose shall be granted to such person for one year thereafter.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b664-8\">An ordinance of the city, known as the \u201cBryer\u2019s Ordinance,\u201d was adopted by the common council March <em>4, </em>1907. Its title is:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b664-9\">\u201cAn ordinance relative to licensing saloons, limiting the number thereof, prohibiting boxing, dancing and stalls therein; also prohibiting gambling devices, disturbances, and classing certain drug stores and hotels as saloons.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b664-10\">By the terms of this ordinance, every person desiring to run or operate a saloon in the city is required to make application in writing to the .city recorder, stating the street and number, and location of the saloon where the business for which the license asked for is proposed to be carried on, and the application must be accompanied by a written recommendation signed by at least three reputable and respectable citizens of the city, certifying that the applicant is well known to them and is well qualified to keep a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>saloon, and has a good reputation and moral character. A nominal license fee of $1 is required, and, when that sum has been paid to the city treasurer and receipt taken therefor and exhibited to the city recorder, that officer issues a license, \u201cif the application shall have been approved and granted by the common council.\u201d It is required that the application for the license shall contain an express provision and agreement, signed and executed by the applicant, that if a license be issued and he shall be convicted more than once in one year of a violation of the ordinance and more than once in one year \u201cof a violation of the State law,\u201d or shall be convicted once in any year of a violation of the State law-and in the same year of a violation of the ordinance, such conviction shall be a sufficient reason for revoking the license and for debarring the applicant from thereafter conducting a saloon in the city of Jackson. It is made the duty of the common council if there is more than one conviction in any one year of a license holder for a violation \u201c of the State law governing the sale of liquor at retail,\u201d or of more than one conviction for a violation of the ordinance, or in the case of one conviction for a violation of the State law, and one conviction for a violation of the ordinance within the same year, to give the license holder at least a five days\u2019 notice in writing of the time and place of hearing when the common council shall determine whether the license shall be revoked.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b665-3\">\u201cIf, after hearing the proofs, said common council shall find that said applicant and licensee has been convicted either of a violation of the State law twice within one year or of a violation of this ordinance or the ordinance which it amends, twice in one year, or that said applicant has been convicted once of a violation of the State law within one year and once of a violation of this ordinance * * * then said common council shall, by resolution, revoke the license of said applicant and licensee and a majority vote of said council shall be sufficient foi that purpose.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b665-4\">John Cox has for a number of years conducted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>b\u00fasiness of selling spirituous, malt, brewed, and fermented liquors at retail in the city of Jackson in a building owned by himself. Some time prior to May 1, 1907, and after the ordinance above mentioned as amended was in force, he made the application required by the ordinance, filed his retail liquor dealer\u2019s bond, which was approved by the common council, received his license, and continued his business. In November of that year he was notified to appear before the common council and show cause why his license should not be revoked. The notice set out that after May 1, 19Q7, he had been convicted of a violation of the ordinance in question, and had also been convicted in the circuit court for the county of Jackson \u201cof a violation of the State law.\u201d He appeared before the common council, and after hearing proofs it was found that he had been convicted once of a violation of the ordinance and once \u201cof a violation of the State law,\u201d and a resolution revoking his license was duly passed, and the chief of police directed to close his business, unless he should within 30 days apply to the courts, \u201cand, if said Cox apply to the circuit court, he is allowed to remain open pending the decision of the case in the circuit court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-5\">The violation of the ordinance for which he was convicted was for having a show in his saloon, of which he was convicted May 16, 1907. The conviction under the State law was for keeping a house for the resort of prostitutes ; the record of his conviction being made November 4,1907. He applied to the circuit court for the county of J ackson for a writ of certiorari to review the action of the common council, and that court determined and held that under certain provisions of the charter of the city, the common council had the right and power to revoke the license, if a license had been issued, and, further, that whether he had been twice convicted within the meaning of said ordinance was a question unnecessary to be determined, expressing a doubt whether the convictions herein referred to were, under the terms of said ordinance, ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>for forfeiting the license. It is assumed, perhaps without warrant, that the writ of certiorari was dismissed. Cox\u2019s place of business was not closed, and at the time of making his application to this, court he was still conducting his business. On the 7th day of April, 1908, he filed with the city recorder of the city of Jackson an application for \u25a0 a license to carry on his business for the year beginning May 1, 1908, the application in form complying with the terms of the ordinance. He also filed the statutory liquor dealer\u2019s bond. The application and bond were referred to a committee, and that committee on the 20th of April reported to the common council:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b667-3\">\u201c In the case of John Cox, your committee find that he signed an application a year ago in which he agreed that if his license were revoked that he should be debarred from conducting a saloon in the city of Jackson, and your committee find his license was revoked, and that he is not for that reason entitled to a license, and they therefore recommend that his license be rejected.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b667-4\">The common council thereupon adopted a resolution, of which the following is the part important here:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b667-5\"><em>\u201c </em>Inthecaseof JosephSchultz and John Cox, that licenses be refused and their bonds be not approved for the reasons mentioned in the report of your committee on file with the recorder and this day adopted by the common council.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b667-6\">John Cox applied to this court for a writ of mandamus to th\u00ae common, council of the city of Jackson, requiring it to approve his bond and grant his application for a license, and, upon a showing of exigencies, an order to show cause was issued and an answer has been filed. Without here setting out the numerous objections fnade to the validity of the ordinance and to the force and effect of the alleged revocation of the license, it will be sufficient to refer to such of them as it seems important to discuss.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b667-7\">Ostrander, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7L\"><em>(after stating the facts). </em>We have no doubt that the ordinance in referring to a conviction of a license holder under the State law was intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>mean, and means, the law or laws governing the business of selling liquors. Any other meaning would make the provisions of the ordinance insensible. The ordinance does not say \u201ca State law.\u201d The words employed in various places in the ordinance are \u201cthe State law,\u201d and in one portion of the ordinance which has been set out, and in the same connection, express reference is made to the liquor law. It follows that a single conviction for violating the ordinance and a single conviction within the same year for violating some State law, other than the law governing the sales of liquors, would not, under the terms of the ordinance, make a case for revoking the license. It also follows that, whatever the effect of the agreement of the applicant may be otherwise found to be, it is in terms an agreement no broader than the ordinance. We have not before us the particular reasons given by the court in the certiorari proceedings referred to for holding that the common council had the right to revoke the license for other reasons than those expressed in the ordinance. It is urged in the brief for the respondent that, so far as the license now applied for is concerned, the common council had the right, in view of its knowledge of the violations of law admitted by the petition, to decline to recommend the fitness of the applicant to conduct the business and the right to refuse a license. We think the respondent may not urge here in support of the action taken by it a reason based upon the asserted premises, although the reason asserted may be one affecting the discretion of the court in granting or refusing a peremptory writ of mandamus. It has not refused a license and has not refused to approve the bond for any reasons other than that petitioner\u2019s license of 1907 was revoked, and that he agreed that, if it was revoked, he should be debarred from conducting a saloon. The common council found that his license had been revoked, and that for that reason he was not entitled to a license. As has been shown, the ground upon which the common council revoked the license was that the respondent had been, within the terms of the ordinance, convicted of two violations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>of the law. That is the ground of the ordinance. We reach the conclusion that two violations of law within the meaning of the ordinance were not shown, and, unless petitioner is concluded upon the subject, no valid reasons were assigned by the common council for refusing the present application for a license and the approval of petitioner\u2019s bond. If petitioner is concluded, it is because he is bound by the finding and determination of the court in the certiorari proceeding which he instituted for the purpose of vacating the determination and order of the common council. Clearly he is not concluded. The former' action of the common council was predicated upon the terms of the ordinance and upon certain declared facts. It was an attempted revocation of a license in enforcement of the ordinance. The case made did not meet the requirement of the ordinance. The count did not determine that it did. The action of the common council which is now complained of is based upon its former action and upon the Bryer\u2019s ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-3\">We are not, however, required to grant a peremptory writ of mandamus. Petitioner has tendered his application for a license, in conformity with the ordinance, and has. tendered his bond, in conformity with the statute. He is entitled to have them considered by the common council at an early date, and approved or disapproved. If disapproved, reasons should be given. The previous action, declaring the former license to be revoked, is not of itself ground for refusing approval. If a license is refused, we may assume that it will be because of facts to be found and not now appearing. We think the court should not anticipate the action which will be taken. It is not likely that the mandate of this court will be required to secure the performance of the duty pointed out.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">Petitioner will be given the writ in case of delay. No costs are awarded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b669-5\">Hookek, Moore, Carpenter, and McAlvay, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
