WALKER, JR., Circuit Judge:</author> <p id=\"b203-9\" pgmap=\"203\">Plaintiff-appellant Dan Friedman appeals from a decision of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut (Alvin W. Thompson, J.) dismissing his defamation action and entering judgment in favor of the defendants-appellees. At issue in this case is whether Connecticut General Statute \u00a7 52-59b\u2014which provides for long-arm jurisdiction over certain out-of-state defendants except in defamation actions\u2014violates Friedman\u2019s First or Fourteenth Amendment rights. We conclude that it does not and AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of this action as to the out-of-state defendants. We also consider whether the allegedly defamatory statements at issue in this case, which were reported and published by the remaining defendants, are privileged under New York Civil Rights Law \u00a7 74 as a fair and true report of judicial proceedings or are protected expressions of opinion. We AFFIRM in part and REVERSE in part the district court\u2019s determinations regarding these statements and REMAND this action for proceedings against the remaining defendants consistent with this opinion.</p> <p id=\"b203-11\" pgmap=\"203\">BACKGROUND</p> <p id=\"b203-12\" pgmap=\"203\">This defamation action arises out of a news article published by Bloomberg News that reported on a lawsuit Friedman filed against his former employer, Palladyne International Asset Management, and others. Friedman alleged in the lawsuit that Palladyne, a purported hedge fund based in the Netherlands, fraudulently induced him into working as its \u201chead of risk\u201d in order to create the appearance that it was a legitimate company. Friedman claimed that, over the course of nearly eight months, Palladyne and an executive recruiting firm made numerous misrepresentations to persuade him to accept this position, including that Palladyne was \u201ca diversified investment company\u201d with a \u201cworldwide clientele\u201d and \u201cconsistent, optimized returns.\u201d App\u2019x at 15, 49, 61.</p> <p id=\"b203-13\" pgmap=\"203(122) 204(10)\">In November 2011, Friedman moved to the Netherlands and began working for Palladyne. According to Friedman, he soon discovered that Palladyne was a \u201ckickback and money laundering operation for the former dictatorial Ghaddafi [sic] regime in Libya,\u201d App\u2019x at 39, and that Palladyne\u2019s primary purpose was to channel funds at the behest of the then-head of Libya\u2019s state-run National Oil Company, who was the father-in-law of Palladyne\u2019s chief executive officer. Friedman also learned that the United States Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission were conducting investigations that implicated Palladyne. In February 2012, after Friedman voiced concerns to a colleague that Palladyne was not engaging in legitimate investment activities and could face criminal exposure, he was \u201cabruptly terminated with no legally cognizable explanation.\u201d App\u2019x at 75.</p> <p id=\"b204-4\" pgmap=\"204\">On March 25, 2014, Friedman sued Pal-ladyne and the firm that had recruited him for the position, as well as several of their employees. Friedman asserted seven counts in his complaint, including fraudulent inducement, and sought monetary damages totaling $499,401,000, plus interest, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. He also sought, as additional punitive damages, two years of the employee defendants\u2019 salaries and bonuses. Friedman requested that \u201cthis Court enter judgment on all Counts for the plaintiff.\u201d App\u2019x at 88.</p> <p id=\"b204-5\" pgmap=\"204\">On March 27, 2014, Bloomberg L.P. published online the article at issue in this case. Entitled \u201cPalladyne Accused in Suit of Laundering Money for Qaddafi,\u201d the article reported on Friedman\u2019s lawsuit. Friedman responded to this article by filing the instant defamation action against (1) Bloomberg L.P. and the authors and editors of the article (collectively, the \u201cBloomberg Defendants\u201d); (2) the Netherlands-based Palladyne and two of its senior officers (collectively, the \u201cPalladyne Defendants\u201d); and (3) Milltown Partners, LLP\u2014 a public relations company based in the United Kingdom that worked for Palla-dyne and allegedly was a source of information for the article\u2014and several of its employees (collectively, the \u201cMilltown Defendants\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b204-6\" pgmap=\"204\">Friedman alleged that the following statements in the article were false and caused him serious and irreparable harm:</p> <blockquote id=\"b204-7\" pgmap=\"204\">(1) A statement that \u201c[Palladyne] was sued in the U.S. for as much as $500 million.\u201d</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b204-8\" pgmap=\"204\">(2) A quote from Palladyne that \u201c[t]hese entirely untrue and ludicrous allegations [in Friedman\u2019s earlier lawsuit] have been made by a former employee who has repeatedly tried to extort money from the company.... He worked with us for just two months before being dismissed for gross misconduct.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"A_a\" pgmap=\"204\">App\u2019x at 19, 37-38. Friedman further alleged that the Bloomberg Defendants negligently published these statements without contacting him for a response or otherwise verifying their accuracy, and acted with reckless disregard by failing to correct or retract the statements even after his lawyer alerted several of the Bloomberg Defendants to their inaccuracy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b204-13\" pgmap=\"204\">The Milltown and Palladyne Defendants moved to dismiss this case pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2) for lack of personal jurisdiction and 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. In granting the motion, the district court concluded that Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 52-59b, which provides for jurisdiction over nonresident individuals, foreign partnerships, and foreign voluntary associations except in defamation cases, deprived it of personal jurisdiction over the Milltown and Palla-dyne Defendants, all of which are foreign entities. The district court further determined that even if Palladyne\u2014organized under the laws of the Netherlands as a besloten vennootschap\u2014were categorized as a corporation and not a foreign partnership, Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 33-929 would deprive it of personal jurisdiction over Palla-dyne.</p> <p id=\"b204-14\" pgmap=\"204(35) 205(69)\">The Bloomberg Defendants also filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, which the district court granted. The district court held that the statement that Friedman had sued Palladyne for \u201cas much as $500 million\u201d was protected by N.Y. Civ. Rights Law \u00a7 74 because it was a fair and true report of Friedman\u2019s complaint and that the statement that Friedman \u201chas repeatedly tried to extort money from [Palladyne],\u201d while not covered by the same privilege, was a protected expression of opinion. Friedman timely appealed the dismissal of his complaint.</p> <p id=\"b205-5\" pgmap=\"205\">DISCUSSION</p> <p id=\"b205-6\" pgmap=\"205\">Friedman argues on appeal inter alia that (1) the district court has personal jurisdiction over the individual Milltown and Palladyne Defendants pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 52-59b because the statute\u2019s exclusion of defamation actions is unconstitutional<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; (2) the \u201cfor as much as $500 million\u201d statement is defamatory because it fails to clarify that he could not have been awarded this amount even if his lawsuit were successful; and (3) the \u201crepeatedly tried to extort money\u201d statement suggests that he engaged in criminal conduct and implies undisclosed facts that are detrimental to his character.</p> <p id=\"b205-7\" pgmap=\"205\">I. Connecticut General Statute \u00a7 52-59b</p> <p id=\"b205-8\" pgmap=\"205\"> We review de novo an appeal from a district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction. Whitaker v. Am. Telecasting, Inc., 261 F.3d 196, 208 (2d Cir. 2001). The plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that the court has personal jurisdiction over each defendant. Id. In determining whether such jurisdiction exists, a court \u201cmust look first to the long-arm statute of the forum state.... If the exercise of jurisdiction is appropriate under that statute, the court must decide whether such exercise comports with the requisites of due process.\u201d Id. at 208 (citation omitted). The relevant long-arm statute, Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 52-59b(a), provides:</p> <blockquote id=\"b205-11\" pgmap=\"205\">[A] court may exercise personal jurisdiction over any nonresident individual, foreign partnership or foreign voluntary association ... who in person or through an agent ... (2) commits a tortious act within the state, except as to a cause of action for defamation of character arising from the act; (3) commits a tortious act outside the state causing injury to person ... within the state, except as to a cause of action for defamation of character arising from the act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> </blockquote> <p id=\"b205-12\" pgmap=\"205\">Based on the plain language of Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 52-59b, the district court did not have personal jurisdiction in this defamation action over the individual Milltown and Palladyne Defendants, who are not Connecticut residents. Friedman argues, however, that the long-arm statute\u2019s exclusion of out-of-state defendants in defamation actions violates his First Amendment right to petition and Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection. We disagree.</p> <p id=\"b205-13\" pgmap=\"205(53) 206(130)\"> The First Amendment provides, in relevant part, that \u201cCongress shall make no law ... abridging ... the right of the people ... to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. I. The right to petition, which applies to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, \u201cextends to all departments of the Government, including the courts.\u201d City of N.Y. v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., 524 F.3d 384, 397 (2d Cir. 2008) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). A plaintiffs \u201cconstitutional right of access to the courts is violated where government officials obstruct legitimate efforts to seek judicial redress.\u201d Id. (citation and brackets omitted); see also Christopher v. Harbury, 536 U.S. 403, 413, 122 S.Ct. 2179, 153 L.Ed.2d 413 (2002) (noting right-of-access concerns are implicated when \u201csystemic official action frustrates a plaintiff or plaintiff class in preparing and filing suits at the present time\u201d); Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817, 828, 97 S.Ct. 1491, 52 L.Ed.2d 72 (1977) (requiring prison authorities to provide inmates with adequate law libraries or legal assistance to permit meaningful litigation of appeals).</p> <p id=\"b206-4\" pgmap=\"206\"> A plaintiffs right of access to courts is not violated when, as here, a state\u2019s long-arm statute does not provide for jurisdiction over certain out-of-state defendants. Indeed, \u201c[tjhere is nothing to compel a state to exercise jurisdiction over a foreign [defendant] unless it chooses to do so, and the extent to which it so chooses is a matter for the law of the state as made by its legislature.\u201d Brown v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 814 F.3d 619, 626 (2d Cir. 2016) (quoting Arrowsmith v. United Press Int'l, 320 F.2d 219, 222 (2d Cir. 1963) (en banc)). In International Shoe Co. v. Washington, the Supreme Court held that, under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, state courts could exercise jurisdiction over out-of-state defendants if the defendants had \u201ccertain minimum contacts with [the forum state] such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend \u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019 \u201d 326 U.S. 310, 316, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945) (quoting Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U.S. 457, 463, 61 S.Ct. 339, 85 L.Ed. 278 (1940)). The Supreme Court described the extent to which it would be constitutionally permissible for state courts to exercise jurisdiction over these defendants; it did not hold that state courts were required to exercise such jurisdiction. See id. Relying on this principle, state legislatures enacted long-arm statutes setting forth the terms under which their courts could exercise jurisdiction over out-of-state defendants. See Robert D. Sack, Sack on Defamation: Libel, Slander, and Related Problems, \u00a7 15.1.2A (5th ed. 2017). Although many states\u2019 long-arm statutes provide for jurisdiction that is coextensive with the limits of the Due Process Clause, some do not permit the exercise of jurisdiction to the full extent allowed by the federal Constitution. Id.; see Best Van Lines, Inc. v. Walker, 490 F.3d 239, 244-45 (2d Cir. 2007).</p> <p id=\"b206-9\" pgmap=\"206(139) 207(115)\"> The Connecticut long-arm statute at issue here, which precludes its courts from .exercising jurisdiction over certain foreign defendants in defamation actions,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> does not provide for jurisdiction to the limits of due process. See Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 52-59b; see also International Shoe, 326 U.S. at 316, 66 S.Ct. 154. The statute\u2019s limitation does not, however, violate Friedman\u2019s First Amendment right of access to courts. As we have noted, \u201c[t]here is nothing to compel a state to exercise jurisdiction over a foreign [defendant] unless it chooses to do so,\u201d Brown, 814 F.3d at 626, and Friedman does not have any right to assert a claim against a foreign entity in the absence of a long-arm statute that provides jurisdiction over such an entity. See Whitaker, 261 F.3d at 208; see also George v. Strick Corp., 496 F.2d 10, 12 (10th Cir. 1974) (\u201c[Pjertinent federal cases do not compel state courts to open their doors to every suit which meets the minimum contacts requirements of the due process clause of the federal constitution.\u201d); Jennings v. McCall Corp., 320 F.2d 64, 68 (8th Cir. 1963) (\u201c[A] state court is free to choose for itself the standards to be applied in determining the circumstances under which a foreign [entity] would be amenable to suit, assuming of course that minimum due process requirements are met.... [It is] a state\u2019s privilege to impose its own jurisdictional limitations.\u201d). Friedman, therefore, has failed to show that this statute violates his First Amendment right of access to courts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b207-5\" pgmap=\"207\"> Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 52-59b also does not violate Friedman\u2019s equal protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. Friedman argues that, applying strict scrutiny, the statute violates the Equal Protection Clause by \u201crestricting the rights of defamation plaintiffs as a class without utilizing the least restrictive means.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 44-45. However, we apply strict scrutiny only when the challenged statute either (1) burdens a fundamental right or (2) targets a suspect class. See Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 319, 113 S.Ct. 2637, 125 L.Ed.2d 257 (1993). Friedman has not shown that his claim falls within either category. As we have discussed, a state is not required to extend its courts\u2019 jurisdiction over specific foreign defendants and, in the absence of a long-arm statute providing for such jurisdiction, a plaintiff does not have a fundamental right to bring an action against those foreign defendants. Further, Friedman does not argue that state residents defamed by out-of-state entities are a suspect class.</p> <p id=\"b207-8\" pgmap=\"207\"> Under rational basis review, which is applicable here, \u201cwe are required to defer to the legislative choice, absent a showing that the legislature acted arbitrarily or irrationally.\u201d Gronne v. Abrams, 793 F.2d 74, 77 (2d Cir. 1986). The party challenging the law, therefore, \u201cmust disprove every conceivable basis which might support it.\u201d Windsor v. United States, 699 F.3d 169, 180 (2d Cir. 2012) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), aff'd, \u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2675, 186 L.Ed.2d 808 (2013). Friedman argues that the statute\u2019s legislative history does not state a rational basis for excluding defamation actions. A legislature, however, \u201cneed not actually articulate at any time the purpose or rationale supporting its classification. ... Instead, a classification must be upheld against [an] equal protection challenge if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.\u201d Heller, 509 U.S. at 320, 113 S.Ct. 2637 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p> <p id=\"b207-11\" pgmap=\"207(69) 208(138)\">Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 52-59b was modeled after a nearly identical provision in New York state\u2019s long-arm statute. See N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 302; Savin v. Ranier, 898 F.2d 304, 306 (2d Cir. 1990). We have previously noted, in the context of the New York statute, that one rational basis for excluding defamation actions against out-of-state defendants is \u201cto avoid unnecessary inhibitions on freedom of speech\u201d and that \u201c[t]hese important civil liberties are entitled to special protections lest procedural burdens shackle them.\u201d Best Van Lines, 490 F.3d at 245 (quoting Legros v. Irving, 38 A.D.2d 53, 55, 327 N.Y.S.2d 371 (N.Y. App. Div. 1st Dep\u2019t 1971)); see also SPCA of Upstate N.Y., Inc. v. Am. Working Collie Ass\u2019n, 18 N.Y.3d 400, 404, 940 N.Y.S.2d 525, 963 N.E.2d 1226 (2012) (\u201cDefamation claims are accorded separate treatment to reflect the state\u2019s policy of preventing disproportionate restrictions on freedom of expression.\u201d). The New York state exception for defamation actions was initially intended, at least in part, to ensure that \u201cnewspapers published in other states [would not be forced] to defend themselves in states where they had no substantial interests.\u201d Best Van Lines, 490 F.3d at 245 (quoting Legros, 38 A.D.2d at 55, 327 N.Y.S.2d 371).</p> <p id=\"b208-4\" pgmap=\"208\">For the first time in his reply brief on appeal, Friedman challenges this rational basis by arguing that \u201c[t]he internet ... dramatically changes the impact of the long arm defamation exclusion\u201d and \u201ccreates a wide defamation liability-free zone for out of state publishers,\u201d such as Bloom-berg L.P., if they publish defamatory statements online. Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 25-30. At issue in this appeal, however, is the statute\u2019s defamation exception with respect to the individual Milltown and Palla-dyne Defendants, who are the alleged sources for the challenged statements in the Bloomberg article. As we described earlier, one conceivable basis for affording special protection to out-of-state defendants in defamation actions is to avoid any unnecessary inhibition on their freedom of speech. See Best Van Lines, 490 F.3d at 245; see also Vincent C. Alexander, Practice Commentaries, N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 302, at C302:10 (McKinney 2008) (\u201cThe [New York State long arm statute\u2019s] exclusion ... recognizes the ease with which a written or oral utterance may occur in New York, thereby subjecting numerous individuals ... to suit in New York despite their potentially remote connection to the state.\u201d). Because Friedman fails to counter this rational basis, we conclude that his equal protection argument is unavailing. See Windsor, 699 F.3d at 180.</p> <p id=\"b208-6\" pgmap=\"208\">In sum, we agree with the district court that Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 52-59b does not violate Friedman\u2019s First or Fourteenth Amendment rights. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal pursuant to this statute of Friedman\u2019s defamation claim against the Milltown and Palladyne Defendants for lack of personal jurisdiction.</p> <p id=\"b208-7\" pgmap=\"208\">II. The Allegedly Defamatory Statements</p> <p id=\"b208-8\" pgmap=\"208\"> Because the parties do not dispute that we have personal jurisdiction over the Bloomberg Defendants for their allegedly defamatory statements, we turn to the district court\u2019s dismissal of Friedman\u2019s claim against those defendants for failure to state a claim. We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), accepting as true the factual allegations in the complaint and drawing all inferences in the plaintiffs favor. Biro v. Conde Nast, 807 F.3d 541, 544 (2d Cir. 2015).</p> <p id=\"b208-9\" pgmap=\"208\">a. The \u201cFor As Much As $500 Million\u201d Statement</p> <p id=\"b208-10\" pgmap=\"208(67) 209(105)\"> We first address the Bloom-berg Defendants\u2019 argument that the article\u2019s statement that Friedman sued Palla-dyne \u201cfor as much as $500 million\u201d is protected under N.Y. Civ. Rights Law \u00a7 74. This statute provides that \u201c[a] civil action cannot be maintained against any person, firm or corporation, for the publication of a fair and true report of any judicial proceeding.\u201d N.Y. Civ. Rights Law \u00a7 74. New York courts adopt a \u201cliberal interpretation of the \u2018fair and true report\u2019 standard of ... \u00a7 74 so as to provide broad protection to news accounts of judicial ... proceedings.\u201d Becher v. Troy Publ\u2019g Co., 183 A.D.2d 230, 233, 589 N.Y.S.2d 644 (N.Y. App. Div. 3d Dep\u2019t 1992). A statement is deemed a fair and true report if it is \u201csubstantially accurate,\u201d that is \u201cif, despite minor inaccuracies, it does not produce a different effect on a reader than would a report containing the precise truth.\u201d Karedes v. Ackerley Grp. Inc., 423 F.3d 107, 119 (2d Cir. 2005) (citations omitted).</p> <p id=\"b209-5\" pgmap=\"209\">Here, the Bloomberg Defendants\u2019 statement that Friedman\u2019s suit was \u201cfor as much as $500 million\u201d was a fair and true report of a judicial proceeding. The statement was a description of the- prayer for relief in Friedman\u2019s complaint, which requested that \u201cthe Court enter judgment on all Counts for the plaintiff,\u201d totaling $499,401,000, exclusive of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. App\u2019x at 89. Nowhere did the complaint state that Friedman was pleading any counts in the alternative or that the damages could not be aggregated. Even though some of these damages would be barred as duplicative if Friedman were successful in his lawsuit, it was not necessary for this explanation to be included in the article. The Bloomberg Defendants\u2019 characterization of the damages sought was an accurate description of what was written in the complaint. See Lacher v. Engel, 33 A.D.3d 10, 17, 817 N.Y.S.2d 37 (N.Y. App. Div. 1st Dep\u2019t 2006) (\u201cComments that essentially summarize or restate the allegations of a pleading filed in an action ... fall within \u00a7 74\u2019s privilege.\u201d). As the district court noted, \u201c[t]o the extent there was an inaccuracy here, it is found in the language [Friedman] used in the prayer for relief.\u201d Special App\u2019x at 31.</p> <p id=\"b209-8\" pgmap=\"209\"> Friedman argues, however, that the statement was neither fair nor substantially accurate because Bloomberg L.P. did not contact him for a response and, as a sophisticated media company, it should have known that Friedman would not have been able to recover as much as $500 million. Friedman cites no case law in support of his argument that the Bloom-berg Defendants were compelled to seek his response in order for an accurate report of the language of his complaint to be \u201cfair.\u201d And the outcome that Friedman requests\u2014that we require \u201csophisticated\u201d reporters to determine the legal question of whether claims asserted in a complaint are duplicative even if they are not pled in the alternative\u2014would be excessively burdensome for the media and would conflict with the general purpose of \u00a7 74. Cf. Becher, 183 A.D.2d at 234, 589 N.Y.S.2d 644 (\u201cNewspapers cannot be held to a standard of strict accountability for use of legal terms of art in a way that is not precisely or technically correct by every possible definition.\u201d (citation omitted)).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b209-9\" pgmap=\"209\">Accordingly, because we find that \u00a7 74 applies, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Friedman\u2019s defamation claim based on the \u201cas much as $500 million\u201d statement.</p> <p id=\"b209-10\" pgmap=\"209\">b.

Friedman argues that this statement is reasonably susceptible to a defamatory meaning\u2014that he engaged in criminal conduct\u2014and implies the existence of undisclosed facts that are detrimental to his character. We agree that the district court erred in dismissing Friedman\u2019s claim based on this statement.</p> <p id=\"b210-4\" pgmap=\"210\"> Under New York law, which the parties do not dispute applies here, a plaintiff must establish the following elements to recover a claim for libel:</p> <blockquote id=\"b210-5\" pgmap=\"210\">(1) a written defamatory statement of fact concerning the plaintiff; (2) publication to a third party; (3) fault (either negligence or actual malice depending on the status of the libeled party); (4) falsity of the defamatory statement; and (5) special damages or per se actionability-</blockquote> <p id=\"b210-6\" pgmap=\"210\">Celle v.

With respect to the first element of this cause of action, which is the focus of this appeal, we must consider whether (1) \u201cthe challenged statements reasonably imply the alleged defamatory meaning\u201d and (2) \u201cif so, whether that defamatory meaning is capable of being proven false.\u201d See Flamm v.

(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p> <p id=\"b210-7\" pgmap=\"210\">Here, the district court found that, based on the context in which Palladyne\u2019s statement was made, a reasonable reader would understand Palladyne\u2019s use of the word \u201cextort\u201d to be \u201crhetorical hyperbole, a vigorous epithet ... reflecting] Palla-dyne\u2019s belief that an upset former employee had filed a frivolous lawsuit against Palladyne in order to get money.\u201d Special App\u2019x at 44. In dismissing Friedman\u2019s claim, the district court relied in particular on Greenbelt Coop. Publ\u2019g Ass\u2019n v. Bresler, 398 U.S. 6, 14, 90 S.Ct. 1537, 26 L.Ed.2d 6 (1970). There, the Supreme Court determined that statements in a newspaper, reporting that attendees of city council meetings had characterized the plaintiffs negotiations with the city as \u201cblackmail,\u201d were merely \u201crhetorical hyperbole\u201d and were not actionable defamatory statements. Id. The Court dismissed the defamation claim, concluding that:</p> <blockquote id=\"AtG\" pgmap=\"210\">It is simply impossible to believe that a reader who reached the word \u201cblackmail\u201d in either article would not have understood exactly what was meant: it was [plaintiffs] public and wholly legal negotiating proposals that were being criticized. No reader could have thought that either the speakers at the meetings or the newspaper articles reporting their words were charging [plaintiff] with the commission of a criminal offense. On the contrary, even the most careless reader must have perceived that the word was no more than rhetorical hyperbole, a vigorous epithet used by those who considered [plaintiffs] negotiating position extremely unreasonable.</blockquote> <p id=\"b210-10\" pgmap=\"210\">Id. (footnote omitted). On appeal, the Bloomberg Defendants also cite to several New York state cases in which courts have held that, in certain contexts, a defendant\u2019s use of the term \u201cextort\u201d may be \u201crhetorical hyperbole\u201d that is not actionable.</p> <p id=\"b210-11\" pgmap=\"210(63) 211(312)\">In Melius v. Glacken, for example, the then-mayor of Freeport stated in a public debate that the plaintiffs lawsuit against him and other officials, alleging that they had conspired to take away the plaintiffs property, was an attempt to \u201cextort money\u201d because the plaintiff was seeking an amount \u201cfar in excess of the appraised value\u201d of the property. 94 A.D.3d 959, 959-60, 943 N.Y.S.2d 134 (N.Y. App. Div. 2d Dep\u2019t 2012). After the plaintiff sued the mayor for defamation, the court determined that based on the context in which the challenged statements were made\u2014in response to a question about the plaintiffs lawsuit and in a \u201cheated\u201d public debate\u2014a reasonable listener would have understood that the mayor was stating his opinion about the merits of plaintiffs lawsuit and not accusing the plaintiff of criminal conduct. Id. at 960, 943 N.Y.S.2d 134. The court held that the statement was not actionable because the mayor had explained the factual basis for his belief that the plaintiff was attempting to extort money\u2014 that the plaintiff sought an amount \u201cfar in excess of the appraised value\u201d of the property\u2014and therefore his statement did not imply the existence of undisclosed facts that were detrimental to the plaintiffs character. Id. at 960-61, 943 N.Y.S.2d 134; see also Sabharwal &amp; Finkel, LLC v. Sorrell, 117 A.D.3d 437, 437-38, 985 N.Y.S.2d 70 (N.Y.

May 27, 2004) (defendant\u2019s quote in article characterizing plaintiffs lawsuit as \u201capproaching extortion\u201d not actionable because \u201cno reasonable reader could understand [the] statements as saying that plaintiff committed the criminal act of extortion\u201d); Trustco Bank of N.Y. v. Capital Neivspaper Div. of Hearst Corp., 213 A.D.2d 940, 942, 624 N.Y.S.2d 291 (N.Y. App. Div. 3d Dep\u2019t 1995) (defendant\u2019s use of the word \u201cextortion\u201d to describe lawsuit filed against him not actionable).</p> <p id=\"b211-5\" pgmap=\"211\">Here, the Bloomberg article discussed Friedman\u2019s lawsuit and then included the following quote from Palladyne: \u201cThese entirely untrue and ludicrous allegations have been made by a former employee who has repeatedly tried to extort money from the company.... He worked with us for just two months before being dismissed for gross misconduct.\u201d App\u2019x at 38. As in the cases cited by the district court and the Bloomberg Defendants, the article clearly indicated that Palladyne made these statements in the context of a \u201cheated\u201d dispute. See Melius, 94 A.D.3d at 959-60, 943 N.Y.S.2d 134. The article described Friedman\u2019s allegations that Palladyne was \u201cnothing more than a fagade created to conceal criminal transactions\u201d and noted that Friedman alleged that he had been fired by Palladyne with \u201cno legally cognizable explanation\u201d after voicing his concerns to a colleague about the firm\u2019s criminal exposure. App\u2019x at 37-38.</p> <p id=\"b211-6\" pgmap=\"211\">However, unlike the cases cited by the district court and the Bloomberg Defendants, a reasonable reader could interpret Palladyne\u2019s use of the word \u201cextort\u201d here as more than just \u201crhetorical hyperbole\u201d describing Palladyne\u2019s belief that the lawsuit was frivolous. See Flamm, 201 F.3d at 150-51. Palladyne did not simply state that Friedman\u2019s lawsuit was an attempt to extort money from the company. Instead, Palladyne stated that Friedman \u201crepeatedly\u201d tried to extort money from them. This statement can be read as something other than a characterization of Friedman\u2019s underlying lawsuit against Palladyne and is reasonably susceptible to a defamatory meaning\u2014that Friedman actually committed the criminal act of extortion\u2014a statement that is capable of being proven false. Id.</p> <p id=\"b211-7\" pgmap=\"211(19) 212(69)\">This interpretation also is reasonable when the statement is read in the context of Palladyne\u2019s entire quote. After asserting that Friedman had \u201crepeatedly\u201d tried to extort money from them, Palladyne went on to state that Friedman was \u201cdismissed for gross misconduct.\u201d App\u2019x at 38. Palla-dyne did not explain whether there was a connection between these two statements. A reasonable reader, therefore, could have believed that Friedman\u2019s \u201cgross misconduct\u201d consisted of multiple attempts to \u201cextort\u201d money and that Friedman was fired for engaging in this criminal conduct.</p> <p id=\"b212-4\" pgmap=\"212\"> Further, even if a reasonable reader could interpret the word \u201cextort\u201d as hyperbolic language describing Friedman\u2019s conduct, and not an assertion that Friedman had committed the criminal act of extortion, this statement still would be actionable. A statement of opinion is actionable under New York law if it implies that \u201cthe speaker knows certain facts, unknown to his audience, which support his opinion and are detrimental to the person about whom he is speaking.\u201d Steinhilber v. Alphonse, 68 N.Y.2d 283, 290, 508 N.Y.S.2d 901, 501 N.E.2d 550 (1986); see also Hotchner v. Castillo-Puche, 551 F.2d 910, 913 (2d Cir. 1977) (\u201cLiability for libel may attach ... when a negative characterization of a person is coupled with a clear but false implication that the author is privy to facts about the person that are unknown to the general reader.\u201d). Here, Palladyne\u2019s statement can be read to imply the existence of undisclosed facts that would be detrimental to Friedman\u2019s character. See Hotchner, 551 F.2d at 913. Palladyne indicated that Friedman had taken prior actions that were attempts to \u201cextort\u201d money from the company, but Palladyne did not explain what those prior acts were or provide any details that would shed light on its use of the word \u201cextort,\u201d whether outside of the context of Friedman\u2019s lawsuit or as a reference to it. See Melius, 94 A.D.3d at 961, 943 N.Y.S.2d 134.</p> <p id=\"b212-5\" pgmap=\"212\">The Bloomberg Defendants argue that the article makes clear that Palladyne\u2019s statement refers to the fact that Friedman voiced concerns about the firm\u2019s criminal exposure and then filed this lawsuit in an attempt to extract money from Palladyne. We disagree that it is clear. Although the article stated that Friedman was fired after \u201crelating his concerns about the firm\u2019s criminal exposure to a colleague,\u201d App\u2019x at 37, a reasonable inference remains, based on Palladyne\u2019s statement that Friedman had \u201crepeatedly\u201d attempted to extort the company, that there were multiple acts that Friedman had taken which rose to the level of \u201cextortion.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b212-6\" pgmap=\"212\">Thus, even if Palladyne was asserting an opinion about Friedman\u2019s prior conduct, Palladyne\u2019s statement can still be read as conveying a negative characterization of Friedman without stating sufficient facts to provide the context for that characterization. Under New York law, such a statement is actionable. See Hotchner, 551 F.2d at 913. We therefore reverse the district court\u2019s dismissal of Friedman\u2019s defamation claim based on this statement.</p> <p id=\"b212-7\" pgmap=\"212\">On remand, it will be up to the jury to decide both (1) whether readers understood Palladyne\u2019s statement\u2014\u201crepeatedly tried to extort\u201d\u2014to mean that Friedman engaged in criminal conduct and (2) whether that statement in fact defamed Friedman. See Sack on Defamation \u00a7 2.4.16 (\u201cOnce the judge has determined that the words complained of are capable of a defamatory meaning, that is, are not nonde-famatory as a matter of law, it is for the jury to determine whether they were so understood and whether they in fact defamed the plaintiff.\u201d) (footnotes omitted). We express no view as to how those issues should be decided by the fact finder.</p> <p id=\"b212-8\" pgmap=\"212\">CONCLUSION</p> <p id=\"b212-9\" pgmap=\"212(13) 213(42)\">For the reasons stated above, we AFFIRM the' district court\u2019s dismissal of Friedman\u2019s claims against the Milltown and Palladyne Defendants, and AFFIRM in part and REVERSE in part the dismissal of his claims against the Bloomberg Defendants. We REMAND the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p> <footnote label=\"1\"> <p id=\"b204-9\" pgmap=\"204\">. There is an updated version of this article in the parties\u2019 joint appendix that includes a response from Friedman\u2019s lawyer. Because Friedman does not mention this version or attach it to his complaint, we do not consider it for purposes of this appeal.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"2\"> <p id=\"b205-9\" pgmap=\"205\">. Friedman also asserts that the lower court had jurisdiction over the corporate defendants under Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 33-929. However, he fails to raise any arguments on this point and, therefore, we do not address the district court\u2019s determination to the contrary.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"3\"> <p id=\"b205-14\" pgmap=\"205\">. Section 52-59b(a)(l) provides jurisdiction over certain out-of-state defendants who \"[t]ransact[ ] any business within the state.\u201d Friedman did not appeal the district court\u2019s decision that this provision does not apply.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"4\"> <p id=\"b206-5\" pgmap=\"206\">. We note that Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 52-59b(a)(l) does permit jurisdiction over out-of-state defendants in defamation actions if the defendant \"[transacts any business within the state.\u201d</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"5\"> <p id=\"b207-6\" pgmap=\"207\">. Friedman also states, without explanation, that the long-arm statute's exception for out-of-state defendants in defamation actions violates his due process rights. Federal due process, however, does not compel a state to provide for jurisdiction over out-of-state defendants. Perkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining Co., 342 U.S. 437, 440, 72 S.Ct. 413, 96 L.Ed. 485 (1952) (\"The suggestion that federal due process compels the State to open its courts to such a case [against a foreign defendant] has no substance.\u201d). Instead, the Due Process Clause limits the extent to which a state court may exercise jurisdiction over such defendants. See International Shoe, 326 U.S. at 316, 66 S.Ct. 154.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"6\"> <p id=\"b209-6\" pgmap=\"209\">. Friedman further argues that he is entitled to discovery to determine the source of this statement. However, \"once it is established that the publication is reporting on a judicial proceeding, how a reporter gathers his information concerning a judicial proceeding is immaterial provided his or her story is a fair and substantially accurate portrayal of the events in question.\u201d See Cholowsky v. Civiletti, 69 A.D.3d 110, 115, 887 N.Y.S.2d 592 (N.Y. App. Div. 2d Dep't 2009) (citations and brackets omitted). We therefore find this argument unpersuasive.</p> </footnote> </opinion> </casebody> ",
