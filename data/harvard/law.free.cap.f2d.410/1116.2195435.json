Byrne, Unite! States District Judge, Central District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1179-10\">DUNIWAY, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1179-11\">This bankruptcy case involves the interpretation of \u00a7 9401(1) of the California Uniform Commercial Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellants sold combines to James C. Clark by conditional sales contracts which were filed in the office of the California Secretary of State, but not in the office of the County Recorder. The combines are specialized equipment usable only for harvesting grain. Clark was not a farmer. He owned no land. Instead, he was a \u201ccustom harvester\u201d who used the combines in harvesting the crops of various farmers in Tulare and King Counties on a contract basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-12\">After Clark filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy, appellants repossessed and sold the combines for $30,200, which has been stipulated to be their present fair value. Appellee trustee in bankruptcy then petitioned for an order that the moneys received from the sale be turned over to him. The referee held that the harvesting combines were \u201cequipment used in farming operations,\u201d and that the trustee was therefore entitled to the moneys, because the appellants\u2019 failure to record their security interests in the office of the County Recorder rendered them invalid as against the trustee. The District Court affirmed. So do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-20\">Appellants contend that the phrase \u201cequipment used in farming operations\u201d should be interpreted in light of the occupational status or contractual arrangements of the debtor-purchaser, rather than as referring to the actual intended use of the equipment itself. They claim that the grain harvesting combines, even though only usable for harvesting grain, were not \u201cequipment used in farming operations\u201d in <em>this </em>case, because Clark was not a farmer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1179-21\">Appellants\u2019 argument is based on the language of various provisions of the Code. They point out that \u00a7 9109 classifies goods as \u201cequipment\u201d if, <em>inter alia, </em>they are not included in the definition of \u201cfarm products,\u201d and defines \u201cfarm products\u201d as including supplies only \u201cif they are in the possession of a debtor engaged in raising, fattening, grazing, or other farming operations.\u201d Appellants conclude that the term \u201cfarming operations\u201d is therefore to be restricted to activities in the nature of \u201craising, fattening, or grazing,\u201d under the maxim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>\u201cexpressio unius est exclusio alterius\u201d and the concept \u201cejusdem generis.\u201d Appellants also argue that Clark\u2019s operations were not \u201cessentially local,\u201d since he worked in two different counties, and point out that, according to a Uniform Commercial Code comment,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-4\">\u201cIt is thought that sound policy requires a state-wide filing system for all transactions except the essentially local ones covered in subsection (1) (a) * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1180-5\">They point out that another Code section indicates that the drafters of the Code did not regard commercial harvesting equipment as of an \u201cessentially local\u201d type.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Consequently, they conclude that the Clark financing statements were properly filed in the office of the Secretary of State.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-6\">We are not persuaded. If the drafters of the Code had intended such a result, they could merely have written \u00a7 9401(1) to refer to \u201cequipment of a farmer used in his farming operations.\u201d We doubt that they expected anyone to divine such a result from the references to which appellants refer. And even if the overall rationale for the local filing of financing statements covering equipment used in farming operations is that such transactions are \u201cessentially local,\u201d it would be unworkable to tell secured sellers to file all financing statements centrally unless the transaction is \u201cessentially local.\u201d How does one determine what is or is not \u201cessentially local\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-7\">We think that the drafters of the Code carefully avoided defining \u201cequipment used in farm operations\u201d in terms of the occupational status or contractual arrangements of the debtor-use. In many cases it would be difficult to determine whether or not the debtor was a \u201cfarmer.\u201d One who owns or leases agricultural land, who raises crops thereon, and who purchases harvesting equipment solely for his own use on his own land, would clearly be a farmer within appellants\u2019 construction. But what of a person who owns or leases agricultural land, and farms it, but purchases harvesting equipment with the intention of using it on his own land some of the time, and using it at other times to harvest the crops of his neighbors on a contract basis? Under appellants\u2019 rationale he would be using the equipment <em>as a farmer </em>only when he was using it on his own land. In such a situation, would the equipment dealer have to determine what its \u201cprimary\u201d intended use would be ? Or would the intended use on a particular day or hour control? According to \u00a7 9401(3), a filing made in the proper place continues effective even though the use of the collateral should later change. But the Code does not say at what point one determines what the use is. Should it be when the security interest attaches, when the financing statement is filed, or when? Cf. In re Pelletier, D. Maine, 1968, 5 UCC Rep. 327, 330.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-11\">The phrase \u201cequipment used in farming operations\u201d is clear and unambiguous. That was the only use to which this equipment could be or was put. We decline to resort to a construction that would raise more problems than it would solve.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-12\"> Finally, the California Equipment Dealers Association as amicus curiae suggests that \u00a7 9401(1) is ambiguous, and that we should therefore hold that any good faith attempt by a conditional seller to file a financing statement in the proper place should be sufficient to protect the security interest against a trustee in bankruptcy. But the Code does not allow this result. Section 9401 (2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-13\">\u201cA filing which is made in good faith in an improper place * * * is nev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>ertheless effective * * * against any person who has knowledge of the contents of such financing statement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALcp\">Section 9301(1) provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"apd-dedup-0\">\u201c * * * [A]n unperfected security interest is subordinate to the rights of \u25a0 * * * (b) A person who becomes a lien creditor * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1181-5\">Under section 70c of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 110(c), the trustee in bankruptcy has the status of an ideal hypothetical lien creditor, similar to a creditor without notice \u2014 even if the trustee has actual notice. Collier, Bankruptcy, 14th ed., \u00a7 70.53. And even apart from the Bankruptcy Act provision, the secured party would, under \u00a7 9401(2), have to prove that either the trustee in bankruptcy or perhaps all the unsecured creditors had actual knowledge of the contents of the financing statement. See In re Lux\u2019s Superette, Inc., E.D.Pa., 1962, 206 F.Supp. 368, 371; In re Smith, E.D.Pa., 1962, 205 F.Supp. 27; In re Luckenbill, E.D.Pa., 1957, 156 F.Supp. 129. Appellants have not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1179-16\">. \u201cThe proper place to file in order to perfect a security interest is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1179-18\">(a) When the collateral is equipment used in farming operations, or farm products other than crops, or accounts or contract rights arising from or relating to the sale of farm products by a farmer, or consumer goods, then in the office of the county recorder in the county of the debtor\u2019s residence * * *_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1179-23\">(b) [crops or timber] * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1179-24\">(c) In all other cases, in the office of the Secretary of State.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1179-25\">. According to appellee, of the 49 states which have adopted the Uniform Commercial Code, 39 have adopted filing requirements under which this question could arise. However, this is evidently a ease of first impression.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1180-8\">. 23 West\u2019s Ann.Cal.Codes, p. 547 (comment to Cal.Comm.C. \u00a7 9401).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1180-9\">.
