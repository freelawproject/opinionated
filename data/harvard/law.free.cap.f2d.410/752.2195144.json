The Commissioner makes the same concession in this Court, although for a different reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-16\">The Tax Court, in a well-considered opinion written by Judge Fay, reported in 49 T.C. 356, found that the transaction constituted a net gift and not a part sale, part gift, as contended by the Commissioner, and that the donor did not realize taxable income as a result thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-17\"> The Tax Court also held that a donee\u2019s basis under Section 1015(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 1964 ed. \u00a7 1015) is the same as the donor\u2019s basis, and that under Section 1223(2) the donee is entitled to include the period of time the shares were held by the donor in determining the period during which the stock was held prior to a sale made by donee.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-18\">We are of the opinion that the Tax Court correctly decided the issues in this case, and we affirm on the opinion of Judge Fay.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
