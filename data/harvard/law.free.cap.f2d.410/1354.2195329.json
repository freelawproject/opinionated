There is, however, a preliminary issue which we find to be dispositive of this appeal; whether the district court had jurisdiction to enjoin the National Mediation Board from holding an election to resolve this representation dispute. We hold that the district court was without jurisdiction to enter the injunction and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-24\">In July, 1959, the International Brotherhood of Firemen, Oilers, Helpers, Roundhouse and Railway Shop Laborers filed an application with the National Mediation Board for an investigation of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1356\">*1356</page-number>representation dispute concerning certain Alabama State Docks Department employees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Docks Department, an agency of the State of Alabama,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> owns and operates port facilities at Mobile. Included in this operation are general cargo piers, warehouses, a grain elevator, a cold storage plant, a plant for the storage and loading of edible fats and oils, a special unloading facility for bulk ores, and a terminal railroad. The prospective constituents of the petitioning Brotherhood are all of the employees of the Docks Department except those working for the terminal railroad, which employees are already represented by unions certified under the Railway Labor Act, and the office and clerical workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-4\">As a jurisdictional prerequisite to its assumption of jurisdiction of this representation dispute, the National Mediation Board determined that the entire Docks Department was a \u201ccarrier\u201d within the scope of 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 151, First (1954). That section provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1418-5\">\u201cFirst. The term \u2018carrier\u2019 includes <em>any </em>express company, sleeping-car company, <em>carrier by railroad, </em>subject to the Interstate Commerce Act, <em>and any company, which is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by or under common control with any carrier by railroad and which operates any equipment or facilities or performs any service </em>(other than trucking service) <em>in connection with the transportation, receipt, delivery, elevation, transfer in transit, refrigeration or icing, storage, and handling of property transported by railroad, </em>and any receiver, trustee, or other individual or body, judicial or otherwise, when in the possession of the business of any such \u2018carrier\u2019: Provided, however, That the term \u2018carrier\u2019 shall not include any street, interurban, or suburban electric railway, unless such railway is operating as a part of a general steam-railroad system of transportation, but shall not exclude any part of the general steam-railroad system of transportation now or hereafter operated by any other motive power. The Interstate Commerce Commission is authorized and directed upon request of the Mediation Board or upon complaint of any party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1357\">*1357</page-number>interested to determine after hearing whether any line operated by electric power falls within the terms of this proviso. The term \u2018carrier\u2019 shall not include any company by reason of its being engaged in the mining of coal, the supplying of coal to a carrier where delivery is not beyond the mine tipple, and the operation of equipment or facilities therefor, or in any of such activities.\u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1419-5\">In making this determination, the Mediation Board noted that the terminal railroad was eoncededly a \u201ccarrier\u201d and that both the terminal railroad and the public maritime facilities were subunits of the Docks Department. Since 45 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 151, First, by its terms covers companies \u201cunder common control with any carrier by railroad,\u201d the Board concluded that the Docks Department was a \u201ccarrier\u201d under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-6\">The Docks Department has from the beginning of this epic controversy contended that the Mediation Board erred in finding that it had jurisdiction because the Department was a \u201ccarrier.\u201d When the Board first requested the Department\u2019s books and records in order to determine which employees were eligible to vote for union representation, the Department refused the request on the ground that the Board was acting without statutory authority. After considerable skirmishing in the district court and two appeals to this court, we held that the Board had made a sufficient showing that the Department was a \u201ccarrier\u201d to warrant an order giving the Board access to the records.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> United States v. Feaster, 5 Cir. 1967, 376 F.2d 147, cert. denied, 389 U.S. 920, 88 S.Ct. 237, 19 L.Ed.2d 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-11\">After finally obtaining the books and records, the Board determined which employees should participate in the representation election and scheduled the election for March 8, 1968. The state and its Dock Department officials declined to post notices of the election and secured from the court below an injunction prohibiting the holding of the election on the ground that the Docks Department was not subject to the Kail-way Labor Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, after a decade <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1359\">*1359</page-number>we find the statutory command to attain a prompt and orderly settlement of labor disputes <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> made a mockery in cynical disregard of the Supreme Court\u2019s hopeful but here frustrated words that there is \u201cto be no dragging out of the controversy into other tribunals of law.\u201d Switchmen\u2019s Union of North America v. National Mediation Board, 320 U.S. 297, 305, 64 S.Ct. 95, 99, 88 L.Ed. 61, 66. As we are witness these days to much vocalizing for participatory democracy, we can feel nothing but dismay at the length of the enforced employee-union disengagement here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-6\">The National Mediation Board argues that the court below did not have jurisdiction over this controversy and that we should reverse the judgment. The Mediation Board\u2019s argument has a dual predicate: (1) that proceedings of the National Mediation Board conducted pursuant to 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 152, Ninth, are never subject to judicial review; and (2) assuming that this controversy may be subject to judicial review, it is not ripe for review at this time because the administrative process has not culminated in a final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-8\">In arguing that the representation proceedings at bar are not reviewable, the Mediation Board relies heavily on Switchmen\u2019s Union of North America v. N.L.R.B., 1943, 320 U.S. 297, 64 S.Ct. 95, 88 L.Ed. 61. In Switchmen\u2019s Union the Supreme Court was asked to resolve a jurisdictional dispute between two unions seeking to represent certain railroad yardmen. The Court, however, refused to reach the merits of the case, holding that the matter was unreviewable. The Court explained its decision as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1421-14\">\u201cWe do not reach the merits of the controversy. For we are of the opinion that the District Court did not have the power to review the action of the National Mediation Board in issuing the certificate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1421-15\">\u201cSec. 24(8) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 41(8), 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 41(8) [8 FCA title 28, \u00a7 41(8)], gives the federal district courts \u2018original jurisdiction\u2019 of all \u2018suits and proceedings arising under any law regulating commerce.\u2019 We may assume that if any judicial review of the certificate of the Board could be had, the District Court would have jurisdiction by reason of that provision of the Judicial Code, [cases cited] But we do not think that that broad grant of general jurisdiction may be invoked in face of the special circumstances which obtain here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1421-16\">\u201cIf the absence of jurisdiction of the federal courts meant a sacrifice or obliteration of a right which Congress had created, the inference would be strong that Congress intended the statutory provisions governing the general jurisdiction of those courts to control. That was the purport of the decisions of this Court in Texas &amp; N. O. R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Ry. &amp; S. S. Clerks, 281 U.S. 548, 50 S.Ct. 427, 74 L.Ed. 1034, and Virginian Ry. Co. v. System Federation, R.E.D., 300 U.S. 515, 57 S.Ct. 592, 81 L.Ed. 789. In those cases it was apparent that but for the general jurisdiction of the federal courts there would be no remedy to enforce the statutory commands which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1360\">*1360</page-number>Congress had written into the Railway Labor Act. The result would have been that the \u2018right\u2019 of collective bargaining was unsupported by any legal sanction. That would have robbed the Act of its vitality and thwarted its purpose. Such considerations are not applicable here. The Act in \u00a7 2, Fourth writes into law the \u2018right\u2019 of the \u2018majority of any craft or class of employees\u2019 to \u2018determine who shall be the representative of the craft or class for the purposes of this Act.\u2019 That \u2018right\u2019 is protected by \u00a7 2, Ninth which gives the Mediation Board the power to resolve controversies concerning it and as an incident thereto to determine what is the appropriate craft or class in which the election should be held, [cases cited] A review by the federal district courts of the Board\u2019s determination is not necessary to preserve or protect that \u2018right.\u2019 Congress for reasons of its own decided upon the method for the protection of the \u2018right\u2019 which it created. It selected the precise machinery and fashioned the tool which it deemed suited to that end. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-4\">******</p>\n<p id=\"AuXm\">\u201cGeneralizations as to when judicial review of administrative action may or may not be obtained are of course hazardous. Where Congress has not expressly authorized judicial review, the type of problem involved and the history of the statute in question become highly relevant in determining whether judicial review may be nonetheless supplied.</p>\n<p id=\"Afd\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-5\">\u201cIn that connection the history of \u00a7 2, Ninth is highly relevant. It was introduced into the Act in 1934 as a device to strengthen and make more effective the processes of collective bargaining, [case cited] It was aimed not only at company unions which had long plagued labor relations [case cited] but also at numerous jurisdictional disputes between unions. Commissioner Eastman, draftsman of the 1934 amendments, explained the bill at the Congressional hearings. He stated that whether one organization or another was the proper representative of a particular group of employees was \u2018one of the most controversial questions in connection with labor organization matters.\u2019 [citations] He stated that it was very important \u2018to provide a neutral tribunal which can make the decision and get the matter settled.\u2019 [citation] But the problem was deemed to be so \u2018highly controversial\u2019 that it was thought that the prestige of the Mediation Board might be adversely affected by the rulings which it would have to make in these jurisdictional disputes, [citations] Accordingly \u00a7 2 Ninth was drafted so as to give to the Mediation Board the power to \u2018appoint a committee of three neutral persons who after hearing shall within ten days designate the employees who may participate in the election.\u2019 That was added so that the Board\u2019s \u2018own usefulness of settling disputes that might arise thereafter might not be impaired.\u2019 [citations] Where Congress took such great pains to protect the Mediation Board in its handling of an explosive problem, we cannot help but believe that if Congress had desired to implicate the federal judiciary and to place on the federal courts the burden of having the final say on any aspect of the problem, it would have made its desire plain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-7\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-8\">\u201cIn the present case the authority of the Mediation Board in election disputes to interpret the meaning of \u2018craft\u2019 as used in the statute is no less clear and no less essential to the performance of its duty. The statutory command that the decisi\u00f3n of the Board shall be obeyed is no less explicit. Under this Act Congress did not give the Board discretion to take or withhold action, to 'grant or deny relief. It gave it no enforcement functions. It was to find the fact and then cease. Congress prescribed the command. Like the command in the Butte [A. &amp; P.] Ry. Co. case [Butte, A. &amp; P. Ry. Co. v. United States, 290 U.S. 127, 54 S.Ct. 108, 78 L.Ed. 222] it contained no exception. Here as in that case the intent seems plain \u2014 the dispute was to reach its last terminal point when the administrative finding was made. There was to be no dragging out of the controversy into other tribunals of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-9\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1361\">*1361</page-number>\u201cWhat is open when a court of equity is asked for its affirmative help by granting a decree for the enforcement of a certificate of the Mediation Board under \u00a7 2, Ninth raises questions not now before us.

Kenan, 5 Cir. 1937, 87 F.2d 651; Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. National Mediation Board, 1936, 66 App.D.C. 375, 88 F.2d 757.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-7\">On its face <em>Switchmen\u2019s Union </em>appears to preclude all review of National Mediation Board decisions in representation proceedings. The sweeping language of <em>Switchmen\u2019s Union </em>and its progeny, however, has been explained and narrowed somewhat in the more than two decades since the opinion was written, <em>cf., </em>e. g., Order of Railway Conductors v. Swan, 1947, 329 U.S. 520, 67 S.Ct. 405, 91 L.Ed. 471; Brotherhood of R. T. v. Howard, 1952, 343 U.S. 768, 72 S.Ct. 1022, 96 L.Ed. 1283. During this period courts have limited <em>Switchmen\u2019s Union </em>by considering the factual context of the opinion (craft jurisdiction dispute), the effect of the subsequent adoption of the Administrative Procedure Act in 1946,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the possibility of review by a court of equity when the National Mediation Board asks the court for affirmative help in enforcing its certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-12\">(A)</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-13\">It is arguable that <em>Switchmen\u2019s Union </em>can be distinguished from the case at bar. There the Supreme Court was faced with a jurisdiction dispute between two rival unions seeking to represent the same railroad yardmen, and the issue decided was whether the Board\u2019s use of its discretion to resolve the dispute was reviewable. \u201cThe question was not as to the power of the Board to resolve the dispute but whether it had done so in an erroneous manner.\u201d Air Line Dispatchers Ass\u2019n v. National Mediation Board, 1951, 89 U.S.App.D.C. 24, 189 F.2d 685, 688, cert. denied, 342 U.S. 849, 72 S.Ct. 77, 96 L.Ed. 641. Furthermore, the Supreme Court emphasized that \u201cGeneralizations as to when judicial review of administrative action may or may not be obtained are of course hazardous. Where Congress has not expressly authorized judicial review [as in the case <em>sub judice'], </em>the type of problem involved\u201d as well as the \u201chistory of the statute in question\u201d becomes highly relevant. 320 U.S. at 301, 64 S.Ct. at 97, 88 L.Ed. at 64. Thus it might be said that while <em>Switchmen\u2019s Union </em>holds that there is no judicial review where the Board has exercised its informed discretion in resolving inter-union representation disputes, it does not preclude judicial review of questions of law which bear directly upon the jurisdiction of the Mediation Board.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Air Line Dispatchers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1362\">*1362</page-number>Ass\u2019n v.

In Air Line Dispatchers Ass\u2019n v. National Mediation Board, <em>supra, </em>wherein the D.C. Circuit was confronted with the \u201cpurely legal question of the territorial jurisdiction of the Board,\u201d the Court wrote that <em>Switchmen\u2019s Union </em>had been partially undermined by these review provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Au90\">\u201cThe law was in this posture when the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S. C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1001-1011) was approved June 11, 1946. In \u00a7 10 it provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-10\">\u2018Except so far as (1) statutes preclude judicial review or (2) agency action is by law committed to agency discretion\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-11\">\u2018(a) Right of Review. \u2014 Any person suffering legal wrong because of any agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by such action within the meaning of any relevant statute, shall be entitled to judicial review thereof.\u2019 (5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1009.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-12\">\u201cWe pointed out in Kirkland v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., supra, that the limitations upon judicial review set forth in the Switchmen\u2019s and like cases must be considered as read into the Administrative Procedure Act; that is, review is not available under \u00a7 10 where a statute, as judicially interpreted, precludes it. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-13\">\u201cNevertheless the purpose of \u00a7 10 is to afford review unless the matter has been committed to agency discretion\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1363\">*1363</page-number>a situation not now presented \u2014 or unless Congress has otherwise decided. When, as in the Switchmen\u2019s case, it had been held that Congress had manifested its intention to exclude review the new legislation was not to be construed as changing the situation. On the other hand, the general purport of the statute is that persons suffering legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved thereby, should be allowed by \u00a7 10 to obtain judicial consideration, [citation]. The statement in the Switch-men\u2019s opinion (320 U.S. at page 343, 64 S.Ct. at page 145, 88 L.Ed. 85), referred to above, that in view of the history of the Railway Labor Act a purpose to afford judicial remedy must plainly appear should now be read in the light of the purpose of the Administrative Procedure Act subsequently enacted: \u2018Legislative intent to forbid judicial review must be, if not specific and in terms, at least clear, convincing, and unmistakable under this bill. The mere fact that Congress has not expressly provided for judicial review would be completely immaterial.\u2019 [citation].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-5\">\u201c(C). The type of question now presented was, as we have said, in the area of those reserved under the Railway Labor Act. This being so, and because of the nature of the question, we are of the opinion that the Administrative Procedure Act indicates a Congressional purpose to authorize review of it by the courts. Since it is not a question of the type previously held unreviewable, and since there is no explicitness in the Railway Labor Act or indication in its history of a Congressional intention to leave it exclusively to Board determination, the provisions of \u00a7 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act for court review take hold of it.\u201d 189 F.2d at 685.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1425-6\">But <em>cf. </em>American Air Export &amp; Import Co. v. O\u2019Neill, 1954, 95 U.S.App.D.C. 274, 221 F.2d 829.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-9\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-10\"><em>Switchmen\u2019s Union </em>itself suggests a third route around its own seemingly impenetrable barrier against judicial review. <em>cf. </em>United States v.

National Mediation Board, D.D.C. 1966, 255 F.Supp. 466, 467, focused upon this crack in the door to judicial review left by <em>Switchmen\u2019s Union. </em>He considered \u201cmatters that appeal to the conscience of a Court of equity\u201d and reached the conclusion \u201cthat the strong arm of equity should not be exerted in order to compel the employer to bargain collectively with the union having a plurality of votes when by far the greater number of employees voted for no union at all.\u201d The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, without detailing the \u201cpowers of an equity court when faced with a suit for a mandatory injunction to compel compliance with section 2, Ninth of the Act,\u201d reversed the judgment of the district court. 127 U.S.App.D.C. 77, 380 F.2d 624, 627, cert. denied, 389 U.S. 912, 88 S.Ct. 237, 19 L.Ed.2d 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-13\">From this brief sojourn into the land of equity we know that courts have only a very, very limited equitable power to refuse enforcement of Mediation Board certifications. Limited as its role may be, equity may still ultimately play a part in the final disposition of this case. <em>cf. </em>Shields v. Utah Idaho C. R. Co., 1938, 305 U.S. 177, 183, 59 S.Ct. 160, 83 L.Ed. 111, 116. However, for reasons set forth <em>infra, </em>we do not now decide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1364\">*1364</page-number>whether the district court will be forever foreclosed from dispensing equity in this controversy. We do hold that here the district court was premature in such dispensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-5\">The foregoing authorities indicate that it is possible, but far from certain, that the National Mediation Board\u2019s determination that the Docks Department is a \u201ccarrier\u201d may <em>eventually </em>be a proper subject for judicial review. However, even if we assume for the sake of argument that the Mediation Board\u2019s action is reviewable, we cannot reach the merits of the controversy because the case is not yet ripe for judicial involvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-6\">The Mediation Board has investigated the dispute, has found that it has jurisdiction, and has ordered an election. The administrative process, nonetheless, remains incomplete because the election has not been held and the Mediation Board\u2019s certificate, which \u201cis the ultimate finding of fact prerequisite to enforcement by the courts,\u201d has not been issued.

This general rule is particularly appropriate to the resolution of labor representation disputes since the Act places a great premium on speed and seeks to limit the opportunity for \u201cdilatory tactics which would postpone the commencement of bargaining when the employer [has] no substantial objections to the conduct of the election other than a desire to delay bargaining as long as possible.\u201d Boire v.

In accord with this statutory policy, the Supreme Court has held that an employer\u2019s attempt to litigate a question of statutory construction prior to final Labor Board action \u201cis at war with the long-settled rule of judicial administration that no one is entitled to judicial relief for a supposed or threatened injury until the prescribed administrative remedy has been exhausted. That rule has been repeatedly acted on in cases where, as here, the contention is made that the administrative body lacked power over the subject matter.\u201d Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbldg.

But the presence of public questions particularly high in the scale of our national interest because of their international complexion is a uniquely compelling justification for prompt judicial resolution of the controvery over the Board\u2019s power.

This action was a brazen defiance of the express provisions of 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 159(b) (1).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1367\">*1367</page-number>trict Court, whose judgment was affirmed by the Second Circuit, held that the Board had acted in excess of its powers and set aside the Board\u2019s determination even though it was not a \u201cfinal order.\u201d \u201cOn the Board\u2019s appeal it did not contest the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the Board, in commingling professional with nonprofessional employees in the unit, had acted in excess of its powers and had thereby worked injury to the statutory rights of the professional employees. Instead, it contended only that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the suit.\u201d 358 U.S. at 187, 79 S.Ct. at 183, 3 L.Ed.2d at 213'. In this extreme factual context, the Supreme Court held that the District Court had original jurisdiction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1429-5\">\u201cThis suit is not one to \u2018review,\u2019 in the sense of that term as used in the Act, a decision of the Board made within its jurisdiction. Rather it is one to strike down an order of the Board made in excess of its delegated powers and contrary to a specific prohibition in the Act. * * * Plainly, this was an attempted exercise of power that had been specifically withheld. It deprived the professional employees of a \u2018right\u2019 assured to them by Congress. Surely, in these circumstances, a Federal District Court has jurisdiction of an original suit to prevent deprivation of a right so given.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aki-dedup-0\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa-B\">\u201cHere, differently from the Switch-men\u2019s case, \u2018absence of jurisdiction of the federal courts\u2019 would mean \u2018a sacrifice or obliteration of a right which Congress\u2019 has given professional employees, for there is no other means, within their control [case cited] to protect and enforce that right. And \u2018the inference [is] strong that Congress intended the statutory provisions governing the general jurisdiction of those courts to control.\u2019 [citation] This Court cannot lightly infer that Congress does not intend judicial protection of rights it confers against agency action taken in excess of delegated powers, [cases cited].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1429-6\">\u201cWhere, as here, Congress has given a \u2018right\u2019 to the professional employees it must be held that it intended that right to be enforced, and \u2018the courts * * * encounter no difficulty in fulfilling its purpose.\u2019 [case cited]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1429-8\">The Court of Appeals was right in holding, in the circumstances of this case, that the District Court had jurisdiction of this suit, and its judgment is affirmed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1429-9\">Leedom v. Kyne could easily have opened the doors of the federal courts to matters which Congress has declared are to be, initially at least, the arbitraments of the Mediation Board and the NLRB. History and the Supreme Court, however, have shown the contrary to be the case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ahj-dedup-2\">\u201cIt is sometimes said that in Leedom v. Kyne, 358 U.S. 184, 79 S.Ct. 180, 3 L.Ed.2d 210 (1958), the Court created an \u2018exception\u2019 to the doctrine of Switchmen\u2019s Union. In Kyne, it was held that the law afforded a remedy in the courts when unlawful action by the National Labor Relations Board inflicted injury on one of the parties to a bargaining dispute. But this was no exception to Switchmen\u2019s Union. Rather the Court was careful to note that \u2018[t]his suit is not one to \u201creview,\u201d in the sense of that term as used in the Act, a decision of the Board made within its jurisdiction. Rather it is one to strike down an order of the Board made in excess of its delegated powers and contrary to a <em>specific prohibition in the Act.\u2019 </em>Leedom v. Kyne, 358 U.S. 184, 188, 79 S.Ct. 180, 184 [3 L.Ed.2d 210, 214]. (Emphasis supplied.) The limited nature of this holding was re-emphasized only last Term where we referred to the \u2018narrow limits' and \u2018painstakingly delineated procedural boundaries of Kyne.\u2019 Boire v. Greyhound Corp., 376 U.S. 473, 481, 84 S.Ct. 894, 899, 11 L.Ed.2d 849 [855] (1964).

Kyne represents only a narrow and rarely successfully invoked exception to the doctrine that exhaustion of administrative procedures is a condition precedent to federal court jurisdiction. Under this exception access to the courts is accorded only if the Mediation Board\u2019s determination is infused with error which is of a <em>summa </em>or <em>magna </em>quality as contra-posed to decisions which are simply <em>cum, </em>error. Only the egregious error melds the Board\u2019s decision into justiciability. Lesser malignancies thwart the jurisdiction of the courts. Modern Plastics Corporation v.

With these strictures in mind, we turn to the merits of this case to determine whether there was such an obvious or gross misapplication of statutory dictates that jurisdiction was vested in the district court, or whether the district court erred in not dismissing for lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1430-10\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-11\">In determining that the Docks Department was a \u201ccarrier,\u201d the Mediation Board gave a literal reading to 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 151, First, which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1430-12\">\u201cThe term \u2018carrier\u2019 includes any express company, sleeping-car company, carrier by railroad, subject to the Interstate Commerce Act, <em>and any company which is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by or under common control with any carrier by railroad and which operates any equipment or facilities or performs any service other than trucking service) in connection with the transportation, receipt, delivery, elevation, transfer in transit, refrigeration or icing, storage, and handling of property transported </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1369\">*1369</page-number><em>by railroad </em>* * * (Emphasis supplied.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1431-4\">The Mediation Board, as noted earlier in the opinion, found that the Terminal Railroad was concededly a \u201ccarrier\u201d and that the State of Alabama controlled both the Docks Department and the Terminal Railroad. Since the Docks Department was \u201cunder common control with [a] carrier by railroad,\u201d the Mediation Board reasoned that the Docks Department was a \u201ccarrier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-5\">The Docks Department argues that the Mediation Board\u2019s determination, although in accord with the words of the Act, clearly contravenes the Congressional intent that the Railway Labor Act should regulate only the \u201crailroad world\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and its essential adjuncts. In this regard it points out that the Supreme Court has \u201ccautioned against a literal reading of congressional labor legislation; such legislation is often the product of conflict and compromise between strongly held and opposed views, and its proper construction frequently requires consideration of its wording against the background of its legislative history and&gt;- in the light of the general objectives Congress sought to achieve.\u201d Wirtz v.

See Northwest Airlines v. Jackson, 8 Cir. 1950, 185 F.2d 74, 77; Walling v. Baltimore Steam Packet Co., 4 Cir. 1944, 144 F.2d 130. The essence of this argument is reflected in the following language from Pan American World Airways v. United Brotherhood of Carpenters, <em>supra, </em>324 F.2d at 220-221:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1431-10\">\u201cThe purpose of the restrictive provisions of the Railway Labor Act is to keep transportation moving. * * * The statute thus made certain that railroads could not escape the application of the statute to activities closely related to railroad transportation, by having those activities carried on by subsidiary or controlled enterprises. Here the attention of the statute was upon transportation and activities accessory to transportation. Would Congress at the same time and in the same statute, in \u00a7 151, Fifth, have intended to make the coverage of the word \u2018employee\u2019 in the Act depend, not at all upon the employee\u2019s relation to transportation, but upon the logically irrelevant fact that his employer owned a railroad, in addition to the shoe factory in which the \u2018employee\u2019 worked?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1431-11\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1431-12\">An intent on the part of Congress to lift the employees of our hypothetical shoe factory, or of our actual Nuclear Research Development Station, out of the legal area occupied by most other workmen in the country who do exactly the same work under exactly the same conditions and surroundings, and place them, for employment relations purposes, in the \u2018state within a state\u2019 occupied by railroad and air transportation workers would be so incongruous as to suggest that there must be some reason, though not readily apparent, why Congress entertained such an intent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1431-13\">In the <em>Pan American </em>case the issue was whether employees of Pan American (a carrier) who were involved in preventive maintenance of electrical equipment and fuel storage facilities at a nuclear research development station were covered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1370\">*1370</page-number><em>by </em>the Railway Labor Act.

It says that the Terminal Railroad was only a minor part of the dock facility and that the primary function and activity of the docks is the loading, unloading, and storage of waterborne freight. Since the commercial emphasis of the facility is water rather than rail oriented, the Docks Department argues that it would travesty Congressional intent to hold that the Act applied to the facts of this case.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See Allen v.

Moreover, it argues that the claustrophobic \u201crailroad world\u201d of which the Docks Department speaks so possessively and sentimentally is a world largely enshrined in museums and is unrelated to the expansionist railroad world of the Twentieth Century. The essence of the Mediation Board\u2019s argument is that the specific words of the Act cover activities which the early inventors of the iron horse never conceived and that this Court should construe the Act accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-4\">In support of its decision not to bifurcate the Mobile dock facilities between maritime and railroad activities, the Mediation Board relies heavily upon Railroad Ret. Bd. v. Duquesne Warehouse Co., <em>supra. </em>In <em>Duquesne </em>the Supreme Court held that a carrier-owned warehouse which performed functions analogous to those of the Docks Department at bar was under common control with a carrier by railroad and was therefore subject to the Railroad Retirement Act. The Court explained its decision as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1433-5\">\u201cWe have noted the loading and unloading services rendered by Du-quesne. The duty of unloading carload freight * * * is a transportation service within the meaning of the Interstate Commerce Act. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALgs\">\u201cDuquesne\u2019s answer is that the service of loading and unloading is done by it for its customers, that these services are rendered before railroad transporation has begun or after it has ended, that they are not and cannot be a part of railroad transportation since the tariff of the Pennsylvania forbids it from performing the services. Duquesne\u2019s conclusion is that under such circumstances loading and unloading are not and cannot be a part of railroad transportation. The question, however, is not whether in these cases the service of loading and unloading is being rendered by the Pennsylvania and is, therefore, in fact a part of its transportation service. It is not whether the affiliate would itself be subject to the Interstate Commerce Act. It is whether a carrier\u2019s affiliate is performing a service that could be performed by the carrier and charged for under the line-haul tariffs. If it is a service, it is a transportation service within the meaning of the present Acts. * * * In other words if a service is involved which the railroad could perform as a part of its transportation service, it is within the present Acts. It then makes no diff\u00e9rence that it is performed by a carrier affiliate rather than by the carrier itself.

Consequently, in view of the statutory words \u201cany company * * * under common control with any carrier by railroad\u201d and the expanding concepts of railroading, we cannot say that the Mediation Board\u2019s interpretation of the statute was error of the <em>magna </em>or <em>summa </em>quality neees-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1372\">*1372</page-number>sary to vest the district court with jurisdiction. <em>cf. </em>Frito-Lay v.

The Terminal Railway files an annual report of all of its activities with the Interstate Commerce Commission on a form provided by the Interstate Commerce Commission. Since 1950 all of the employees of the Terminal Railway have been and are now represented by \u2018labor organizations, national in scope,\u2019 authorized to represent employees of railroads pursuant to the Railway Labor Act, Section 151 et seq. of Title 45 of the United States Code. Since 1950 collective bargaining agreements between the Terminal Railway and labor organizations, national in scope, have been and are now in existence covering all employees of the Terminal Railway. Only employees of the Terminal Railway are covered by these collective bargaining agreements. The Terminal Railway pays taxes to the United States on each of its employees and officials pursuant to the Railroad Retirement Tax Act, Section 3201 et seq. of Title 26 of the United States Code and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, Section 351 et seq. of Title 45 of the United States Code.

The Terminal Railway performs switching services only. Switching services performed by the Terminal Railway consist of moving railroad cars from one point to another on interchange tracks maintained jointly by the Terminal Railway and line haul carriers, tracks of the Terminal Railway and private tracks. All of the compensation of the Terminal Railway is derived from switching and demurrage; the Terminal Railway does not receive any compensation as an originating carrier or as a line haul carrier.

The maritime facilities of the Department are charged exactly the same amount for an extra switch as is charged to a private industry served by the Terminal Railway. No distinction is made between a maritime facility of the Department and a private industry with respect to services rendered by the Terminal Railway ; all are treated equally.

In areas where the National Labor Relations Board has considerable discretion, judicial review is very circumscribed. For example, the Board has great discretion in the determination of appropriate bargaining units, which determinations may involve the resolution of inter-union and/or craft jurisdictional disputes (as in <em>Switchmen\u2019s Union), </em>and in these matters \u201cthe decision of the Board, if not final, is rarely to be disturbed.\u201d Packard Motor Car Co. v. N. L. R. B., 1947, 330 U.S. 485, 491, 67 S.Ct. 789, 793, 91 L.Ed. 1040, 1050. See also N. L. R. B. v. Tallahassee Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 5 Cir. 1969, 409 F.2d 201; N. L. R. B. v.

Where, however, the Board has ruled on a question of law which affects its jurisdiction (as in the case <em>sub \u00cdndice), </em>the courts have a broader scope of review and may even substitute their judgment for that of the Board. For example, in Office Employees Intern. Union v. N. L. R. B., 1957, 353 U.S. 313, 77 S.Ct. 799, 1 L.Ed.2d 846, the Supreme Court held that the Board had misinterpreted the Act when it held that a labor organization which has employees should not be treated as an \u201cemployer\u201d under \u00a7 2(2) of the Act. In holding that the organization was an employer, the Court gave the Board jurisdiction over the labor dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-15\">To summarize the foregoing, under the Labor Management Relations Act the scope of judicial review of representation disputes of the type involved in <em>Switch-men\u2019s Union </em>is very narrow. However, questions of statutory construction which relate to the extent of the Labor Board\u2019s jurisdictional power are subject to full judicial review. Viewing the language of <em>Switchmen\u2019s Union </em>in the light of this experience under the Labor Management Relations Act, it is arguable that the Supreme Court intended to proscribe review of National Mediation Board decisions only in areas where the Board was merely exercising discretionary powers granted by the Act, and that it did not intend to eliminate judicial review of questions relating to the extent of these Mediation Board powers, <em>cf. </em>Brotherhood of Ry. &amp; S.

The importance of Leedom v. Kyne to the case before us lies not only in its significance as an exception to the general rule of exhaustion, but also in the fact that it is the only undisputed exception to <em>Smtohmen\u2019s </em>doctrine that Mediation Board decisions in representation matters are unreviewable. \u201cIt is generally assumed that <em>Leedom </em>does apply to matters arising under the Railway Labor Act.\u201d International Brotherhood of Teamsters v.

Leedom v. Kyne is also narrowly construed where the issue is whether and how the Mediation Board should conduct an election in a representation dispute over which the Board has jurisdiction. In International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. Brotherhood of Rail., A. &amp; S. Cl., <em>supra, </em>402 F.2d at 204-205, Judge Leventhal, after reviewing <em>Switchmen\u2019s Union, </em>its ancestors and progeny, and its statutory setting, gives us a jurisdictional formulation of the scope of such review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1430-7\">\u201cThe nub of the matter is this: The courts must put aside the kinds of disquietude that we have sketched in deference to the doctrine of <em>Switchmen\u2019s Union </em>that the courts have no jurisdiction to intervene in representation disputes committed by the Railway Labor Act to final Board action. The Act puts a premium on speed of resolution; indeed the Board is directed to resolve representation disputes within 30 days. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1430-8\">\u201cThat purpose may be fulfilled only if the courts are extremely chary of involving themselves. The narrow exceptions to the \u2018jurisdictional\u2019 bar created by Leedom v. Kyne, and similar cases must be instances of constitutional dimension or gross violation of the statute. The exception inevitably eliminates any strict concept of lack of jurisdiction, since it permits a peek at the merits. The reconciliation of doctrine lies not in concepts but in practicalities. The retention of the doctrine negativing jurisdiction to consider the merits serves to confine the assertion of jurisdiction to cases where the error on the merits is as obvious on the face of the papers as the violation of specific statutory language, without extension to \u2018arguing in terms of policy and broad generalities as to what the Railway Labor Act should provide.\u2019 As this court has written, the Board\u2019s action must be \u2018so plainly beyond the bounds of the Act, or * * * so clearly in defiance of it, as to warrant the immediate intervention of an equity court.\u2019 This case does not bring us to such a pass.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1431-7\">. \u201cThe railroad world for which the [Railway Labor] Act was designed has been described as \u2018a state within a state.

Taylor, 1957, 353 U.S. 553, 565-566, 77 S.Ct. 1037, 1044, 1 L.Ed.2d 1034.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1432-5\">. Notwithstanding arguments to the contrary, the fact that the Docks Department is an agency of the State of Alabama does not of itself foil statutory applicability. Although 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 151, First, refers to a <em>\u201ccompany </em>* * * under common control with any carrier by railroad,\u201d it is well settled that the Railway Labor Act applies to carriers operated by sovereign states as well as to corporations. In California v. Taylor, 1957, 353 U.S. 553, 77 S.Ct. 1037, 1 L.Ed.2d 1034, the Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A41\">\u201cThe question presented here is whether the Railway Labor Act * * * applies to the State Belt Railroad, a common carrier owned and operated by the State of California and engaged in interstate commerce.

The principal unions in the railroad industry are national in scope, and their officials are intimately acquainted with the problems, traditions and conditions of the railroad industry. Bargaining collectively with these officials has often taken on a national flavor, and agreements are uniformly negotiated for an entire railroad system. \u2018[Breakdowns in collective bargaining will typically affect a region or the entire nation.\u2019 [citation] It is by no means unreasonable to assume that Congress, aware of these characteristics of labor relations in the interconnected system which comprises our national railroad industry, intended that collective bargaining, as fostered and protected by the Railway Labor Act, should apply to all railroads. Congress no doubt concluded that a uniform method of dealing with the labor problems of the railroad industry would tend to eliminate inequities, and would promote a desirable mobility within the railroad labor force.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1432-14\">\u201cFinally, the State suggests that Congress has no constitutional power to interfere with the \u2018sovereign right\u2019 of a State to control its employment relationships on a state-owned railroad engaged in interstate commerce. In United States v. State of California, supra [297 U.S. 175, 56 S.Ct. 421, 80 L.Ed. 567], this Court said that the State, although acting in its sovereign capacity in operating this Belt Railroad, necessarily so acted \u2018in subordination to the power to regulate interstate commerce, which has been granted specifically to the national government.\u2019 * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1432-17\">\u201c \u2018California, by engaging in interstate commerce by rail, has subjected itself to the commerce power, and is liable for a violation of the Safety Appliance Act, as ax\u2019e other cax-riers * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1432-18\">\u201cThat principle is no less applicable here. If California, by engaging in interstate commerce by rail, subjects itself to the commerce power so that Congress can make it conform to federal safety requirements, it also lias subjected itself to that power so that Congress can regulate its employment relationships.
