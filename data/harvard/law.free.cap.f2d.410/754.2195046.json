Appellant sought review in the Tax Court which allowed her $63.97 more in deductible charitable contributions in 1964 and $13.25 more in 1965 than the Commissioner had allowed; as to the remainder of the disallowed deductions the Tax Court agreed with the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-30\">After examination of the record before us we find that the determinations are not clearly erroneous and affirm the Tax Court.
