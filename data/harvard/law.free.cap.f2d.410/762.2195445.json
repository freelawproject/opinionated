At the time of filing that \u00a7 2255 motion, Aeby had pending in this court an appeal from the district court\u2019s order denying, without a hearing, his third \u00a7 2255 motion. It is for this reason that the district court has refrained from acting.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-23\">Since the date of filing his mandamus application, the court has issued its opinion on Aeby\u2019s \u00a7 2255 appeal. Aeby v. United States, 5 Cir. 1969, 409 F.2d 1 (1969). In light of that opinion, it becomes unnecessary to further consider the mandamus application. Accordingly, the application is dismissed without prejudice to Aeby to proceed as per the instructions contained in this court\u2019s opinion in No. 26363.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
