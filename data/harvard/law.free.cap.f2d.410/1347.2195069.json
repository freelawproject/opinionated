NLRB, 1951, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and we therefore enforce the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-14\">Enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1410-8\">. Pursuant to new Rule 18 of the Rules of this Court, we have concluded on the merits that this case is of such character as not to justify oral argument and have directed the Clerk to place the case on the Summary Calendar and to notify the parties in writing. See Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 5th Cir. 1969, 409 F.2d 804, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1410-9\">. The Board decision and order are reported at 171 NLRB No. 165. The Board\u2019s order requires the Union to cease and desist from \u201cpicketing, or causing to be picketed, or threatening to picket [the Company] for a period of 1 year from January 29, 1968, and for the period during which another labor organization is the duly certified representative of the employees of said Company\u201d for objects proscribed by Section 8(b) (7) and 8(b) (4) (C) of the Act. Furthermore, the Board\u2019s order requires the Union to cease and desist from picketing the Company for these same objects, where there has been a valid election within the preceding 12 months under Section 9(c) of the Act which the Union did not win, or while another labor organization is the duly certified representative of the employees of the Company. Affirmatively, the order requires the Union to post appropriate notices.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1410-11\">. The Union as-erts in its brief that \u201cthe Board erred in finding that Emile D. Verbois and Thomas Kyle were agents of Local 5.\u201d The Board, however, reversing the Trial Examiner, held that \u201cthe evidence does <em>not </em>establish that Kyle was also an agent of [the Union] \u201d. (Emphasis added)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1410-16\">. The picket at the plant was maintained from May 2, 1967 until January 26, 1968, when it was enjoined. The period of the statutory violation commenced January 3, 1968, the date Local 270 was certified as the exclusive bargaining representative of the Company\u2019s employees. Although the Union\u2019s name was removed from the sign on December 27, the pickets themselves, including Verbois and Reeves of the Union\u2019s negotiating committee, remained substantially the same so as to continue the Union\u2019s responsibility. Additionally, the picket was financially supported by contributions of Union members solicited by Union agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-17\">As for Verbois, the record shows that he was business agent of the Union and had been the only signatory on behalf of the Union on the expired contract with the Company. The Union points to no evidence of a termination of the prior relationship between it and Verbois. Indeed, it was Verbois who solicited and collected money from the employees to maintain the picket line. Thus it is clear that he was acting as an agent of the Union.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
