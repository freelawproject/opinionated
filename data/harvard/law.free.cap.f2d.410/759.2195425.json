While a close case is presented on the facts, we are convinced after careful study that there is a sufficient evidentiary basis for the decision\" of the Tax Court and that there is no error in law. The clearly erroneous rule applies in our review of decisions of the Tax Court. C. I. R. v. Du-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>berstein, 1960, 363 U.S. 278, 80 S.Ct. 1190, 4 L.Ed.2d 1218; Estate of Broadhead v. C. I. R., 5 Cir., 1968, 391 F.2d 841. There having been no separate economic interests, it follows that G. C. M. 24994, 1944, Cum.Bull. 250, had no applicability.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">The decision of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
