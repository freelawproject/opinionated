The statute is set out in pertinent part in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellee filed her original complaint under subdivision (a) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-17\">The district court ruled that appellant\u2019s motion was untimely, coming at the end of the trial and after judgment, and granted appellee leave to amend the complaint to correct the jurisdictional flaw.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-18\">While we agree with appellant that the motion was not untimely, see C. Wright, Federal Courts \u00a7 7, at 14-16 (1963), we affirm the ruling of the district court. Upon leave of the court a party may amend defective allegations of jurisdiction, even after judgment has been entered or an appeal taken. Finn v. American Fire &amp; Casualty Co., 207 F.2d 113 (5th Cir. 1953); 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1653; Fed.R.Civ.P. 15. In <em>Finn </em>this court held that where a first trial was free from error apart from a jurisdictional matter, a new trial was not mandatory and judgment could be entered on the original verdict after the correction of the jurisdictional flaw by the dismissal of a non-diverse defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-19\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"AWG\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b794-11\">. Pursuant to Rule 18 of the Rules of this Court, this ease has been put on the summary calendar for disposition without oral argument. See Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 5 Cir. 1969, 409 F.2d 804; Floyd v. Resor, 5 Cir. 1969, 409 F.2d 714.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b794-12\">. Canal Zone Code, tit. 8, \u00a7 461:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-13\">\u201c(a) An action pursuant to this sub-chapter may be brought by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-14\">(1) a female resident of the Canal Zone who has delivered an illegitimate child or who is pregnant with a child which, if born alive, would be illegitimate ; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-21\">(2) an illegitimate child or, if the illegitimate child is a minor or otherwise incompetent, his next friend. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b794-22\">. Subdivision (a) (2) allows a suit by the child or his next friend, if the child is a minor. It is not limited to residents of the Canal Zone. <em>See supra </em>note 1. Ap-pellee was allowed to amend her complaint to make the suit into an action by her as next friend for the child.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
