Prior to issuing these bonds, United had insisted upon and received an indemnity agreement from the individual appellants requiring them to stand ready to deposit collateral upon the request of United and to hold United harmless in the event it incurred losses on its surety bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-28\">When the contractor was adjudicated a bankrupt and was unable to meet its construction obligations, United called upon the appellants to deposit the collateral in accordance with the agreement. Their refusal to do so prompted this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-29\">In its complaint in the court below, United asked for the following relief: (1) an order for specific performance of the deposit-of-collateral provision requiring appellants to deposit the sum of $75,000 as collateral; (2) an order requiring the appellants to exonerate ap-pellee from liability under the bonds; (3) an award against the appellants in such amounts as should be determined to be the liability of the appellee-surety under the bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>After a motion by appellants to dismiss the action had been denied, appellee filed a motion for summary judgment requesting \u201cpartial Summary Judgment in its favor requiring defendants to deposit with plaintiff the sum of $75,000.-00\u201d in accordance with the indemnity agreement and \u201cpartial Summary Judgment in the sum of $49,948.96, being the amount of claims actually paid by the plaintiff [bonding company] prior to the filing of this Motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The district court granted relief on the request for the deposit of collateral but denied any further relief. The court said, in the opinion by Judge Kirkpatrick:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-6\">\u201cThe first part of the motion for summary judgment is granted and judgment may be entered in favor of the plaintiff ordering the deposit of $75,-000 as collateral in accordance therewith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-7\">\u201cAs to the second part of the motion for summary judgment it is clear that there are unresolved issues upon which, in my judgment, it would be improper and unwise to enter a summary judgment before full discovery has been had. Therefore, partial summary judgment in the amount prayed for is denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">These appeals are from the order of the court granting the \u201cpartial summary judgment\u201d for the deposit of collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">At oral argument on these appeals we indicated to the parties that there was a serious question as to whether this order was appealable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We permitted the parties to argue the appeals on the merits, and asked for supplemental memoranda directed specifically to the question of appealability. Able counsel for the parties have supplied excellent briefs on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-15\">Congress has directed that \u201cThe courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts.\u201d 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1291. Federal Rule 54(b) provides that when more than one claim for relief is presented in an action, judgment on less than all the claims shall not be deemed final \u2014 and thus appealable \u2014 unless the district court so determines and directs. In addition, Rule 54(b) expressly states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-16\">\u201cIn the absence of such determination and direction, any order or other form of decision, however designated, which adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims or parties, and the order or other form of decision is subject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-17\">Read together, Section 1291 of Title 28 and Federal Rule 54(b) thus present two essential ingredients for rendering a judgment final. First, the substance of the matter litigated and upon which the order is entered must be \u201cfinal\u201d within the statutory conception of Section 1291,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and second, in a multiple claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>action, the district court must conform its judgment to the requirements of Rule 54(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Assuming that the judgment entered by the court below was final within the conception of Section 1291, the fact remains that the district court made no certification under Rule 54(b), nor was any request for such action made by the parties. The judgment is therefore subject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment on all the claims presented in the .action. In this posture, the district court\u2019s judgment ordering the deposit of collateral cannot be viewed as final.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">In an effort to avoid the requirement of finality, appellants urge that the partial summary judgment entered below was, in fact, a mandatory injunction and thus, although interlocutory, was nonetheless appealable under the express provisions of 28 U.S.C.A. Section 1292(a) (1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Both district judges involved in the case below, however, characterized the present order as enforcing specific performance of the parties' agreement. The term \"injunction\u201d appears at no point in the proceedings below. Although we are aware that \u201cthe label used to describe the judicial demand is not controlling,\u201d Independent Petroleum Workers of New Jersey v. Esso Standard Oil Co., 235 F.2d 401 (3 Cir. 1956), it is nonetheless persuasive evidence against reaching a differing interpretation as a matter of first impression at the appellate level.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">An injunction is a prohibitive writ issued by a court of equity forbidding a party-defendant from certain action, or in the case of a mandatory injunction, commanding positive action. The philosophy behind the use of injunctive relief is the recognition of the necessity to restrain or compel conduct in those extraordinary situations where irreparable injury might result from delay or inaction. Wyrough &amp; Loser Inc. v. Pelmor Laboratories, Inc., 376 F.2d 543 (3 Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">A bill for specific performance lacks the elements of timely action and irreparable injury which essentially characterize the use of injunctive relief. It refers fundamentally to the performance of obligations which the parties have, by contract, agreed to perform. Unlike an injunction, which can be employed procedurally to preserve rights pending the outcome of the substantive litigation, the remedy of specific performance is, generally speaking, dispositive of the substantive rights of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-12\"> Conceding that in some cases the difference between an injunction and specific performance may escape precise definition, we agree with the court\u2019s statement in Taylor v. Board of Education, 288 F.2d 600, 604 (2 Cir. 1961), that \u201cnot every order containing words of command is a mandatory injunction within that section [28 U.S.C. A. \u00a7 1292(a) (1)]\u201d and conclude that the order of the court below, granting \u201cjudgment * * * in favor of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>plaintiff ordering the deposit of $75,000 as collateral,\u201d was not an injunction as contemplated by the statute permitting appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">The appeal will be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b547-10\">. See Aetna Insurance Co. v. Newton, 398 F.2d 729 (3 Cir. 1968), in which Judge Kalodner emphasized that we are required to raise the question of appeal-ability <em>sua sponte </em>as we did here; Calis-tro v. Kean, 389 F.2d 618 (3 Cir.1968) <em>; </em>6 Moore, Federal Practice, 1f 54.28[2] (2d ed. 1966); Annot., 38 A.L.R.2d 377 (1954).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b547-13\">. This is the concept of \u201cfinality\u201d as expressed in decisions such as Forgay v. Conrad, 6 How. 201, 47 U.S. 201, 12 L.Ed. 404 (1848), in which an order compelling the transfer of property with an express grant of execution was held appealable even though other claims in the action remained pending. Appellant argues that the present order is appeal-able because it falls within the <em>Forgay </em>doctrine. We do not regard <em>Forgay, </em>decided many years prior to the adoption of Rule 54(b), as being beyond its reach. Rather, we interpret Rule 54(b) as an efficient procedural device with which the district court can impose finality to its partial adjudication of a multi-claim action where warranted. In this way, Rule 54(b) removes the substantial uncertainty which accompanied the question of finality before its adoption. In DiBella v. United States, 369 U.S. 121, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>126, 82 S.Ct. 654, 657, 7 L.Ed.2d 614 (1962), the Court noted that even where the concept of finality is met in its traditional sense, an appeal in a multiple claim litigation will lie \u201conly when the trial judge certifies that \u2018there is no just reason for delay.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b548-9\">. The appellant also urges that the judgment entered below qualifies for appellate review under the \u201ccollateral rule\u201d enunciated in Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949), which held that an order requiring plaintiff to deposit security as a prerequisite to maintaining a stockholder\u2019s derivative action was appealable. The same holding can be found in Chabot v. National Securities and Research Corp., 290 F.2d 657 (2 Cir. 1961). In each of these cases, the courts said that the deposit order was appealable because it was \u201cnot an ingredient of the cause of action and [did] not require consideration with it.\u201d Such is not the case here. The object of the summary judgment was one of the claims for relief sought in the action and was most certainly one of the ingredients of the substantive claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
