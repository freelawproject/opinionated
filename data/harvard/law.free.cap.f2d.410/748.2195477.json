The district court denied this motion by memorandum order, reproduced in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We find no error, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>We add the following observation. The thrust of appellant\u2019s argument before us largely is that the two statutes overlap and that the U. S. Attorney is vested with unconstitutionally broad discretion to determine whether to proceed under the Misdemeanor Statute, Title 26, \u00a7 7207, or the felony statute, Title 26, \u00a7 7206(1), so that only a sentence as a misdemeanant could lawfully have been imposed. The district court\u2019s quotation from our opinion on the former appeal [Footnote 1] demonstrates that this is fallacious. Even if it were not, we consider binding the opinion of this Court in Black v. United States, 5 Cir. 1968, 405 F.2d 187 [December 19, 1968]. In <em>Black, </em>we rejected the argument advanced here, which is based upon the dissents in Berra v. United States, 351 U.S. 131, at 138-140, 76 S.Ct. 685, 100 L.Ed. 1013 (1955) and Hutcherson v. United States, 1965, 120 U.S.App.D.C. 274, 345 F.2d 964, at 972-977.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b810-12\">. Escobar v. United States, 5 Cir. 1968, 388 F.2d 661, cert. denied 390 U.S. 1024, 88 S.Ct. 1411, 20 L.Ed.2d 282 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b810-14\">. \u201cThe defendant in the above styled and numbered cause has moved this Court to correct the sentence imposed by this Court in said case, alleging that the sentence imposed is illegal. The defendant contends that \u2018the Misdemeanor Statute, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7207, overlaps with \u00a7 7206(1),\u2019 of Title 26, and that hence the defendant should have been sentenced under the Misdemeanor Statute, \u00a7 7207, rather than under \u00a7 7206(1).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-32\">\u2018[Defendant] * * * was charged in a four count indictment with willfully making and subscribing false income tax returns for the years 1957, 1958, 1959, and 1960. He was acquitted on Count 1 and found guilty on the other three counts.\u2019 (Footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-34\">Escobar v. United States, 388 F.2d 661, 663 (5th Cir. 1968). He was sentenced to two (2) years imprisonment, six (6) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>months to serve, the remainder suspended for two years, plus $1,000.00 fine, on each count, the sentences to run concurrently. His conviction was affirmed in Escobar v. United States, supra. On his appeal, defendant contended, inter alia, and the Court found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-6\">\u2018Appellant contends that the court erred in refusing to charge that the jury could find him guilty under 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7207 (misdemeanor) even though he was indicted for violating 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7206(1) (felony). There is an element in \u00a7 7206(1) which is not in \u00a7 7207, i. e., the document must contain a statement that it is \u201cmade under the penalties of perjury\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-9\">\u2018 * * * [T]he question narrows to whether there is \u201ca disputed factual element\u201d in \u00a7 7206(1) which is not present in \u00a7 7207. As pointed out the only difference between the two statutes is in the \u201cmade under the penalties of perjury\u201d requirement in \u00a7 7206(1). If there was any question for the jury concerning whether some or all of the returns involved here were or were not \u201cmade under the penalties of perjury\u201d appellant would have been entitled, under <em>Sansone </em>[Sansone v. United States, 380 U.S. 343, 85 S.Ct. 1004, 13 L.Ed.2d 882 (1965)], to the requested charge. However, appellee contends, and appellant does not dispute, that all returns involved here contain the \u201cperjury declaration\u201d. Therefore, there was no factual dispute concerning the charged greater offense to be submitted to the jury, ergo appellant was not entitled to his requested charge. See Sansone v. United States at 354-355, 85 S.Ct. 1004, 13 L.Ed.2d 882, 388 F.2d at 666 (Footnote omitted)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A071\">In other words, defendant was either guilty of a violation of \u00a7 7206(1) or he was innocent of violating either \u00a7 7206 (1) or \u00a7 7207. The jury found that he was guilty as charged, i. e. that he was guilty of acts and/or omissions which constituted a violation of \u00a7 7206 (1). Congress has declared that anyone guilty of such acts of omissions should be punished as a felon. This court could not and can not sentence him otherwise. Especially, the Court could not sentence the defendant under a statute which he could not have lawfully been found guilty of violating.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-15\">While this precludes the relief sought, the Court would point out that even if the defendant were correct in his contention that a prosecutor cannot constitutionally be empowered to choose the more onerous of overlapping statutes under which to prosecute, it would not help him here. In the particular facts of this case, the statutes do not overlap. As pointed out above, the defendant was either guilty of a violation of \u00a7 7206(1) or he was not guilty of any violation, felony or misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-16\">Furthermore, the practical effect of the sentence given this defendant, assuming the period of probation is successfully served, as this Court did and must assume, would be the same had he been sentenced under the statutory provision for misdemeanors. In other words, the actual sentence, again assuming no probation revocation, could have, and probably would have been the same under either sentence, his having six (6) months to serve, a $1,000.00 fine to pay, and a two (2) year period of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-17\">Treating the motion both as a request to correct an illegal sentence and/or to reduce a valid sentence, the Court having reviewed the motion, files and records of the case, finds, for the foregoing reasons, that it should be, and the same is hereby, in all things, DENIED, and IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-18\">Entered this 2nd day of September, 1968.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
