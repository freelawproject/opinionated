On August 17, 1959, appellant filed two German applications, one relating to certain fulvene derivatives and thei other to certain cyclopen-tadiene derivatives. By appellant\u2019s admission, neither German application contained any disclosure of utility, such disclosure having been unnecessary in Germany. On August 1, 1960, within one year of the German filings, appellant filed a U. S. application<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (the \u201cparent\u201d of the instant application) combining the two German disclosures. A claim of priority was made and the necessary certified copies of the German applications were filed. Although the parent application alleged that the claimed compounds are useful as intermediates for preparing certain artificial resins and indicated a manner in which such resins can be prepared, all claims were finally rejected under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112 because of an alleged failure of the specification to disclose how those resins might be put to use.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-16\">On April 27, 1961, during the pendency of the parent application, one of appellant\u2019s two German applications (hereinafter referred to as \u201cHafner\u201d) was published.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> More than one year thereafter, on July 24, 1964, the instant continuation-in-part application was filed. It contains a reference to the parent application, and a claim for priority going back to the German application was made at the time of filing. The instant application contains an amplified disclosure of utility and \u201chow to use,\u201d the adequacy of which, under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 and \u00a7 112 respectively, has not been questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-17\">All the appealed claims stand rejected as being \u201cfully met (35 USC 102)\u201d by both Hafner and an article published in May 1960 by one Arnold.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Assuming that these two references are valid \u00a7 102 references and considering their respective dates and the filing dates of appellant\u2019s two German and two U. S. applications, the instant application must be entitled to the parent application\u2019s U. S. filing date to overcome Hafner and the convention filing date of the German applications to overcome Arnold.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-18\">Until his brief before this court, appellant conceded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1466-19\">* * * the claims are met by * * * Hafner and * * * Arnold * * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1405\">*1405</page-number><em>if the present application is not entitled to rely upon the filing date of the parent application </em>* * * and through it to * * * [Hafner].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1467-5\">Now, however, appellant urges that these references do not qualify as \u201cenabling\u201d disclosures<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because they allegedly, do not \u201cteach the public \u2018how to use\u2019 the invention * * Appellant also maintains that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1467-7\">* * * the Patent Office is at once inconsistent and unfair in holding that the Arnold disclosure and the Hafner disclosure * * * \u201cfully meet\u201d the appealed claims, and that the disclosure in the parent application which is even better than that in the Hafner reference fails to support the claims on appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1467-9\">In essence, appellant is contending that a double standard should not be applied in determining the adequacy of a disclosure to anticipate under \u00a7 102, on the one hand, and to support the patent-ability of a claim under \u00a7 112 on the other. He feels that a disclosure adequate for the one purpose is necessarily adequate for the other but, unhappily for him, this is not so. As we shall develop, a disclosure lacking a teaching of how to use a fully disclosed compound<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for a specific, substantial utility or of how to use for such purpose a compound produced by a fully disclosed process is, under the present state of the law, entirely adequate to anticipate a claim to either the product or the process and, at the same time, entirely inadequate to support the allowance of such a claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This is so because of the requirements of law engrafted on sections 101 and 112 by the decision of the Supreme Court in Brenner v. Manson, 383 U.S. 519, 86 S.Ct. 1033, 16 L.Ed.2d 69 (1966), with respect to the meaning to be given to the words \u201cuseful\u201d and \u201cuse\u201d in those sections. In construing them, we must of course, give them the meaning demanded by the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1467-15\">Standing alone, appellant\u2019s argument against a double standard is a plausible proposition. However, when considered in light of the specific provisions of \u00a7 102, and \u00a7 112 as it has been interpreted, it is seen to. be untenable \u2014 \u00a7 112 provides that the specification must enable one skilled in the art to \u201cuse\u201d the invention whereas \u00a7 102 makes no such requirement as to an anticipatory disclosure. The disclosure of how to use must relate to a use of the kind considered by the Supreme Court in Brenner v. Manson to be a sufficient utility. The majority of this court has spoken in <em>Kirk </em>and <em>Joly, </em>supra note 7, as to its construction of the <em>Manson </em>requirement. Thus, the double standard which appellant criticizes is now, implicitly if not explicitly, required by law, at least in situations such as we have here, although the \u201cinvention\u201d per se claimed is fully disclosed and though the manner of \u201cmaking,\u201d as distinguished from \u201cusing,\u201d the invention is also fully disclosed or is obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-16\">Returning now to the question of appellant\u2019s right to his claims of priority, the examiner held appellant not entitled to the filing date of either his German applications or his parent U. S. application because the latter allegedly did not comply with \u00a7 112 (as required by \u00a7 120) in that the \u201chow to use\u201d requirement of \u00a7 112 was not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1406\">*1406</page-number>The only \u201chow to use\u201d disclosure in the parent application reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1468-4\">The new products are valuable intermediate products especially for preparing artificial resins and plastic masses such as unsaturated linear or cross-linked long-chained acetal resins or mixed acetal-polyester resins which may be copolymerized with monomeric vinyl compounds such as styrene or diallylphthalate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1468-5\">The examiner and; board were of the view that, although persons skilled in the art might well have no difficulty <em>preparing </em>acetal resins from the compounds of appellant\u2019s invention, the parent application disclosure was still inadequate under \u00a7 112 because there is no <em>express </em>disclosure of a specific use to which the resulting resins can be put, and appellant has not <em>shown </em>that such a use would be obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-6\">After carefully reviewing the record and appellant\u2019s arguments and in view of the law as established by Brenner v.. Manson, <em>Kirk, </em>and <em>Joly, </em>the decision below appears to be correct.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1468-7\">While arguing that his parent application did in fact comply with the first paragraph of \u00a7 112, appellant also maintains that \u00a7 120 <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> only requires that a \u201cpreviously filed\u201d U. S. application disclose the <em>\u201cinvention\u201d </em>as required by \u00a7 112 and does not require that it also disclose \u201cthe manner and process of making and <em>using </em>it\u201d (emphasis added). Appellant correctly points out that the utility of an invention is distinct from \u201cthe invention\u201d per se<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and from this argues that only \u201cthe invention\u201d need be disclosed. <em>If </em>\u00a7 120 spoke <em>only </em>of an \u201cinvention disclosed in an application previously filed in the United States,\u201d which it does not, appellant\u2019s interpretation might well be unassailable.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This section, however, also makes specific reference to the first paragraph of \u00a7 112 (see footnote 9). From this we think it clear that \u00a7 120 means that, to be entitled to the benefits provided by that section, the invention disclosed in the \u201cpreviously filed\u201d application must be described therein in such a manner as to satisfy <em>all </em>the requirements of the first paragraph of \u00a7 112 as the courts have construed it, including that which requires the description to be sufficient to enable one skilled in the art <em>to use </em>the same for a legally adequate utility.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We therefore find appellant not entitled to the benefit of the parent filing date.</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-14\"> Finally, appellant argues that the instant application is entitled to the filing date of the German applications even though we find it is not entitled to the date of the parent U. S. application. We have carefully considered appellant\u2019s extensive arguments but hold that the express language of \u00a7\u00a7 119 and 120 requires the contrary conclusion for the reasons stated above. Appellant has argued that his failure to disclose adequately the utility of his invention is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1407\">*1407</page-number>mere \u201ctechnical\u201d defect which he could have cured by an amendment of his parent U. S. application (35 U.S.C. \u00a7 132), instead of by the continuation-in-part application which he chose. We have to disagree. As we said in the section headed \u201cNew Matter\u201d of In re Nelson, supra note 7,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1469-5\">Of course, if the application had been fatally defective * * * such a defect could not have been cured by an amendment the object of which was to put into the specification something required to be there when it was filed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1469-6\">Here the parent application is found to be fatally defective. Appellant further argues that his parent application was sufficient, under Rules 53 and 55 to be given a filing date for examination and that its defect was only a \u201cminor informality\u201d such as contemplated by Rule 53(a). An application can be given a filing date and be examined and still contain a fatal defect requiring its rejection. We have already expressed our disagreement with the \u201cminor informality\u201d theory in discussing the \u201ctechnical\u201d defect argument. What was added in the continuation-in-part to render it adequate under the law was clearly \u201cnew matter\u201d under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-9\">Because of the primary ground of our decision \u2014 inability to obtain the benefit of the filing date of the U. S. parent application \u2014 it follows that appellant does not get the benefit of the filing date of the German applications on which it was based.</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-10\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-12\">WORLEY, C.
