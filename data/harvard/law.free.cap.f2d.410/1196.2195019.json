See Alabama Stat. Title 51, Sec. 342 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-23\">It appearing without dispute that Continental had engaged in a number of acts that, under the laws of the State of Alabama, amount to doing business in that state, we conclude that the trial court properly disposed of the suit by giving effect to this defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-24\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
