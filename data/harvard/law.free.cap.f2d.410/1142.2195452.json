The Referee\u2019s order, confirmed by the District Court, was based upon two grounds, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-21\">(1) That the bankrupt had \u201cfailed to keep or preserve books of account or records, from which his financial condition and business transactions might be ascertained * * 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 32(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-23\">(2) That the bankrupt\u2019s debt to the appellee resulted from the bankrupt\u2019s having made \u201ca materially false statement in writing respecting his financial condition\u201d and the appellee\u2019s reliance upon the misrepresentation in making the loan in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-24\">The evidence considered by the Referee in connection with the appellee\u2019s objection to discharge consisted of documentary exhibits and oral testimony and was somewhat extensive. The record reveals that the evidence was carefully considered, both by the Referee and in the District Court. From our examination of the record and our review of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1143\">*1143</page-number>authorities presented in the excellent briefs of both parties, we are unable to say that the challenged order was clearly wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
