We find nothing in this record to warrant departure from the well recognized rule that character examinations of a witness to impeach his credibility must ordinarily be limited to inquiries as to conviction of a felony or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude.

United States (5 Cir., 1967), 377 F.2d 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>There is no substance to the remaining points raised by appellant as to the charge of the court dealing with the inference that may be drawn from proof of one\u2019s possession of recently stolen property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-4\">The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"A4u\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
