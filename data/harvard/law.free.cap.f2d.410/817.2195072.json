Hardyman,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> involves a racially motivated assault committed upon a public highway. Adhering as we must to <em>Collins, </em>we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of appellants\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-29\">Plaintiffs, Negro citizens, brought this suit under the mantle of 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1985(3),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> popularly known as the Ku <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>Klux Klan Act. They alleged in their complaint a conspiracy between defendants Lavon Breckenridge and James Breckenridge to deprive them of their equal protection of the laws and their privileges and immunities under the laws. Specifically they charged that on July 2, 1966, defendants, both white adults, acting under the mistaken belief that R. G. Grady was a worker for the civil rights of Negroes, willfully and maliciously conspired, planned and agreed to block the passage of plaintiffs upon the public highway and to assault, beat and injure them with deadly weapons. It was further alleged that pursuant to this conspiracy defendants drove their truck into the path of Grady\u2019s automobile and blocked its passage over the public road. Both defendants then forced Grady and the other plaintiffs from their automobile and, holding them at gun point, began to club Grady with a black jack, pipe or other blunt instrument. During this period defendants repeatedly menaced plaintiffs with threats to kill or injure them, and eventually attacked all plaintiffs with clubs, while preventing escape or resistance with their firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">Based on these allegations, plaintiffs seek $10,000 compensatory and $5,000 punitive damages. They claim that as a result of defendants\u2019 conspiracy and their acts pursuant thereto, plaintiffs have been deprived of their rights, privileges and immunities as citizens of the United States and as citizens of the State of Mississippi, including but not limited to their rights of freedom of speech, movement, association and assembly; their right to petition their government for redress of grievances; their right to be secure in their persons; their right not to be enslaved nor deprived of life, liberty or property other than by due process of law; and finally, their right to travel the public highways without restraint on the same terms as white citizens in Kemper County, Mississippi. The district court dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 complaint on the authority of Collins v. Hardyman, <em>supra, </em>for failure to state a cause of action. The district judge reasoned that the complaint alleged no more than an invasion of private rights by private individuals, and that <em>Collins </em>and numerous lower courts had limited \u00a7 1985(3) to actions performed under \u201ccolor of law.\u201d See Hoffman v. Halden, 9 Cir. 1959, 268 F.2d 280, 291; Wallach v. Cannon, 8 Cir. 1966, 357 F.2d 557; Haldane v. Chagnon, 9 Cir. 1965, 345 F.2d 601; Bryant v. Donnell, W.D. Tenn.1965, 239 F.Supp. 681; Van Daele v. Vinci, N.D.Ill.1968, 294 F.Supp. 71; Huey v. Barloga, N.D.Ill. 1967, 277 F.Supp. 864; Swift v. Fourth National Bank of Columbus, Georgia, M.D.Ga. 1962, 205 F.Supp. 563.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-12\">On this appeal, plaintiffs forcefully urge that United States v. Guest,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> have lifted the state action limitation from \u00a7 1985 (3) so that the literal words of that statute <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (which do not include the words \u201cunder color of law\u201d) may now be given their unfettered application.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-13\">The state action limitation on the. various Civil Rights Acts<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> enacted during the Reconstruction Era are traceable to the Civil Rights Cases, 1883, 109 U.S. 3, 3 S.Ct. 18, 27 L.Ed. 835, in which the public accommodation sections of the Civil Rights Act of 1875 were questioned. Out of those cases, and of course out of the language of the Fourteenth Amendment itself,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> has grown a long and com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>plicated history in which the state action requirement has undergone considerable expansion<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and some redefinition, but always with the result that the Fourteenth Amendment and rights flowing from it have been vouchsafed only where there has been interference by state authority, or by those acting under \u201ccolor\u201d of state authority. United States v. Price, 1966, 383 U.S. 787, 86 S.Ct. 1152, 16 L.Ed.2d 267. As said by one court, \u201c[t]his distinction between purely private discrimination and discrimination pursuant to \u2018state action\u2019 has persisted for over eighty years. Only discrimination which falls within the latter category warrants Fourteenth Amendment protection and falls within the ambit of the Civil Rights Act^ \u00bfSection 1985 (3)). Huey v. Barloga, supra, 277 F.Supp. at 869. In the words of the Supreme Court in United States v. Cruikshank, 1876, 92 U.S. 542, 23 L.Ed. 588:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-5\">\u201cThe Fourteenth Amendment prohibits a State from denying to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws; but this provision does not add anything to the rights which one citizen has under the Constitution against another. The equality of the rights of citizens is a principle of republicanism. Every republican government is in duty bound to protect all its citizens in the enjoyment of this principle, if within its power. That duty was originally assumed by the States; and it still remains there. The only obligation resting upon the United States is to see that the States do not deny the right. This the Amendment guaranties [sic], but no more.\u201d 92 U.S. at 555.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b881-15\">See also United States v. Guest, 383 U.S. 745, 755, 86 S.Ct. 1170, 16 L.Ed.2d 239 and Wilkins v. United States, 5 Cir. 1967, 376 F.2d 552, 560, cert. denied, 389 U.S. 964, 88 S.Ct. 342, 19 L.Ed.2d 379.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-16\">Despite the long history and the persistent durability of the state action limitation, appellants contend that under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress has the power to punish all conspiracies to violate Fourteenth Amendment rights, with or without state action. They rely for this proposition on United States v. Guest, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b881-17\"><em>Guest </em>involved a criminal prosecution under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 241,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and not under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1985(3).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> A majority of the Court, concurring in the opinion of Mr. Justice Stewart, reaffirmed the Court\u2019s position that the equal protec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>tion clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not reach wrongs done by one or more private individuals against another. 383 U.S. at 755, 86 S.Ct. 1170. The Court nonetheless concluded that dismissal of the indictments against private persons was improper because there had been some state involvement in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">Appellants point out that six of the Justices in Guest subscribed to the view that Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment empowers Congress to enact legislation affecting purely private conduct. They emphasize that the legislative history and the language of \u00a7 1985(3) indicate that Congress not only intended to assert its full power under the Constitution when it enacted the Civil Rights Acts,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> see United States v. Price, 1966, 383 U.S. 787, 800, 86 S.Ct. 1152, 16 L.Ed.2d 267, 276, 280-287; United States v. Mosley, 238 U.S. 383, 387-388, 35 S.Ct. 904, 59 L.Ed. 1355, 1357; Virginia Commission on Constitutional Government, The Reconstruction Amendments, Debates (1967), pp. 484-570, but also clearly intended that \u00a7 1985(3) reach private conspiracies. Cong. Globe, 42nd Cong., 1st Sess., 505-506(1871); Cong. Globe, 42nd Cong., 1st Sess., 481-484.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">While we do not gainsay the persuasiveness of this argument, and certainly do not disparage the prognostications of numerous commentators who read in <em>Guest </em>the eventual demise of the state action requirement,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> we cannot subscribe to the view that <em>Guest </em>has fulfilled this promised potential. This court does not write on a clean slate. We are compelled to note that most if not all courts which have considered <em>Guest </em>since its appearance in 1966 have hewed closly to the majority opinion by Justice Stewart and to the majority\u2019s findings of state action. Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 8 Cir. 1967, 379 F.2d 33, 43, reversed on other grounds; 392 U.S. 409, 88 S.Ct. 2186, 20 L.Ed.2d 1189; United States v. Lester, 6 Cir. 1966, 363 F.2d 68, 72, cert. denied, 385 U.S. 1002, 87 S.Ct. 705, 17 L.Ed.2d 542; O\u2019Hara v. Mattix, W.D.Mich.1966, 255 F.Supp. 540, 542; St. Augustine High School v. Louisiana High School Athletic Association, E.D.La.1967, 270 F.Supp. 767, 771-772, aff\u2019d., 5 Cir. 1968, 396 F.2d 224. This court has been no exception. Wilkins v. United States, 5 Cir. 1967, 376 F.2d 552, 570, cert. denied, 389 U.S. 964, 88 S.Ct. 342, 19 L.Ed.2d 379. At this late date we cannot give <em>Guest </em>a new and novel interpretation. \\ Guided as we are by decisions of other courts, bound as we are by <em>Wilkins, </em>and recognizing that <em>Guest </em>on its merits does not abolish state action,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> we are constrained to hold that \u00a7 1985(3) does not reach private conspiracies to interfere with Fourteenth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>Amendment rights. Hoffman v. Halden, <em>supra; </em>Huey v. Barloga, <em>supra. </em>In so holding we recognize that the citadel of state action is under heavy attack, but we reluctantly concede that as yet it has not fallen.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\">We are not deterred or persuaded otherwise by the recent Supreme Court case of Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer &amp; Co., <em>supra. </em>The <em>Mayer </em>case is authoritative only as to the constitutionality of a statute, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1982, enacted pursuant to the Thirteenth and not the Fourteenth Amendment. While <em>Mayer </em>is certainly illustrative of the importance of Section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment as a source of Congressional power,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> it is not dispositive of the proposition that Congress, under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, may reach private conduct. Such an important and significant extension of the Fourteenth Amendment, though intimated in several recent Supreme Court decisions,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> must still await a specific and authoritative pronouncement by that Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-18\">We feel compelled to add that appellants\u2019 failure to state a cause of action under \u00a7 1985(3) is impeded by more than just limitations on the extent of Congressional power under the Fourteenth Amendment. While some of appellants\u2019 claims are' \"of Fourteenth Amendment derivation, others such as the right to petition the government for redress of grievances, cf. United States v. Cruikshank, 1876, 92 U.S. 542, 552-553, 23 L.Ed. 588; Powe v. United States, 5 Cir. 1940, 109 F.2d 147, cert. denied, 309 U.S. 679, 60 S.Ct. 717, 84 L.Ed. 1023; Wilkins v. United States, 5 Cir. 1967, 376 F.2d 552, and the right to interstate travel and the use of streets and highways in interstate commerce,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> United States v. Guest, 383 U.S. at 757-760, and 757; n. 13, 86 S.Ct. 1170, are attributes of national citizenship not sourced in the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>Unlike appellants\u2019 other claims, these rights are \u201cfundamental to the concept of our Federal Union,\u201d 383 U.S. at 757, 86 S.Ct. at 1178, and implicit in our form of republican government.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It is well established that Congress has the power to legislate for their protection even against interference by private conduct.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Under these circumstances it is clear that appellants\u2019 failure to state a cause of action under \u00a7 1985(3) for violation of rights of national citizenship must derive from reasons...other than constitutional limitatumsT</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">\"'Turning\u201dto \u00a7 1985(3) itself and the cases which have construed it, we find that rights of national citizenship remain unredressed (when impaired by private conduct), not for want of Congressional power, but for want of a proper statutory vehicle to express it. The Supreme Court has instructed us that \u00a7 1985(3) does not have the statutory equipage for redress of private conspiracies. In Collins v. Hardyman, <em>supra, </em>the court held that \u00a7 1985(3) reached only conspiracies under color of law. The Court was probably led to this result by its doubts as to the constitutionality of the statute, yet it based its decision not on constitutional grounds, but upon a construction of the language of the statute itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\"><em>Collins </em>involved the disruption of a political meeting in Los Angeles County, California, that has been called in order to petition Congress in opposition to the Marshall Plan. The Democratic Club that called the meeting had been organized for.the purpose of participating in the election of officers of. the United States and for the purpose of engaging in public discussions on issues of national importance. In their complaint, plaintiffs alleged that they had been deprived of equal protection of the laws and privileges and immunities under the laws in that, among other deprivations, they had been denied their right to petition the government for redress of grievances.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">The district court dismissed the complaint holding that the statute did not afford redress for invasion of civil rights at the hands of individuals. D.C., 80 F.Supp. 501. In reversing, the Court of Appeals relied on that part of \u00a7 1985(3) which provides damages for overt acts \u201cwhereby another is * * * deprived of having and exercising any right or privilege of a citizen of the United States.\u201d Hardyman v. Collins, 9 Cir. 1950, 183 F.2d 308, 314. The Court of Appeals also relied on the long line of cases developed under \u00a7 241:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-8\">\u201cThe delineation by the courts of the narrow area of rights which Congress has constitutional power to protect from individual invasion has developed through the application of what is now 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 241, originally enacted May 31, 1870. This statute has been applied to individual deprivations of _the right to vote for federal offices, Ex parte Yarborough, 1884, 110. U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>651, 4 S.Ct. 152, 28 L.Ed. 274; the right to enjoy the privileges granted by the homestead laws, (United States v. Waddell, 1884, 112 U.S. 76, 5 S.Ct. 35, 28 L.Ed. 673; the right to protection from attack while in the custody of a federal marshal, Logan v. United States, 1892, 144 U.S. 263,12 S.Ct. 617, 36 L.Ed. 429; and the right to inform federal officers of violations of federal law, In re Quarles, 1895, 158 U.S. 532, 15 S.Ct. 959, 39 L.Ed. 1080; Motes v. United States, 1900, 178 U.S. 458, 20 S.Ct. 993, 44 L.Ed. 1150. The cases also indicate by way of dictum that the right to assemble for the purpose of discussing the policies of the federal Government and petitioning that Government for redress of grievances is within the scope of direct federal protection.\u201d 183 F.2d at 313</blockquote>\n<p id=\"amy-dedup-0\">On the basis of these precedents, the Court of Appeals reinstated the plaintiffs\u2019' complaint. <em>Accord, </em>Robeson v. Fanelli, S.D.N.Y.1950, 94 F.Supp. 62. It distinguished the\"'case of United States v. Harris, 1883, 106 U.S. 629, 1 S.Ct. 601, 27 L.Ed. 290, in which the criminal counterpart of \u00a7 1985(3) was declared unconstitutional, on the grounds that the portion of \u00a7 1985(3) which dealt with the rights of national citizens was clearly severable from the rest of the statute and was therefore insulated from constitutional infirmity.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">The Supreme Court, in <em>Collins, </em>reversed the Court of Appeals and dismissed the complaint, taking the position that the statute was not severable. Nonetheless it avoided the constitutional challenge raised by <em>Harris </em>and argued that privileges and immunities <em>under the laws </em>and equal protection <em>of the laws </em>required that there be \u201csome manipulation of the law or its agencies.\u201d 341. U.S. at 661, 71 S.Ct. at 942. Without state involvement, the Court viewed appellants\u2019 claims as \u201cno more a deprivation of \u2018equal protection\u2019 or of \u2018equal privileges and immunities\u2019 than it would be * * * to assault one neighbor without assaulting them all, or to libel some persons without mention of others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court found that appellants\u2019 \u201crights <em>under the laws </em>and to protection <em>of the laws </em>remain untouched and equal to the rights of every other Californian * * <em>Id. </em>The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-8\">\u201cWe say nothing of the power of Congress to authorize such civil actions as respondents have commenced or otherwise to redress such grievances as they assert. We think that Congress has not, in the narrow class of conspiracies defined by this statute, included the conspiracy charged here. We therefore reach no constitutional questions.\u201d 341 U.S. at 662, 71 S.Ct. at 942.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">This decision in <em>Collins, </em>because it is based on the language of \u00a7 1985(3), and not upon any considerations of Congressional power, is unaffected by any of the opinions in <em>Guest, </em>or by the opinion in <em>Mayer. </em>We are therefore bound to follow it until it is expressly overruled. We have serious doubts as to its continued vitality,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> but we, as an inferior court, cannot expand the statutory girth of \u00a7 1985(3) when we are \u201c* * * faced with a limiting Supreme Court de-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>cisi\u00f3n which, so far as we are told directly, remains good law.\u201d Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 379 F.2d at 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">We conclude by noting that \u00a7 1985(3) is today a poor remnant of its original conception. Its criminal counterpart has been held unconstitutional, United States v. Harris, <em>supra, </em>and its own constitutionality cast in doubt. Its language has been greatly restricted, Collins v. Hardy man, <em>supra, </em>and its application is no longer in accord with its legislative history. The last is probably the most mystifying. \u00a7 241 and \u00a7 1985(3) have the same Reconstruction historicity.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> They both speak of men going in disguise on the public highway and they both lack the language \u201cunder color of law\u201d which appears so clearly in \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Every indication in the legislative history of the period suggests that the Congressional reconstructionists intended to make the streets and highways safe for the lately freed from private as well as from public traducers.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> As said by Justice Frankfurter in United States v. Williams, 1951, 341 U.S. 70, 76, 71 S.Ct. 581, 95 L.Ed. 758, 763-764, decided during the same term as Collins :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-5\">\u201cMen who \u2018go in disguise upon the public highway, or upon the premises of another\u2019 are not likely to be acting in official capacities. The history of the times \u2014 the lawless activities of private bands, of which the Klan was the most conspicuous \u2014 explains why Congress dealt with both State disregard of the new constitutional prohibitions and private lawlessness. The sponsor of \u00a7 6 [now \u00a7 241] in the Senate made explicit that the purpose of his amendment was to control private conduct.\u201d 341 U.S. at 76, 71 S.Ct. at 584.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b886-13\">We are puzzled as to why this statement petraining to the legislative history of \u00a7 241 is not equally applicable to \u00a7 1985(3).- Nor can we discern why \u201cprivileges and immunities under the laws\u201d do not include privileges'and immunities of national citizenship<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Judge Healy, dissenting in the Court of Appeals in Collins, was of the view that \u201cprivileges and immunities under the laws\u201d was derivative from the Fourteenth Amendment and therefore limited the statute only to Fourteenth Amendment rights. His theory was that the similarity of the language used in \u00a7 1985(3) to \u201cthe wording of Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment shows that Congress, in choosing its language, was thinking * * * of that Amendment and its vindication.\u201d 183 F.2d at 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>This view is somewhat inconsistent with recent Supreme Court pronouncements on \u00a7 241. As noted in United States v. Price, quoting from Justice Holmes in United States v. Mosley:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-5\">\u201cThe source of this section [\u00a7 241] in the doings of the Klu Klux and the like is obvious, and acts of violence obviously were in the mind of Congress. Naturally Congress put forth <em>all Us powers. </em>* * * \u201d (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">Justices Burton, Black and Douglas expressed the same view of \u00a7 1985(3) in their dissenting opinion in <em>Collins. </em>Theirs was the position that Congress had the power, <em>quite independent of the Fourteenth </em>Amendment,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> to create a federal cause of action for the abridgment of federally protected rights. Morever, they took the position that Congress had actually done so in \u00a7 1985(3):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-8\">\u201cCongress certainly has the power to create a federal cause of action in favor of persons injured by private individuals through the abridgment of federally created constitutional rights. It seems to me that Congress has done just this in RS \u00a7 1980(3) [1985(3)]. This is not inconsistent with the principle underlying the Fourteenth Amendment. That Amendment prohibits the respective states from making laws abridging the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States or denying to any person within the jurisdiction of a state the equal protection of the laws. Cases holding that those clauses are directed only at state action are not authority for the contention that Congress may not pass laws supporting rights which exist apart from the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d 341 U.S. at 664, 71 S.Ct. at 943.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b887-14\">The solicitude recently shown by the Supreme Court in United States v. Guest, <em>supra, </em>for the protection of the .right to travel as a \u201cprivilege and immunity of national citizenship,\u201d 383 U.S. at 766, 86 S.Ct. at 1182, raises some doubts as to the continued vitality of Collins,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Even more recently the Court has disapproved the practice of reading civil rights legislation more restrietively than either the history or the language of the statutes require:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-15\">\u201cAs we said in a somewhat different setting two Terms ago, \u2018We think that history leaves no doubt that, if we are to give [the law] the scope that its origins dictate, we must accord it a sweep as broad as its language.\u2019 United States v.

Nevertheless, in Collins v. Hardyman, the Supreme Court read the section respectively and imposed a requirement, as with section 1983, that the prohibited conduct be action under color of state law. The majority noted that the fourteenth amendment prohibits only certain state action and that this statute, like section 1983, was founded exclusively upon that amendment. Under the Court\u2019s interpretation, the only effective difference between the two sections is that one deals with individual action while the other deals with conspiracies.

Since this civil provision is similar in wording to section 241, its development has closely paralleled that of its criminal counterpart. In fact, the courts \u2022 seem to consider holdings in both the criminal prosecutions and the civil actions when deciding either type of case. This practice has led to considerable confusion in the civil eases, where, for example, violations of equal protection rights give rise to a cause of action while denials of due process do not.

The Fourteenth Amendment is only a protection against the encroachment upon enumerated rights by or with the sanction of the State.

In these cases the Court did not require, as a prerequisite to federal protection, that the individuals charged must have acted under color or sanction of state law. Neither did they inquire as to the availability of remedial action under state law. Why then should the Court make such limitations under the civil sanctions of civil rights legislation?
