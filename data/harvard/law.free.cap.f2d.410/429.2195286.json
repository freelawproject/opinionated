Appellant acknowledges that it has long been known to add lead salts of organic phosphorodithioic acids to lubricating oils to inhibit corrosion and oxidation and further that, to facilitate easy mixing with the lubricating oil, it has been desired to supply the salts to the lubricant compounders in the form of liquid concentrates containing the phosphorodithioate salts dissolved in high concentration in oil. Appellant indicates that problems sometimes arise because of the tendency of the lead phosphorodithioate salts to crystallize or solidify when the concentrate is left standing.

having less than five carbon atoms and higher molecular weight radicals having at least five carbon atoms. While Higgins does not teach specifically that the ratio of carbon atoms to phosphorus atoms must be 8.5-9.8:l, the products shown in every one of the examples are within this range. Thus, examples 1-3 show a ratio of 8.5:1, examples 4-7 show 9:1 and example 8 shows 8.7:1.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-14\">Freuler is cited by the examiner for a teaching that zinc and lead salts of particular d'ialkyl dithiophosphoric acids differing from those of Higgins and appellant are useful as lubricating oil additives. For example, Freuler states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-15\">A specific example of this invention which is particularly valuable as a high film strength and oiliness agent, and which also imparts some oxidation inhibiting value to oils compounded therewith, is zinc di-octyl thiophos-phate. The corresponding lead salt is also useful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-16\">THE REJECTION</p>\n<p id=\"b493-17\">The examiner\u2019s rejection under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 was based on the premise that Higgins discloses the use of zinc salts corresponding to the lead salts employed by appellant and that it would be obvious to one skilled in the art to substitute' the corresponding lead salts in view of Freuler\u2019s teaching of the \u201cfunctional equivalence\u201d of zinc and lead salts of other dialkyl dithiophosphoric acids as lubricant additives. The board, in affirming the examiner, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-18\">Higgins et al. clearly show a compound similar to that claimed except that the metal is zinc and not lead. However, since zinc and lead thiophos-ophates [sic] are adequately soluble in mineral and impart high film strength thereto as shown by Freuler, page 3, lines 7 through 19 and lines 28 and 29, it would be obvious to one skilled in the art to use lead instead of zinc in the phosphorodithioate inhibitors shown by Higgins et al.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-19\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b493-20\">Here, the solicitor discusses the Higgins\u2019 disclosure and concludes that the Higgins compounds may be characterized as the zinc analogs of the lead phosphor-odithioate salts of appellant. The solicitor also indicates that the Higgins examples show the use of Higgins\u2019 analogous zinc salts in solutions in a range from 50% to 75% by weight and, in addition, points out that the product of each of Higgins\u2019 eight examples is characterized by a carbon to phosphorus atom ratio within the range recited in claim 2. Having thus set the background of similarity between the claimed compositions of appellant and the solutions of salts in oil disclosed in Higgins, the solicitor then poses, we believe correctly, the determinative issue here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-21\">What the case boils down to is this. Appellant has discovered that the lead analogs of Higgins\u2019 zinc salts can form a clear and free-flowing solution in oil, even when used in high concentrations. Higgins\u2019 zinc salts also have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>that capability. Can such discovery, as recited in illustrative claim 2, be properly held unobvious under 35 U.S.C. 103, notwithstanding Freuler\u2019s teaching that for his purposes, which include inhibition of corrosion, his lead and zinc thiophosphates are equivalents * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">On the record here, we agree with the Patent Office that the claimed subject matter cannot be held unobvious. As to claim 13 which recites a concentration of salt in oil from 0.1 to about 20%, we consider the rejection to be quite clearly correct in view of Freuler\u2019s explicit teaching of the use of his additive in the same range<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> coupled with Freuler\u2019s teaching that lead and zinc salts are equally useful as lubricant additives.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">As to the remaining claims, in which the concentration of lead salt is recited as from about 20% to about 80.% (in claim 12, about 40% to about 60%), it is appellant\u2019s contention that any equivalency between the lead and zinc salts of phosphorodithioic acid which might be inferred from Freuler would be merely for the purpose of imparting certain antioxidant and corrosion-inhibiting properties to lubricants, and that there is no suggestion of equivalency with respect to the <em>oil solubility </em>characteristics which is the heart of appellant\u2019s invention. Further, appellant asserts, it would be unobvious to employ, in oil concentrates, lead salts corresponding to the zinc salts of Higgins in view of the lower solubility in oil of certain other lead salts of phosphorodithioic acids as compared with the corresponding zinc salts, as shown by an affidavit filed by appellant. The affidavit compares pairs of samples of various lead and zinc phosphorodi-thioates in oil and shows that for each pair of samples tested the lead salt exhibited much inferior solubility.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">The solicitor, however, is unimpressed by the results shown in the affidavit observing that none of the phosphoro-dithioate salts selected for comparison in the affidavit comes within the classes of phosphorodithioate salts involved in the respective inventions of either Higgins or appellant. But implicit in that observation is the suggestion that appellant should have made a \u201ccomparison of the results of the invention with the results of the invention.\u201d In re Chapman, 357 F.2d 418, 53 CCPA 978 (1966). What is in point, it seems to us, is the fact that the affidavit, purporting to show that certain lead salts of phosphoro-dithioic acid may be less soluble than the corresponding zinc salts, employs examples in which, in each case, the concentration of the lead salts found not to be soluble is at least 49;%. The concentration of the salt recited in the rejected claims (other than claim 13), however, ranges from about 20-80% or 40-60.%. The affidavit does not establish, therefore, that lead salts of phosphorodithioic acids in general are not soluble at concentrations of from 20 to near 49%\u2014 the lower portion of the claimed range lying below 49%. In passing, we also draw attention to Freuler\u2019s teaching, previously noted, that his particular phosphorodithioic acid salts, including lead and zinc salts, may be added to oil up to at least the lower limit of about 20% recited by appellant. Thus we do not consider the affidavit to be persuasive evidence of the possible insolubility of the tested lead salts of phosphoro-dithioic acid at concentrations of 20 %- 48.%, concentrations within the scope of the claims. We cannot find sufficient evidence in this record that one skilled in the art, aware of the high solubility of the zinc phosphorodithioate oil additives of Higgins and led by the teachings of Freuler to substitute lead for zinc in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>the phosphorodithioate salts here involved, would consider it unobvious that similar high solubility should be present in the analogous lead salts, at least to the extent broadly recited in the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b492-24\">.

For example, Freuler states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">In referring to the content of 1.0% of the salt in the lubricating oil, it is not intended to convey the idea that this amount is critical. Varying proportions may be employed in mineral lubricating oils between any lower range sufficient to produce the desired increased film strength, or stabilization, or oxidation control, for example, 0.1%, up to a figure such as 20% beyond which added material produces no appreciable increased effect. * * *</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
