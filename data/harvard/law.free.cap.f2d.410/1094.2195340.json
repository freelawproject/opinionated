Constituting the disputed subject matter of the tax are periodic payments made to decedent\u2019s dependent sister under a survivorship benefit plan of the decedent\u2019s employer. Specifically, the issue is whether the value of these payments is includable in the gross estate of the decedent for tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-21\">It has long been recognized that the federal estate tax \u201cis not levied on the property of which an estate is composed * * * [but] is an excise imposed upon the transfer of or shifting in relationships to property [or interests] at death.\u201d United States Trust Co. of New York v. Helvering, 307 U.S. 57, 60, 59 S.Ct. 692, 693, 83 L.Ed. 1104 (1939). Congress has altered the operation of the estate tax to meet the changes which the ingenuity of our age, and our tax-conscious economy, have devised to shift \u201cthe relationships to property\u201d or interest in things at death. In 1954, Congress enacted \u00a7 2039 which was new and did not correspond to any prior provision of existing law. S.Rep. No. 1622, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. (3 U.S.C.Cong. &amp; Adm. News, pp. 4756-4757, 5113-5115 (1954)); H.R.Rep. No. 1357, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. (3 U.S.C.Cong. &amp; Adm.News, pp. 4117, 4457-4459 (1954)); All v. McCobb, 321 F.2d 633, 635 (2d Cir. 1963). The new section frames the taxing power in terms of the operative view and effect of a transaction rather than the technical requirements of rights in property. Bahen\u2019s Estate v. United States, 305 F.2d 827, 829, 158 Ct.Cl. 141 (1962).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1159-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1097\">*1097</page-number>Congress intended to include in the gross estate of a decedent for estate tax purposes the value of interests which under traditional common law concepts were never part of the \u201cestate.\u201d These interests are considered to pass to others at decedent\u2019s death because they were interests \u201cbelonging to, accumulated by, or created by or for\u201d the decedent. <em>Bahen, supra </em>at 834. The court went on to say in <em>Bahen-.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1159-4\">Phrased in terms of the earlier concepts of a decedent\u2019s \u201cproperty\u201d \u201ctransferred\u201d at his death, Section 2039 declares that annuities or other payments payable by an employer to his employee, and on his death to a beneficiary, constitute his property \u2014 created by him through his employer as part of the employment arrangement and in consideration of his continued services- \u2014 which is transferred to another at his death. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1159-13\">With this legislative purpose in mind, observable from a close reading of the statute and its legislative history, and supported by the authorities above cited, we proceed to our duty <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to determine the application of the statute to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-14\">At the moment of his death on March 10, 1958, Hamilton Gray (whose executor, appellant, brought this action to recover federal estate taxes assessed and paid after an audit) was an employee of Socony Mobil Oil Company. Decedent was a participant in the Socony Retirement Annuity Plan (hereinafter Retirement Plan), which became effective December 31, 1956, and in the Company\u2019s Survivorship Benefit Plan for 20-Year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1098\">*1098</page-number>Employees (hereinafter Survivorship Plan), which became effective November 30, 1957.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-4\">As a participant in the Retirement Plan, decedent Gray had a vested right upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 65 to receive annuity payments for the remainder of his life.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Gray died pri- or to retirement and therefore never received any payments from the Retirement Plan. His contributions to the Plan, plus interest to the date of death, were paid to a designated beneficiary.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1160-5\">The Survivorship Plan, a non-contributory plan,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> provided that if an employee should die in the active service of the company after 20 years\u2019 service, as happened here,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> a beneficiary designated by the employee would receive total benefits equal to twice the annual salary earned prior to death. The beneficiary or beneficiaries which an employee could designate were a spouse, children, parents or other dependents. In the ease of \u201cother dependents,\u201d the relationship of the dependent to the employee had to be acceptable to the Company at the time of designation, and the beneficiary had to be dependent upon the employee for his or her principal support at the time of designation as well as at the employee\u2019s death. An employee had the right to designate a contingent beneficiary who would continue to receive benefits upon the death of the primary beneficiary. In the event no contingent beneficiary was named and the primary beneficiary died, any remaining benefits would lapse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-16\">Several other important features of the Survivorship Plan, relating to the employer\u2019s right to revoke or modify the Plan and to the effect of the Plan upon a member\u2019s employment status, are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1099\">*1099</page-number>Decedent Gray designated as his beneficiary his semi-invalid sister, Isabella Gray, who had been dependent upon him for her sole support. No contingent beneficiary was named. This litigation concerns the inclusion in Gray\u2019s gross estate of the benefits Socony is paying to Isabella Gray.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-5\">Under the Survivorship Plan Socony had several optional methods of making the benefit payments.'<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Socony elected to pay Isabella Gray $158.31 per month for life, or until she exhausted the total fund of $35,635.59, whichever period ended first.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-6\">The Internal Revenue Service included the full $35,635.59 in the gross estate of Hamilton Gray after an audit of the federal estate tax return.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In 1962, the appellant-executor paid the tax deficiency, which had been assessed in the amount of $11,582.72, plus $2,103.93 in interest. After a claim for refund was disallowed in 1963, this suit was brought in 1965 to recover the taxes paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-7\">The authority for the imposition of the tax by the Government, as previously noted, is \u00a7 2039 of the Internal Revenue Code which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1161-13\">\u00a7 2039. Annuities</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1161-14\">(a) <em>General. </em>\u2014 The gross estate shall include the value of an annuity or other payment receivable by any beneficiary by reason of surviving the decedent under any form of contract or agreement entered into after March 3, 1931 (other than as insurance under policies on the life of the decedent), if, under such contract or agreement, an annuity or other payment was payable to the decedent, or the decedent possessed the right to receive such annuity or payment either alone or in conjunction with another for his life or for any period not ascertainable without reference to his death or for any period which does not in fact end before his death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1161-15\">(b) <em>Amount includible. </em>\u2014 Subsection (a) shall apply to only such'part of the value of the annuity or other payment receivable under such contract or agreement as is proportionate to that part of the purchase price therefor contributed by the decedent. For pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1100\">*1100</page-number>poses of this section, any contribution by the decedent\u2019s employer or former employer to the purchase price of such contract or agreement (whether or not to an employee\u2019s trust or fund forming part of a pension, annuity, retirement, bonus or profit sharing plan) shall be considered to be contributed by the decedent if made by reason of his employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1162-4\">* -x- * -\u00bb -x- *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1162-5\">Treasury Regulations were adopted in final form in 1958 to implement the new IRC section on annuities. 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.2039-1 (1968). The provisions of the regulations, insofar as they apply to this case, may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-6\">(1) The term \u201cannuity or other payment,\u201d as used with respect to both the decedent and the beneficiary, has reference to one or more payments extending over any period of time. The payments may be equal or unequal, conditional or unconditional, periodic or sporadic;</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-7\">(2) The term \u201ccontract or agreement\u201d includes any arrangement, understanding or plan, or any combination of arrangements, understandings or plans arising by reason of the decedent\u2019s employment;</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-8\">(3) The decedent \u201cpossessed the right to receive\u201d an annuity or other payment if, immediately before his death, he had an enforceable right to receive payments at some time in the future, whether or not at the time of his death he had a present right to receive payments. In connection with the preceding sentence, the decedent will be regarded as having had \u201can enforceable right to receive payments at some time in the future\u201d so long as he had complied with his obligations under the contract or agreement up to the time of his death.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1162-16\">The regulations also contain a number of examples of their proper application. Example (6), virtually identical with the facts at bar, will be referred to later.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-17\">Before dealing specifically with appellant\u2019s grounds for contesting the inclusion of the benefits of the Survivorship Plan in the decedent\u2019s gross estate, it will be instructive to review two decisions by eminent jurists, analyzing \u00a7 2039 in depth, which we believe to control the disposition of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-18\">\n<em>Bahen</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-19\">Section 2039 received its \u201cjudicial baptism\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> in Bahen\u2019s Estate v. United States, <em>supra, </em>which was a suit for refund of estate taxes in the Court of Claims, decided in an opinion by Judge Oscar H. Davis. The Government sought to include in the gross estate of the decedent benefits received by his wife under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1101\">*1101</page-number>two separate plans adopted by the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-4\">The more valuable of the two plans was a Deferred Compensation Plan, initiated by the employer in February 1953, under which a stated maximum sum was payable to the employee\u2019s widow and other beneficiaries, at his death either before or after retirement, in sixty equal monthly installments. A key measure of the plan was that if the employee became totally disabled prior to his retirement, the payments would be made to <em>him </em>in sixty equal monthly installments so long as he survived, with any unpaid amounts going to his widow or children. The employer\u2019s president notified the employees of the company eligible for this plan, which was non-contributory, that it was irrevocable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-5\">The other plan was a Death Benefit Plan, adopted earlier in January 1952, which provided that if an employee died after ten years\u2019 service and prior to retirement, the employer would pay an amount equal to three months\u2019 salary to his widow.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-6\">At the time of decedent\u2019s death, he had not retired nor was he eligible for retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-7\">In deciding whether the benefits payable to decedent\u2019s widow under the plans were includable in the gross estate, Judge Davis said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1163-8\">We need consider only Section 2039, a new provision added to the estate tax in 1954 which for the first time established specific rules for the coverage of annuities and other survivor benefits. 305 F.2d at 829.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1163-13\">The big sum the Government was attempting to net in <em>Bahen </em>was the $100,000.00 payable to the widow under the Deferred Compensation Plan. In explicit fashion, and with great clarity, Judge Davis\u2019 opinion walks us through the elements of taxability under \u00a7 2039, and its implementing regulations, to support the claim of the Government under the Deferred Compensation Plan:</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-14\">(1) The plan was a \u201cform of contract or agreement\u201d under the statute because even though created by the company unilaterally, it was expressly made irrevocable.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1163-15\">(2) Under the regulations the receipt by the widow of the $100,000.00 benefit in sixty equal installments met the \u201cannuity or other payment\u201d to the beneficiary requisite of \u00a7 2039(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-16\">(3) The requirement that at his death the decedent \u201cpossessed the right to receive * * * [an] annuity or [other] payment\u201d involved two problems:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1163-17\">(a) The court considered the compensation payable to decedent in the event he became totally incapacitated during his lifetime prior to retirement as a type of \u201cannuity or other payment\u201d within the purview of the statute.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1102\">*1102</page-number>(b) The court held that the potential right which the decedent had to receive the disability payments, <em>even though the right never materialized in his lifetime, </em>satisfied the condition that he must possess the right to receive an annuity or payment at his death. The specific holding by the court on this point is important because of its direct applicability to the appeal we are considering in the Gray estate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1164-4\">We hold, however, that at his death Mr. Bahen did \u201cpossess the right\u201d to receive the disability payments in the future if certain conditions were fulfilled, and therefore that the alternative requirement of Section 2039 is met. The intentional juxtaposition in the statute of amounts \u201cpayable\u201d and those the decedent \u201cpossessed the right to receive\u201d indicates that the former relates to the present (i. e. at time of death) and the latter to the future. The Regulations make clear that, in circumstances like these, the decedent\u2019s interest in future benefits, even if contingent, is sufficient. [Footnote omitted.] Where the employer has offered a plan of this kind, the employee\u2019s compliance with his obligations to the company gives him \u201can enforceable right to receive payments in the future, whether or not, at the time of his death, he had a present right to receive payments.\u201d 305 F.2d at 831.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1164-8\">The court refused to make any distinction, as asserted by the taxpayer in <em>Ba-hen, </em>between possessing the right to receive a <em>retirement annuity </em>on the contingency of living to retirement age and the right to receive <em>disability payments </em>on the contingency of becoming totally disabled prior to retirement. The important point, according to the court, was that the statute and the regulations contemplate the right to receive sums becoming due in the future regardless of the nature of the contingency.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-9\">(4) Section 2039 further requires that the decedent\u2019s right to receive the annuity or payment must be possessed \u201cfor his life or for any period not ascertainable without reference to his death or for any period which does not in fact end before his death.\u201d The court said the decedent had the right to receive the contingent total disability payments right up to the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-10\">(5) The final element of coverage under the statute, set forth in \u00a7 2039(b), requires that the purchase price of the annuity or other payment must have been contributed by the decedent. The statute makes this requirement easy to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1103\">*1103</page-number>meet by providing that the employer\u2019s contribution for the purchase price \u201cshall be considered to be contributed by the decedent if made by reason of his employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-5\">Having fit the Deferred Compensation Plan benefits into the mold of \u00a7 2039, Judge Davis proceeded to the more difficult task of deciding whether the three months\u2019 salary received by the widow under the Death Benefit Plan was properly part of the decedent\u2019s gross estate. The court conceded that standing alone the amount received under the Death Benefit Plan would not be taxable because under <em>that </em>Plan there was no right possessed by the <em>decedent </em>at his death to receive \u201can annuity or other payment.\u201d The court concluded, however, that the Death Benefit Plan payment to the widow <em>was </em>taxable, and this is a decisive precedent in disposing of the Gray appeal before us, by holding the two plans in <em>Bahen, </em>i. e., the Deferred Compensation Plan and the Death Benefit Plan, to constitute in combination a \u201cform of contract or agreement\u201d for the purpose of \u00a7 2039.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus decedent\u2019s right in <em>Bahen </em>to receive the potential total disability payments under the <em>Deferred Compensation Plan </em>met the requirement that the decedent possess the right to receive an annuity or payment at his death so as to make the payment received by the widow under the <em>other </em>part of the overall contract or agreement, i. e., the <em>Death Benefit Plan, </em>subject to inclusion in the gross estate.</p>\n<p id=\"an9-dedup-0\">Judge Davis put it this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1165-6\">[T]he Government makes another point which we do accept as bringing the Death Benefit Plan under Section 2039. The suggestion is that this Plan should not be viewed in isolation but must be considered together with the Deferred Compensation Plan \u2014 as if both arrangements were combined into one plan, providing two types of benefits for beneficiaries after the employee\u2019s death but only one type of benefit (disability compensation) to the employee himself. There is some factual support, if that be necessary, for looking at the two plans together, since the Death Benefit Plan was adopted in January 1952 and the Deferred Compensation Plan only a year later in February 1953.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> There appears to be a common genesis and a unifying thread. 305 F.2d at 835.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1165-11\">\n<em>All</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-12\">All v. McCobb, 321 F.2d 633 (2d Cir. 1963), decided by Judge (now Justice) Marshall, involves a somewhat different factual context. There were also two plans in issue which had been adopted by the employer Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, one a Retirement Annuity Plan and the other a Death Benefit Plan. Under the Retirement Plan, the decedent who had already retired prior to his death received a fixed retirement allowance. The Death Benefit Plan provided for the payment to the surviving dependents of an employee who dies following retirement of \u201cbenefits equal to twelve times the monthly retirement allowance paid to the annuitant, less payments provided by law by the Government\u201d under Social Security.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-13\">At issue in <em>All </em>was the includability in the decedent\u2019s estate of the payments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number>to which the widow was entitled under the Standard Oil Death Benefit Plan.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1166-4\">Judge Marshall followed the step-by-step analysis of \u00a7 2039 by Judge Davis in <em>Bahen </em>in holding the widow\u2019s payments under the Death Benefit Plan to be part of the gross estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-5\">The key point in <em>All, </em>which makes the decision a compelling precedent for the disposition of the present appeal, is Judge Marshall\u2019s holding that \u201cfor purposes of determining the applicability of \u00a7 2039, the [Retirement] Annuity Plan and the Death Benefit Plan are to be considered as having been integrated into a single plan,\u201d citing Example (6) of the Treasury Regulations, \u00a7 20.2039-l(b) (2), <em>infra </em>note 21. 321 F.2d at .636.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-6\">Turning now to the main prongs of appellant\u2019s attack on the inclusion of Isabella Gray\u2019s benefit payments in her brother\u2019s gross estate, the taxpayer argues:</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-7\">(1) that the two plans may not be considered in combination as a \u201cform of contract or agreement\u201d under \u00a7 2039;</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-8\">(2) that there was no enforceable contract or agreement; and</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-9\">(3) that even if the contract or agreement requirement were met, there was no annuity or other payment payable to the decedent, nor did the decedent possess the right to receive such annuity or payment, at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-13\"><em>Do Socony\u2019s Retirement Plan and Surviv-orship Plan Viewed Together Constitute a \u201cForm of Contract or Agreement\u201d Under </em>\u00a7 <em>2039?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1166-14\">Although the two Socony Plans involved here are separate in that they were not created by the same document,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> nor initiated at the same time,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> nor did they make any reference to each other, the purpose of the two plans clearly was to form an integrated program to assure the employees an annuity upon retirement as well as to provide benefits to designated survivors on the d\u00e9ath of an employee before his retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-15\">The applicable part of the Treasury Regulations, followed in <em>Bahen </em>and <em>All, </em>\u00a7 20.2039-1 (b) (ii), states that the \u201cterm \u2018contract or agreement\u2019 includes any arrangement, understanding or plan, <em>or any combination of arrangements, understandings or plans </em>arising by reason of the decedent\u2019s employment.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-16\">By reason of his employment, decedent Gray had a combination of plans providing (a) for an annuity upon reaching the age of retirement (Retirement Plan), or (b) if he died before retirement but after 20 years\u2019 service, for certain benefit payments to his designated beneficiary (Sur-vivorship Plan). Example (6) of the applicable Treasury Regulations, set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> specifically contemplates the combined operative effect of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>two separate plans established by a decedent\u2019s employer in determining whether or not benefits derived from either one of the plans shall be includable in the gross estate. All v. McCobb, <em>supra </em>at 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-5\">Judge Davis\u2019 comments in <em>Bahen </em>on the portion of the Treasury Regulations, \u00a7 20.2039-1 (b) (ii), quoted above, and on Example (6), are wholly persuasive on the \u201ccontract or agreement\u201d issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ad5-dedup-0\">Example (6) * * * describes two separate plans neither of which, by itself, would meet the requirements of Section 2039 but which would satisfy those requirements if the plans were considered as one. The Regulations indicate that the plans are to be viewed together, for the reason stated above in the text.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1167-6\">Effect must be given to this declaration, adopted pursuant to the Treasury\u2019s recognized power to issue regulations and not challenged by plaintiff, since it does not violate the terms or the spirit of Section 2039. In view of the general purpose of the statute to cover a large share of employer-contributed payments to an employee\u2019s survivors, it is not unreasonable to lump together all of the employer\u2019s various benefit plans taking account of the employee\u2019s death * * * in order to decide whether and to what extent Section 2039 applies to his estate. There is no immutable requirement in the legislation that each plan separately adopted by a company must be considered alone. One good ground for rejecting that position is to prevent attempts to avoid the reach of the statute by a series of contrived plans none of which, in itself, would fall under the section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1167-14\">This directive in the Regulations that all rights and benefits \u201care to be considered together\u201d \u2014 read with another part of the same Regulation which defines \u201ccontract or agreement\u201d under Section 2039 to cover \u201cany combination of arrangements, understandings, or plans arising by reason of the decedent\u2019s employment\u201d \u2014 requires the two plans of the C. &amp; O. to be deemed a coordinated whole for the purposes of Section 2039. On that view the payments under the Death Benefit Plan were includable in the decedent\u2019s gross estate for the reasons given above with respect to the Deferred Compensation Plan. If the two Plans are integrated into one, each element required for coverage of all payments is present.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> [Footnotes omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1167-15\">Appellant seeks to distinguish <em>Bahen </em>on the ground that the Deferred Compensation Plan in that case was \u201cirrevocable.\u201d But this was not decisive in <em>Bahen. </em>The payments under the Death Benefit Plan in that case which the court said would not have been taxable standing alone, were includable in the gross estate because of the combined treatment of the two plans in <em>Bahen </em>as a unitary contract or agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-16\">Likewise, in the case at bar, the benefits to Isabella Gray under the Survivor-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1106\">*1106</page-number>ship Plan, standing alone, may not have been includable in decedent\u2019s gross estate. These benefits are taxable, however, because of the existence of the Retirement Plan, which the district court properly held<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> should be considered in combination with the Survivorship Plan as a contract or agreement under \u00a7 2039.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1168-4\">We conclude that there is simply no merit to the taxpayer\u2019s contention that the combination of the two plans here may not be treated as a contract or agreement under \u00a7 2039.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-5\">\n<em>Was the \u201cContract or Agreement\u201d Enforceable?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-6\">We believe that the preceding discussion explaining and supporting the treatment of the two separate plans as a contract or agreement under \u00a7 2039 is sufficient to dispose of this issue. However, the taxpayer presses hard his contention that there is no <em>enforceable </em>contract here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-7\">We have already observed that \u00a7 2039 is a departure from common law notions, and that Congress did not necessarily intend that the words used should be considered in terms of traditional property or contract law concepts so that, as <em>Ba-hen </em>suggests we should \u201cnot become entangled in the older meshes.\u201d 305 F.2d at 829.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-8\">We do not need to decide in this case, however, whether in using the phrase \u201ccontract or agreement\u201d in \u00a7 2039 Congress intended to create a unique, \u201cfederal\u201d type of contract relationship limited to estate tax purposes as we believe that Soeony\u2019s obligation to pay Isabella Gray is enforceable under regular contract law principles.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1168-15\">The taxpayer\u2019s focus on decedent Gray\u2019s possible inability to enforce the Survivorship Plan is misplaced; it is Isabella Gray\u2019s right to enforce Socony\u2019s obligation with which we should be concerned. And we find that Isabella Gray may enforce what is a matured contract right as an intended third-party beneficiary.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1168-16\">Must we test the viability of the third-party beneficiary contract here by the law of the state of the decedent ? In Miller v. United States, 387 F.2d 866 (3d Cir. 1968), we said, in an estate tax appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1168-17\">The extent of the decedent\u2019s interest in the testator\u2019s estate under the power to consume must be determined by Pennsylvania law, although the tax-ability of the interest will be determined by federal law. [Footnote omitted.] 387 F.2d at 868.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1168-18\">Assuming that the <em>Miller </em>case formula applies to the determination of the question of the enforceability of the contract here, we believe that the law of New Jersey (the state of the decedent), state law generally, and the Restatement of Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>tracts support the concept of enforceability we now proceed to outline.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-5\">The contract rights to be enforced arise from the offer made by Socony to its employees to participate in the Sur-vivorship Plan. Decedent Gray accepted this offer and designated his sister as the beneficiary. Socony then had by way of consideration a satisfied employee who continued in its employ. On his part, decedent was assured that if he died as a Socony employee prior to his retirement, and the Survivorship Plan were still in effect, Isabella would receive certain benefits.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Isabella Gray, as an intended beneficiary,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> could enforce the contract.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1169-6\">Decedent Gray\u2019s designation of Isabella Gray as the beneficiary, and So-cony\u2019s acceptance, place her in the class of an intended beneficiary. In fact, the Survivorhip Plan by its own terms contemplates enforcement by the named beneficiary.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1169-16\">As a beneficiary of a plan which was subject to \u201cmodification and revocation\u201d during the lifetime of the employee-decedent, Isabella Gray had rights similar to the beneficiary of a life insurance contract where the insured may change the beneficiary at will.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-17\">Williston calls this a vested contract subject to divestment: \u201cWhere the policy reserves to the insured a power to change the beneficiary, there is a defeasible vested interest in the latter.\u201d 2 Williston, Contracts, \u00a7 369 (3d ed. 1960). The life insurance analysis by Williston has been applied to situations similar to the instant appeal.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1170-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number>In Roberts v. Ellis, 229 Or. 609, 368 P.2d 342 (1962), as part of the contract of employment the employer agreed, <em>inter alia, </em>to pay to the employee\u2019s wife, if she should survive him, a sum of $1,000.00 per month. In upholding the widow\u2019s right to payment, the Oregon court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGC5\">* * * [T]he widow\u2019s rights, created during the husband\u2019s lifetime, became absolute upon his death * * *. The situation is analogous to that of a contingent remainderman whose estate can be defeated by a variety of circumstances over which he has no control, e. g., the birth of an heir to the holder of a limited fee, etc. A contingent remainder may become a vested remainder when a named person dies because it is no longer within the power of such a person to defeat the estate. * * * 368 P.2d at 345.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1170-5\">A New Jersey case, Bendit v. Inta-rante, 70 N.J.Super. 116, 175 A.2d 222 (1961), was a suit by an executor to recover for the estate of his decedent the proceeds of an agreement made by the decedent, Salvatore La Spada, and one defendant, whereby the latter was to pay the decedent $100.00 per week for ten years and, in the event of his death during that period, the payments were to be continued to the decedent\u2019s widow. Although the precise issue before the court was the testamentary nature of the document, i. e., whether it was revocable, the New Jersey court held that the widow as an intended third-party beneficiary could enforce the contract. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1170-12\">An otherwise valid and binding contract for the payment of monies due or to become due to the promisee is not invalidated because one of its provisions calls for payment of the balance due to a third party, in the event of the prom-isee\u2019s death before receiving payment in full. * * * [The agreement] conveyed a present equitable right upon Mrs. La Spada as a third-party beneficiary, which ripened into full ownership of the balance due upon her husband\u2019s death. * * * Restatement, Contracts, sec. 133(a) and 135(a). * * * The contract was valid and enforceable, and the weekly payments became payable to Mrs. La Spada upon her husband\u2019s death. 175 A.2d at 229.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1109\">*1109</page-number>In contending that decedent Gray did not have an enforceable right in the Sur-vivorship Plan, an issue we need not decide, appellant fails to consider that Isabella Gray, by reason of surviving the decedent, had a right to enforce payment under a \u201cform of contract or agreement,\u201d here a third-party beneficiary contract. As was well stated by Judge Goodrich in Isbrandtsen Co. v. Local 1291, 204 F.2d 495, 496-497 (3d Cir. 1953), the focus of the court should be on the rights of the party for whose benefit the contract was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-5\">The taxpayer also argues that by the very terms of the Survivorship Plan it is non-eontractual and unenforceable. Not only does this contention ignore the enforcement provision of the Plan previously cited,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> but it misconstrues the clear import of Part VI of the Survivorship Plan, somewhat ineptly labeled \u201cNon-contractual.\u201d <footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The purpose of the \u201cnon-contractual\u201d provision, which actually reaffirms the enforceable rights of beneficiaries under the Survivorship Plan, is to make unambiguous the fact that this plan is not a contract of employment but rather a separate arrangement arising out of the employment relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-12\">\n<em>Did Decedent Possess a Right to Receive an Annuity or Other Payment Under Section 2039(a) ?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-13\">Appellant argues that the decedent was not possessed of the right to receive an annuity or other payment, as required under \u00a7 2039(a). In resolving the issue posed under this heading, a searching anaysis of this part of \u00a7 2039 is in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-14\">First, an explanation regarding the construction and use of the phrase \u201cannuity or * * * payment\u201d is necessary. This phrase is used three times in \u00a7 2039 (a). Although it is proper to give the same definition to a word or phrase used several times in a section of a statute, the facts here do not require us to <em>focus </em>on the same word each time the phrase is used. We may focus on the word \u201cpayment\u201d in one use of the phrase and on the alternative word \u201cannuity\u201d in another application of the phrase.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>Under the facts here presented, we read the first use of the phrase \u201cannuity or other payment\u201d (focusing on the word \u201cpayment\u201d) to refer to the money actually paid or to be paid to the beneficiary under the Survivorship Plan. For our purposes the second (and therefore the third) use of the phrase refers to the annuity provided for under the decedent\u2019s Retirement Plan. Thus in the second and third use of the phrase the focus will be on the word \u201cannuity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-4\">This means, then, that the retirement \u201cannuity\u201d which the decedent Gray possessed the right to receive at his death need not be under the same plan as the \u201cpayment\u201d receivable by the surviving beneficiary. That the decedent need not have possessed any right or property interest in the benefits payable to the <em>survivor </em>is made clear in Beal v. C. I. R., 47 T.C. 269, 273 (1966). The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1172-5\">* * * [W]e can perceive no reason to limit the section only to those payments to a beneficiary which are a continuation of the payments to the decedent or to those payments to a beneficiary which are a substitution for amounts otherwise payable to the deeement. 47 T.C. at 272.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1172-6\">Secondly, at the risk of prolonging this opinion unduly, it may be helpful to analyze \u00a7 2039(a) in terms of a hypothetical (to use the language of the logician), viz., if <em>A </em>and <em>B </em>then &lt;7.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1172-11\"><em>A </em>consists of all the language in the second part of \u00a7 2039(a), starting with the word \u201cif\u201d following the parenthesis,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> explaining the rights the decedent must have had. <em>B </em>is described in the first part of \u00a7 2039(a),<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> and is the money payable to the beneficiary who takes by reason of surviving the decedent. If <em>A </em>and <em>B </em>are present, then the conclusion <em>C </em>follows,<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> the payments to the beneficiary are in-cludable in the gross estate of the decedent for tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-12\">Isabella Gray, the beneficiary, received a \u201cpayment\u201d by reason of surviving the decedent. Thus element <em>B </em>of the hypothetical is present.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-13\">To find <em>A </em>requires further interpretation. If, under the contract, \u201ceither alone or in conjunction with another for his life or for any period not ascertainable without reference to his death or for any period which does not in fact end before his death,\u201d the decedent</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1172-14\">(1) had an annuity or other payment payable to him, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1172-15\">(2) was possessed of the right to receive such annuity or payment,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1172-16\">then element <em>A </em>has been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-17\">Although at the moment of his death the decedent Gray did not have the benefits of the Retirement Plan \u201cpayable\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>him, he \u201cpossessed\u201d a vested right to receive such an annuity.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1173-5\">The decedent\u2019s vested right<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> in an annuity under the Retirement Plan is sufficient to meet the requirements of element <em>A. </em>Therefore, both conditions <em>A </em>and <em>B </em>are present, leading to conclusion <em>C, </em>i. e., the includability of Isabella Gray\u2019s benefits under the Survivorship Plan in the decedent\u2019s gross estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-6\">This analysis is clearly supported by <em>Bahen, supra, </em>which on the requirement of \u201cpossessed the right to receive\u201d was not even as strong as the facts here. It will be recalled that in <em>Bahen, </em>the \u201cannuity or payment\u201d which the decedent possessed was the right to receive certain compensation in the event of becoming totally disabled during his lifetime prior to retirement, a contingency which the taxpayer there argued did not reach the more likely ripening of a right to receive an annuity upon reaching retirement age. The court held that either contingency, total disability or retirement, was sufficient to meet the \u201cpossessed the right to receive such annuity or payment\u201d condition under \u00a7 2039(a). 305 F.2d at 831-832.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1173-11\">One final matter need be discussed. Section 2039(c) of the Internal Revenue Code and \u00a7 20.2039-2 of the Regulations, as amended, provide that if one of the plans in a combined plan situation qualifies for exemption under 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 401(a), there is no taxability under \u00a7 2039(a).<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Appellant did not raise this issue below nor was it raised in the brief to this court. At oral argument, however, appellant\u2019s counsel intimated, apparently for the first time, that the So-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>cony Retirement Plan may be a qualified plan under \u00a7 401(a).<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1174-4\">We have held that in civil matters an issue not raised below may not be considered on appeal: United States v. Ivy Hall Apartments, Inc., 310 F.2d 5, 10 (3d Cir. 1962).<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> We, therefore, may not consider appellant\u2019s \u00a7 401(a) contention at this stage. It could have been, and should have been, raised below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-5\">For the reasons we have expressed at length in this opinion, the decision of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1158-12\">.

Pre-1954 cases were in disagreement regarding taxability of such benefits as part of a decedent\u2019s gross estate under other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. See discussion in Beal v. C.

The court refused to consider the second provision in the agreement, i. e., the annual payments promised to the decedent in the event he became disabled but continued as an advisor and counsellor (which never materialized), as a type of retirement annuity plan. The court would not analogize this arrangement to the provision in the <em>Bahen </em>Deferred Compensation Plan whereby the decedent was to receive certain payments in the event he became totally disabled prior to his retirement. It was the requirement for continuing to furnish advice and counsel, even if lie became disabled, that led the majority of the court to distinguish <em>Bahen. </em>The court considered the payments as a commitment to continue to pay a \u201csalary\u201d rather than the kind of \u201cannuity\u201d presumably contemplated under \u00a7 2039(a). <em>See </em>Fusz v.

Rundle, 327 F.2d 153, 161 (3d Cir. 1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1174-6\">ALDISERT, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AbgK\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-7\">I disagree with the majority\u2019s interpretation of what I consider to be the clear and unsophisticated language of the Annuity Estate Tax Statute, \u00a7 2039 and its implementing Tax Regulation 20.2039 (1) (b) (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-8\">The statute subjects to inclusion in the taxable estate, proceeds from \u201csuch contract or agreement, an annuity or other payment [which] was payable to the decedent, or [which] the decedent possessed the right to receive * * * either alone or in conjunction with another for his life or for any period not ascertainable without reference to his death or for any period which does not in fact end before his death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-11\">The pertinent tax regulation provides that \u201c[A]n annuity \u2018was payable\u2019 to the decedent if, at the time of his death, the decedent was in fact receiving an annuity or other payment, whether or not he had an enforceable right to have the payments continued.\u201d The decedent \u201cpossessed the right to receive an annuity or other payment if, immediately before his death, the decedent had an enforceable right to receive payments at some time in the future, whether or not, at the time of his death he had a present right to receive payments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-12\">The two plans which were combined by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to justify the imposition of the tax involved a retirement plan for the benefit of the decedent, and a survivorship plan for the benefit of a named beneficiary. At those critical moments which controlled the theory of tax imposition, neither plan qualified for taxation under the plain and ordinary meaning of the language of the statute and regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-13\">With respect to the retirement plan, the only plan of the two under which the decedent himself could benefit, the critical moment is \u201cat the time of his death\u201d. At the time of Mr. Gray\u2019s death he was not retired. He was still working. He was receiving his ordinary salary from the company. He had not put in the requisite years to qualify for the retirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>plan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was not \u201cin fact receiving an annuity or other payment\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-5\">Because the decedent in his lifetime was not receiving an annuity or other payment, we must then inquire whether he \u201cpossessed the right to receive\u201d the benefits of any plan. Another equally critical time is set forth in the tax regulations for this contingency: \u201cif immediately prior to his death the decedent had an enforceable right to receive payments at some time in the future\u201d. Under the survivorship plan he had no right to receive anything in the future, for this plan, by its very terms, was not for his benefit but for someone else, to-wit, a designated beneficiary. Similarly the decedent had no enforceable right to receive the benefits of his retirement plan \u201cimmediately before his death,\u201d because at that moment he had not qualified under the appropriate years of service to be eligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-6\">To declare as a matter of law that he had an enforceable right to receive such payments in the future is also to declare as a matter of law that any participant in any retirement program will live long enough to participate in the plan, will be healthy long enough to remain on the job, and will never leave his present employment for another position with another employer. Common sense and experience dictate otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-7\">Accordingly, it cannot be said that the decedent possessed the right to receive the annuity or other payment under the terms of either plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-11\">In this posture, I believe that one conclusion becomes inescapable: because there was no annuity payable to the decedent at the time of his death under the retirement plan, and because the decedent \u201cimmediately before his death\u201d had no enforceable right at some time in the future, under either the retirement or survivorship plans, it is inappropriate to justify taxation on the theory of combining the plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-13\">The effort of the majority to find support for the Commissioner\u2019s action is a masterful endeavor, expressed in comprehensive and scholarly form. This became necessary because of the extreme difficulty of reconciling the language of the statute and the tax regulation with Example 6 of Tax Regulation 20.2039 (l)-<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1175-14\">This formidable task of reconciliation evinces inordinate concern with the sanctity of descriptive commentary at the expense of clear statutory language. Here indeed is the exemplary tail wagging the statutory dog. Because Example (6) is not complete, it is neither a correct statement of the regulations, nor, without more, a proper reflection of the language of the statute upon which the regulation is based. This example is deceptive, because under certain circumstances\u2014 where the terms of the specific combined plans meet the requirements of the statute \u2014 its conclusion may be true. But to make a blatant pronouncement that any combination of retirement and annuity plans will subject the value of the annu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number>ity to an inclusion in the employee\u2019s gross estate is to be dangerously simplistic. Example (6) overlooks the absolute necessity that either or both of the plans comply with the basic language of the statute. For the Commissioner to rely upon this example affixed as an appendage to a purely interpretative regulation, when the specific terms of the plans involved are not within the ambit of the taxing statute is to impose taxation beyond that authorized by law. It is the language of the statute and the appropriate regulations implementing the statute which must control, not an improvidently-worded example.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-4\">With the view I take of this case, it does not become necessary to discuss other serious problems involved, especially the extremely challenging questions of contractual enforceability and third party beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-5\">I would reverse the judgment of the district court and enter judgment in favor of the taxpayer.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1175-8\">. Government\u2019s brief: \u201cAs a 20-year employee of Socony, the decedent, if he had reached retirement age under the Retirement Annuity Plan, would have been entitled to receive for the remainder of his life annuities or payments thereunder.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1175-9\">. \u201cExample (6). The employer made contributions to two different funds set up under two different plans. One plan was to provide the employee, upon his retirement at age 60, with an annuity for life, and the other plan was to provide the employee\u2019s designated beneficiary, upon the employee\u2019s death, with a similar annuity for life. Each plan was established at a different time and each plan was administered separately in every respect. Neither plan at any time met the requirements of section 401(a) (relating to qualified plans). The value of the designated beneficiary\u2019s annuity is includible in the employee\u2019s gross estate. All rights and benefits accruing to an employee and to others by reason of the employment (except rights and benefits accruing under certain plans meeting the requirements of section 401(a) (see \u00a7 20.2039-2)) are considered together in determining whether or not section 2039(a) and (b) applies. The scope of section 2039(a) and (b) cannot be limited by indirection.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
