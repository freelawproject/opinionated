Missouri Pacific\u2019s train, manned by an engineer and lookout, was heading west when it struck John Howard\u2019s car heading south. Howard was killed in the collision. The case was tried solely on the theory of last clear chance. The jury found that Missouri Pacific had the last clear chance to avoid the fatal collision. On this verdict, the district judge entered judgment in favor of Howard\u2019s heirs, and denied Missouri Pacific\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1206-21\">Since from the evidence presented, the jury was justified in finding that the train crew had the last clear chance to make this case into a close call rather than a tragedy, defendant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict must be denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1206-22\">We agree with the district judge that the question in this case was solely one of fact and that the evidence was <em>\u201cof </em>such quality and weight that reasonable and fair-minded men in the exercise of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1145\">*1145</page-number>impartial judgment might reach different conclusions\u201d. Boeing Co. v. Shipman, 5 Cir., 411 F.2d 365 [April 7, 1969]. Accordingly, we hold that the district judge properly denied Missouri Pacific\u2019s motions for a directed verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"AD1\">The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"a7n-dedup-0\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
