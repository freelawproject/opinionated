Ladd (U.S.D.C.D.C.1963), 219 F.Supp. 259, affd. 141 USPQ 623, indicates that appellant\u2019s goods are in fact pasteurized. The above-styled case involved an appeal from the refusal of the Patent Office to allow registration on the Principal Register of the word \u201cPASTEURIZED\u201d for face cream on the ground that the word was merely descriptive of applicant\u2019s goods. The District Court commented as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-20\">The fact that plaintiff and its predecessor alone have used the term \u201cPASTEURIZED\u201d continuously in connection with facial and massage creams for over thirty years, and have been the only ones to do so, is not of itself sufficient to establish a secondary meaning of the term, and furthermore, the fact that the involved term has been used so extensively and over such a long period of time cannot * * * make it properly a term for registration as applied for, particularly in view of the fact that one of plaintiff\u2019s own witnesses in his deposition stated that the materials entering into the cream have been substantially pasteurized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-21\">After citing Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the board, in affirming the examiner, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-22\">It is clear enough * * * that the word \u201cPASTEURIZED\u201d is generieally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>descriptive of any and all products which have been subjected to pasteurization, as it likewise is that it would be deceptively misdescriptive as applied to a product which could be but has not been subjected to pasteurization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-4\">In view of the foregoing, and since applicant\u2019s face creams, as noted by the Court, have been \u201csubstantially pasteurized\u201d, we agree with the Examiner that the word \u201cPASTEURIZED\u201d does not possess the capacity to distinguish applicant\u2019s goods.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">There can be no doubt that the issue of pasteurization was directly before and dealt with by the District Court on the basis of testimony substantially reproduced before us in appellant\u2019s brief. On this phase of the matter, appellant has had its bite at the proverbial cherry. Appellant\u2019s present insistence and argument that the District Court committed error in holding that the face cream had been \u201csubstantially pasteurized\u201d is not within our competence to review, nor do we consider it the determinative factor of the issue we are called upon to resolve in the pending appeals. Suffice it to say that the opinion of the board, in the light of the dictionary definitions, holding that appellant\u2019s face cream had been \u201csubstantially pasteurized\u201d finds ample support in the record. Certain it is that the product is amenable to and was subjected to the process of pasteurization.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Appellant in its brief cites an expired registration of PASTEURIZED CREAM, for facial and massage creams, under the Act of 1920 and argues that this constitutes \u201ca recognition by the Patent Office of the fact that \u2018PASTEURIZED\u2019 is a trademark\u201d; that no intervening factual situation would prevent the mark from distinguishing appellant\u2019s goods, and that the continued exclusive use should enhance rather than diminish re-registrability. It is pointed out that this argument was not made before the board, hence is not properly before us. In re Osweiler, 52 CCPA 1427, 346 F.2d 617, 145 USPQ 691; In re Allen, 51 CCPA 809, 324 F.2d 993, 139 USPQ 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">Appellant advances the argument that notwithstanding the assumption that the mark PASTEURIZED is not capable of distinguishing the goods from those of others, such finding, in itself, is not sufficient to preclude registration on the Supplemental Register, citing In re Simmons Co., 47 CCPA 963, 278 F.2d 517, 126 USPQ 52. In <em>Simmons </em>the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-10\">Second, and of more importance here, * * * [it is suggested] that a mark cannot be placed on the supplemental register unless it can be shown that the \u201caverage purchaser\u201d recognizes it as a trademark. However, that is not the test set forth in the applicable statute (15 U.S.C. 1091), which provides, with certain exceptions not pertinent here, that \u201cAll marks <em>capable of distinguishing </em>applicant\u2019s goods or services and not registrable on the principal register\u201d may be registered on the supplemental register. The test is not whether the mark, when registration is sought, is actually recognized by the average purchaser, or is distinctive of the applicant\u2019s goods in commerce, but whether it is <em>capable of'becoming </em>so. In fact a mark which has become distinctive on an applicant\u2019s goods, if not otherwise barred, is registrable on the principal register, hence is expressly barred from the supplemental register. [Emphasis original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">It is our view that the test applied in <em>Simmons </em>is to be taken subject to the construction placed on the applicable statute in In re Bourns, 45 CCPA 821, 252 F.2d 582, 117 USPQ 38, and subsequently applied in In re Minnesota Mining &amp; Mfg. Co., 51 CCPA 1546, 335 F.2d 836, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>142 USPQ 366. In <em>Bourns </em>the court stated that a mark:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-5\">* * * cannot properly be registered as a trademark, <em>even on the Supplemental Register, </em>unless it is intended primarily to indicate origin of the goods and is of such a nature that the ordinary purchaser would be likely to consider that it indicated such origin. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">We do not consider that the above-noted conditions are met in the instant appeals. We think it apparent that the word \u201cpasteurized\u201d is highly descriptive of appellant\u2019s goods. So accepted, the logical inference follows that it was not primarily intended \u201cto indicate origin of the goods.\u201d We find nothing of record to allay the impact of that inference. Nor do we believe that mere addition of the unquestionably descriptive words \u201cface cream\u201d and the common commendatory term \u201cspecial\u201d to the primary word \u201cpasteurized\u201d results in a mark which can be then considered as capable of distinguishing appellant\u2019s face cream from that of others. The specimens of record disclose that \u201cPASTEURIZED\u201d appears in association with the internationally well-known name \u201cHelena Rubinstein.\u201d Such concurrent usage would, in our judgment, be emanative of the conclusion that the ordinary purchaser would not consider the mark indicative of the origin of the goods. Thus, the conditions prescribed in <em>Bourns </em>are not met. This view was aptly stated by the District Court in the <em>Rubinstein </em>case, previously adverted to, in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-7\">The use of \u201cPASTEURIZED\u201d as has been made by plaintiff herein is not of a nature calculated to cause purchasers to recognize this term as an indication of origin for plaintiff\u2019s face cream rather than as a term used merely to describe a face cream produced by plaintiff which <em>could [be] or has been </em>pasteurized. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-8\"><em>In re Minnesota Mining and Mfg. Co., </em>supra, as here, involved registration under section 23 of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1091). Therein this court pointed out that the mark for which registration is sought need not be a trademark but that it must be a mark \u201ccapable of distinguishing applicant\u2019s goods\u201d from the goods of others. In brief, it <em>might </em>be a mark registrable on the Principal Register upon adequate showing of secondary meaning. In addition thereto, the court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-11\">Applicable in addition to the statutory considerations are those <em>policy considerations, </em>which could prevent registration on the Principal Register, considered in our opinion in In re Deister Concentrator Co., 48 CCPA 952, 289 F.2d 496, 129 USPQ 314, <em>which apply equally to registration on both registers. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">This court in the <em>Deister </em>case delineated a series of truisms applicable to trademark cases, observing that not everything that enables one to determine source, distinguishes goods, or acquires a secondary meaning will be protected as a trademark, and that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-13\">* * * the clear weight of authority shows that the courts will not support exclusive rights in any word or shape which, in their opinion, the public has the right to use in the absence of patent or copyright protection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-14\">While it is true that appellant and no other has had and enjoyed long use of the wordings in issue, we agree with the observation of the examiner that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-15\">Applicant\u2019s long use of the wording, and the fact that others have not used it up to this time, does not make it any less an apt description for the goods, which others in the trade are entitled to use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-16\">In summary, we find persuasive the argument of the solicitor that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-17\">Whether appellant\u2019s goods are pasteurized as evidence shows, or simply could be pasteurized, or would normally be expected by the average purchaser to be pasteurized because so designated in the marks sought to be registered, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>the appellant cannot legally appropriate this common descriptive term for its own use * * * to the exclusion of all others who may desire to pasteurize the face creams they sell * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5B\">It seems to us that the marks speak irrefutably for themselves that appellant\u2019s face creams are pasteurized or substantially so, and are clearly so descriptive of the goods as to be incapable of distinguishing them from the goods of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">\u2022 On the basis of these records and the arguments of counsel, we are not persuaded of reversible error in the decision of the board, which decision is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b501-13\">. 152 USPQ 445.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b501-14\">.

The method was devised by Pasteur to check fermentation in wine, milk, etc. The standard for pasteurization of milk is 145\u00b0 F. for a period of 30 minutes followed by a rapid cooling to below 50\u00b0 F. and storage at that temperature.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b504-6\">RICH, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A8V5\">(dissenting in part, with whom McGUIRE, Judge, joins).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">I concur in the result as to appeal No. 8144 affirming the rejection of the application to register \u201cPASTEURIZED.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I dissent from the opinion insofar as it affirms refusal of the application to register the mark</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">\u201cPASTEURIZED\u201d FACE CREAM SPECIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">involved in appeal No. 8145. I think the two marks involve quite different considerations. In the former case we are dealing with a single descriptive word as well as a prior decision in the District of Columbia courts with respect to the descriptiveness of that word. In the latter, we have a \u201cmark\u201d consisting of a four-word phrase as. to which there has been no prior adjudication and as to which the question of <em>capability </em>of distinguishing applicant\u2019s goods (face cream) from the goods of others rests on a different factual foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">My views on the applicable law are essentially set forth in the quotation in Judge Almond\u2019s opinion from my opinion in the <em>Simmons </em>case. I am unable to see any reason why \u201cPASTEURIZED\u201d FACE CREAM SPECIAL, considered as a whole as it must be, is not a mark with a very definite capability of distinguishing applicant\u2019s goods within the meaning of section 23. Judge Almond\u2019s opinion has not given any <em>reason </em>why it is not. Certain it is that its registrability is not determined by the individual, separate descriptiveness of three of the four words. Conceding \u201cface cream\u201d is as descriptive as \u201cpasteurized,\u201d what about the word SPECIAL? What about the overall combination of words including the quotation marks around PASTEURIZED?</p>\n<p id=\"b504-13\">The board gave no separate consideration to the \u201clong-form\u201d mark. The solicitor\u2019s brief erroneously states that \u201ca determination of whether \u2018Pasteurized\u2019, for use with face cream, is registerable on the Supplemental Register is desposi-tive [sic] of the two appeals at bar.\u201d The examiner made a serious attempt to deal with this mark on its own footing. His ground of rejection was that the whole mark \u201cis believed to constitute the apt descriptive name of applicant\u2019s goods, and is consequently incapable of distinguishing its goods in commerce.\u201d His supporting analysis was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-14\">The wording on the drawing merely indicates that the goods are applicant\u2019s <em>specialty </em>in face creams in its line of goods, and that the same is pasteurized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-15\">This argument I consider too forced to stand up. It appeared in what seems to be the first office action. In the final rejection the examiner modified it by contending that \u201c \u2018Face Cream Special,\u2019 [is] the common name for applicant\u2019s face cream.\u201d I don\u2019t think that contention will hold water. What kind of a product is \u201cFace Cream Special\u201d? In what sense is \u201cspecial\u201d descriptive? In his Answer, the examiner stated his conclusion that the whole mark is nothing but \u201can apt description for the goods, which others in the trade are entitled to use.\u201d I can imagine no circumstance, and none has been pointed out, by virtue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>of which a competitor of Helena Rubinstein, Inc., would have the right to market a product labelled</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">\u201cPASTEURIZED\u201d FACE CREAM SPECIAL. I therefore think the examiner\u2019s rejection is without foundation and that its affirmance below and here is error. On Appeal No. 8145 I would reverse.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b504-11\">.
