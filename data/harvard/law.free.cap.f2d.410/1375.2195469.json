That judgment followed from a motion for summary judgment filed by the appellee, Alabama State Board of Education. We conclude that the trial court correctly determined that \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, affidavits and exhibits reflect that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.\u201d We take this judgment to mean that there exists no issue as to any material fact touching on any federally protected right, such questions as are in the litigation being purely matters over which the federal court has no jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
