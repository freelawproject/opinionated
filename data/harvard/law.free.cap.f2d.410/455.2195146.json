See Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 5 Cir. 1969, 409 F.2d 804, Part I.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-17\">This appeal is taken from the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for injunctive relief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-18\">Appellant, while on probation from a state sentence, was convicted of a federal offense for which he is presently incarcerated in a federal penitentiary. The State of Georgia lodged a detainer against him to take him into custody and hold a hearing to determine whether probation was violated and should be revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-19\">Appellant filed his complaint for an injunction in the court below, based upon 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, claiming his state conviction was invalid and, unless the de-tainer is removed, he will suffer damages amounting to $200,000. The district court treated the complaint as a petition for habeas corpus and denied relief for failure to exhaust state remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-20\">Federal courts will not interfere with a state\u2019s good-faith and orderly administration of its criminal laws except in those extraordinary circumstances where federally created rights face irreparable injury. Cameron v. Johnson, 1968, 390 U.S. 611, 88 S.Ct. 1335, 20 L.Ed.2d 182; Zwickler v. Koota, 1967, 389 U.S. 241, 88 S.Ct. 391, 19 L.Ed.2d 444; Dombrowski v. Pfister, 1965, 380 U.S. 479, 85 S.Ct. 1116, 14 L.Ed.2d 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-21\">Georgia statutes require a hearing to determine whether probation should be revoked or modified (Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 27-2713). The state also has provisions for post-conviction remedies [Ga.Code \u00a7 50-127(1)] of which petitioner has not availed himself. We find no error in the judgment of the district court dismissing the appellant\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
