At the trial before a jury the defendants testified that Dennis voluntarily returned with them to New Jersey to face state criminal charges. Their testimony was corroborated by a federal narcotics agent. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Naz-aretti and McCummings and judgment was accordingly entered pursuant to that verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-26\">On this appeal Dennis contends that the jury\u2019s verdict was against the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>On review of the record we are of the opinion that the jury\u2019s verdict was amply supported by the evidence. Other contentions presented by Dennis are utterly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">The Judgment of the District Court entered pursuant to the jury\u2019s verdict will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
