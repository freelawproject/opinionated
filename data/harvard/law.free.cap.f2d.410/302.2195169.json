The Tax Court found on the facts in this case that neither the litigation in which the estate was involved nor the executprs\u2019 reliance upon their attorney constituted \u201creasonable cause\u201d for failure either to file the return or make timely request for an extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-19\">In Fisk v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 203 F.2d 358 (6th Cir. 1953), a penalty was assessed for an estate tax return which was mailed on the last day allowed by the statute but was received one day late. This court reversed, holding that the delay there involved was an innocent error made despite reasonable care. A five-month delay does not appear to us to present a comparable situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-20\">We cannot hold on this record that the findings of fact of the Tax Court in this case are \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Duberstein, 363 U.S. 278, 80 S.Ct. 1190, 4 L.Ed.2d 1218 (1960).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
