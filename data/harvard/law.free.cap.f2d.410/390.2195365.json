Stout v. Broom, 5 Cir. 1969, 406 F.2d 758.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-27\">The appellants are prisoners in the Georgia State Penitentiary at Reidsville <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>who petitioned the district court for an injunction to block desegregation of prison facilities. The integration had been ordered by a three-judge district court. See Wilson et al. v. Kelley, N.D.Ga.1968, 294 F.Supp. 1005.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Injunctive relief was denied below on grounds that <em>Wilson </em>was a proper class action under Rule 23(b) (1), F.R. Civ.P., and appellants, being within the class designated as plaintiffs in that action, are bound by that decision. Rule 23(c) (3), F.R.Civ.P. The district court was correct in its interpretation of the rule. The judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
