Petitioner seeks a writ of mandamus to compel the respondent judge to vacate his order transferring the action to the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">\u201cFor the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any district or division where it might have been brought.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404 (a). In ruling on Honeywell\u2019s motion to transfer the action to Minnesota, the District Judge weighed a number of factors, including the location of the parties, the witnesses and the physical , evidence, and the desirability of consolidating the action with antitrust litigation between Honeywell and petitioner\u2019s parent corporation pending in the District of Minnesota. Our review of the record leaves us unconvinced that the District Judge abused his discretion in concluding a transfer would serve \u201cthe convenience of parties and witnesses\u201d and be in \u201cthe interest of justice.\u201d The record is inconclusive, however, as to whether the action \u201cmight have been brought\u201d in Minnesota.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\"> A civil action for patent infringement may be brought \u201cin the judicial district where the defendant resides, or where the defendant has committed acts of infringement and has a regular and established place of business.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400(b). Before a motion to transfer under \u00a7 1404(a) may be granted, it must appear that the conditions necessary to satisfy this special venue provision existed on the date the action was commenced. Hoffman v. Blaski, 363 U.S. 335, 80 S.Ct. 1084, 4 L.Ed.2d 1254 (1960). Petitioner conceded in the proceedings before the District Judge that Honeywell had a \u201cregular and established place of business\u201d in Minnesota,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but the record does not show, and the District Judge apparently did not find that Honeywell had \u201ccommitted acts of infringement\u201d there.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">An act of infringement is committed when a person \u201cwithout authority makes, uses or sells any patented invention, within the United States during the term of the patent therefor.\u201d 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(a). The record does not disclose whether at the time the action was commenced Honeywell had made, used or sold in Minnesota any machine or device embodying the patented invention. For this reason, we believe the order transferring the case to the District of Minnesota should be vacated, and the motion to transfer reconsidered on the basis of such additional evidence as the parties may introduce with respect to the question whether the action \u201cmight have been brought\u201d in that district. <em>Cf. </em>Platt v. Minnesota Mining &amp; Mfg. Co., 376 U.S. 240, 84 S.Ct. 769, 11 L.Ed.2d 674 (1964). We assume that the respondent will act in accordance with these views, and that the writ prayed for need not be issued.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b300-6\">. Since Honeywell is incorporated in Delaware, it does not \u201creside\u201d in Minnesota. Fourco Glass Co. v. Transmirra Products Corp., 353 U.S. 222, 77 S.Ct. 787, 1 L.Ed.2d 786 (1957).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
