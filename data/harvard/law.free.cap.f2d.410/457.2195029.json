The employer does not challenge the Section 8(a) (1) findings. Therefore, the only issues relate to the Section 8(a) (3) violations, which involve the discharge of three permanent employees and one hired for extra work.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-24\">The consideration presented to the Court in this case is succinctly outlined in Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company v. N.L.R.B., 354 F.2d 707 (5 Cir., 1966):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-25\">\u201cThe only issue here is whether the findings of the Board are supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. We cannot disturb the Board\u2019s choice if there is a fair conflict between the employer\u2019s testimony and a reasonable inference of discrimination [citations omitted]. The Board is not compelled to accept the employer\u2019s statement when there is reasonable cause for believing that the ground put forward by the employer was not the true one, and that the real reason was the employer\u2019s dissatisfaction with the employee\u2019s union activity [citations omitted]. When faced with a review of findings, pegged on witness credibility, courts have generally held that a determination of credibility by the N.L.R.B. is not to be reversed unless there is uncontrovertible evidence to the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>trary [citations omitted.].\u201d (brackets added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">The employer\u2019s justifications for discharging the men involved appear in the record and careful study of the full proceedings reveals that the factual determinations of the Board are sustainable. The employer\u2019s contentions are without merit. The petition for enforcement of the Board\u2019s order is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"AMW\">Order enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
