We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">At the time of her husband\u2019s death, March 19, 1965, the total amount due under six policies issued by defendant covering decedent was $100,861.86. The several policies were issued to plaintiff as owner and in each she was named primary beneficiary. Each policy was subject to an \u201cAgreement of Designation of Beneficiary and Method of Settlement\u201d made September 14, 1945, which elected a settlement option providing for continuous monthly payments of $402.86 to plaintiff guaranteed for twenty years and for life thereafter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">Plaintiff alleged in substance that she had timely performed all of her policy obligations; that defendant refused to pay, in accordance with her demand, the total face value, contrary to the express terms of the contract; and that defendant\u2019s withholding its \u201cconsent\u201d to election of the lump sum provision of the insurance contracts was arbitrary and in disregard of plaintiff\u2019s interest. The district court entered summary judgment for defendant on the ground that \u201cplaintiff ha[d] no right * * * to elect a lump sum payment, subsequent to maturity of the policies, without * * * consent of * * * defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-11\">Plaintiff\u2019s affidavits justify the following statement of facts: After her husband died on March 19, 1965, plaintiff, being uncertain as to her cash needs, did not immediately answer the repeated requests of the Company that she elect a mode of payment of the proceeds of the policies. On May 3, about six weeks after her husband\u2019s death, the Company wrote plaintiff\u2019s lawyer enclosing an inter-office memorandum to the effect that plaintiff had eighteen months to decide whether she would like a life income option. Plaintiff relied on the eighteen months representation and did not demand the lump sum settlement until October 29, 1965. On November 3, 1965, the Company refused the demand, stating that her election required the consent which they refused to give.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-13\">Plaintiff argues that the foregoing post-maturity events \u201ctacitly\u201d admit her right to change the mode of payment and that the Company is estopped from withholding consent; that the withholding of consent was arbitrary and invalid; and that Indiana law prohibited the Company from changing its tacit position by failing, within two months after proof of death was submitted, to settle the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-14\">We see no merit in the last argument. The delay was due primarily to plaintiff\u2019s uncertainty, and in the Company\u2019s view it settled plaintiff\u2019s claim by rejecting plaintiff\u2019s demand of October 29,1965 in the next month after insured\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-15\">Under Sec. D1 of each policy, the \u201cowner\u201d could by written notice, <em>before or after </em>insured\u2019s death, elect to have the proceeds paid according to any of several installment options instead of in a single sum. The beneficiary, \u201cno prior election having been made,\u201d could after insured\u2019s death elect any one of the installment options instead of a single sum payment. The September, 1945 agreement which \u2014 under stipulation in subsequently issued policies \u2014 covered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>six policies in issue, provided that \u201cwith consent of the Company\u201d plaintiff at any time <em>after </em>maturity could \u201cchange or revoke the method of settlement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">The district court rejected the contention that plaintiff, as owner of the policy, did not need the Company\u2019s consent to change her rights as beneficiary. The policies expressly provided that plaintiff was to have express ownership rights \u201cduring her lifetime,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and expressly provided that the insured was not owner and had no ownership rights. The 1945 agreement, however, reserved to plaintiff the right as owner to change the settlement option <em>before </em>maturity. This agreement also provided that plaintiff reserved the right <em>after </em>maturity to change or revoke the method of settlement \u201cwith * * * consent of the Company.\u201d This modified the owner\u2019s right \u201cbefore or after\u201d insured\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">It is our view that plaintiff\u2019s rights as beneficiary vested upon the insured\u2019s death. Her rights as owner at that time ceased. This is consistent with the 1945 settlement agreement provisions, which reserved <em>before </em>maturity her ownership rights in the policies, and <em>after </em>maturity limited her right to change or revoke the method of settlement by requiring consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">After an examination of the record before us, we hold there is no genuine issue of fact concerning the claim that the Company arbitrarily withheld its consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">The district court noted that the provisions of the policies making plaintiff the owner were prepared by the insured. The letterhead under which the ownership provisions were submitted shows that the insured, Mr. Dunbar, was an attorney and a member of the firm of Dunbar &amp; Dunbar \u201cSpecializing in Income and Inheritance Taxes, Wills and Trusts.\u201d It is apparent to us that the life insurance program was carried out at the direction of the insured. The September 22, 1945 agreement electing a monthly settlement option was signed by plaintiff. Presumably it was with her husband\u2019s acquiescence, in view of the fact that it was executed a few months after the policies became effective. This jointly-declared intention to provide plaintiff with a guaranteed income for life was done for her financial security. The agreement provided for continuous installments and expressly withheld from plaintiff the right to withdraw funds from the insurance proceeds retained as principal by the defendant. Violence would be done to this plan if the option could be changed merely because the beneficiary has so requested. Plaintiff has neither alleged nor brought forth any extraordinary facts to justify a change in the pattern of financial security designed by both her and her husband.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-12\">Finally, we see no merit in plaintiff\u2019s claim that the policy option for monthly installments elected prior to her husband\u2019s death violated Burns\u2019 Ind.Stat. Ann. Sec. 39-4207 (1965 Repl.), because \u201cat maturity\u201d the settlement could be of less value than the \u201camount insured\u201d in the policies. The affidavit of defendant\u2019s chief actuary shows that the value of the \u201cguaranteed\u201d monthly installments was the equivalent of the amounts insured, and this settlement option was approved by the State of Indiana Insurance Department. There was no genuine issue of fact about this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-13\">For the reasons given, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b707-16\">. Contingent beneficiaries, two daughters at the time of insured\u2019s death, under the agreement were to receive the balance due of the guaranteed payments should plaintiff not survive the twenty years,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b708-9\">. \u201cOWNERSHIP.
