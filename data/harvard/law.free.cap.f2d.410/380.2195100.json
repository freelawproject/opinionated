Kiekhaefer is the largest and dominant manufacturer and seller of inboard-outboard engines in the United States and controls at least 50 percent of the inboard-outboard engine market.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">Plaintiff filed an action in the court below charging that Brunswick\u2019s policy of conditioning the sale of its engines upon purchase of its instrumentation system constitutes a \u201ctie-in\u201d arrangement in violation of the federal antitrust laws which has resulted in irreparable injury to plaintiff\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">In justification of its policy, defendant, at a four-day hearing on plaintiff\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction, contended that its policy of selling its instrument panels with its engines as a \u201cpackage\u201d was based on the technological interdependence between the engines and the monitoring and control panels and instruments.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Although the District Court, 293 F.Supp. 106, found that plaintiff had made a showing of \u201cirreparable harm\u201d, it denied its motion for a preliminary injunction. It further found \u201cthe defendant has preliminarily established a legitimate basis for continuing its tie-in sales\u201d by its evidence of \u201ctechnological interdependence\u201d \u201cbetween the efficient operation of its engine, and the instruments which are required to monitor that operation\u201d and by its showing \u201cthat its instrument panel and ancillary harnessing equipment is of a higher quality than the plaintiff\u2019s\u201d, and \u201cthat primarily <em>its </em>good will (and customer satisfaction) would suffer as the result of a malfunctioning instrument which ultimately damages [its] MerCruiser engine.\u201d The District Court concluded that plaintiff had not shown \u201ca substantial probability (or likelihood) ythat it will ultimately prevail at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">In denying the preliminary injunction the District Court imposed upon the defendant these three conditions: (1) \u201cdefendant must take back for full credit or refund, all unused Kiekhaefer Mercury instrument panels,\u201d previously furnished to boat builders; (2) \u201cthe defendant is enjoined from foreclosing and otherwise preventing the plaintiff from participating in \u2018non critical\u2019 instrument and equipment sales to OEM [original equipment manufacturers] accounts\u201d, and, \u201cPending ultimate resolution of this action, the defendant is hereby required to supply its \u2018critical\u2019 instruments to the plaintiff * * * at a competitive price for inclusion in Teleflex customized instrument panels, if the plaintiff so desires\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe defendant is required forthwith to promulgate to the plaintiff and other instrument panel manufacturers, the minimum acceptable standards and specifications for all instruments and instrument panels, to permit qualification of plaintiff\u2019s products with appropriate certification by defendant\u2019s engineering department, \u2018 * * * as having design characteristics suitable for use on the [MerCruiser] stern-drive product\u2019 set forth in the MerCruiser Stern Drive Power Package Warranty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">On defendant\u2019s motion for a stay of the \u201cconditions\u201d pending its appeal from their imposition, the District Court stayed performance of the first condition but refused to stay the second and third conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">Plaintiff has appealed from the denial of its motion for a preliminary injunction. It contends that the District Court abused its discretion in denying its motion in the light of its proof at the hearing and applicable legal principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">Defendant has cross-appealed. It contends that the District Court \u201cin fact granted a preliminary injunction\u201d against it via the three imposed \u201cconditions\u201d and that it abused its discretion in doing so under the evidence. It further urges that the District Court failed to comply with the mandatory requirement of a bond imposed by Rule 65(c) F.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-12\">We are of the opinion that the interests of justice and judicial economy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>would be most effectively served by remand of the cause to the District Court with directions to proceed <em>forthwith </em>to final hearing and decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">Accordingly, the Order of the District Court denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction and imposing the foregoing recited \u201cconditions\u201d, will be vacated and the cause remanded with directions to proceed in accordance with this Opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
