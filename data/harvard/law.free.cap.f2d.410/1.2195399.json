Because of diversity of citizenship and the amount in controversy the defendants, Alfred Watland and Superwood Corporation, removed the case to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas. A jury trial resulted in a verdict for appellee of $36,-300. This appeal is from the ensuing judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">The issues litigated were: (1) whether defendant Watland was negligent; (2) whether Watland occupied the status of an employee or servant of Superwood when the negligent act occurred; (3) whether Superwood was guilty of negligence in the preparation of a drawing used in connection with the construction of a drainage ditch which caved in and caused appellee\u2019s injuries; (4) whether appellee was guilty of contributory negligence. The issues were resolved in ap-pellee\u2019s favor by special verdicts on appropriate interrogatories submitted to the jury in accordance with the provisions of Rule 49, Fed.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-13\">Watland, who denied negligence, concedes here that a case was made for the jury on that issue and he has abandoned his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-14\">Superwood has abandoned the question of appellee\u2019s contributory negligence. Its appeal is primarily centered in issues (2) and (3) stated above.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-15\">A resume of the uncontradicted facts will aid in placing issue (2) in proper perspective.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-16\">The parties stipulated that Little Rock Hardboard, Inc., an Arkansas corporation, was at all pertinent times the wholly owned subsidiary of Superwood Corporation of Duluth, Minnesota. Pursuant to negotiations initiated in January, 1966, the two corporations agreed to an expansion of Hardboard\u2019s plant in North Little Rock. There is evidence that Superwood had made the decision to expand.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It prepared the plans and specifications for the expansion project and charged the costs to Hardboard. Watland had been engaged in the supervision of construction for approximately 25 years and had worked 14 years for Superwood. This company directed Watland to supervise the construction of the expansion project for Hardboard. Watland went to Little Rock in February and was engaged in the supervision of the plant continuously from that time. His wages were paid by Super-wood, which was in turn reimbursed by Hardboard. Watland\u2019s hotel expenses were also paid by Hardboard.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-17\">During the spring of 1966, the general manager of Hardboard decided to reroute an effluent line through which effluent had been discharged upon private property. Based upon information revealed by an aerial photograph taken by Hardboard, Superwood prepared a drawing showing the depth, width and other relevant information in regard to the location of the ditch in which the new effluent line was placed. In August, Wat-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>land commenced supervision of the digging of the ditch. In doing so he followed the drawing prepared by Super-wood. On August 10, during the excavation, appellee, who was in the ditch, sustained serious injuries resulting from a cave-in or slide of the walls of the ditch. The slide occurred from improper shoring or bracing.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">Superwood timely challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to warrant submission of either theory of liability to the jury. It stoutly contends here that the evidence conclusively shows that Watland was not an agent or servant of Superwood in supervising the construction of the ditch. In amplifying its position, Superwood, relying on the loaned servant doctrine, recognizes that Wat-land was the general servant of Super-wood but had been loaned by it to Hardboard for the special purpose of supervising the construction of the plant expansion project; that during the period in question, and particularly when the ditch was being excavated, Watland was working under the sole direction and control of Hardboard and was not subject to the direction and control of his general master.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The loaned servant doctrine has been considered by the Supreme Court of Arkansas in Barton-Mansfield Co. v. Bogey, 201 Ark. 860, 147 S.W.2d 977 (1941); Taylor v. Arkansas Light &amp; Power Co., 173 Ark. 868, 293 S.W. 1007 (1927); Arkansas Logging Co. v. Martin, 116 Ark. 318, 173 S.W. 184 (1915); St. Louis, I. M. &amp; S. Ry. Co. v. Yates, 111 Ark. 486, 165 S.W. 282 (1914); Arkansas Natural Gas Co. v. Miller, 105 Ark. 477, 152 S.W. 147 (1912); and St. Louis, I. M. &amp; S. Ry. Co. v. Boyle, 83 Ark. 302, 103 S.W. 744, 12 L.R.A.,N.S., 317 (1907). These cases recognize the well established principle that the employer who retains direction and control over the employee is responsible for his negligent acts. And, as the court has stated, \u201cthe <em>right </em>to direct and control * * * is the important circumstance.\u201d St. Louis, I. M. &amp; S. Ry. Co. v. Boyle, 83 Ark. 302, 304, 103 S.W. 744, 745 (emphasis added.) \u201cThe master is the person in whose business he (the negligent employee) is engaged, at the time, and who has the right to control and direct his conduct.\u201d St. Louis, I. M. &amp; S. Ry. Co. v. Yates, 111 Ark. 486, 498, 165 S.W. 282, 285.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-12\"> As is true in many areas of the law, each case involving the loaned servant doctrine must be decided on its own facts. Ordinarily the question whether the general or special employer had the right of control and thus was the employee\u2019s master, presents an issue of fact for the jury. Arkansas Natural Gas Co. v. Miller, 105 Ark. 477, 483, 152 S.W. 147, 149-150 (1912) ; 35 Am.Jur. Master and Servant, \u00a7 541 (1941). <em>See </em>St. Louis, I. M. &amp; S. Ry. Co. v. Washington, 114 Ark. 184, 192-193, 169 S.W. 770, 773 (1914). But where all of the evidence is in one direction and there is no rational basis for reasonable minds to differ as to the status of the servant the issue is one of law for the court to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>solve. <em>See, </em>e. g., St. Louis, I. M. &amp; S. Ry. Co. v. Boyle, <em>supra, </em>and St. Louis, I. M. &amp; S. Ry. Co. v. Yates, <em>supra, </em>where the court exonerated the general employer from liability when the facts did not show he retained control over the employee. 35 Am.Jur. Master and Servant, \u00a7 541 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">Here, Judge Henley, having a firm grasp of the evidence, concluded that under the controlling law the issue of Su-perwood\u2019s liability presented a fact question. We have examined the evidence in the light most favorable to the appellee, as we are required to do, and find ourselves in agreement with the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Throughout the trial Superwood focused upon that aspect of the project concerning the relocation of the effluent line. This is clear from an extended colloquy between Judge Henley and Super-wood\u2019s able counsel relating to framing the interrogatories or special verdicts to be submitted to the jury. We do not say that counsel for Superwood expressly conceded Watland was under the direction of Superwood in supervising the enlargement of the Hardboard building, but we do say that this inference is implicit in counsel\u2019s unsuccessful attempt to have Superwood exonerated by the court. Counsel endeavored to convince the court that the relocation of the effluent line was not regarded by the parties as a part of the original project; that it was not included in the plans and specifications for the enlargement of the building; that the relocation was conceived after the building project was underway, and that Hardboard, and it alone, was responsible for this phase of the overall project. The difficulty with Superwood\u2019s position, sound in theory, is found in the evidence from which the jury could find, as it manifestly did, that the relocation was an integral part of the enlargement project. This is clear from Watland\u2019s testimony and may be inferred from the testimony of Pierce, the general manager of Hardboard.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, Superwood prepared the drawing for the location of the new effluent line, and Watland was supervising construction of the ditch in accordance with that drawing when the cave-in occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">Further discussion of the evidence is not necessary. Considering Superwood\u2019s interest in the new project, the fact that Watland was regarded as an expert in supervising construction, that he had acted in that capacity for Superwood on prior occasions, and that he was guided in his work by the plans, specifications, and the drawing, all prepared by Super-wood, we are satisfied that a jury case was made. This holding renders it unnecessary for us to discuss the alternative issue of liability, namely, whether Superwood was negligent in preparing the drawing for the construction of the ditch and that such negligence was the proximate cause of the eave-in and ap-pellee\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-11\">Superwood claims that it was prejudiced by the instruction which permitted the jury to consider the parent-subsidiary relationship between Superwood and Hardboard in resolving whether Wat-land was the servant of Superwood. The instruction informed the jury that it could consider, along with all the other evidence, the relationship between the two corporations. The court cautioned the jury that the mere fact that one corporation is a subsidiary of the other does not mean that the two are one entity, or that the employees of the one are employees of the other and that this is true even though the parent corporation is interested in the conduct of the affairs of the subsidiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-12\">Superwood condemns the instruction and suggests that it runs counter to Arkansas law against piercing the corporate veil. In our view this is an erroneous assumption. Piercing the corporate veil was not in the ease. Appellee made no attempt to hold Superwood for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>the tort of Hardboard in disregard of the separate entities of the two corporations. The case was tried and submitted on the theory that Watland was in fact Superwood\u2019s servant at the time the incident occurred which gave rise to the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">As shown above, the parties stipulated as to the relationship between the two corporations. This was in the case throughout the trial. Indeed, the bone of contention was whether Watland was Superwood\u2019s or Hardboard\u2019s employee in connection with the relocation of the effluent line. Since the relationship was a relevant factor the instruction was necessary in order to guide, direct and assist the jurors toward an intelligent understanding of the legal and factual issues in their search for the truth. <em>See, </em>Lind v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Surety Co., 374 F.2d 377, 380 (5th Cir. 1967); Marshall v. Isthmian Lines, Inc., 334 F.2d 131, 137 (5th Cir. 1964); Tyler v. Dowell, Inc., 274 F.2d 890, 897 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 363 U.S. 812, 80 S.Ct. 1248, 4 L.Ed.2d 1153 (1960); 2B Barron &amp; Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure, \u00a7 1105 at 470 (Wright ed. 1961; 9 Encyclopedia of Federal Procedure, \u00a7 31.88.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Additional assertions of error relate to the admission of evidence and the refusal of an instruction. These contentions need not be discussed since they relate only to the second issue of liability rendered moot by our holding on the first issue.</p>\n<p id=\"AE\">In summary, we are satisfied that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s finding that Watland was Superwood\u2019s servant. The case was tried free of prejudicial error. The judgment is affirmed,</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b64-10\">. Pierce, general manager of Hardboard, testified that Superwood had, \u201cin a sense, because of the corporation\u2019s structure,\u201d made the decision to expand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b65-6\">. The court\u2019s submission of the test to be applied by the jury is not challenged. The jury was fully instructed as to the standard to be applied. It was informed that the parties were in disagreement as to whether Watland was carrying out the construction of the ditch as an employee of Superwood or Hardboard; that the question for the jury to decide was whether in connection with the digging of the ditch Watland was an employee of Super-wood, acting in the course or scope of such employment, or an employee of Hardboard ; that the controlling test was whether Watland was subject to the direction and control of Superwood not only witb respect to the ultimate result to be achieved but also with respect to the details of the work, in which case he would be deemed an employee of Superwood, or whether he was doing the work of Hardboard, and was subject to its direction and control with respect to the result to be achieved and the details of the work, in which case he would be deemed an employee of Hardboard ;\u25a0 and that it was the right to direct and control Watland in the digging of the ditch that was determinative of the question of which employer was responsible for Watland\u2019s negligent act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b66-6\">. Watland testified that the digging of the ditch was \u201cconnected with\u201d the expansion of the building. Both he and Pierce testified that Pierce did not give him day-today supervision on the project.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b67-7\">. The record reveals that after the court submitted its proposed instruction to counsel, Mr. Barron, representing Super-wood, was opposed to the court making any reference to the relationship in the instruction. Judge Henley reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-8\">\u201cIt seems to me the fact it was a subsidiary cuts several ways. It indicates on the one hand a desire on the part of these corporate owners of both corporations to keep the two establishments separate. After all, this company need not have organized the Little Bock Hardboards at all. They could have chosen to do business here in its own name. It didn\u2019t. It set up a separate entity, which it owned, but which is separate. On the other hand, the question of whether \u2014 passing employees back and forth, preparing plans and giving directions, the question of whether they strictly observed this corporate entity, whether they in fact made Watland an employee of Hardboard, is to be resolved in the light of the fact that this is a subsidiary and these folks were doing what they were doing. I don\u2019t see how we can ignore it. I could not tell this jury not to think about it. I won\u2019t go along with you on that at all.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
