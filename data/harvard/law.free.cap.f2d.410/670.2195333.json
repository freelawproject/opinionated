We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-28\">Edmondson was president of American Southern Publishing Company, a corporation headquartered in Northport, Alabama. In an apparent effort to bolster the credit rating of his company, Ed-mondson allegedly had stationery printed bearing the letterhead of Georgia State Department of Education, Jack P. Nix, Superintendent of Schools, and fabricated two letters under that letterhead about which the alleged perjury centers. Both letters were addressed to Edmondson as President of American Southern Publishing Company. The first, dated August 10, 1966 (Exhibit No. 1), appears to be signed by Jack P. Nix, \u201cState Superintendent of Education.\u201d It purports to confirm a verbal agreement \u201cbetween <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>you and the Georgia State Board of Education Professional Textbook Adoption Committee\u201d for the purchase of 70,000 copies of a textbook, \u201cThis is Your Georgia,\u201d to be published by the Ed-mondson firm. The second letter, dated August 16, 1966 (Exhibit No. 2), six days after the first, purports to be signed by Hal W. Clements, \u201cDirector Division of Instructional Materials and Library Service,\u201d \u201cas an official notification of your company\u2019s textbooks which were adopted by the State Board of Education * * The list attached to that letter showed \u201c \u2018This is Your Georgia\u2019 by Mrs. Bernice McCullar\u201d at a net wholesale price f. o. b. Atlanta of $4.80. Facsimile copies of the two letters were included in the indictment as Exhibits 1 and 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">The indictment charged that Edmond-son having been duly sworn testified in the first meeting of creditors concerning said exhibits as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-6\">\u201cMR. FULFORD [Attorney for Receiver] : I ask you to Cross-Examine [sic] this letter, which is addressed to yod, August 10, in the letterhead Georgia State Board of Education, are you familiar with that, please, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-7\">\u201cA. Yes, Sir I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-8\">\u201cQ. Did you receive that letter in the mail please, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-9\">\u201cA. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-10\">\u201cQ. I will ask you also, to examine Receiver\u2019s Exhibit No. 2 and tell us if you received that letter also, in the mail?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-11\">\u201cA. Yes, sir, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-12\">* . * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-13\">\u201cQ. All right, sir, now Mr. Edmond-son, I want to ask you please sir, if you don\u2019t know as a fact, that you had stationery printed in the Plant down there by Claude Dean, to print up a letterhead for the Georgia State Department of Education and you had that written in your office from a typewriter yourself, and that there was never such a letter in existence, from the State of Georgia, or this one either Receiver\u2019s Exhibit No. 2?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-15\">\u201cA. I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-16\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-17\">\u201cQ. You tell us that you never instructed anyone, you never yourself signed that letter or instructed anyone to sign it. I want to be sure that you understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-18\">\u201cA. I understand, and I answered that question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-19\">\u201cQ. Do you say that you had nothing to do with the fabrication of Receiver\u2019s Exhibit 1, and Receiver\u2019s Exhibit 2?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-20\">\u201cA. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-21\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-22\">\u201cQ. A series of questions were put to you by Mr. Fulford, and I will try my best to avoid duplicating them, or creating any interence [sic], maybe our motives may be different.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-23\">Exhibit No. 1,1 want you to hold it again. Was that letter prepared by you or by anyone in your presence at your direction, or whether in you [sic], with your direction, with your knowledge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-24\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-25\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-26\">\u201cSaid defendant, then and there well knew that the foregoing answers were false and contrary to his oath to testify truthfully in said proceedings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-27\">Edmondson moved to quash and dismiss the indictment because it did not charge that any of his answers were material to the matter under inquiry or investigation, and the court overruled that motion. For any of Edmondson\u2019s answers to constitute perjury, it is, of course, essential that the answer be material to the inquiry. That much appears from the very definition of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>crime,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and is inherent in the federal concept of perjury. As said by the elder Justice Harlan speaking for the Court in Markham v. United States, 1895, 160 U.S. 319, 325, 16 S.Ct. 288, 40 L.Ed. 441:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-4\">\u201cIn 2 Chitty\u2019s Criminal Law, 307, the author says: \u2018It is undoubtedly necessary that it should appear on the face of the indictment that the false allegations were material to the matter in issue. But it is not requisite to set forth all the circumstances which render them material; the simple averment that they were so, will suffice.\u2019 In King v. Dowlin, above cited [5 T.R. 311], Lord Kenyon said that it had always been adjudged to be sufficient in an indictment for perjury, to allege generally that the particular question became a material question. So, in Commonwealth v. Pollard, 12 Met. 225, 229, which was a prosecution for perjury, it was said that it must be alleged in the indictment that the matter sworn to was material, or the facts set forth as falsely and corruptly sworn to should be sufficient in themselves to show such materiality.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9-\">13] In the present case the indictment did not expressly allege that the matter sworn to was material. So the question is whether \u201cthe facts set forth as falsely and corruptly sworn to should be sufficient in themselves to show such materiality.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">Edmondson\u2019s testimony was taken at the first meeting of creditors in the bankruptcy proceeding in the matter of American Southern Publishing Company on November 14, 1966. As of that date the proceeding was a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> One of the purposes of the first meeting of creditors was to determine facts relevant to \u201cthe purposes of an arrangement providing for an extension of time for payment of debts in full.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 707. The existence of a verbal agreement confirmed by letter for the production of 70,000 books at a fixed price was material to that inquiry, and the district court properly so held as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-12\">Edmondson moved for a judgment of acquittal when the Government rested. His motion was overruled. He offered no other evidence. It is not disputed that Edmondson\u2019s testimony as alleged in the indictment was given under oath. The district court properly held that it was material. The other two essential elements of proof of perjury are: (1) that Edmondson\u2019s statements or some of them<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> were in fact false; and (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>that Edmondson when he made the statements did not believe them to be true.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">The objective falsity of the statements made must be proved in conformity with the \u201ctwo witness rule\u201d peculiar to perjury cases. As Circuit Judge Washington has said for the D. C. Circuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-5\">\u201cThis rule is misnamed. It does not require the testimony of two witnesses. Properly stated it is that \u2018the uncorroborated oath of one witness is not enough to establish, for purposes of conviction of perjury, the falsity of sworn testimony.\u2019 Maragon v. United States, 1950, 87 U.S.App.D.C. 349, 350, 187 F.2d 79, 80, certiorari denied, 1951, 341 U.S. 932, 71 S.Ct. 804, 95 L.Ed. 1361. See Hammer v. United States, 1926, 271 U.S. 620, 46 S.Ct. 603, 70 L.Ed. 1118; Weiler v. United States, 1945, 323 U.S. 606, 65 S.Ct. 548, 89 L.Ed. 495.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Young v. United States, 1954, 94 U.S.App.D.C. 54, 212 F.2d 236, 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">Dr. Nix, the Georgia State Superintendent of Schools, whose purported signature was affixed to the letter dated August 10, 1966, Exhibit 1, testified, without dispute, that it was not his signature and that he did not authorize any other person to affix his signature, nor authorize or direct the preparation of the letter. Harold W. Clements, formerly with the Georgia Department of Education, whose signature purports to be affixed to the letter dated August 16, 1966, Exhibit 2, gave like unequivocal testimony as to that letter. Clark Dean, a former employee of The American Southern Publishing Company, testified that at Edmondson\u2019s direction he prepared the letterheads on which the two letters were typed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There was an abundance of other corroborative evidence. The record fairly shrieks of Edmondson\u2019s guilt of perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-14\">Edmondson\u2019s extremely competent and experienced counsel was asked outside the presence and hearing of the jury whether he had any objection to the court\u2019s oral charge, and he responded, \u201cNo exceptions, your Honor.\u201d The able district judge gave general instructions on types of evidence, followed by a specific instruction on the essential evidentiary requirements to authorize a conviction for perjury.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The portions of the charge regarding the weight given circumstantial evidence and the peculiar requirements as to evidence in a perjury ease were widely separated and could not have confused the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-15\">We find no error in the record, and the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b736-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b733-29\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b735-5\">. \u201cWhoever, having taken an oath before a competent tribunal, officer, or person, in any case in which a law of the United States authorizes an oath to be administered, that he will testify, declare, depose, or certify truly, or that any written testimony, declaration, deposition, or certificate by him subscribed, is true, willfully and contrary to such oath states or subscribes <em>any material matter </em>which he does not believe to be true, is guilty of perjury, and shall, except as otherwise expressly provided by law, be fined not more than $2,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.

In federal courts the issue of materiality of the alleged perjury is for the court and not the jury. Sinclair v. United States, 1929, 279 U.S. 263, 298, 299, 49 S.Ct. 268, 73 L.Ed. 692; Black-mon v.
