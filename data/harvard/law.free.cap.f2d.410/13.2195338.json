Those raising the most serious questions are (i) the suppression by the prosecution of the name and story of Dagmar Finch Generazio; (ii) the admission into evidence, without a hearing, of a chair allegedly obtained by means of an illegal search and seizure; and (iii) the use of a Blue Ribbon Jury at appellant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-23\">After an extensive hearing<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by the trial court (Culkin, J.), the motion was denied. The Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court (24 App.Div.2d 32, 263 N.Y.S.2d 629 (1st Dept.1965)) unanimously affirmed both the judgment of conviction and the denial of the appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial and that decision in turn was affirmed by the Court of Appeals (Fuld, J., dissenting), 18 N.Y.2d 162, 272 N.Y.S.2d 753, 219 N.E.2d 274 (1966). The appeal to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>United States Supreme Court was dismissed for want of jurisdiction (Douglas, J., dissenting) and the petition for a writ of certiorari denied. Then followed Fein\u2019s application for a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, which was denied by Judge Palmieri (United States of America ex rel. Fein v. Deegan, 859 F.Supp. 298). In effect, we are reviewing a State court record which has been reviewed by 12 State court judges and affirmed by 11 of them.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The story is a sordid one, resulting on October 10, 1963 in the murder of Rubin Markowitz, a one-time grocery clerk and bookmaker. Markowitz was last heard from by a client at 4 P.M. that same day and his death occurred after that hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Fein owed Markowitz $7,000, which he had lost betting against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1963 World Series. He made an appointment with Markowitz to pay the $7,000 and at the same time he made arrangements with a friend to pay Markowitz approximately $16,690 owed to Markowitz by that friend and another. For this purpose Fein was given $4,690 in cash and a $12,000 promissory note payable to Fein. The killing permitted Fein not only to write off his own debt but ultimately to pocket the $16,690 furnished by the friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">The State\u2019s chief witness against Fein was Gloria Kendal, an admitted prostitute and the some time mistress of Fein. She testified that Fein telephoned her to come to his apartment (which he leased in the name of \u201cWeissman\u201d for his extramarital activities) between 5:30 and 5:45 P.M. on October 10, 1963. Before responding to this distress signal, Gloria left a message with another prostitute who remained in her apartment, one Sandra Ede. This message was addressed to Geraldine Boxer (Geri), whose custom was to meet daily with Gloria for light supper before each attended their respective evening classes. Gloria then taxied the ten blocks to Fein\u2019s secret lodging. When she arrived before 6 P.M. at Fein\u2019s apartment \u201cHe was very flushed. His hair was messed, and his eyes were enormous.\u201d Fein then told her that he had shot his bookmaker Ruby and asked her to assist him in disposing of the body which he had stuffed into a steamer trunk. Gloria testified that she \u201csaw part of an arm, and some new clothes line, and some white material that looked like a shirt.\u201d Responding to his request, Gloria called one David Broudy, an unemployed taxi cab driver (who did not know Fein), who immediately proceeded by car to the \u201cWeiss-man\u201d apartment. In the meantime Geri drove to Gloria\u2019s apartment and was directed by Sandra Ede over the intercom to proceed to the \u201cWeissman\u201d apartment pursuant to Gloria\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">Both Broudy and Geri eventually arrived at the \u201cWeissman\u201d apartment. In answer to a question by Broudy, Fein stated that while he was paying his bookmaker \u201csomebody burst in * * * shot this man and scooped up the money and left.\u201d He also told Broudy that he had lined the bottom of the trunk with \u201csome canvas bags\u201d to prevent blood leakage. Since the trunk would not fit into either Broudy\u2019s car or Geri\u2019s car, Fein arranged for the rental of a station wagon. After he and Gloria picked up the vehicle, Fein and Broudy loaded the trunk into it and Fein gave the keys to Broudy and departed for a dinner date with his wife and friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">Thereafter the two women and Broudy drove the station wagon to Gloria\u2019s apartment and double parked while Gloria entered the apartment, had a drink with Sandra Ede and obtained some money to pay Broudy for his trouble. Half an hour later she returned to the car where Broudy and Geri were waiting. Thereafter the three disposed of the trunk in the Harlem River. During the weeks that followed Gloria <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>and Broudy, in answer to Fein\u2019s plea for help, attempted to obliterate all evidence that might have associated Fein or the crime with the \u201cWeissman\u201d apartment by filling and painting holes in the floor and wall, destroying the carpet and removing furniture and furnishings.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">\n<em>The Alleged Suppression of the Testimony of Dagmar Finch Generazio</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">One of the chief grounds for Fein\u2019s application for <em>habeas corpus </em>was the alleged suppression of the testimony of one Dagmar Finch Generazio (Dagmar), a prostitute associate of Gloria, which Fein claims to be exculpatory. There are two phases of Dagmar\u2019s testimony, the first relates to an alleged phone call from Gloria to Dagmar and the story Dagmar told the prosecutor pertaining to that call, and the second relates to Gloria\u2019s second recantation on September 28, 1964, three weeks before the trial. Dagmar\u2019s post-trial testimony was to the effect that Gloria had telephoned her on the day of the murder<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> before 4 P.M. at Gail Weiner Tracy\u2019s apartment on 64th Street, where she was living at the time. In this conversation Gloria tried to induce Dagmar to assist her in finding a car to move a heavy box but was unsuccessful. The defense claims that the testimony of this telephone call before 4 P.M. would have been not only damaging to Gloria\u2019s credibility but might have suggested that Gloria, rather than Fein, was responsible for the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Dagmar\u2019s estranged husband corroborated his wife\u2019s account to the police by testifying at the hearing that his wife had said to the detectives that the call was \u201cin the afternoon of October, this particular time * * * She did say it was in the afternoon.\u201d Gail Tracy testified that the phone call was made shortly after 3 P.M. But prior to this testimony at the hearing Gail testified that she had called Dagmar a liar when Dagmar stated that such a phone call had been made because, according to Gail, Dagmar had not been in Gail\u2019s house for six or seven months. She also admitted that, except on one post-trial occasion, she had flatly denied the occurrence of any such call and did so on one occasion in Dagmar\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">Both Assistant District Attorney Vincent Dermody and Detective Leman testified that Dagmar had never said that the telephone call was made earlier than between 6 and 7 o\u2019clock. At one time she told Detective Leman that \u201cmaybe it was eight o\u2019clock or nine o\u2019clock.\u201d In an effort to fix the time more precisely she said \u201cAll I know is that it was dark out, and when I entered the building the dry cleaning man was getting ready to close his store.\u201d On a second visit to the District Attorney\u2019s office, Dagmar related in front of Gail Tracy the story of receiving a phone call at her house some time after or between 6 and 7 P.M. Gail Tracy called Dagmar a liar stating that Dagmar never received a call on Gail\u2019s telephone at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">In his decision on the post-trial motion, the state trial judge rejected Dag-mar\u2019s testimony as well as that of her husband and of Gail Tracy as being unworthy of belief, and denied the motion for a new trial. As to Dagmar, the judge specifically found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-12\">\u201cHaving seen and heard this witness, I reject her testimony as totally unworthy of belief. While under oath at the hearing, she strained with tireless effort to avoid telling the truth, whether the examination covered her recorded criminal past, the date of her marriage, the frequency which the police telephoned her, or the reaction of Gail Weiner Tracy, a witness called by the prosecution after she submitted a sworn question and answer on behalf of the defendant, upon a certain confrontation. The foregoing are all measurable standards, but of no greater import than the impression <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>this witness created when set against less tangible marks. I find that she never told the prosecution of receiving a call <em>on any afternoon. </em>I further find that insofar as this witness\u2019 credibility is concerned, her story that she received any call from Mrs. Lazarus on the day, or month, of the killing does not warrant belief.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The state judge, after hearing all the witnesses, thus found that Dagmar never told the prosecutor of a call received between 3 and 4 P.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">In United States v. Johnson, 327 U.S. 106, 66 S.Ct. 464, 90 L.Ed. 562 (1946), the Supreme Court held that it was not the province of a federal court of appeals in reviewing orders granting or denying motions for a new trial, to intervene on the ground of erroneous findings of fact unless it clearly appears that such findings are unsupported by any evidence. As the court observed (p. 113, 66 S.Ct. p. 467):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-7\">\u201cWhile a defendant should be afforded the full benefit of this type of rectifying motion, courts should be on the alert to see that the privilege of its use is not abused. One of the most effective methods of preventing this abuse is for appellate courts to refrain from reviewing findings of fact which have evidence to support them. The Circuit Court of Appeals was right in the first instance, when it declared that it did not sit to try de novo motions for a new trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">Where the State Court has made a full and fair evidentiary hearing with express findings of fact, the district court may \u201cand ordinarily should, accept the facts as found in the hearing\u201d (Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 318, 83 S.Ct. 745, 760, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963); see, Midgett v. Warden, Maryland State Penitentiary, 329 F.2d 185 (4th Cir.1964); Durham v. Haynes, 258 F.Supp. 452 (E.D.Mo., N.D.1966), aff\u2019d, 368 F.2d 989 (8th Cir. 1966), <em>cert. denied, </em>390 U.S. 959, 88 S.Ct. 1054, 19 L.Ed.2d 1154 (1968)). This principle was codified in 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254(d), which provides that the determination of fact of the State court in a <em>habeas corpus </em>proceeding, subject to certain other provisos not here present, \u201cshall be presumed to be correct,\u201d unless the \u201cfactual determination is not fairly supported by the record.\u201d Since we do not believe that it can be said that the findings of the State court are not fairly supported by the record and since that hearing was full and fair, we must, therefore, accept at least the finding that Dagmar \u201cnever told the prosecution of receiving a call on any afternoon.\u201d The State also argues with force that since the State judge also found incredible Dagmar\u2019s story that she received <em>any </em>call from Gloria on the day of the killing, that should end this phase of the appeal. However, Fein points out that the prosecutor conceded that Dagmar made a statement to him of a 6 to 7 P.M. telephone call, which is not in the \u201cafternoon.\u201d While this is not a concession that Dagmar actually did receive a call, it does bear on the prosecutor\u2019s state of mind and his alleged \u201cunfairness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">We turn then to the assumption that Dagmar did tell the prosecutor of a 6 to 7 P.M. telephone call. It is argued that such information was vitally material to the defense because from such a call the jury could draw an inference damaging to Gloria. The prosecution witnesses testified that when Broudy, Geri and Gloria drove the station wagon containing the trunk from the \u201cWeiss-man\u201d apartment, they stopped at Gloria\u2019s apartment between 6 and 7 P.M. Fein suggests that had the prosecutor disclosed that he had evidence indicating that Gloria had, at the time she went upstairs to her own apartment, telephoned Dagmar in an attempt to borrow a car to remove a box, the jury might have inferred that the decedent\u2019s body was not in the trunk at all but was elsewhere awaiting removal; thus the entire substance of Gloria\u2019s story that it was at Fein\u2019s request that she had become involved in disposing of the body <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>of the man murdered in the \u201cWeissman\u201d apartment was false. A major difficulty with this theory is that there is no evidence from any witness that Marko-witz\u2019s body was anywhere except in the station wagon trunk at the time. Broudy testified that Fein said that the body was in the trunk, Gloria testified that she had seen the body in the trunk, and Broudy and Gloria testified that they helped Fein to remove the damaging evidence from the \u201cWeissman\u201d apartment. Moreover, it was reasonable for the prosecution to conclude that there was no major inconsistency between Gloria\u2019s account and Dagmar\u2019s statement that Gloria made a phone call to Dagmar between <em>6 </em>and 7 P.M., because the call could have been made by Gloria from the \u201cWeissman\u201d apartment (rather than from Gloria\u2019s apartment) at the same time Gloria called Broudy (which was around 6 P.M.) in her effort to get a car to remove the trunk. From the record it appears that the prosecutor had reason to feel unsure as to whether Dagmar was telling the truth. Dagmar had mentioned that she received a call from Gloria while at Gail Tracy\u2019s apartment, but Mrs. Tracy had denied this to the prosecution before the trial. It is true that Dagmar\u2019s statement might have been used to attack Gloria\u2019s credibility but, as indicated below, defense counsel was adequately armed at trial and attacked her credibility thoroughly. Under all the circumstances, even giving credence to Dagmar\u2019s statement that she had informed the prosecution about a phone call between 6 and 7 P.M. does not vest it with the materiality essential to a finding of prosecutorial suppression.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">The second phase of Dagmar\u2019s potential testimony, allegedly suppressed, involved Gloria\u2019s second recantation on September 28th. Dagmar testified that Gloria had twice asked her to \u201cstick with me.\u201d Finally there was a confrontation between Dagmar and Gloria at the District Attorney\u2019s office when Dagmar related the story that Gloria had called Dagmar at Gail\u2019s apartment between 6 and 7 P.M. Gloria denied the call and began screaming and yelling that Detective Leman was trying to induce people to lie about her. Detective Leman escorted Dagmar from the room and Gloria demanded to see her lawyer. After Dag-mar and Leman left, Gloria recanted her story for the second time, only to return to the original story given at the trial. The prosecutor advised defense counsel of both recantations but not of the confrontation with Dagmar prior to the recantation. In their testimony neither Gloria nor Detective Leman mentioned Dagmar\u2019s presence at the meeting prior to the recantation. Based upon these, circumstances, the defense has accused the prosecution of countenancing false testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Gloria and Detective Leman had conflicting explanations at the trial of the case as to the cause of the second recantation. In each case their testimony was predicated upon their respective opinions as to the cause. It cannot be said whether either was right or wrong. In all events, Dagmar was not present at the time of the recantation although she was present at the meeting. The questions posed by the defense itself were ambiguous. The Appellate Division held that who was present at the interview was not emphasized and the question did not clearly indicate that presence at the interview rather than presence at the time of recantation, was the information sought. The Court of Appeals held that the record amply sustained the lower court\u2019s finding that the testimony was not in fact false or perjurious. We are compelled to agree. The record discloses that materiality of Dagmar\u2019s confrontation under the circumstances is highly speculative and fails to reveal any evidence of its suppression.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Dagmar\u2019s testimony did not bear directly upon the guilt or punishment of Fein. At most, it pertained to Gloria\u2019s credibility, provided one could bridge the gap of Dagmar\u2019s incredibility. Gloria\u2019s credibility, however, had been relentlessly attacked by an exhausting and punishing cross-examination in which her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>recantations and background were thoroughly explored. Even the prosecutor in his summation described her, among other things, as \u201cnotorious,\u201d \u201ca moral leper,\u201d and \u201can old whore.\u201d Nevertheless, the jury believed enough of Gloria\u2019s testimony, as corroborated by Broudy and Geri, to convict Fein.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">Fein claims that he made a request to the prosecutor for Dagmar\u2019s whereabouts, which poses the question of prosecutorial suppression. It is admitted that during the course of the trial the defense was aware that Dagmar had told the prosecutor that she had received a phone call from Gloria on the murder day in an attempt to borrow a car. In fact, the defense counsel knew about Dagmar, as appears from his cross-examination of Geri Boxer, when he inquired as to Geri\u2019s acquaintanceship with Dagmar. In a hallway conversation during the trial, William J. Whelan, defendant\u2019s investigator and a former policeman, informed Detective Leman that the defendant knew of the phone call and asked whether the prosecutor was going to place Dagmar on the stand, to which Detective Leman replied that he did not know. When Detective Leman asked Whelan if the latter had called Dagmar\u2019s mother in Baltimore, Whelan requested the mother\u2019s phone number, to which Detective Leman replied \u201cI am not at liberty to give it to you.\u201d Whelan stated that he \u201cdid not expect that he would give it to me.\u201d In other words, Whelan as a former policeman knew that the request was not made to the proper source and that a detective ordinarily is not at liberty to furnish information to the defense without the authority of the prosecutor. Yet the defense neither pursued the matter nor made an application to the court for Dagmar\u2019s whereabouts. Mr. Blinder, one of the defendant\u2019s counsel, stated at the post-trial hearing that he did not pursue the matter because he believed that if Dagmar were important to the defendant\u2019s case, the prosecutor would inform him of that relevance.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The Court of Appeals found that there was not only no request for Dag-mar\u2019s full name, address or telephone number but also no indication that the defense could not locate her. If the request was to flag the importance of the evidence for the defense and accordingly impose upon the prosecutor a duty to make a careful check of his files, it was not too much to require that such request be made to someone in authority rather than to a police detective whom the defendant\u2019s own investigator did not believe would supply the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">In United States v. Keogh, 391 F.2d 138 (2d Cir.1968), Judge Friendly classified the law as to prosecutorial suppression of evidence into three categories: (1) deliberate bad faith suppression for the very purpose of obstructing the defense, or the intentional failure to disclose evidence whose high probative value to the defense could not have escaped the prosecutor\u2019s attention; (2) deliberate refusal to honor a request for evidence where the evidence is material to guilt or punishment, irrespective of the prosecutor\u2019s good faith or bad faith in refusing the request; and (3) where suppression was not deliberate and no request for evidence was made, but where hindsight discloses that it was so material that the defense could have put the evidence to not insignificant use (pp. 146-148). The best that can be said for appellant\u2019s point is that the action of the prosecutor in this case arguably fell within the second category of a deliberate refusal to honor a request for evidence that is material to guilt or punishment. But in our view, it would be unfair and inequitable to charge the prosecutor with the responsibility for any oral request which was made by an employee of the defendant, such as an investigator, to an employee of the prosecutor, such as a detective. Aside from that failure, we find it hard to evaluate Dagmar\u2019s testimony as material. The third category set forth in <em>Keogh </em>refers to an unintentional suppression of evidence without a request where the evidence was so material that \u201cthe defense could have put the evidence to not insignificant use.\u201d But in those cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>\u201cthe standard of materiality must be considerably higher.\u201d As Judge Friendly remarked (p. 148): \u201cTo invalidate convictions in such eases because a combing of the prosecutors\u2019 files after the trial has disclosed evidence possibly useful to the defense but not likely to have changed the verdict would create unbearable burdens and uncertainties.\u201d Dagmar\u2019s testimony was peripheral in nature and only obliquely affected Gloria\u2019s credibility. To say the least, it is doubtful whether such evidence satisfied the standard of materiality required by the second category. Certainly it did not satisfy the standard of materiality in the third category. It seems to us that no stretching can force the testimony of Dagmar into the factual pattern of prosecutorial suppression of material evidence, condemned in Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963); Giles v. Maryland, 386 U.S. 66, 87 S.Ct. 793, 17 L.Ed.2d 737 (1967); Barbee v. Warden, Maryland Penitentiary, 331 F.2d 842 (4th Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">It is appropriate to note that upon an application for a new trial based upon newly discovered evidence, due diligence is an essential factor. See, New York Code of Criminal Procedure, \u00a7 465(7) and eases cited thereunder; see also, United States v. Costello, 255 F.2d 876 (2d Cir.1958), <em>cert. denied, </em>357 U.S. 937, 78 S.Ct. 1385, 2 L.Ed.2d 1551 (1958), <em>reh. denied, </em>358 U.S. 858, 79 S.Ct. 16, 3 L.Ed.2d 93 (1958); Kyle v. United States, 297 F.2d 507 (2d Cir. 1961), <em>cert. denied, </em>377 U.S. 909, 84 S.Ct. 1170, 12 L.Ed.2d 179 (1964); United States v. Capece, 287 F.2d 537 (2d Cir.1961), <em>cert. denied, </em>368 U.S. 847, 82 S.Ct. 78, 7 L.Ed.2d 45 (1961); United States v. Lombardozzi, 343 F.2d 127 (2d Cir.1965), <em>cert. denied, </em>381 U.S. 938, 85 S.Ct. 1771, 14 L.Ed.2d 702 (1965). And such application will not be granted if the evidence is merely impeaching. People v. Eng Hing, 212 N.Y. 373, 386, 106 N.E. 96 (1914); Mesarosh v. United States, 352 U.S. 1, 77 S.Ct. 1, 1 L.Ed.2d 1 (1956); United States v. Aguillar, 387 F.2d 625 (2d Cir.1967). To relieve the defendant of his duty of due diligence, the evidence of prosecutorial suppression should be clear and unequivocal. A half-hearted and casual inquiry made by one subordinate to another subordinate should not shift the responsibility to the prosecutor. The prosecutor made many disclosures to the defense and there is nothing in the record which suggests that his conduct, as well as that of his staff, under difficult circumstances did not amply satisfy the fundamental concepts of due process necessary in order to provide the defendant with a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">\n<em>The Admission into Evidence of the Chair</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">The second relevant ground for Fein\u2019s complaint is the admission into evidence of a chair containing a speck of blood, allegedly seized in violation of. the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. When the prosecutor offered the chair for identification, the defense counsel objected at the bench in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\">\u201cIf this furniture purports to be furniture that was in the apartment, Apartment 5-B, which is the apartment in question over here; and if that apartment was entered into without a search warrant; or in the alternative, since we have already heard some furniture had been stored in some furniture storage warehouse, if this furniture had been secured from this furniture storage warehouse without the proper legal warrant or proper legal authorization, I object to it; and I shall move to suppress this evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">The chair was marked for identification upon the condition that the defense was not deemed to have waived its right to question the legality of the evidence on a motion to suppress later. Eight days later, during direct examination, Gloria testified that Fein had requested her to remove all the furniture, including the chair, from the 63rd Street apartment, saying: \u201cGet rid of all the furniture in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>the apartment now, and get rid of the rug; get rid of everything.\u201d Gloria placed the chair in a storage warehouse under a pseudonym. The chair was received in evidence over the general objection by the defense, counsel reminding the court of a discussion about the chair at the bench a few weeks prior thereto. The trial court stated: \u201cYes, I am familiar with that; but under the testimony here, the objection is overruled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">At the post-trial hearing the State court stated that there was no evidence to support the counsel\u2019s conjecture that the chair was illegally seized. It added that after the witnesses for the prosecution testified, the defense did not seek a <em>voir dire </em>upon the ground of illegal search and seizure and it accordingly found that the chair had been abandoned by the defendant. The Appellate Division stated that the speck of blood on the chair was so small that it could not be typed and that the chair could be disregarded as proof that the homicide took place in the apartment. The Court of Appeals found that the defendant abandoned his interest and retained no rights in the chair which could be breached by an illegal seizure. The District Court found that the police had procured the chair stored in a warehouse in the name of \u201cWeissman\u201d without a search warrant, but that Fein had given Gloria authority to dispose of the chair and had abandoned it just as if he had thrown it in a public wastepaper basket.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Defendant claims that he was deprived of his fundamental constitutional rights under the authority of Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964), because he was denied a hearing under the New York Code of Criminal Procedure \u00a7 813-c in the absence of the jury upon the issue of abandonment. The particular facts in this case do not pose the attack upon the rights of the accused presented in Jackson v. Denno, <em>supra. </em>Assuming that Fein had properly preserved his right under \u00a7 813-c of the New York Code of Criminal Procedure, the court was justified in proceeding without such a hearing. Defense counsel\u2019s objection was based upon an \u201cif\u201d but that \u201cif\u201d was rendered meaningless by Gloria\u2019s subsequent testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">While the right to a suppression hearing is not a technical device or a narrow procedural requirement, nevertheless it is a right that must be asserted upon unambiguous grounds. Although the chair was taken by a warrantless search from the warehouse, counsel for Fein knew, after eight days of testimony, that if Fein had any right to a separate suppression hearing, it would have to be asserted upon the ground that Fein had a property interest in the chair. Counsel was an experienced and skillful defense attorney and he knew how to focus attention upon his client\u2019s rights. Instead of making a claim of property interest in the chair to the court (which he could have asserted outside of the hearing of the jury), he was content to rely upon his earlier objection of an illegal search and seizure predicated upon the hypothesis that the chair was in the \u201cWeissman\u201d apartment at the time of the search which he knew at the time of the second objection was not the fact. It was then his duty to come forward with an assertion of some specifics to show that he had a standing to demand a \u00a7 813-c hearing. This he did not do. Under such circumstances, he cannot wait until after the trial and then claim that he was deprived of his rights. Cohen v. United States, 378 F.2d 751 (9th Cir. 1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>389 U.S. 897, 88 S.Ct. 217, 19 L.Ed.2d 215 (1967); United States v. Phillips, 375 F.2d 75 (7th Cir. 1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>389 U.S. 834, 88 S.Ct. 40, 19 L.Ed.2d 95 (1967); People v. Solimine, 18 N.Y.2d 477, 276 N.Y.S.2d 882, 223 N.E.2d 341 (1966); People v.

Fein will not be heard to claim prejudice from the use of evidence arising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>from a search and seizure in violation of the constitutional right of either Gloria or the warehouseman. Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257, 80 S.Ct. 725, 4 L.Ed.2d 697 (1960); Abel v. United States, 362 U.S. 217, 80 S.Ct. 683, 4 L.Ed.2d 668 (1960), <em>reh. denied, </em>362 U.S. 984, 80 S.Ct. 1056, 4 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1960); Hester v. United States, 265 U.S. 57, 44 S.Ct. 445, 68 L.Ed. 898 (1924) ; United States v. Masterson, 383 F.2d 610 (2d Cir.1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>390 U.S. 954, 88 S.Ct. 1048, 19 L.Ed.2d 1147 (1968), <em>reh. denied, </em>391 U.S. 909, 88 S.Ct. 1650, 20 L.Ed.2d 425 (1968). One is compelled to infer that Fein\u2019s counsel failed to properly move at the trial not only because the evidence indicated that the chair had been abandoned and the result of his application would have been fruitless, but also because Gloria\u2019s damaging testimony with respect to the chair was at all events admissible, even though the chair might have been inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">\n<em>The Challenges to the Blue Ribbon Jury</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ad\">The final serious question presented by this appeal involves a double-barreled attack on the special jury convened by the trial court under the New York blue ribbon jury statute, former New York Judiciary Law \u00a7 749-aa, repealed, 1965 New York Laws ch. 778, \u00a7 3. First Fein urges that New York\u2019s blue ribbon jury statute was unconstitutional because it resulted in a significant overrepresentation of persons from higher income groups with a corresponding underrepresentation of those from lower income groups. The argument that Fein was thus convicted by an unrepresentative jury presents difficult issues. The analogy is drawn to Whitus v. Georgia, 385 U.S. 545, 87 S.Ct. 643, 17 L.Ed.2d 599 (1967), and Jones v. Georgia, 389 U.S. 24, 88 S.Ct. 4, 19 L.Ed.2d 25 (1967), where a demonstration that members of a racial group were significantly underrepresented on grand and petit juries was enough to make out a prima facie case of intentional discrimination and a denial of due process and of the equal protection of the laws. Those cases may be distinguishable but, in any event, it is more significant that what we are in effect being asked to do here is to overrule the decisions of the Supreme Court, sustaining by 5-4 vote the blue ribbon jury against constitutional attack, in Moore v. New York, 333 U.S. 565, 68 S.Ct. 705, 92 L.Ed. 881 (1948), and Fay v. New York, 332 U.S. 261, 67 S.Ct. 1613, 91 L. Ed. 2043 (1947), although that Court has not done so yet,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and even though the New York blue ribbon jury statute is no longer in effect. It is urged that those decisions would have been different had the Court then considered that the Sixth Amendment applied to the State; however, we believe that we are bound by these decisions until such time as the Court informs us that we are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">In his reply brief, Fein for the first time also argues that the blue ribbon jury statute was unconstitutional on its face because its object was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-8\">\u201c* * * to effect the exclusion * * * of all those individuals who had conscientious scruples against capital punishment. * * * Thus this statute assured the state of a jury whose members were partial to the prosecutor on the issue of guilt or innocence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">This argument in Fein\u2019s reply brief came after (and no doubt in light of) the grant of certiorari by the Supreme Court in Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510, 88 S.Ct. 1770, 20 L.Ed.2d 776 (1968). In that case the Court held unconstitutional the imposition of the death penalty in cases where persons with scruples against capital punishment were excluded from jury service, a holding explicitly limited to death penalty cases and then only to sentence rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>than conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 522-523, 88 S.Ct. 1770 n. 21; see Bumper v. North Carolina, 391 U.S. 543, 545, 88 S.Ct. 1788, 20 L.Ed.2d 797 (1968). The Court in <em>Witherspoon </em>did consider the argument that exclusion of jurors with scruples against capital punishment precludes an impartial trial on the issue of guilt. The majority there said, <em>id. </em>at 517-518, 88 S.Ct. at 1774:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-5\"><em>\u201cWe </em>simply cannot conclude, either on the basis of the record now before us or as a matter of judicial notice, that the exclusion of jurors opposed to capital punishment results in an unrepresentative jury on the issue of guilt or substantially increases the risk of conviction.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">While it is true that <em>Witherspoon </em>does hint, as the dissenters note, <em>id. </em>at 539, 88 S.Ct. 1770, that the law may change on a different record, the studies and reports cited to us are the same as those cited to the Court in <em>Witherspoon </em>and <em>Bumper. </em>Thus, a different result could not be supported on the present law. However, we do not even reach the question. As pointed out above, this part of the challenge to the blue ribbon jury statute was first made in this court. Consequently, there was not only no opportunity for the district court to evaluate the question, but Fein apparently has not exhausted his State court remedies by first making the argument raised here to the New York State courts. In these circumstances, we should refuse to pass on the claim without prejudice to Fein\u2019s subsequently making it to the State courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Appellant also claims that he is entitled to reversal because of other alleged prosecutorial suppression of evidence, denial of pretrial discovery and inspection, the effect of publicity, and certain statements made by the trial judge to the jury. These contentions were discussed and found to be without merit by Judge Palmieri in his opinion predicated upon the petition for the writ and the motion for a certificate of probable cause. We subscribe to his conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">Upon the examination of the State court record, we find no violation of Fein\u2019s right to due process and a fair trial. Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b76-24\">. Gloria was not available for this bearing and there is no showing that she would be available for any other hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b77-11\">. If we add the State trial judge and the Federal district judge, 13 judges have approved the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b78-7\">. As a matter of fact, the prosecutor and the detective testified that she said the phone call was made in late September or early October.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b84-5\">. In our own court, we would be overruling Vanderwyde v. Denno, 113 F.Supp. 918 (S.D.N.Y.1953), <em>aff'd per curiam, </em>210 F.2d 105 (2d Cir. 1954), <em>cert. denied, </em>347 U.S. 949, 74 S.Ct. 646, 98 L.Ed. 1096 (1954).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b85-8\">. Subsequently, the Court in Bounds v. Crawford, 393 U.S. 76, 89 S.Ct. 234, 21 L.Ed.2d 62 (1968), vacated the judgment in Crawford v. Bounds, 395 F.2d 297 (4th Cir. 1968) <em>(in banc), </em>which had accepted the argument urged to us, and remanded for reconsideration in light of <em>Witherspoon.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b85-13\">WATERMAN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AX\">(concurring) :</p>\n<p id=\"b85-14\">I find the dissenting opinion of Chief Judge Fuld of the New York Court of Appeals, 18 N.Y.2d 162, 177, 272 N.Y.S.2d 753, 763, 219 N.E.2d 274 (1966), most persuasive. I, with him, believe that it is possible that the jury might have reached a different verdict if the testimony Dagmar Generazio gave at the post-trial hearing had been presented at the trial. Nevertheless, I recognize that petitioner was convicted in the New York state courts and not as a result of a federal prosecution, and as we are not therefore writing upon a clean slate I am willing to concur in the affirmance of the decision below.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-15\">It appears that before the state felony trial the defense knew of Dagmar\u2019s existence and of the possible importance of her testimony. The defense, despite this knowledge, did not exert itself to seek her out and interview her. This failure on its part to exercise a reasonable diligence in trial preparation should bar us in this collateral proceeding from ordering petitioner\u2019s release or ordering the grant of a new trial based upon truly newly discovered suppressed' exculpatory evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-16\">Even though the office of the prosecutor was in constant touch with Dagmar during crucial days of investigation and trial as shown by the records of the telephone company, I would not go so far as to hold that this interrogative surveillance requires us to overturn this state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>court conviction upon a consideration of likely inferences that may be drawn from Dagmar\u2019s post-trial testimony. I agree with my brothers that we should not hold that there was a New York state prosecutorial suppression here; the defense was not unaware of Dag-mar; she was not deliberately made unavailable to the defense; and no specific request was made by defense counsel for a direct lead to her whereabouts.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
