Respondent, however, advances policy considerations for applying section 48(c) (1) exactly as it reads.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1196\">*1196</page-number>The legislative history cited to us by petitioners is at best equivocal. We cannot say that it evidences the intention which petitioners suggest, rather than that suggested by respondent, with sufficient certainty to justify a departure from the ordinary meaning of the statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
