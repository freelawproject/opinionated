Sinclair removed the suit to the federal district court and the Collector\u2019s motion to remand for lack of jurisdiction was denied. Sinclair\u2019s motion for summary judgment based on our prior holding in Mississippi River Fuel Corporation v. Cocreham, 5 Cir., 1967, 382 F.2d 929, rehearing denied, 1968, 390 F.2d 34, cert. denied, Mouton v. Mississippi River Fuel Corp., 390 U.S. 1015, 88 S.Ct. 1264, 20 L.Ed.2d 164 (1968), was granted and the Collector of Revenue has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">All of the legal contentions raised by the Collector in this case have heretofore been considered and ruled on adversely to him by this Court in the <em>Mississippi River Fuel </em>case. (See our per curiam decision released this day in the companion cases of Shell Oil Co. v. Mouton, No. 26493, and Mouton v. Shell Oil Co., No. 26730, 410 F.2d 715)</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\"> Nor is there any merit in the Collector\u2019s contention that this suit was improperly removed from the Louisiana state court to the federal district court since it is apparent that the federal court has jurisdiction both under diversity of citizenship, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, in that the Collector is acting unconstitutionally and therefore in an individual capacity and not as the official representative of the State of Louisiana, and because a federal question is presented, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, in that the Collector is attempting to collect severance taxes on oil and gas produced from a federal military enclave, Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana, on which the United States has exclusive jurisdiction as provided by Article I, Section 8, Clause 17, of the United States' Constitution. See <em>Mississippi River Fuel Corporation, </em>382 F.2d at 934, citing Georgia R. R. &amp; Banking Co. v. Redwine, 342 U.S. 299, 72 S.Ct. 321, 96 L.Ed. 335 (1952), and Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908), in support thereof. It was proper, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446, to consider the stipulation of fact, together with the allegations of the complaint, on the petition of the Collector for removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-11\">Being of the opinion, therefore, that our holding in <em>Mississippi River Fuel, </em>supra, is conclusive as to all the legal issues presented in this ease, the judgment appealed from is</p>\n<p id=\"b780-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
