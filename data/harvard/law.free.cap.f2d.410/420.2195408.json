width=\"909\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">In describing the preferred embodiment, the specification states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-8\">The supporting member must form a strong bond with both the tungsten carbide cutting rim and the steel bushing, it must possess substantial strength, particularly under compression, and it should not shrink during curing. These properties are obtained by using a mixture of powdered or finely-divided metal, such as steel or aluminum, and an epoxy or epoxy-polyamide resin. These resins have excellent dimensional stability during the curing process and provide a strong bond with the rim and the bushing. When coupled with powdered metal, they yield a supporting member with excellent compressive strength. I have found that a mixture of 80% powdered steel and 20% resin works very satisfactorily. However these proportions may be varied depending on the strength desired.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">THE CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"ASB\">The appealed claims read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-10\">16.

Suitable natural or synthetic resins include phenol-formaldehyde resin, any alkyd resin, thermoplastic resins, and shellac or the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Nestor discloses an <em>abrasive </em>wheel made by whirling a rotating mold containing a suspension of <em>abrasive grit, </em>preferably aluminum oxide grains, and a resin binder, preferably epoxide resin having an \u201cepoxy number approximately 192 grams per epoxide equivalent.\u201d Centrifugal force causes the <em>abrasive grains </em>to be arranged uniformly at the periphery leaving a \u201cclear inner resin ring.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">Kistler et al. relates to a molded <em>abrasive </em>article or <em>grinding </em>wheel.

The resin is softer than phenol-formaldehyde and more heat resistant than shellac or rubber.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">Voegeli-Jaggi discloses a <em>grinding </em>wheel comprising an outer <em>grinding </em>portion formed of an <em>abrasive </em>grit embedded in a phenolic resin, mounted on an iron support by means of a supporting portion which \u201cis formed of artificial resin such as phenolic condensation product resin and is in the form of a hollow cylinder or disc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">THE REJECTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">\n<em>Insufficient Disclosure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ArK\">In support of his rejection of claims 16-20 as being based on an insufficient disclosure, the examiner stated in his Answer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-12\">* * * Since appellant\u2019s disclosure as originally filed fails to identify the bond material for the tungsten carbide rim \u201c10\u201d, the specification * * * fails to set forth a complete written description of the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-14\">In sustaining, the board noted appellant\u2019s \u201cfailure to describe the tungsten carbide rim material\u201d and the absence of \u201ca statement in the original specification to the effect that a <em>bonded </em>carbide rim was employed.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.]</p>\n<p id=\"b485-15\">\n<em>Unduly Broad and Indefinite</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b485-16\">In rejecting the claims \u201cas not particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the invention as required by 35 USC 112,\u201d the examiner said: <em>&gt;</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-17\">Claim 16 is considered unduly broad and indefinite in the recited limitations of (1) \u201ca bonded hard metal carbide rim\u201d and (2) \u201ca powdered metal\u201d. In the first recited limitation, the identity of the bond * * * is indefinite and would include resins and ceramics as the binder * * *. In fact, the limitation reads on a self-bonded metal carbide rim. The affidavits * * * disclose the use of an iron-group metal as essential for bonding the hard carbide particles. [The board noted that (1) applied only to claims 16-19.] The second recited limitation above, includes the powdered metals of cobalt, nickel, iron and silver in supporting member \u201c12\u201d which are not taught by appellant as being operative. * * * [A]luminum and steel are the only two specific metal powders identified as operative * * *. [The board noted that (2) applied only to claims 16, 17, 19 and 20 and \u201cthat the term \u2018powdered metal\u2019 is broad enough to refer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>powdered sodium, or lithium, for instance, apparently unsuitable.\u201d]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">\n<em>Obviousness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">The examiner rejected claims 16-20 as unpatentable over Van der Pyl in view of Nestor, Kistler et al. and Voegeli-Jaggi. The examiner\u2019s application of the references to the claims is summarized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">Van der Pyl discloses an inner non-grinding ring consisting of aluminum powder and a synthetic resin bonded to an outer <em>abrading </em>rim of diamond grains in a synthetic resin bond. Kist-ler et al. discloses employing tungsten carbide or diamonds as the <em>abrasive </em>grains in molding resin-bonded <em>grinding </em>wheels. Nestor discloses an <em>abrasive grinding </em>wheel consisting of an epoxy ring and an outer <em>grinding </em>rim consisting of <em>abrasive </em>grains and an epoxy resin. Substituting tungsten carbide particles for the diamond grains in the outer rim of Van der Pyl and employing an epoxy resin as the synthetic resin in the inner ring thereof would be obvious expedients in view of Kistler et al. and Nestor. Employing a metal bushing in Van der Pyl\u2019s <em>abrasive </em>wheel would also be obvious in view of Voegeli-Jaggi. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">In sustaining, the board opined that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-8\">* * * the references demonstrate that the expedient of joining a hard bonded rim to a sleeve or shaft by means of a thermosetting resin in a powdered metal composition would have been obvious. The difference in operation between a rotary slitter knife and an abrasive wheel is not a controlling consideration in this case. The record does not suggest that the problem of bonding the hardened rim to a supporting sleeve or shaft is different in these two types of wheels.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">\n<em>New Matter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b486-11\">The board sustained the rejection of certain claims as being drawn to new matter</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-12\">* * * in the limitation \u201cno greater than 400\u201d characterizing the epoxide equivalent in claims 17 and 19, and in the expression \u201ca metal selected from the group consisting of cobalt and nickel\u201d in claim 20.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-14\">In so holding, the board was of the opinion that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-15\">* * * the epoxide equivalent of \u201cno greater than 400\u201d is new to the application as a description of the final product. The specification, page 4, refers to an epoxy resin equivalent \u201cof 400 or less\u201d but this reference is directed to the liquid resin prior to curing, and is intended to insure liquidity at room temperature, a process and not a product feature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-16\">We find no basis in the original application for the reference to cobalt and nickel. Assuming that iron group metals have been employed as bonding materials in this art, this would not give appellant the option of selecting cobalt and nickel for monopoly after the filing date of the application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-17\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b486-18\">We believe the board\u2019s affirmance of the rejection of claims 16-20 to be in error, excepting the rejection of claim 20 as being drawn to new matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-19\">\n<em>Insufficient Disclosure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b486-20\">The original application contained no express statement that the carbide rim is \u201cbonded\u201d nor did it disclose the nature of the binding material. However, an omission is not fatal where, as here, the disclosure is sufficient to enable <em>those skilled in the art </em>to practice the invention. A specification is directed to those skilled in the art and need not teach or point out in detail that which is well-known in the art. In re Nelson, 280 F.2d 172, 47 CCPA 1031, (1960). \u201cAppellant\u2019s invention is a new combination of old materials,\u201d namely, \u201ca new slitter knife using a well-known carbide cutting blade.\u201d The specification discloses that \u201cslitter knives having tungsten carbide blades are currently used.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-21\">Affidavits of appellant and Ritz, a metallurgist for more than 35 years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>who is familiar with metal slitting blades, <em>pr mo, facie </em>show that the terms used in tne specification, namely, \u201ctungsten carbide blades\u201d and \u201ctungsten carbide rims,\u201d have only one meaning to those skilled in the <em>cutting </em>art \u2014 a well-known tungsten carbide bonded by an iron group metal. The affidavit of Ritz states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">that the hard tungsten carbide facing materials referred to in the aforementioned patent application can only consist of hard carbide particles and an iron group metal binder, <em>usually </em>cobalt or nickel;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ArKH\">that * * * a person of ordinary skill in the art of metal slitting * * * would immediately recognize that the \u201ctungsten carbide rim\u201d referred to in the specification is the hard tungsten carbide facing material commonly employed which consists essentially of hard carbide particles bonded by iron group metals * * *. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">The record before us <em>prima facie </em>establishes that the terms used in the specification clearly teach those skilled in the metal <em>slitting </em>wheel or <em>cutting </em>wheel art how to practice appellant\u2019s invention; thus, the specification satisfies the requirements of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">The solicitor argues that Kistler et al. evidences \u201cthe fact that it was known to those in the art that other materials could be successfully used as binders for tungsten carbide particles for use in <em>cutting </em>tools.\u201d [Emphasis added.] However, the solicitor has fallen into the same error as the board and the \u25a0'examiner ; that is, Kistler et al. relates to resin bonded <em>abrasive </em>articles or <em>grinding </em>wheels, <em>not metal slitting knives to </em>which the instant invention is directed. Although synthetic resin binders for carbide grains may be satisfactory for <em>abrasive </em>tools, nothing of record establishes the operability of such binders for rotary slitter knife rim elements. In fact, the record supports the opposite conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">\n<em>Unduly Broad and Indefinite</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">We do not consider that the limitation, \u201ca bonded hard metal carbide rim,\u201d is unduly broad, and the rejection of claims 16-19 on that ground is untenable. Such a limitation, as evidenced by the record, defines an article which is old and well-known to one skilled in the metal slitting wheel art. Moreover, the claims of a patent are to be construed in the light of the specification and the understanding thereof by those skilled in that art to whom they are addressed. The record further establishes that one skilled in the art here involved would not consider the term \u201cbonded hard metal carbide\u201d broad enough to include resins and ceramics as binders, as well as self-bonded carbide, all apparently unsatisfactory ; instead, such a limitation would mean, to one skilled in the art, a carbide bonded with an iron group metal.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-12\">The solicitor argues that claims 16-19 omit an essential limitation, namely, an iron group binder, and are therefore, unpatentable for overclaiming the invention. He cites Graver Tank &amp; Mfg. Co., Inc. et al. v. Linde Air Products Co., 336 U.S. 271, 69 S.Ct. 535, 93 L.Ed. 672 (1949) in support of the proposition that, when the claims improperly overclaim the invention and are free from ambiguity which might justify resort to the specification, they are not to be saved because the latter is less inclusive. However, in the <em>Graver Tank </em>case, involving welding flux, the Supreme Court merely affirmed the District Court\u2019s refusal to limit or qualify the claim terms \u201csilicates\u201d and \u201cmetallic silicates,\u201d so as to mean only the nine specific metallic silicates which had been proved operative and had been disclosed in the specification. In that ease, there was no indication that the terms used in the claims would have a more specific meaning to one skilled in the art than the broader <em>generic </em>literal meaning; one skilled in <em>that </em>art apparently would not have recognized that \u201csilicates\u201d or \u201cmetallic silicates\u201d means only the nine metallic silicates disclosed in the specification. Here, however, evidence was introduced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>which <em>prima facie </em>establishes that \u201cbonded hard metal carbide rim\u201d has but one meaning to those skilled in this art, namely, a hard metal carbide bonded by an iron group metal.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">The rejection of claims 16-20 as unduly broad in calling for a supporting member which includes broadly \u201ca powdered metal\u201d is, we feel, likewise untenable. The examiner noted that such limitation \u201cincludes the powdered metals of cobalt, nickel, iron and silver * * * which are not taught by appellant as being operative.\u201d The board additionally asserted that such highly reactive materials as powdered sodium and lithium would also be included, and the solicitor adds to the list potassium and magnesium which, he suggests, may react with the epoxy resin. Again, the solicitor argues that the claims are unpatentable for overelaiming, citing <em>Graver Tank, </em>supra, and also In re Newton, 187 F.2d 337, 38 CCPA 877 (1951). However, in claiming a mechanical combination, which the invention here is, an applicant is not necessarily limited to the specific composition which he discloses as the material for making up each and every element of the combination. In re Fuetterer, 319 F.2d 259, 50 CCPA 1453 (1963). If every element in a mechanical combination claim were required to be so specific as to exclude materials known to be inoperative and which even those <em>not </em>skilled in the art would not try, the claims would fail to comply with 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112 because they would be so detailed as to obscure, rather than particularly point out and distinctly claim, the invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Here, appellant has <em>described, </em>his invention as <em>comprehending </em>the use therein of <em>any </em>metal in the supporting member <em>capable </em>of performing a specific function in a specific combination, and he has disclosed specifically two such metals having such capability. The examiner and the board, believing that not all metals are capable of performing this function and that one skilled in the art would not know offhand which metals are capable of so functioning, have rejected the claims as unduly broad. But it is clear that the instant claims do not comprehend a class of metals of any greater breadth than is <em>comprehended </em>by the invention description which is quoted above under \u201cthe invention.\u201d It is equally clear from this description and appellant\u2019s brief that, in the words of the second paragraph of section 112, \u201capplicant regards as his invention\u201d the slitter knife <em>combination </em>with epoxy resin and <em>any </em>metal powder <em>capable </em>of providing a supporting member having high compressive strength and resistance to shrinkage. Thus, the limitation of \u201ca powdered metal\u201d is not unduly broad for the reasons expressed in <em>Fuetterer, </em>supra, and in Judge O\u2019Connell\u2019s opinion in <em>Newton, </em>supra, where further precedents are cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">\n<em>Obviousness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">The rejection of claims 16-20 as unpatentable over Van der Pyl in view of Nestor, Kistler et al. and Voegeli-Jaggi under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 cannot be sustained on the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">The examiner and the board have apparently failed to take into account the precise art to which the invention relates. The invention relates to the sheet metal slitting art wherein a hard metal carbide rim is employed to exert a shearing action. None of the references teaches a hard metal carbide cutting rim and thus none of the references can teach or suggest the expedient of joining a hard metal carbide rim, as that term is used in the prior art and is understood by those skilled in the art, to a sleeve or shaft by means of an epoxy resin and powdered metal supporting member. Combining the references as done by the examiner and sustained by the board<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> will result in an <em>abrasive </em>or <em>grinding </em>wheel but will not result in appellant\u2019s invention, namely, \u201ca rotary slitter knife for slitting metal strip and sheet.\u201d In this respect, this case is not unlike Kropa v. Robie et al., 187 F.2d 150, 38 CCPA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>858, (1951), where the claim preamble, \u201can abrasive article,\u201d was held to be a significant limitation which defined a particular article and property of that article and gave \u201clife and meaning to the claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">\n<em>New Matter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The rejection of claims 17 and 19 on the basis of new matter in the limitation \u201cno greater than 400\u201d characterizing the epoxide equivalent is reversed because <em>original </em>claim 5<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> clearly supports the terminology in the rejected claims. It is elementary that claims contained in an application as originally filed may be considered part of the disclosure of the application. McBride v. Teeple, 109 F.2d 789, 27 CCPA 961 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">The rejection of claim 20 on the basis of new matter in the expression \u201ca metal selected from the group consisting of cobalt and nickel\u201d is proper on this record. Although the affidavits of record <em>grima facie </em>established that \u201ctungsten carbide or other hard metal carbides\u201d means, to one skilled in the art, tungsten carbide or other hard metal carbides bonded by <em>an iron group </em>binder, the affidavits do not sufficiently show that such binder is necessarily cobalt or nickel. Appellant\u2019s affidavit refers to rim particles as \u201cbonded together with a binder <em>such as </em>cobalt or nickel\u201d (emphasis added) and to \u201ccobalt or nickel bonded metal carbides.\u201d Certainly the first quoted passage suggests that other binders might be encompassed within the meaning of \u201ctungsten carbide.\u201d The affidavit of Ritz mentions \u201chard carbide particles and an iron group metal binder, <em>usually </em>cobalt or nickel,\u201d \u201cbonded by an iron group metal <em>such as </em>cobalt or nickel,\u201d and \u201chard carbide particles bonded by iron group <em>metals </em>[with no examples].\u201d (Emphases added.) It may be inferred from the record that \u201ctungsten carbide\u201d would not necessarily mean <em>cobalt or nickel </em>bonded tungsten carbide since other iron group metals may also be suitable. Accordingly, appellant may not specifically claim those two binders after his filing date for want of a specific disclosure even though they may be the most prevalently used.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b489-13\">The decision of the board is affirmed as to the rejection of claim 20; the board\u2019s affirmance of the rejection of claims 16-19 is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-14\">Modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-15\">SMITH, J., participated in the hearing of this case but died before a decision was reached.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b483-19\">.

The prior art cited by the examiner and relied on by the Board of Appeals relates to abrading wheels.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-18\">I am in accord with Judge Baldwin\u2019s opinion that none of these prior art references teaches the expedient of joining a hard metal carbide cutting rim, as that term is used in the prior art and understood by those skilled in the art, to a sleeve or shaft by means of an epoxy resin and powdered metal supporting mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>ber; and that a combining of these references will not result in a rotary slitting-knife for slitting metal-strip and -sheet.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">The differences between the prior art and the subject matter sought to be patented by the appellant are apparent in the record, i. e., a slitting-wheel which cuts shee-metal by a shearing action differs in kind from an abrading wheel which removes material by abrasive action; and, in operational use, tungsten carbide is applied in a slitting-wheel, not to remove metal as in abrasion, but to resist wear while providing the force to be imposed in the shearing of sheet-metal.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">There is no evidence before us suggesting that a person of ordinary skill in the slitter-wheel art would glean information from the abrading-wheel art in solving this problem in the slitter-wheel art. Thus, under the record before us, the differences between (a) the subject matter sought by the appellant to be patented and (b) the prior art, are not such that such subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person of ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertained. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103; see Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 17, 86 S.Ct. 684, 15 L.Ed.2d 545, 556 [11] (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">For the foregoing reasons, I concur in the reversal of the \u00a7 103 rejection, and in all other respects I join the opinion of Judge Baldwin.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b489-19\">.

The majority states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-9\">* * * None of the references teaches a hard metal carbide cutting rim and thus none of the references can teach or suggest the expedient of joining a hard metal carbide rim, as that term is used in the prior art and is understood by those skilled in the art, to a sleeve or shaft by means of an epoxy resin and powdered metal supporting member. Combining the references as done by the examiner and sustained by the board will result in an <em>abrasive </em>or <em>grinding </em>wheel but will not result in appellant\u2019s invention, namely, \u201ca rotary slitter knife for slitting metal strip and sheet. <em>* * *</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">I do not think the board intended to imply that it was limiting its consideration solely to what was taught merely to the <em>abrading </em>art by a consideration of the various teachings of the references, or that it was relying on that combination alone to render obvious appellant\u2019s slitter knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-12\">It is well settled that we must consider the state of the prior art not only as shown in the references employed, but also as reflected in appellant\u2019s specification. In re Davis, 305 F.2d 501, 49 CCPA 1196 (1962). Here, appellant\u2019s specification states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-13\">* * * Two principal types of slitter knives having tungsten carbide blades are currently used. Slitter knives of small width (%\" and less) have been made of solid tungsten carbide. Such knives obviously have in them a substantial amount of expensive tungsten carbide which does not serve to perform any of the cutting operation and has to be scrapped or reclaimed after the knife has worn to a certain extent A tungsten carbide rim is mechanically mounted on a steel hub for knives <em>y%\" </em>and wider. In these structures, a screw clamp holds the tungsten carbide rim in position. Although there is less unusable carbide in such structures, the expense of manufacturing and assembling this type is high.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-14\">Thus it can be seen that the board, like this court, was faced with a record which establshes beyond peradventure that each element of appellant\u2019s claimed combination is old. What is new, insofar as this record shows, is the use of a particular means \u2014 a previously known chemical composition consisting essentially of a mixture of epoxy resin and finely divided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>metal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014 to attach the concededly old \u201cbonded hard metal carbide rim\u201d or cutting blade to the equally old \u201cmetal bushing\u201d or hub, thereby replacing the clamp holding means previously employed for that purpose in the prior art.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">It was in those circumstances that the board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-6\">* * * the references demonstrate that the expedient of joining a hard bonded rim to a sleeve or shaft by means of a thermosetting resin in a powdered metal composition would have been obvious. <em>The difference in operation between a rotary slitter knife and an abrasive wheel is not a controlling consideration in this case. </em>The record does <em>not </em>suggest that <em>the problem </em>of bonding the hardened rim to a supporting sleeve or shaft <em>is different in these two types of wheels. </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">The board\u2019s language \u201chard bonded rim\u201d or \u201chardened rim\u201d is sufficiently broad to encompass either appellant\u2019s \u201cbonded hard metal carbide rim\u201d or the abrading rims of the references. It is evident from those references that phenol formaldehyde or epoxy resin materials, with or without metal powder fillers for purposes of heat dissipation, have long been suggested to those in the art as supporting members for abrasive rims. I think the board properly found appellant\u2019s particular means for attaching the cutting blade to the hub to be obvious in view of what had been suggested before in the abrading wheel art as shown by the references before us.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AuT\">I would affirm the \u00a7\u2022 103 rejection.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b491-9\">. That the epoxy resin-metal powder composition appellant employs was itself known prior to appellant\u2019s filing date is clear from certain pages from Lee and Neville \u201cEpoxy Resins\u201d (1957) filed by appellant during proceedings below. Lee points out that epoxy resins \u201cpossess a number of unusually valuable properties immediately amenable to use in the formulation of <em>adhesives, </em>sealing liquids, <em>cold solders, eastings, </em>laminates, and coatings.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.] \u201cCold solder,\u201d in turn, is defined by yet another publication appellant submitted as \u201ccomposed of finely divided metallic particles dispersed in epoxy resin.\u201d Among the desirable properties of epoxy resins, Lee mentions \u201chigh adhesive strengths,\u201d ability \u201cto provide chemical bonds with surfaces, such as metals,\u201d and \u201clow shrinkage.\u201d Appellant\u2019s argument that it \u201cis surprising and unexpected in the art that such a supporting member [of epoxy and powdered metal] would possess the strength, resistance to shrinkage, and adhesive properties requisite for the present application\u201d appears contradicted by Lee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b491-23\">.
