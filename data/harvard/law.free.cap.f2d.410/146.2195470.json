See Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 5 Cir. 1969, 409 F.2d 804, Part I [dated March 11, 1969].</p>\n<p id=\"b208-19\">This is an appeal from the denial of a motion to vacate the sentence of a federal prisoner. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-20\">The appellant was convicted upon his plea of guilty to a three-count Information charging three burglaries of United States Post Offices. He was sentenced to a 5-year term on Count I, a 3-year term to run consecutively on Count II, and a 3-year term on Count III to run concurrently with Count II.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-21\">The appellant contends that he did not make an intelligent waiver of his right to counsel; that he was not represented by counsel at any stage of the proceedings; and that his plea of guilty was the product of illegally-taken statements and coercion through threat of a life sentence being imposed in a pending state case as an habitual criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-22\">From the evidence presented at the plenary hearing, the District Court was entitled to conclude that appellant\u2019s testimony attacking the guilty plea was convincingly refuted by Postal Inspector Powell. We find no error in the proceedings below. See Goodwin v. United States, (5 Cir., 1968) 391 F.2d 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-23\">The judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b208-24\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
