The cause having come on to be heard upon the record and the briefs and arguments of counsel, the Court is of the view that there is not substantial evidence upon the record, viewed as a whole, to support the findings and order of the Board. Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-20\">It is ordered that the cross-petition for enforcement of said order be and it is hereby denied, and it is further ordered that Petitioner\u2019s petition to set aside the order of the Board be and it is hereby granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
