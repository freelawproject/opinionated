United States, 1962, 370 U.S. 722, 82 S.Ct. 1574, 8 L.Ed.2d 802, and accordingly the case is properly placed on the summary calendar under Fifth Circuit Rule 18.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-23\">This is an appeal from the denial of habeas corpus relief to a Florida state convict, without a hearing. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-24\">Appellant, along with several other defendants, was tried on the charge of riot. During the course of said trial, the tape-recorded confession of one, Benny Brooks, was introduced in evidence over the timely objection of appellant\u2019s court-appointed counsel. The trial judge permitted the confession to be introduced in evidence only as to Benny Brooks and specifically instructed the jury as to this fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-25\">When the playing of the recorded confession was completed, counsel for appellant moved for a mistrial on the ground that the evidence adduced through the tape recording prejudiced all other defendants and such prejudice could not be cured by an instruction to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-26\">In the recent case of Bruton v. United States, 1968, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476, the United States Supreme Court overruled its previous holding in Delli Paoli v. United States, 1957, 352 U.S. 232, 77 S.Ct. 294, 1 L.Ed.2d 278, and held that, because of the substantial risk that the jury, despite instructions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>to the contrary, \u201clooked to the incriminating extrajudicial statements in determining petitioner\u2019s guilt,\u201d admission of a co-defendant\u2019s confession in a joint trial \u201cviolated petitioner\u2019s right of cross-examination secured by the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.\u201d 391 U.S. 123, 126, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 1622, 20 L.Ed.2d 476. The Court then reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">In the recent cases of Williams v. Florida, 1968, 392 U.S. 306, 88 S.Ct. 2064, 20 L.Ed.2d 1112, and Hillman v. Florida, 1968, 392 U.S. 307, 88 S.Ct. 2065, 20 L.Ed.2d 1114, both of said petitioners having been co-defendants with Benny Brooks and the petitioner in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the United States Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the Florida First District Court of Appeal and remanded for further consideration in light of Bruton v. United States, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">It is clear that the appellant\u2019s case, too, is entitled to renewed scrutiny in light of <em>Bruton. </em>See Gray v. United States, 5 Cir. 1969, 407 F.2d 830 [March 6, 1969]. However, in our view the state and not the federal courts should re-examine this case in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Appellant filed his petition in the court below prior to the <em>Bruton </em>decision. That decision has created for him a new remedy in the state courts. Since the state courts bear a responsibility \u201cto vindicate federally-guaranteed, federally-protected rights in the administration of justice,\u201d Peters v. Rutledge, 5 Cir. 1968, 397 F.2d 731, 736, the request made by the state of Florida to be allowed the opportunity to decide the issue in this case should be granted. The principle of exhaustion of state remedies rests on comity, not on jurisdiction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-7\">\u201cIn the long run, time is saved and constitutional rights are better vindicated by assuring that state mechanisms to ascertain and find facts are fully used. We reject again, as we have so many times recently the beguiling appeal of remanding it for the Federal Judge to do what is initially the clear duty of the State Court.\u201d Milton v. Wainwright, 5 Cir. 1968, 396 F.2d 214, 215; Peters v. Rutledge, 5 Cir. 1968, 397 F.2d 731, 736.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed without prejudice to the appellant to apply to the state court for reconsideration of his case in light of <em>Bruton. </em>However, should the Florida courts deny such reconsideration, \u201cAppellant can return to the Federal Court for its inescapably independent judgment on federal issues.\u201d Peters v. Rutledge, 397 F.2d at 741.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b799-13\">. Under Rule 18 the Court has placed this ease on the Summary Calendar for disposition without oral argument. See Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 5 Cir. 1969, 409 F.2d 804 [March 11, 1969].</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
