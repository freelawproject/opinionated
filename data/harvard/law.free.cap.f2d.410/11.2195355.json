These conditions are: (1) that they were both \u201cmembers of the same household,\u201d or (2) that she was receiving \u201cregular contributions\u201d from him toward her support, or (3) that he had been ordered by a court to contribute to her support.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-15\">The Railroad Retirement Board found on substantial evidence that petitioner had not satisfied any of the three alternatives set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-16\">There is no merit to the petition, and the decision is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
