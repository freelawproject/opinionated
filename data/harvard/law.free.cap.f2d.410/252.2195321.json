He was admitted to the United States in September, 1960, to study towards! an advanced degree in the field of education. His visit was sponsored by the Agency for International Development- (AID) pursuant to the U.S. Information and Cultural Exchange Act of 1948, 62 Stat. 6, as amended, 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2451 et seq. (1964) (Cultural Exchange Act). It was understood at that time that upon completing 'his course of studies here Mr. Bong would return to South Vietnam to teach English. In 1963, after Columbia University Teachers\u2019 College dropped him from its enrollment because of unsatisfactory work, appellee obtained employment with the Department of State Foreign Service, and later with the Department of the Army\u2019s Defense Language Institute (DLI), a division of the Department of Defense (DOD).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-18\">Upon termination of his studies appellee lost his nonimmigrant status<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and it became necessary to apply for an immigrant\u2019s visa. However, he was ineligible for such a visa until the expiration of two years following departure from the United States after expiration of his exchange visitor status, in view of section 212 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-19\">Mr. Bong applied to the Immigration and Naturalization Service for a waiver of section 212 requirements on the grounds of exceptional hardship. His application was rejected on August 16,1965, and December 26, 1965, was set as a voluntary departure date. When the DLI learned of appellee\u2019s situation,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Dr. Chen, Chairman of its Far Eastern Division, notified its administrative office that he would like to retain Mr. Bong in the department, and Captain Greinwald of DLI\u2019s East Coast Branch contacted the Staff Civilian Personnel Division to \u201ctake the necessary steps\u201d so that DLI could retain Mr. Bong. Section 212(e) provides <em>(see </em>footnote 2) that a waiver of its two year residence requirement may be obtained if the Attorney General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>finds, \u201cupon the favorable recommendation of the Secretary of State pursuant, to the request of an interested United States Government Agency,\u201d that it is in the \u201cpublic interest.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182 (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">After taking up the matter with other concerned governmental agencies the Office of the Director of Defense Research and Engineering (ODDR&amp;E), the division responsible for processing departmental applications for waiver, declined to recommend pursuing request for a waiver. Appellee\u2019s counsel protested the decision as \u201cegregiously indefensible\u201d and urged the Office of the Secretary of Defense to reconsider. The Department notified appellee\u2019s counsel that the decision was \u201creluctantly reached after a careful assessment of all relevant factors,\u201d and that the Department would defer to AID and the Vietnamese Embassy, both of which opposed granting a waiver.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Appellee thereafter commenced an action in the District Court for a declaratory judgment directing the Secretary of Defense to exercise his independent discretion \u201cwhether to pursue waiver procedures.\u201d The Government moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, and in the alternative for summary judgment. The District Court denied both motions, and this court granted permission for this interlocutory appeal, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The Government urges that the action of the Defense Department in not requesting a waiver is non-reviewable as a \u201cmatter committed to agency discretion by law.\u201d <em>See </em>section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 (Supp. III, 1968). It is argued in the alternative that the matters before us are subject only to narrow, limited review, restricted to the question of whether the Department acted in accordance with the proper legal standard. Appellee contends that the decision to request a waiver is not beyond judicial scrutiny, and that the Department erroneously failed to exercise its discretion by deferring to the views of AID.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">We need not rule on the broad contentions as we think it plain that the Defense Department exercised its discretion in a manner compatible with its obligations under section 212 and in accordance with sound principles of government administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b316-13\">Appellee\u2019s complaint is in essence an attack on departmental regulations that establish the guidelines for the determination of when to request waiver on behalf of an exchange visitor employee. Defense regulations provide in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-14\">* * * Each waiver request will be individually and strictly evaluated in terms of the following considerations and standards:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-15\">1. <em>High priority character of the program or activity involved. </em>[Paragraph omitted.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-16\">2. <em>Essential relationship of the exchange visitor to the program. </em>[Paragraph omitted.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-17\">3. <em>Critical qualifications of the exchange applicant. </em>[Paragraph omitted.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-18\">4. <em>Need for special clearance for person on an official Exchange Program of the U.S. Government. In the </em>case of an exchange visitor who came to the United States on an official Exchange Program of the U.S. Government, the documentary evidence should include information on satisfactory clearance with the sponsoring agency. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-21\">5. <em>Relevance of other factors. </em>Consideration of waiver requests is not restricted to the professional aspects of the exchange visitor\u2019s present or potential contribution to programs of offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>cial defense interest. Other relevant facts concerning the exchange visitor\u2019s non-immigrant status, his commitment to return home, the attitude of his government, and the prospects for making effective use of his knowledge and capabilities acquired in the United States will be taken into account.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">To similar effect is the Interagency Policy on <em>The Return of Participants in Exchange Visitor Programs </em>to which DOD is a signatory. These regulations, it is contended, bind the Defense Department to abide by considerations of foreign relations which the Department of State, and not the \u201cinterested agency\u201d should take into account.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">It is clear that neither the DOD regulations nor the Interagency Agreement <em>require </em>the Department of Defense, as an \u201cinterested agency\u201d making application for continued presence of an exchange visitor, to respect the position of the sponsoring agency which originally brought in the exchange visitor, and that the Department may proceed without its concurrence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The regulations and the Interagency Agreement include consultation with a sponsoring agency as only <em>one </em>aspect of the decision-making process. Neither document requires a department to abandon its pursuit of waiver for an exchange visitor if it has a <em>com-pelting </em>need for his services. Thus, the issue is whether an \u201cinterested agency\u201d <em>may </em>informally consult and take into account the views of other concerned departments in deciding whether or not to submit a formal waiver request to the Department of State.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-14\">The announced purpose of the Cultural Exchange Act is to afford aliens an opportunity to visit the United States and acquire skills that would be useful in their homelands. <em>See </em>22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2451. To the extent that a visiting exchangee does not return to his native land a major policy of the Act is undercut. Congress sought to secure its objectives by adopting the requirements of \u00a7 212. The waiver procedures were included for the purpose of permitting a government department to retain critical personnel. But there are degrees of need. Any competent employee is an asset to any organization. Yet short of a finding of irre-placeability a department may responsibly decide not to press the matter of waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-15\">A bureau considering whether to make application as an \u201cinterested agency\u201d for extension of the stay of an exchange visitor, as in the \u201cpublic interest,\u201d is not required to act solely on the basis of its own needs. We may assume that it may not properly delegate to another agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>the decision whether or not to apply. But certainly it may make its own decision whether or not to apply by appraising its own need in light of the views and comments of other concerned agencies. Comity among departments of government is desirable. One branch of an organization should try to accommodate another division\u2019s personnel needs rather than enter into a dispute that has to be reconciled by a supervising department. Departmental clashes are wasteful of resources and time.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">It is clear from the exhibits that the Defense Department considered the possibility of requesting a waiver. It undertook to assess its own need for appellee\u2019s services. Dr. Chen, Chairman of DLI\u2019s Far East Division, felt that appellee was \u201cqualified\u201d and asserted a need for his \u201cinvaluable services,\u201d but there was no representation that Mr. Bong was irreplaceable. Indeed, a department memorandum indicates that there were replacement applicants waiting to be tested for Bong\u2019s job.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">In our view appellant Department is entitled to summary judgment. The only issue on the merits is whether the Department of Defense failed to fulfill its statutory obligations under \u00a7 212 by consulting other agencies. <em>We </em>reject the contention that the Department was not entitled to solicit the views of other concerned Federal agencies and defer to them as it saw fit.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We also reject the contention that DOD abdicated from its own evaluation. There is nothing before us to rebut the presumption of regularity. Indeed it is the uncontroverted fact that ODDR&amp;E explored the desirability of requesting a waiver. The Department has offered General Ely\u2019s statement that it considered all the relevant factors and decided \u201conly with reluctance\u201d not to pursue waiver. All appellee can prove is the fact that the Department did not deem its need for Mr. Bong\u2019s services as overriding.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This does not entitle appellee to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>The order of the District Court will he reversed and that Court is directed to enter judgment in accordance with this opinion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b315-10\">. When appellee, tost his status under \u00a7 212 of the Immigration Act, see note 2, <em>infra, </em>he no longer qualified as a non-quota immigrant under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 (a) (15) (J) and became subject to the requirements for obtaining a visa that apply to aliens who do not fall into a special category. <em>See, e.g., </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a) (15) (27) (1964), as amended (Supp. III, 1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b315-13\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(e):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-14\">No person admitted * * * [who acquired exchange visitor status under the Cultural Exchange Act of 1948] shall be eligible to apply for an immigrant visa, or for permanent residence, or for a nonimmigrant visa under section 1101 (a) (15) (H) of this title until it is established that such person has resided and been physically present in the country of his nationality or his last residence, or in another foreign country for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States: * * * 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(e) (1964).'</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b315-22\">. Appellee did not notify the DLI of his status before obtaining his position. Apparently the Institute had failed to check with the Director of Defense Research and Engineering before hiring plaintiff Bong.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b316-7\">. General Ely noted in his letter to counsel that both an Interagency Agreement, Foreign Affairs Circular No. 292, to which the Defense Department had subscribed, and \u201cdefense policy\u201d required concurrence of the sponsoring Federal Agency to a waiver request.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b317-7\">. The State Department\u2019s published regulations implementing \u00a7 212 provide that waiver requests by \u201cinterested agencies\u201d should be channeled through its office. 22 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 63.6(d) and (e), 63.7 (1968).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-9\">63.6(d). A request for a waiver submitted by any agency of the United States Government to the Secretary for his recommendation shall * * * state the reason or reasons why the waiver is being requested; and be accompanied by the report of the sponsor or sponsors of his application. [Sponsor here means \u201cinterested agency.\u201d]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqk\">(e) The request must be supported by documentary evidence demonstrating that issuance of the waiver is in the public interest because the two-year period of residence abroad would * * * be clearly detrimental to a program or activity of official interest to an agen-gy ^ H&gt; !|!</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-16\">^ ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-17\">63.7. Upon receipt of a request from an interested * * * agency * * * the Secretary shall review the policy, program, and foreign relations aspects of the case and in appropriate instances shall transmit his recommendation to the Attorney General for the latter\u2019s finding and consequent action.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b317-18\">. Paragraph 6-c-(2)-(a) of the Inter-agency Agreement provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-19\">In the case of an Exchange Visitor who came to the United States on an official Exchange Visitor Program of the U.S. Government, the application should include evidence that the sponsoring Federal Agency has agreed to the application being made, <em>or if it did not agree, </em>the grounds on which it declined to do so. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b318-5\">. The decision to pursue a waiver request means that \u2022 the Department must be prepared to present and defend its case for retaining an employee. An agency may well decide not to expend time and effort to retain noncritical personnel when it knows that it must be ready to meet opposition from other departments with numerous claims for the\u2019 services of an exchange visitor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b318-6\">. United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 74 S.Ct. 499, 98 L.Ed. 681 (1954), lends no support to appellee. Plaintiff-appellant there sought suspension of a deportation order. In his habeas corpus application he alleged that the Board of Immigration Appeals \u201cprejudged [him] through the issuance by the Attorney General in 1952, prior to the Board\u2019s decision, of a confidential list of \u2018unsavory characters\u2019 including petitioner\u2019s [Accardi\u2019s] name, which made it impossible for him \u2018to secure fair consideration of his case.\u2019 \u201d 347 U.S. at 262, 74 S.Ct. at 500. The Court held that under the applicable regulations, having the force of law, the Attorney General had conferred on the appeals board his discretion to review deportation orders, and that Accardi was entitled to an independent determination by the Board, according to the Attorney General\u2019s own rules. Having charged the Board to make an initial determination, the Attorney General could not usurp its discretion by dictating the outcome of Accardi\u2019s case. 347 U.S. at 267, 74 S.Ct. 499. Since Defense was not bound to defer to AID or any other agency, we do not have before us a case where discretion was usurped.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-12\">Appellee also cites regulations of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, which do not call for consultation with other federal agencies before deciding whether to submit a waiver request to the Secretary of State. We have no occasion to say whether such consultation is not necessary, but only that it is not forbidden.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b318-13\">. General Ely\u2019s letter to Mr. Carliner, appellee\u2019s attorney, demonstrates that ODDR&amp;E reached its decision by balancing the Department\u2019s need for Mr. Bong against the desire of AID and the Viet <em>Nam Embassy to </em>expedite Bong\u2019s return. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-14\">Both in our original waiver review requested by the Defense Language Institute and in the current re-assessment of the merits of a waiver in response to your letter, we find that AID, the Department of State and the Viet Namese Government stand firmly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>opposed to a waiver on program, policy and foreign relations grounds. If Viet Nam needs Mr. Lekhae\u2019s services in a military or civilian capacity in support of Joint U.S.-Viet Nam objectives in Viet Nam, in our judgment this requirement must take precedence over Department of Defense needs for his language instruction services here. JA 43.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-14\">The Defense Department\u2019s flexible attitude and willingness to defer to the Viet Namese Embassy and AID is particularly understandable in view of the Department\u2019s shared responsibility for both the military and political programs in Viet Nam. At a time when it is the joint policy of the United States and Viet Nam to increase the self-sufficiency' of that nation, it might sensibly be deemed contrary to the overall interest even of the Defense Department, considered apart, to claim the services of one vitally needed in Viet Nam in the absence of a genuinely crucial need for his services in the United States.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b319-15\">. Overseas Media Corp. v. McNamara, 128 U.S.App.D.C. 48, 385 F.2d 308 (1968), cited by appellee, does not call for a contrary result. <em>Overseas Media </em>reversed a summary judgment granted on the grounds that the Defense Department\u2019s action in refusing to permit distribution of plaintiff\u2019s newspaper at post exchange newsstands in Viet Nam was nonreviewable. The issue on appeal was whether</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-21\">* * * the Secretary of Defense, purportedly acting without reference to established criteria, [had the] power, insulated from judicial review, to deny to appellants access to post exchange newsstands in the Far East when it is alleged that he has granted such access to similarly situated publishers? 128 U.S.App.D.C. at 53-54, 385 F.2d at 313-314.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-22\">Moreover, appellant\u2019s prayer for relief requested a judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-23\">Declaring that the banning of the Overseas Weekly from distribution facilities * * * was * * * arbitrary and capricious and hence was an abuse of discretion. 128 U.S.App.D.C. at 53, n. 6, 385 F.2d at 313, n. 6.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-24\">The Court remanded so that it could be ascertained what, if any standards were applied to appellant\u2019s request. In the case before us appelleefs claim is that the standards avowedly applied were erroneous. JA. 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
