In this, the Board overruled the employer\u2019s objections to the validity of the union\u2019s election as the representative. The exception was to the refusal of the Board to allow a conventional hearing on the ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>jections. Instead, decision was made on the Regional Director\u2019s report after investigating the charges and considering ex parte affidavits and statements of witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\"> Concededly, such a hearing is demandable if the objections and exceptions raise material and substantial factual issues. NLRB v. Bata Shoe Company, 377 F.2d 821, 826 (4 Cir. 1967). The Board concluded they did not. Because we cannot say that the Board\u2019s action was unsustainable in law upon the facts found, or that there was not substantial support in the evidence for these findings, we must deny the company\u2019s petition to set the order aside, and grant the Board\u2019s petition for its enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Enforcement granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
