We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">Raymond Baechel was employed by Sears from 1966 until 1988. During the period between 1967 and 1984, Baechel worked at Sears\u2019s Chapel Hill store in the floor covering department as a salesperson, where he sold floor tile and linoleum, some of which contained asbestos. In 1984, Baechel was transferred to the plumbing department. In August 1987, Baechel developed chest pains and sought medical treatment. In January 1988, Cleveland Clinic doctors Edward Cordasco and James Weick performed a biopsy on Baechel\u2019s left lung, which revealed malignant mesothelioma. As a result of the doctors\u2019 findings, Baechel\u2019s left lung was removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">Baechel filed an application for an occupational disease with the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation, alleging that he had contracted mesothelioma in the course and scope of his employment with Sears. On July 14, 1988, before his claim could be processed, Baechel died. After Raymond Baechel\u2019s death, Raymond\u2019s widow, JoAnn Baechel, filed her Workers\u2019 Compensation claim for benefits under R.C. 4123.59.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-13\">A hearing officer issued an order stating that Raymond\u2019s death was a result of an occupational disease arising out of his employment and that JoAnn was a dependent spouse and therefore qualified to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund. Sears filed an appeal from the hearing officer\u2019s order to the Industrial Commission\u2019s Canton Regional Board of Review. The regional board affirmed the hearing officer\u2019s order. Sears appealed the regional board\u2019s judgment to the Industrial Commission. The commission affirmed the regional board\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>After JoAnn Baechel\u2019s application to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund had been upheld through the administrative process, Sears filed an appeal pursuant to former R.C. 4123.519, invoking the Summit County Court of Common Pleas\u2019 appellate jurisdiction. After a jury trial, the court of common pleas entered judgment, upholding the administrative order entitling JoAnn to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund. Sears appeals from the lower court\u2019s judgment, asserting three assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Assignment of Error I</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">\u201cThe trial court erred in excluding evidence of the decedent\u2019s prior exposure to asbestos.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Sears claims that it was error for the trial court to exclude certain answers to interrogatories made by the administrator of Raymond Baechel\u2019s estate, Edward Bayer, in connection with asbestos litigation pending in the United States Federal Court, Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division. Through such interrogatory answers, Sears sought to introduce evidence that Raymond had been exposed to asbestos while working for a previous employer. The trial court excluded the interrogatories as inadmissible hearsay evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">Appellant argues that such answers to interrogatories were binding party admissions under Evid.R. 801(D)(2) and were therefore admissible as nonhearsay statements. Even assuming, without deciding, that the interrogatory answers were improperly excluded, we would be unable to find reversible error. Civ.R. 61 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-9\">\u201cNo error in either the admission or the exclusion of evidence * * * is ground for granting a new trial or for setting aside a verdict or for vacating, modifying or otherwise disturbing a judgment or order, unless refusal to take such action appears to the court inconsistent with substantial justice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">Through introduction of. the interrogatory answers, appellant sought to establish that Raymond was exposed to asbestos while working for a previous employer. Under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, an occupational disease claim can be pursued if an \u201cinjurious exposure\u201d is established at the last place of employment. <em>Gradwell v. A.S. Helbig Constr. Co. </em>(Sept. 19, 1990), Summit App. No. 14520, unreported, 1990 WL 136068, citing <em>State ex rel. The Hall China Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1962), 120 Ohio App. 374, 29 O.O.2d 241, 202 N.E.2d 628. As a prerequisite to the allowance of an occupational disease claim, a claimant must demonstrate an injurious exposure in the course of his employment. <em>State, ex rel. Burnett v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 266, 268, 6 OBR 332, 333, 452 N.E.2d 1341, 1343. In order to demonstrate Raymond\u2019s injurious exposure, JoAnn was required to prove (1) that Raymond was exposed to asbestos in the course of his employment, and (2) that such exposure proximately caused or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>aggravated Raymond\u2019s condition. <em>Gradwell, supra. </em>As discussed in conjunction with appellant\u2019s third assignment of error, we believe that the jury could find that Raymond received an injurious exposure to asbestos in the course of his employment at Sears. As such, any alleged error for failure to admit evidence of Raymond\u2019s exposure to asbestos while working for a prior employer was necessarily harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Assignment of Error II</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred in instructing the jury on dual causation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">Appellant next contends that it was error for the trial court to instruct the jury on dual causation. After all of the evidence was presented, the judge delivered the following instruction to the jury on proximate causation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-9\">\u201cNow, there may be more than one proximate cause of a result and when two causes combine or contribute to produce a result, they are both the proximate cause of that result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-10\">\u201cNow, you will, therefore, determine whether Raymond Baechel was exposed to asbestos while working for Sears. And if so, whether that exposure was a direct and proximate cause of his mesothelioma.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-11\">\u201cNow, the Plaintiff is not entitled to receive benefits for any physical condition of Raymond Baechel which was caused solely or exclusively by Raymond Baechel\u2019s personal habits or nonoccupational causes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-12\">\u201cThus, if you find Raymond Baechel\u2019s mesothelioma was caused solely and exclusively by atmospheric exposure, then the claimants have not established the issue of causation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-13\">\u201cIf you find, however, that both the environment and the exposure to asbestos at Sears each contributed directly and proximately to cause mesothelioma, then the Plaintiff has established the issue of causation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-14\">At trial, Sears objected to the court\u2019s jury instruction on dual causation, arguing that an occupational disease must be caused exclusively \u201cin the course and scope of employment and not [by the] environment.\u201d In its appellate brief, Sears claims that the court\u2019s instruction would cause every mesothelioma claim to be compensable because it \u201cpermits the jury to find that the environment was the proximate cause of the disease, yet still find in favor of the Plaintiff because the employment at Sears was part of that environment, or because the decedent sustained a non-injurious exposure to asbestos while at Sears.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-15\">Initially, the court\u2019s jury instruction clearly required the jury to find that Raymond\u2019s exposure to asbestos while working at Sears was injurious before an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>entitlement to any benefits can be found. The court instructed the jury that as a prerequisite to compensability it was required to find that Raymond\u2019s exposure to asbestos during and in the course of his employment at Sears was a direct and proximate cause of his mesothelioma. The court further instructed the jury that if Raymond\u2019s mesothelioma was caused solely by Raymond\u2019s personal habits or by nonoccupational causes, JoAnn was not entitled to compensation under the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">With respect to the jury instruction on dual causation, this court has previously held that \u201cthe basic principles of proximate causation are applicable to dual causation of occupational diseases.\u201d <em>Norris v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co. </em>(1988), 48 Ohio App.3d 66, 67, 548 N.E.2d 304, 305, cited with approval in <em>Murphy v. Carrollton Mfg. Co. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 585, 588, 575 N.E.2d 828, 830. Under the dual causation theory, \u201cwhen two factors combine to produce damage or illness, each is a proximate cause.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The trial court instructed the jury on dual causation as a result of JoAnn\u2019s evidence that Raymond was exposed to asbestos in the course of his employment at Sears and the evidence elicited by Sears at trial regarding the existence of asbestos in the general environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">\u201cThe fundamental rule for determining the scope of the instruction to be given by the court is that it should be adapted to and embrace all issues made by the pleadings and the evidence. The instruction should be broad enough to properly cover the issues presented for consideration, or all the facts in issue which the evidence tends to establish or disprove.\u201d <em>Murphy, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 591, 575 N.E.2d at 832, fn. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">As such, we cannot say that it was error for the trial court to instruct the jury on dual causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">Assignment of Error III</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">\u201cThe trial court erred in failing to direct a verdict in favor of Sears, Roebuck and Co.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-11\">Sears contends that it was error for the trial court to deny its motion for a directed verdict, claiming that JoAnn failed to demonstrate that Raymond had contracted a compensable occupational disease. In order to demonstrate that Raymond contracted a compensable occupational disease, JoAnn was required to present evidence that (1) Raymond contracted mesothelioma in the course of his employment at Sears, (2) Raymond\u2019s employment \u00e1s a floor tile salesman with Sears resulted in exposure to asbestos distinguishable from the exposure found in general employment, and (3) Raymond\u2019s employment with Sears created a risk of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>contracting the disease in a greater degree and in a different manner from the general public. (See the former version of R.C. 4123.68.)</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">\u201c[T]he trial court must submit an issue to the jury if there is evidence which, if believed, would permit reasonable minds to come to different conclusions.\u201d <em>TLT-Babcock, Inc. v. Serv. Bolt &amp; Nut Co. </em>(1984) 16 Ohio App.3d 142, 143, 16 OBR 149, 151, 474 N.E.2d 1223, 1225. It is not a function of the trial court to consider the weight of the evidence or the credibility of witnesses when ruling on a directed verdict motion. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, an appellate court must affirm a trial court\u2019s denial of a directed verdict motion if a plaintiff produced some evidence on every element essential to establish its cause of action. See <em>Strother v. Hutchinson </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 282, 285, 21 O.O.3d 177, 179, 423 N.E.2d 467, 469. Upon review of the record, we find substantial evidence which tends to prove every essential element of JoAnn\u2019s claim. Accordingly, we overrule appellant\u2019s third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b403-8\">Cook and Dickinson, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
