Price, plaintiffs-appellants Shirley Gockel, Virginia Chidley and June Schweitzer, the sisters of Price, timely appeal from an August 18,1993 judgment of the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court, Probate Division granting summary judgment in favor of defendant-appellee Delphine C. Mundell who is the sole legatee of Price\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-12\">Defendants-appellees also include (1) Susan Johnson, Price\u2019s niece, who, although a defendant, was added by appellants as a party to the within action and who opposed Mundell\u2019s claims; (2) Gayle L. Eble, Price\u2019s niece, who was appointed executrix of Price\u2019s estate but was subsequently excused by the trial court from participation in the capacity of executrix since she opposed the validity of Price\u2019s will; and (3) Ann Marie Hawkins who was appointed special administratrix of Price\u2019s will upon Eble\u2019s removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-13\">Janet N. Price (\u201cPrice\u201d) and Delphine C. Mundell (\u201cMundell\u201d) were close friends for thirty-two years. In 1968, Price and Mundell took up residency together and, in 1977, they purchased a home together. In 1988, they purchased a condominium where they continued to live together. On January 13, 1984, during the period in which they resided together, Price executed a will in which she bequeathed her entire estate to Mundell. Price and Mundell, however, ended their co-residency, and apparently their close friendship, in 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Thereafter, Price allegedly stated to Eble and others, shortly before her death, that she, Price, executed a new will which revoked the original legacies to Mundell contained in the January 13, 1984 will. On February 20, 1992, however, Price died and Mundell thereafter admitted Price\u2019s January 13, 1984 will to the probate division. Pursuant to the January 13, 1984 will, the court appointed Price\u2019s niece, Gayle L. Eble (\u201cEble\u201d), as executrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Price\u2019s sisters, Shirley Gockel, Virginia Chidley and June Schweitzer, who are Price\u2019s heirs-at-law, then commenced the within action claiming that Price\u2019s will executed on January 13,1984 was not Price\u2019s last will and testament. Specifically, appellants claimed Price executed a new will shortly before her death which revoked the legacies previously devised to Mundell, <em>ie., </em>Price\u2019s new will revoked the January 13, 1984 will.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The parties to the within action, however, neither discovered nor admitted to probate an actual document, original or copy, of the new will allegedly executed by Price in which Price revoked the January 13, 1984 will. Appellants claimed, rather, that Mundell, shortly after Price\u2019s death, obtained and destroyed the new will executed by Price. Appellants further argued that, although Price\u2019s new will remained undiscoverable, Price\u2019s estate was required to be distributed according to the statutory provisions concerning intestate succession since Price indicated her intention to revoke the January 13, 1984 will.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Upon motion, the court thereafter permitted appellants to amend their complaint to add new party defendant Susan Johnson who is also a niece and heir-at-law of Price. Mundell then moved the court to excuse Eble from participating at trial in the capacity of executrix claiming that Eble, who was the daughter of appellant Gockel, would experience a conflict of interest and, therefore, be unable to impartially defend the January 13, 1984 will. The probate division agreed and removed Eble from participation in her representative capacity as executrix. Mundell then moved the court to appoint a special administrator and the court appointed Ann M. Hawkins (\u201cHawkins\u201d) who was attorney for Mundell but subsequently withdrew as counsel for Mundell.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">On June 8, 1993, Mundell moved for summary judgment claiming appellants neither demonstrated the invalidity of the January 13, 1984 will nor produced evidence substantiating their claim that Price executed a new will shortly before her death, <em>ie., </em>appellants failed to prove Price revoked her January 13, 1984 will. The court overruled this motion and the case proceeded to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">On August 9, 1993, Mundell and Hawkins, as administratrix with will annexed, * filed a motion <em>in limine </em>moving the court to prohibit appellants from offering any testimony or evidence that (1) Price executed a new will which revoked the January 13, 1984 will; and (2) Mundell destroyed Price\u2019s new will. In their motion, appellants moved the court to preclude the foregoing unless and until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>appellants introduced (1) evidence that Price did indeed execute a new will in conformity with existing law, <em>ie., </em>executed a new will conforming to R.C. 2107.03 which required, <em>inter alia, </em>the new will be signed in the presence of two witnesses; and (2) evidence of the content of the new will.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Appellees argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that introduction -of circumstantial evidence suggesting Price executed a new will which Mundell destroyed would be highly prejudicial to the jury and unfair without actual evidence that the new will was legally executed and without evidence that the new will specifically revoked the January 13, 1984 will. Appellees also argued (1) Eble had made a diligent but unsuccessful effort to locate any other document which might purport to be Price\u2019s new will; (2) appellants discovered no person who witnessed, saw or was in possession of Price\u2019s new will; and (3) for three consecutive days during the week of February 3, 1993, an advertisement appeared in the Daily Legal News requesting information regarding any last will and testament executed by Price and, in addition, appellants located no attorney who was consulted or who prepared a new will for Price.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Appellants opposed the motion <em>in limine </em>arguing that Evid.R. 803 and other statutes, which appellants failed to cite, permitted testimonial evidence, <em>ie., </em>statements made to Eble and others by Price before she died, to be introduced demonstrating that Price executed a new will with the intent to revoke the January 13, 1984 will.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">The probate division, however, granted appellees\u2019 motion <em>in limine </em>finding (1) that Evid.R. 803(3) was applicable to only a properly executed will rather than to a purported will; (2) that Evid.R. 804(B)(5) would permit evidence of the new will to be introduced only for purposes of rebuttal but not to prove the existence of a will; and (3) the probative value of such evidence would be substantially outweighed by the danger of confusion of the issues or of misleading the jury in violation of Evid.R. 403(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">Thereafter, the case proceeded to trial on August 18, 1993 and appellees renewed their summary judgment motion. The probate division granted this summary judgment motion noting, <em>inter alia, </em>(1) appellants produced no evidence, other than hearsay testimony, of the existence of Price\u2019s new will; and (2) appellants stipulated that, with respect to the execution of the January 13, 1984 will, Price possessed testamentary capacity and the will was not a forgery or the product of undue influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">A timely appeal was then filed. This appellate court, however, dismissed the appeal for lack of a final appealable order finding that summary judgment was inappropriately granted in favor of all appellees, <em>viz., </em>Mundell, Johnson, Eble and Hawkins, instead of only Mundell since Mundell alone had moved the court for summary judgment. Appellants then filed a motion for reconsideration arguing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>that summary judgment was, in fact, neither granted in favor of Johnson since Johnson would have prevailed only if appellants had prevailed nor granted in favor of Eble and Hawkins whose interests in the case <em>sub judice </em>were merely to defend Price\u2019s will as mandated by statute. This court granted appellants\u2019 motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Appellants\u2019 first assignment of error follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">\u201cI. The court erred in appointing a special administratrix.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">This assignment lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">Appellants argue the trial court erred when it removed Eble from participating at trial in the capacity of executrix and, subsequently, appointed Hawkins as special administratrix with will annexed to defend Price\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">R.C. 2113.05 states in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-10\">\u201cWhen a will is approved and allowed, the probate court shall issue letters testamentary to the executor named in the will * * * if he is <em>suitable </em>* * (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">A person is \u201csuitable\u201d for the position of executrix only if she is reasonably disinterested and in a position to reasonably fulfill the obligations of a fiduciary. <em>In re Estate of Henne </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 232, 20 O.O.3d 228, 421 N.E.2d 506; <em>In re Estate of Rock </em>(1991), 81 Ohio App.3d 161, 610 N.E.2d 524; <em>In re Estate of Pfahler </em>(1989), 64 Ohio App.3d 331, 581 N.E.2d 602. An executrix may neither commence a will contest action nor concur as a defendant with plaintiffs in a will contest action while she simultaneously performs the duties of an executrix. <em>Henne, supra; Steinberg v. Cent. Trust Co. </em>(1969), 18 Ohio St.2d 33, 47 O.O.2d 154, 247 N.E.2d 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-12\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Eble, although a party defendant, clearly concurred in the will contest brought by appellants against Price\u2019s January 13, 1984 will. The will contest was commenced by Price\u2019s sisters including Shirley Gockel who was Eble\u2019s mother. In her deposition, Eble maintained that Price told her, Eble, that Price had executed a new will which revoked the legacies to Mundell contained in the January 13,1984 will. In addition, Eble engaged in the following colloquy at deposition with defense counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-13\">\u201cQ. As executrix, do you know what the duties of an executrix are?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-14\">\u201cA. I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-15\">\u201cQ. What are they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-16\">\u201cA To <em>preserve </em>my aunt\u2019s estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-17\">\u201cQ. What else, in addition?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>\u201cA. To do what she <em>would want done </em>with her estate following her death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-5\">\u201cQ. And what would guide you in doing what she wanted done?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">\u201cA. <em>Her last conversation with </em>\u2014 well, <em>one of her last conversations with me on the 13th of February.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-7\">\u201cQ. What was that conversation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-8\">\u201cA. <em>It was that she had a new will prepared. She had Del taken off because Del was still on it from the old will and the old house, and that she had changed that.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-9\">\u201cQ. And you feel that you should distribute or handle her estate in accordance with that conversation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-10\">\u201cA. <em>I feel that my aunt had a will made, and I cannot effectively do that, her wishes, because I feel that her condominium was illegally entered, and that I cannot find a will that my aunt had told me that she had made.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-11\">\u201cQ. Do you feel that it is your duty to handle the estate affairs in accordance with the will that is admitted to probate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-12\">\u201cA. I do as my lawyer has directed me to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-13\">\u201cQ. But you don\u2019t believe that this is the correct way to do it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-14\">\u201cA. <em>My aunt said that was her old will. She said she had a new will.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-15\">Based upon the foregoing colloquy, it is clear that Eble was neither reasonably disinterested in the outcome of the within will contest nor in a position to reasonably fulfill her fiduciary obligations and, thus, was not a suitable person for the position of executrix of Price\u2019s will. R.C. 2113.05, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-16\">The test to be applied by this appellate court concerning the trial court\u2019s removal of an executrix is whether or not the trial court abused its discretion. Under the circumstances and in accordance with <em>Henne, supra, Steinberg, supra, Roch, supra </em>and <em>Pfahler, supra, </em>the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it removed Eble from the position of executrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-17\">R.C. 2113.06 states in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-18\">\u201cIf there are no persons entitled to administration, or if they are for any reason unsuitable for the discharge of the trust, * * * the court shall commit the administration to some suitable person who is a resident of the state. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-19\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the remainder of Price\u2019s family consisted of (1) Price\u2019s sisters and their children who are Price\u2019s heirs-at-law and who commenced the within action; and (2) Price\u2019s other niece, Susan Johnson, who is also Price\u2019s heir-at-law taking through Johnson\u2019s deceased father who was Price\u2019s brother. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>probate division, however, was unable to appoint any of Price\u2019s foregoing family members to the position of administratrix because of their adverse positions to the January 13, 1984 will which had been admitted to probate.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">In accordance with R.C. 2113.06, <em>supra, </em>the trial court, therefore, did not err when it determined there were no family members suitable for the position. In addition, since there were no family members suitable for the position of administratrix, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when, pursuant to R.C. 2113.06, <em>supra, </em>it appointed Ann Hawkins as special administratrix with will annexed to defend Price\u2019s January 13, 1984 will.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Based upon the foregoing analyses, appellants\u2019 first assignment of error lacks merit and, therefore, is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">Appellants\u2019 second assignment of error follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-8\">\u201cII. The court erred in granting appellee\u2019s motion in limine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">This assignment lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">Appellants first claim the trial court erred when it granted appellees\u2019 motion <em>in limine, i.e., </em>when the trial court precluded appellants from offering testimony which would have alleged (1) Price made a new will with intent to revoke the legacies to Mundell contained in the January 13, 1984 will; and (2) Mundell destroyed Price\u2019s new will in order to ensure that the January 13,1984 will would be declared valid. The trial court held that appellants could introduce the foregoing evidence only after offering evidence that Price did, in fact, execute a new will in accordance with R.C. 2107.03<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and then offering evidence of the content of Price\u2019s new will.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">When a will is in the custody of the testator and cannot be found following the death of the testator, a presumption arises that the testator destroyed the will with an intent to revoke it. <em>In re Estate of Haynes </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 101, 25 OBR 150, 495 N.E.2d 23; <em>Behrens v. Behrens </em>(1890), 47 Ohio St. 323, 25 N.E. 209; <em>Chenoweth v. Cary </em>(App.1939), 30 Ohio Law Abs. 98, 17 O.O. 76, 31 N.E.2d 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-12\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>therefore, if Price executed a new will which remained in her sole custody, as appellants claim, the presumption arose that Price destroyed the new will with intent to revoke the new will when the new will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>was not discovered following Price\u2019s death. <em>Haynes, supra; Behrens, supra; Chenoweth, supra. </em>The foregoing presumption, however, may be rebutted by, <em>inter alia, </em>(1) proof of declarations made by the decedent; (2) testimony that a third party fraudulently destroyed the will; or (3) proof of the testator\u2019s relations to the persons involved in the will contest action. <em>Haynes, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">In addition, based upon Evid.R. 803(3),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the hearsay rule is inapplicable in a proceeding to admit a destroyed will. <em>Haynes, supra; Behrens, supra. </em>In <em>Haynes, supra, </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus, the Ohio Supreme Court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">\u201cThe proceeding to admit a lost, spoliated, or destroyed will is a special statutory proceeding in which the hearsay rule is inapplicable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellants desired to present hearsay statements made by Price which would have demonstrated Price\u2019s (1) intention to execute a new will thereby revoking the legacies to Mundell contained in the January 13, 1984 will; and (2) memory or belief that she did, in fact, execute a new will thereby revoking the legacies to Mundell contained in the January 13, 1984 will. Appellants also desired to introduce evidence that Mundell was present at Price\u2019s condominium shortly after Price\u2019s death and took the key to Price\u2019s safety deposit box thereby suggesting Mundell obtained Price\u2019s new will and destroyed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">In accordance with <em>Haynes, supra, Behrens, supra </em>and Evid.R. 803(3), <em>supra, </em>such testimony was admissible providing, however, the testimony was relevant in accordance with Evid.R. 401<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and its admission was not violative of Evid.R. 403.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">R.C. 2107.26 states in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-10\">\u25a0 \u201cWhen an original will is * * * destroyed subsequent to the death of a testator * * * and such will cannot be produced in the probate court in as complete a manner as the originals of last wills and testaments * * *, the court may admit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>such * * * destroyed will to probate, <em>if such court is satisfied the will was executed according to the law in force at the time of its execution and not revoked at the death of the testator.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellants did not seek <em>per se </em>to admit to probate Price\u2019s new will which was allegedly destroyed, <em>i.e., </em>appellants did not present, <em>e.g., </em>a copy of the allegedly destroyed new will and petition the probate division to execute the terms of that destroyed new will. However, appellants did indeed petition the trial court to recognize the existence of Price\u2019s new will, duly executed by Price and destroyed by Mundell, the contents of which new will revoked the January 13, 1984 will.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Thus, appellants petitioned the probate division to declare the January 13,1984 will invalid and distribute Price\u2019s estate according to the statutes controlling intestate succession. Appellants, therefore, did impliedly and indirectly petition the probate division to admit the new will to probate and give effect to its content, <em>viz., </em>declare that Price\u2019s new will revoked the January 13, 1984 will. R.C. 2107.26 is, therefore, applicable in light of the foregoing circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">In <em>Cole v. McClure </em>(1913), 88 Ohio St. 1, 102 N.E. 264, syllabus, the Ohio Supreme Court stated in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-8\">\u201cTo establish a lost or destroyed will <em>the evidence of its execution and its contents must be clear, strong, positive, free from bias and convincing beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) See <em>Dyce v. Koch </em>(App.1958), 79 Ohio Law Abs. 596, 157 N.E.2d 130; cf. <em>Behrens, supra; Chenoweth, supra.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">In addition, R.C. 2107.33<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> dictates that a new will does not constitute a valid revocation of a prior will unless the new will was properly executed in accordance with R.C. 2107.03, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">At first blush, there seems to be a conflict between <em>Cole, supra </em>and <em>Haynes, supra </em>with respect to the <em>quantum </em>of evidence required regarding lost, spoliated or destroyed wills. In <em>Haynes, supra, </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus, the Ohio Supreme Court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-11\">\u201cThe standard of proof necessary to admit a lost, spoliated, or destroyed will to probate is <em>clear and convincing evidence that the loss, spoliation, or destruction of the original will occurred </em>subsequent to the death of the testator or before the death of the testator, but without his knowledge.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Upon comparison of <em>Cole, swpra </em>and <em>Haynes, supra, </em>however, it is clear that <em>Cole, supra </em>deals with the <em>execution </em>of such wills the establishment of which must be demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt, whereas, <em>Haynes, supra </em>deals with the <em>destruction of </em>such wills the establishment of which requires clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the probate division precluded appellants from offering the foregoing admissible testimonies, <em>viz., </em>Price\u2019s hearsay statements and Mun-dell\u2019s alleged actions following Price\u2019s death, unless and until appellants first introduced evidence that Price did, in fact, execute a new will in accordance with the provisions of R.C. 2107.03, <em>supra </em>and evidence of the content of the new will. Pursuant to R.C. 2107.26, <em>supra, </em>R.C. 2107.33, <em>supra </em>and <em>Cole, supra, </em>the trial court did not err when it granted the motion <em>in limine. </em>If Price indeed executed a new will as appellants claimed, Price\u2019s new will would not have constituted a valid revocation of the January 13, 1984 will, regardless of Price\u2019s intentions, unless the new will was properly executed and either clearly stated Price\u2019s intent to revoke or was, in fact, clearly inconsistent with the January 13,1984 will. See <em>Hennessy v. Volz </em>(1938), 59 Ohio App. 1, 12 O.O. 335, 16 N.E.2d 1019.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Restated, in the absence of \u201cclear, strong, positive\u201d evidence \u201cfree from bias and convincing <em>beyond a reasonable doubt </em>\u201d (1) that Price <em>legally executed </em>a will in conformity with the requirements of R.C. 2107.03, <em>supra; </em>and (2) demonstrating the contents of the new will, the foregoing testimonies with respect to Price\u2019s memories and the actions of Mundell were irrelevant to resolve the case <em>sub judice. Cole, supra; </em>Evid.R. 401, <em>supra. </em>In addition, admission of the foregoing testimonies would have violated Evid.R. 403, <em>supra, </em>since admission would have been unfairly prejudicial to Mundell and would have also distracted the jury from focusing upon the real issue, <em>viz., </em>whether or not Price legally executed a new will which legally revoked the January 13, 1984 will. R.C. 2107.26, <em>supra; </em>R.C. 2107.33, <em>supra; Cole, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Based upon the foregoing analyses, appellants\u2019 second assignment of error lacks merit and, therefore, is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">Appellants\u2019 third and final assignment of error follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-9\">\u201cIII. The court erred in granting appellee\u2019s renewed motion for summary judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">This assignment lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">Civ.R. 56(C) specifically provides that before summary judgment may be granted, the court must determine the following: (1) no genuine issue as to any material fact remains to be litigated; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to only one conclusion viewing such evidence most strongly in favor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>the non-movant and the conclusion is adverse to that party. <em>Osborne v. Lyles </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 326, 587 N.E.2d 825.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">In addition, a motion for summary judgment forces the nonmoving party to produce timely filed evidence on issues for which that party bears the burden of production at trial. <em>Wing v. Anchor Media, Ltd. of Texas </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 108, 570 N.E.2d 1095 (syllabus). The nonmovant must also present specific facts and may not rely merely upon the pleadings or upon unsupported allegations. <em>Shaw v. J. Pollock &amp; Co. </em>(1992), 82 Ohio App.3d 656, 612 N.E.2d 1295.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellants presented neither evidence that Price <em>duly executed </em>a new will in conformity with R.C. 2107.03, <em>supra, </em>nor <em>evidence of the content of a new will. </em>Appellants were unable to produce, <em>e.g., </em>any of the following which would have constituted evidence that Price duly executed a new will shortly before her death, <em>viz., </em>(1) an original or copy of Price\u2019s new will; (2) the testimony of a person who witnessed Price\u2019s new will or saw Price\u2019s new will; (3) the testimony of a person who was in possession of Price\u2019s new will; or (4) an attorney who prepared a new will for Price or advised Price with respect to a new will.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">However, pursuant to R.C. 2107.26, <em>supra, </em>R.C. 2107.33, <em>supra, </em>and <em>Cole, supra, </em>appellants bore the burden to produce such evidence at trial. Appellants, thus, failed to produce timely filed evidence on the foregoing issues for which they bore the burden of production. <em>Wing, supra. </em>On the contrary, appellants relied upon mere allegations which could not withstand Mundell\u2019s summary judgment motion. <em>Shaw, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">As the trial court noted, if it were held that the mere allegations in the case <em>sub judice </em>were sufficient to withstand Mundell\u2019s summary judgment motion, then nothing would prevent an unscrupulous heir-at-law, who was omitted from a testator\u2019s will, from commencing a will contest and effectively frustrating the intent of that testator merely by (1) fraudulently claiming the testator executed a new will prior to death thereby revoking a previously executed valid will; and (2) alleging the new will was subsequently destroyed by the legatees of said previous will.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">In addition, since appellants were unable to demonstrate that Price duly executed a new will, the issues with respect to Price\u2019s memories or intentions and with respect to Mundell\u2019s actions were not genuine issues of material fact remaining to be litigated. <em>Osborne, supra. </em>On the contrary, such issues and allegations were irrelevant in the absence of proof that Price duly executed a new will in conformity with R.C. 2107.03, <em>supra, </em>which legally revoked the January 13, 1984 will. Evid.R. 401, <em>supra; Cole, supra; </em>R.C. 2107.33, <em>supra; </em>R.C. 2107.26, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>Furthermore, viewing the evidence, or the lack of evidence, most strongly in favor of the nonmoving appellants, reasonable minds could come to only one conclusion, <em>viz., </em>that appellants failed to prove Price legally executed a new will which legally revoked the January 13, 1984 will. R.C. 2107.03, <em>supra; </em>R.C. 2107.26, <em>supra; </em>R.C. 2107.33, <em>supra; Cole, supra. </em>Since appellants failed to demonstrate that Price legally executed a new will which legally revoked the January 13,1984 will, appellee was, therefore, entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Based upon the foregoing analyses, appellants\u2019 third assignment of error lacks merit and, therefore, is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b325-7\">James D.
