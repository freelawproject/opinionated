Stein, is an attorney who was retained by three women who had filed lawsuits against appellant, Liqui-Box Corporation, and Samuel N. Davis, a former Liqui-Box employee, alleging sexual harassment and discrimination. Davis is not a party to this appeal. After the lawsuits were filed, an article was published in The Columbus Dispatch.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As a result of this article, appellant filed this cause of action against appellee seeking damages for defamation. Appellee filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and for appellant\u2019s lack of standing to bring the claim to which appellant filed a memorandum in opposition. On May 23, 1994, the trial court granted appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>could be granted. It is from this decision that appellant now brings this appeal, asserting the following assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\">\u201cFirst Assignment of Error</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">\u201cThe Franklin County Court of Common Pleas erred by dismissing Plaintiffs complaint upon Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-7\">\u201cSecond Assignment of Error</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-8\">\u201cThe Franklin County Court of Common Pleas erred by improperly converting Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted into a motion for summary judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">Appellant\u2019s assignments of error are related and will be considered together. In these assignments of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred in granting appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">In ruling on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, it must appear beyond doubt from the complaint that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts that would entitle him to relief. <em>O\u2019Brien v. University Community Tenants Union </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 242, 71 O.O.2d 223, 327 N.E.2d 753. In considering a motion for failure to state a claim, the court is required to view the facts presented in the pleadings in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Fifer v. Buffalo Cafe </em>(1991), 76 Ohio App.3d 297, 601 N.E.2d 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-11\">Defamation is a false publication causing injury to a person\u2019s reputation, or exposing him to public contempt, shame, disgrace or ridicule, or affecting him adversely in his trade or business. <em>Cleveland Leader Printing Co. v. Nethersole </em>(1911), 84 Ohio St. 118, 95 N.E. 735. See, also, <em>Rogers v. Buckel </em>(1992), 83 Ohio App.3d 653, 615 N.E.2d 669. In an action for defamation, the plaintiffs prima facie case is established when he has demonstrated: (1) a statement of fact; (2) the statement is false; (3) the statement has a defamatory meaning; (4) the statement is published; and (5) the defendant is guilty of some degree of fault. <em>Hersch v. E.W. Scripps Co. </em>(1981), 3 Ohio App.3d 367, 3 OBR 430, 445 N.E.2d 670. See, also, 3 Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1977) 155, Section 558.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\">Appellant asserts that appellee\u2019s comment that \u201c[t]hese claims are the worst that I\u2019ve seen, short of rape,\u201d defamed it. On the other hand, appellee asserts that his comments stated his opinion about the allegations in the lawsuits, and did not make a statement about appellant and whether or not the company was guilty of any civil or criminal wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-13\">In <em>Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell </em>(1988), 485 U.S. 46, 108 S.Ct. 876, 99 L.Ed.2d 41, the Supreme Court accepted a jury\u2019s finding that an ad parody of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Falwell could not reasonably be understood as describing actual facts about him or actual events in which he participated. Thus, the court provided protection for statements that cannot reasonably be interpreted as stating actual facts about an individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">In <em>Greenbelt Coop. Publishing Assn., Inc. v. Bresler </em>(1970), 398 U.S. 6, 90 S.Ct. 1537, 26 L.Ed.2d 6, the Supreme Court addressed a situation where a real estate developer had engaged in negotiations with a city council for a zoning variance for some of his land while, at the same time, he also negotiated with the city on other land which the city wished to purchase from him. A local newspaper published articles stating that some people had characterized the developer\u2019s negotiation position as \u201cblackmail.\u201d As a result of the articles, the developer sued for libel. The court rejected the contention that the word \u201cblackmail\u201d implied that the developer had actually committed the crime of blackmail and held that the imposition of liability on such a basis was constitutionally impermissible because, as a matter of constitutional law, the word \u201cblackmail\u201d as used in this circumstance was not slander when it was spoken and was not libel when it was reported in the newspaper. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-6\">\u201c[E]ven the most careless reader must have perceived that the word was no more than rhetorical hyperbole, a vigorous epithet used by those who considered [the developer\u2019s] negotiating position extremely unreasonable. * * \u201d <em>Id., </em>398 U.S. at 14, 90 S.Ct. at 1542, 26 L.Ed.2d at 15.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">In <em>Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co. </em>(1990), 497 U.S. 1, 20, 110 S.Ct. 2695, 2706, 111 L.Ed.2d 1, 18-19, the court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">\u201c[T]he <em>Bresler-Letter Carriers-[Letter Carriers v. Austin </em>(1974), 418 U.S. 264, 94 S.Ct. 2770, 41 L.Ed.2d 745] line of cases provides protection for statements that cannot \u2018reasonably [be] interpreted as stating actual facts\u2019 about an individual. <em>Falwell, </em>485 U.S., at 50, 108 S.Ct., at 879 [99 L.Ed.2d at 48-49], This provides assurance that public debate will not suffer for lack of \u2018imaginative expression\u2019 or the \u2018rhetorical hyperbole\u2019 which has traditionally added much to the discourse of our Nation. See <em>id., </em>at 53-55, 108 S.Ct., at 880-882 [99 L.Ed.2d, at 50-52].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">The statement in this case cannot reasonably be interpreted as stating as an actual fact that appellant, a corporation, committed or condoned the crime of rape, nor is the statement susceptible of being proved true or false. See <em>Milkovich. </em>No reader of the statement \u201c[t]hese claims are the worst that I\u2019ve seen, short of rape,\u201d could have thought that appellee was charging appellant with the commission of a criminal offense. The comments were simply appellee\u2019s opinion of the seriousness of the claims of the women he was representing and, as such, they are nonverifiable and express appellee\u2019s subjective viewpoint. See, <em>e.g., Ohio Savings Assn. v. Business First of Columbus, Inc. </em>(1988), 43 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>App.3d 215, 540 N.E.2d 320. As a result, appellant cannot make a prima facie case for defamation and the trial court correctly granted appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The trial court did not err in the manner in which it ruled on appellee\u2019s motion. The trial court did not convert the motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment, nor did it take into consideration evidentiary materials outside of the complaint in ruling on the motion. Construing the facts presented in the pleadings in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party, appellant, it appears beyond doubt that appellant can prove no set of facts that would entitle it to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Based on the foregoing, appellant\u2019s two assignments of error are overruled, and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b517-8\">Tyack and Strausbaugh, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b517-9\">Dean Strausbaugh, J., retired, of the Tenth Appellate District, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b517-11\">The article, under the headline \u201cLiqui-Box accused of sexual harassment\u201d stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b517-12\">\u201cThree former employees of the Liqui-Box Corporation, including the former equal employment opportunity coordinator, are accusing the Worthington company of sexual harassment and discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-13\">\u201cThree lawsuits filed yesterday in Franklin County Common Pleas Court allege that the boss\u2019 son, Samuel N. Davis, repeatedly made unwanted sexual advances, gestures and comments to female employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-14\">\u201cOne suit contends that, despite many complaints, Liqui-Box Chairman Samuel B. Davis refused to allow any investigation into his son\u2019s alleged conduct and was himself giving promotions to women he slept with.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-15\">\u201cNeither Samuel B. Davis nor his attorneys returned messages left by <em>The Dispatch </em>yesterday.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-16\">\u201c T tried to protect the company from itself, but that didn\u2019t work, so now I\u2019m trying to help (those) still working there,\u2019 said Teresa Wilson, former manager of human resources and equal opportunity coordinator.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-17\">\u201cIn her suit, Wilson, of Johnstown, Ohio, said Samuel B. Davis warned her against investigating complaints of sexual harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-18\">\u201cShe said that when she voiced her objections, she was fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>\u201cTwo other former employees, Jill Booth and Michelle Peace, say in separate suits that Samuel N. Davis, who oversaw a subsidiary operation in the same building, made repeated and non-consensual sexual advances toward them, forcing both to resign.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">\u201cThe women are demanding an unspecified amount of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">\u201cLiqui-Box, with sales of more than $100 million last years, manufactures plastic packaging for liquid products. The company was founded in 1961 and employs about 80 people in its corporate office and adjacent plant, along with an additional 700 workers in facilities across the United States and Europe.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">\u201c \u2018These claims are the worst that I\u2019ve seen, short of rape,\u2019 said attorney David K. Stein, who is representing the women.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">\u201cPeace, 23, a former laboratory technician, said in her suit that Samuel N. Davis exposed himself to her, forced his hands up her shirt and otherwise \u2018attempted to intimidate and coerce (her) into engaging in sexual activity with actual and implied threats of job reprisals or with promises of job advancement and job security.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">\u201cBooth, 25, a former customer service representative, claims in her suit that Samuel N. Davis forced his hands up her shirt, \u2018physically attacked\u2019 her and tried to coerce her into having sexual relations.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">\u201cPeace and Booth say Liqui-Box refused to take any action and, as a result, \u2018created an atmosphere of abuse, intimidation, hostility and offensive behavior.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b518-12\">\u201cWilson said she began receiving complaints about Samuel N. Davis shortly after starting her job Aug. 5, 1991. First Wilson\u2019s supervisor, then Samuel B. Davis, warned Wilson against taking any action.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-13\">\u201c \u2018He told me that his son had a problem and that he was getting help,\u2019 Wilson said.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-14\">\u201cComplaints also were made against the elder Davis, she said.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-15\">\u201cWilson claims that, in one case, he was having an affair with his administrative assistant and the woman was rewarded with a promotion, but was eventually fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-16\">\u201cWhen the woman filed a discrimination complaint, she was rehired as a consultant and resumed her relationship with Davis.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-17\">\u201cAccording to one of the suits, \u2018Samuel B. Davis has had sexual relations with other female employees while chairman of Liqui-Box.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>\u201c \u2018These persons have been rewarded with increased benefits and promotions, to the detriment of female employees who do not wish to engage in sexual relations with their supervisors.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b514-17\">.
