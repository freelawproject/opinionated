In the 1990-1991 school year, David Frank Workman (\u201cWorkman\u201d) was a tenth grade student in appellant Bryan\u2019s (\u201cBryan\u201d) high school biology course at Vermilion High for both semesters. Workman received a passing grade for the fall semester but received an F for spring semester in biology. Workman\u2019s failure and his subsequent treatment by appellee Vermilion Local School District Board of Education (\u201cthe board\u201d) gave rise to litigation and ultimately this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">Bryan\u2019s biology course requirements and grading procedures were clearly delineated in a document that was disseminated to the students at the beginning of each semester. The document was reviewed orally with the students at the beginning of each semester. The document stated that an incomplete notebook would result in course failure for the nine-week grading period and course failure for the entire semester. A complete class notebook consisted of several separately graded assignments within different categories of work, such as (1) the student\u2019s notes from class sessions, (2) outlines of chapters from the textbook, and (3) written laboratory reports. The spring course requirements also included submission of two major laboratory projects, a plant lab study and a behavior lab study.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">Spring semester consisted of two nine-week grading periods. At the end of the first nine-week grading period of spring semester, Bryan required the biology students to submit their class notebooks. When Bryan returned the notebooks, he included a checklist of the items in the notebook with comments where improvement was needed. During the second nine-week grading period of the spring semester, Bryan met individually with each biology student to go over the student\u2019s progress. The student was required to bring the class notebook to this one-on-one session. When he met with Workman, Workman did not have his class notebook.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">At semester\u2019s end, Workman did not submit the two major laboratory projects and submitted an incomplete class notebook. Although Workman had a passing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>grade on quizzes and exams, because of the omission of the other course requirements, Bryan gave Workman an F for the grading period as well as the semester utilizing the \u201coverride procedure.\u201d Bryan also used the override procedure with two other biology students that spring semester.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">Vermilion High School has a grading policy that was developed by a committee of teachers and evaluated and modified by the high school administration. The high school principal testified that she sent this grading policy to the board during the summertime. The board had neither modified nor raised objection to the grading policy. One part of this grading policy was the override procedure, a means of \u201coverriding\u201d the computer averaging of grades from two nine-week grading periods. Another part of Vermilion High grading policy states: \u201cNo student can be failed for failing to complete a single item such as a project, assignment, book report, etc., unless: * * * 3. A completed Failure to Complete Requirements Report will be sent to the parents. * * * \u201d Thus, when a student fails to complete more than one single assignment, he can be failed without parental notification pursuant to the grading policy. This failure could result from a teacher\u2019s use of the override procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Sometime in June 1991, Bryan met with Workman\u2019s mother to discuss her son\u2019s biology grade. Both of Workman\u2019s parents met with the superintendent of Vermilion schools in late June or early July to discuss their son\u2019s grade and the override procedure. After this meeting, the parents also went to a board meeting and, during the public session, Mr. Workman expressed the parents\u2019 concern over their son\u2019s grade and the override procedure. The board directed the superintendent to investigate the issue. The superintendent met with Bryan and the high school principal and Bryan explained the course requirements and grading procedure. The superintendent had a series of conversations primarily with the principal, but also with Bryan and with Workman\u2019s parents to find a way to resolve this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">In September, the superintendent, Workman, his parents, the high school principal and Bryan had a meeting to discuss the grade issue and a possible resolution. A proposal was made for Workman to retake spring semester biology with Bryan and to replace the grade. Normally, when a student retakes a failed course, both the failure and the second grade appear on the transcript but in Workman\u2019s case the grade would have been replaced. While the parents were considering the proposal, Bryan said something that apparently enraged them and the meeting dissolved without resolution. Shortly after this meeting, Workman\u2019s father told the superintendent that he wanted to talk with an attorney. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>The superintendent received a letter from an attorney representing Workman\u2019s parents requesting a meeting. The superintendent and the principal met with the Workman\u2019s attorney and discussed the proposal for Workman to retake biology. According to the superintendent, he tried to leave the impression that there were not a lot of other options. The board was kept aware of the attempts to resolve the issue of Workman\u2019s grade because the superintendent submits written communications to the board called \u201cFriday reports.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">On October 7, 1991, there was a regular meeting of the board. Workman\u2019s parents were at this meeting and spoke to the superintendent, asking to speak privately to the board about their son\u2019s spring semester biology grade. The superintendent told the presiding board officer about this request. After the board conducted its regular session business, a motion was made to move into executive session to discuss personnel compensation. Workman\u2019s parents were invited into this executive session to discuss the issue of their son\u2019s grade. No motion had been made to move into executive session to discuss this specific issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">After Workman\u2019s parents explained their complaint to the board, proposals were made and then rejected by various board members. A proposal was made that Workman do an alternative assignment to allow the grade to be changed. It evolved that Workman would do three separate assignments, designed and graded by a certified science teacher outside the school district. If completed satisfactorily, the grades of these three assignments would be averaged into the grade for the second nine-week grading period; Workman\u2019s semester grade would be adjusted accordingly with the override taken off. No vote was taken by the board on this proposal nor was any rule, regulation or any formal action adopted when the board went back into regular session.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Later in October, Workman was assigned to write three science reports, not on biology topics but on environmental science topics. These topics were designed, and the papers later graded, by a county supervisor. Workman successfully completed the assignments by January 1992. Although not initially changed because of the litigation, ultimately, Workman\u2019s grade in biology was changed to a \u201cpass.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Soon after Bryan learned of the board\u2019s October 7, 1991 actions, he, and the high school principal who supported his use of the override, met with the board in an effort to explain his biology class assignments, his grading procedure, and the use of the override. The board did not alter the action initiated on October 7, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>A complaint was originally filed by Bryan and appellant Vermilion Teachers\u2019 Association, OEA/NEA (\u201cthe association\u201d), on March 30, 1992, suing the board. Appellants sought a declaratory judgment that the board had violated the Sunshine Law and various provisions of R.C. Title 33, including the graded-course-of-study provision. Appellants also sought a preliminary and permanent injunction against changing Workman\u2019s grade and monetary damages as well as the civil forfeiture of $100 and court costs and attorney fees pursuant to R.C. 121.22(I)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">A notice of voluntary dismissal was filed on August 19, 1992 because of a scheduling conflict. The case was refiled on September 9, 1992. Appellee Frank Workman, father of student Workman, filed a motion to intervene as guardian and next friend and the motion was granted. Bryan and the association filed a motion for summary judgment on February 18, 1993. Oppositions to this motion were filed by both appellees. The board also filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. Appellants filed a memorandum in opposition to this cross-motion. On June 23, 1993, a judgment entry granted the board\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment and denied appellants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Appellants filed a notice of appeal on July 23, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Appellants set forth two assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">\u201cAssignment of Error No. 1:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">\u201cThe Trial Court erred in granting the Appellees\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment and denying the Appellants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment and denying the Appellants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment with regard to the Appellants\u2019 assertion that the Appellee Vermilion School District violated its own graded course of study procedure as mandated by O.R.C. \u00a7 3313.60, \u00a7 3313.20, the Board\u2019s own policies and procedures, and the high school faculty handbook.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-8\">\u201cAssignment of Error No. 2:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-9\">\u201cThe Trial Court erred in granting the Appellees\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment and denying the Appellants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment with regard to the Appellants\u2019 claim that the decision to permit Student Frank Workman to take alternative assignments in lieu of the high school biology course taught by Appellant Bryan, and upon successful completion of said assignments, to allow Student Workman\u2019s grade to be changed retroactively for Appellant Bryan\u2019s high school biology course, violated the Ohio Public Meetings Law, O.R.C. \u00a7 121.22.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">Central to both assignments of error is the issue of standing to sue. As noted in <em>State ex rel. Consumers League of Ohio v. Ratchford </em>(1982), 8 Ohio App.3d 420, 424, 8 OBR 544, 548, 457 N.E.2d 878, 883:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>\u201cStanding requires demonstration of a concrete injury in fact, rather than an abstract or suspected injury. Demonstration of injury in fact is limited to those situations where an individual can show he has suffered or will suffer a specific injury, even if slight, from the challenged action or inaction, and that this injury is likely to be redressed if the court invalidates the action or inaction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">If Bryan has standing to sue in his own right, then the association would have standing because he is one of its members. <em>State ex rel. Connors v. Ohio Dept. of Transp. </em>(1982), 8 Ohio App.3d 44, 8 OBR 47, 455 N.E.2d 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">In regard to the first assignment of error, neither Bryan nor the association has standing to sue. Bryan has not demonstrated that he has suffered any concrete injury in fact as a result of the board\u2019s action. Thus, because he is unable to demonstrate this essential element, Bryan does not have standing. Because Bryan does not have standing, the association does not have standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Accordingly, appellants\u2019 first assignment of error is found not well taken to the extent that appellants lack standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">The second assignment of error concerns the requirements of R.C. 121.22, the \u201cSunshine Law.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This section requires that public officials take official action and conduct deliberations upon official business only in open meetings. Thus, all meetings of any public body shall be public meetings open to the public, unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>the subject matter is excepted by law. A board of education is a public body. R.C. 121.22(B)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">R.C. 121.22(G) provides the procedural requirements in regard to holding nonpublic, executive sessions: a roll call vote and a motion, approved by a majority, to go into executive session stating which one or more of the six exempted subjects, delineated in R.C. 121.22(G)(1) to (G)(6), is to be discussed. This section requires the board to conduct its meetings and discuss issues openly, except for the exempted subjects. Furthermore, even if an exempted subject were discussed in executive session, the sunshine law requires that the board move to go into executive session by stating which \u201cone or more\u201d of the subjects are to be discussed, R.C. 121.22(G), and then to adopt in an open session any rule, regulation, or formal action decided upon in executive session. R.C. 121.22(H).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">R.C. 121.22(I)(1) grants standing to any person to bring an action to enforce the provisions of the section. Thus, if this court finds a violation of the provisions of the Sunshine Law, Bryan, and therefore the association, would have standing to sue.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>a motion was made to move into executive session to discuss personnel compensation, one of the six exempted subjects delineated in R.C. 121.22(G). Once in executive session, after discussing this subject, the board proceeded to discuss Workman\u2019s course failure due to the school\u2019s override procedure, without a motion having been made to move into executive session to discuss this subject. Thus, the board violated the requirements of R.C. 121.22(G). Appellees in their brief to this court state: \u201cThe Board has admitted in its Answer that its procedure [going into executive session to discuss a student\u2019s grade without so specifically stating] did not follow the Sunshine Law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Appellees contend that because the board is required to keep a student\u2019s grade confidential, R.C. 121.22(G)(5), the exempted subject covering \u201cmatters required to be kept confidential by federal law or rules or state statutes,\u201d would apply. Therefore, appellees argue, Workman\u2019s failing grade due to the use of the override procedure could only have been discussed in executive session. This argument misses the point. When the board plans to discuss <em>any </em>.exempted subject, a motion to move into executive session \u201cshall state which one or <em>more </em>of the approved matters listed * * * are to be considered at the executive session.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 121.22(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">R.C. 121.22(A) states \u201cthis section shall be liberally construed.\u201d Public bodies cannot broaden the scope of the six exempted subjects, even if it would be more convenient to discuss a subject in executive session. <em>Gannett Satellite Information Network, Inc. v. Chillicothe Bd. of Edn. </em>(1988), 41 Ohio App.3d 218, 221, 534 N.E.2d 1239, 1241-1242.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Once a violation of the Sunshine Law is found, the remedy provisions of R.C. 121.22(1) are mandatory:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-4\">\u201cUpon proof of a violation * * *, the court of common pleas shall issue an injunction * * *.\u201d <em>Fayette Volunteer Fire Dept. No. 2, Inc. v. Fayette Twp. Bd. of Twp. Trustees </em>(1993), 87 Ohio App.3d 51, 621 N.E.2d 855.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Even a \u201ctechnical violation\u201d of the Sunshine Law requires application of R.C. 121.22(1). <em>Beisel v. Monroe Cty. Bd. of Edn. </em>(Aug. 29, 1990), Monroe App. No. CA-678, unreported, 1990 WL 125485. A trial court is bound by the remedy provisions even if the employee terminated by resolution in executive session, contrary to R.C. 121.22(G) requirements, has been returned to her job by the State Personnel Board of Review. <em>Drake v. Fairfield Cty. Dist. Bd. of Health </em>(Jan. 22, 1991), Fairfield App. No. 28-CA-90, unreported, 1991 WL 6267. As noted by the <em>Drake </em>court, the Sunshine Law contemplates the issuance of an injunction as a preventative measure. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Therefore, because this court finds a violation of the Sunshine Law, Bryan and thus the association have standing to bring this action to enforce the provisions of R.C. 121.22.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Accordingly, appellants\u2019 second assignment of error is found well taken to the extent that the board violated R.C. 121.22 when it went into executive session on October 7, 1991, without moving to do so for the additional reason of discussing the issue of a student\u2019s course failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">On consideration whereof, the judgment of the Erie County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed in part and reversed in part. This cause is remanded to the trial court with instructions to issue an injunction pursuant to R.C. 121.22 to the board to prevent future violations and to order the board to pay a civil forfeiture of $100 for the past violation of R.C. 121.22 and for a hearing regarding an award of appellants\u2019 trial court costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred in enforcing the provisions of R.C. 121.22. Appellants and appellees are ordered to pay their own court costs of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\"><em>Judgment affirmed in </em>part&gt; <em>reversed in part and cause remanded.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b564-10\">Glasser and Sherck, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-9\">. In both assignments of error, appellants seek to have this court address the merits of the actions taken by the board in its executive session on October 7, 1991. This court is reluctant to enter into the management of schools, even though we find some of the board\u2019s actions violative if not of the letter than at least the spirit of the legal constraints placed upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">For example, a board of education may not exceed its statutorily granted jurisdiction or authority. <em>Verberg v. Cleveland City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1939), 135 Ohio St. 246, 14 O.O. 87, 20 N.E.2d 368, paragraph one of syllabus. Therefore, a board may not undertake or <em>authorize </em>any action that is inconsistent with statutory law. Baker\u2019s Ohio School Law (1994) 28, Section 3.01. Here, the board implicitly, if not explicitly, authorized the superintendent to provide an alternative assignment for one student, Workman, without regard for any other students similarly situated. Boards are required to have regulations that apply equally to all within the class regulated. <em>Jacobs v. Benedict </em>(1973), 39 Ohio App.2d 141, 68 O.O.2d 343, 316 N.E.2d 898.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">Another constraint on the board is R.C. 3313.60, the provision for graded courses of study, which include biology. Graded courses of study must follow specific goals and objectives that must be approved by the board. It is apparent that the alternative assignments given to Workman were papers on topics in environmental science, not biology, even though the grades on the assignments were to be used to recalculate his grade in biology. Thus, the superintendent, the executive officer of the board, deviated from the board-approved graded course of study for one student.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-12\">This court is not unaware of the constraints placed upon elected officials by demanding constituents. However, the board must remember the ultimate demands placed upon it by the law of Ohio, and conduct itself accordingly.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
