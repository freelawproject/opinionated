Bushey, appeals his conviction in the Hamilton Municipal Court for driving while under the influence of alcohol in violation of the Codified Ordinances of the city of Hamilton, Ohio, and R.C. 4511.19.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-10\">On August 3, 1991, at 12:30 a.m., officers Mark Christian and John H. Nethers of the Hamilton City Police Department were both standing outside a Dairy Mart at the corner of Fairgrove Avenue and Campbell Avenue in Hamilton, Ohio, when Officer Christian observed appellant enter the Dairy Mart parking lot by \u201cshorten[ing]/cut[ting] off the comer.\u201d Both officers noticed that appellant was driving faster than they thought one should in a parking lot. Appellant\u2019s vehicle pulled up in front of the Dairy Mart and came to an abrupt stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-11\">After observing actions leading him to believe appellant was under the influence of alcohol and finding a sixteen-ounce open beer can on the seat between appellant\u2019s legs, Officer Nethers asked appellant to step out of his vehicle and perform a field sobriety test. Appellant refused, stating that he was not going to take any test. Officer Nethers placed appellant under arrest, put him in his cruiser and took him to the police station. At trial, officer Nethers testified that appellant was verbally abusive and uncooperative at the scene and that he was using profanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-12\">At the police station, Officer Nethers began the booking procedure. Although Nethers had appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s license (which appellant had handed to him at the scene), Nethers asked appellant about his home address, phone number, place of birth, marital status and employment to verify that the information on the driver\u2019s license was correct. Each time, appellant gave Nethers facetious answers which Nethers wrote as \u201crefused\u201d on the arrest report.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Later on, officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>Nethers read appellant the implied consent form and asked him if he would take the test. Appellant refused, stating that he was not taking any test. He also refused to sign the implied consent form and the property receipt for the beer can seized in his vehicle. Following appellant\u2019s refusal, officer Nethers placed him in the holding cell. Both officers testified at trial that appellant was \u201cmouthy\u201d and belligerent at the police station and that he made threats to both.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">On August 3, 1991, appellant was charged with driving while under the influence of alcohol in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1). On October 11, 1991, appellant filed a motion to suppress based in part upon a lack of probable cause to stop appellant and a violation of appellant\u2019s constitutional right to counsel. A hearing on the motion to suppress was held on January 14,1992. The trial court <em>sua sponte </em>determined that certain issues, including the issue of appellant\u2019s refusal to submit to chemical testing, would be treated as if addressed in a motion <em>in limine. </em>Both parties filed their respective memorandum in support of or in opposition to appellant\u2019s motion <em>in limine. </em>On February 25, 1992, the trial court overruled appellant\u2019s motion to suppress/motion <em>in limine. </em>A one-day jury trial ensued on March 2, 1992. At the close of the city of Hamilton\u2019s case, appellant moved for dismissal under Crim.R. 29. This motion was denied. The jury later returned a verdict of guilty as charged, and judgment was entered on March 2, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">Appellant filed this appeal and raises the following assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of the defendant in admitting evidence that the defendant did not submit to a chemical sobriety test when, in fact, defendant\u2019s delay was a good faith exercise of his right to consult with counsel which occurred well within the two hour limit for administration of such tests.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">Appellant claims that on more than one occasion, he requested to make a phone call to his brother-in-law, who was an attorney in Minneapolis,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for advice, a request which was repeatedly denied by the police officers. Appellant argues that his refusal to answer any questions or to take any tests was conditioned only upon a request to exercise the statutory right to counsel pursuant to R.C. 2935.20, and that, as such, it did not constitute a refusal within the meaning of R.C. 4511.191. Appellant further argues that it was error for the trial court to allow appellee during the trial to introduce and rely on appellant\u2019s refusal to submit to any tests, to prove appellant\u2019s alcohol-related physical impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">R.C. 2935.20 confers the right to counsel after arrest and states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>\u201cAfter the arrest, detention, or any other taking into custody of a person, with or without a warrant, such person shall be permitted forthwith facilities to communicate with an attorney at law of his choice who is entitled to practice in the courts of this state, or to communicate with any other person of his choice for the purpose of obtaining counsel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">A good faith request to exercise one\u2019s statutory right to consult with counsel before submitting to a chemical test required by the implied consent statute does not constitute a refusal to take such test, as long as the delay which occurs as a result of exercising the right will not unduly or unreasonably delay the administration of the test. <em>Siegwald v. Curry </em>(1974), 40 Ohio App.2d 313, 69 O.O.2d 293, 319 N.E.2d 381. However, if a request to consult with an attorney is made as a fraud or subterfuge to avoid taking a blood-alcohol-content (\u201cBAC\u201d) test, or as an attempt to delay matters beyond the statutory two hours for taking the test, there is a refusal within the contemplation of R.C. 4511.191. <em>Siegwald; Raine v. Curry </em>(1975), 45 Ohio App.2d 155, 74 O.O.2d 171, 341 N.E.2d 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">The determination of whether one\u2019s refusal to submit to a test is a refusal within the contemplation of R.C. 4511.191 or a good faith request to exercise one\u2019s statutory right is a factual determination to be made by the trial court based upon the facts and circumstances of the case. See <em>Siegwald, supra. A </em>refusal to take the chemical test may be admissible into evidence to show that the arrested person was intoxicated at the time of his refusal. See <em>Westerville v. Cunningham </em>(1968), 15 Ohio St.2d 121, 44 O.O.2d 119, 239 N.E.2d 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">The testimony of the witnesses as to when and if appellant requested to consult with counsel or his brother-in-law conflicts. On direct examination, appellant testified that as soon as Officer Nethers started asking him questions at the police station, appellant replied that he would not answer any questions until he had the right to speak to an attorney. Appellant testified that he requested to speak to an attorney approximately eight or nine times. With regard to his brother-in-law, appellant testified as follows: \u201cAnd uh, then he asked me will you take a breath test. I refuse to answer any questions, until I have a right to speak to an attorney. He said, I suppose your attorney is in Minnesota? I said yes, he\u2019s my brother-in-law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">On cross-examination, appellant testified that the police officers did not ask him to perform any field sobriety test. He further testified that his refusal to answer any questions on the basis of his desire to consult with an attorney began at the scene. He admitted, however, that he did not state that his attorney was his brother-in-law until they were at the police station. He also testified that his brother-in-law was not licensed to practice in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>With regard to appellant\u2019s request to make a phone call, Officer Christian first testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-4\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>[by David Scacchetti, counsel for appellant] * * * Was there a request for phone call?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-5\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I do not recall at the scene.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-6\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Was there a request for a phone call at some point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-7\">\u201cA Not that I\u2019m aware of. There was a statement made in the booking room, later.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-8\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>What was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-9\">\u201cA When am I going to be able to use a telephone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-10\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>What did you tell him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-11\">\u201cA I said as soon [sic ] everything gets done, you will be able to usea [sic ] telephone. That was the only thing I said to him, in the booking room.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-12\">Officer Christian later testified as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-13\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>[by David Scacchetti, counsel for appellant] Officer do you recall him mentioning something about his brother-in-law being an attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-14\">\u201cA Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-15\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>And do you also recall the fact that he said he wanted to talk to an attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-16\">\u201cA I do not remember that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-17\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Did he say he wanted to talk to his brother-in-law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-18\">\u201cA Not at the scene, I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-19\"><em>\u201cQ. At </em>any point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-20\">\u201cA Not that I can recall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-21\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>I just thought that you said that he stated that he wanted to talk to his brother-in-law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-22\">\u201cA Are we speaking at the scene?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-23\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>At any point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-24\">\u201cA He said he wanted to make a telephone call, when I saw him in the booking room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-25\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Did he state that he wanted to talk to his brother-in-law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-26\">\u201cA I do not recall who he asked for, just that he wanted to make a telephone call.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-28\">Officer Christian testified on redirect examination that appellant requested to use the phone after he had refused to submit to the chemical test. Christian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>explained that he knew about the time frame because he did not arrive at the police station until after the BAC test had been refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Officer Nethers did not recall appellant mentioning a lawyer at the scene. He testified, however, that he heard appellant mention his brother-in-law several times at the police station, but not at the scene. Nethers testified that he did not learn that appellant\u2019s brother-in-law was an attorney until appellant so testified at the hearing for the motion to suppress. Nethers\u2019s testimony as to when appellant asked to call his brother-in-law was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-6\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I do recall Mr. Bushey wanting to call his brother-in-law. I was never aware that his brother-in-law was an attorney. But he did ask to call his bortherin-law <em>[sic </em>]. I don\u2019t recall what point during the booking process. I don\u2019t know for sure if it was before or after I read him the complied [sic ] consent to the Datamaster test. At one point and time, I did tell him that [if] his brother-in-law was in Minnesota, it would be a long distance call. He would either have to use a calling card or something of that effect, because he can\u2019t make long distance phone calls out of the prisoner phone in our booking room. I believe he said forget it or words to that effect. And he never did use the phone.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">Officer Nethers finally testified that he never heard appellant request an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">A thorough review of the record indicates that, although there was some evidence that appellant requested to make a phone call, the facts are conflicting as to whether appellant refused to take the test when first asked by Officer Nethers to do so, and then requested a communication with his brother-in-law/attorney, or whether he conditioned his taking the test upon first talking to his brother-in-law. The record clearly indicates, however, that from the time the police officers approached appellant at the scene, appellant was belligerent, uncooperative and verbally abusive, and that he refused to identify himself at the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">It is our view that, under the facts and circumstances of the case at bar, the trial court could have reasonably construed the evidence to the effect that appellant\u2019s refusal to take the chemical test was not a refusal based upon the statutory right to communicate with counsel or his brother-in-law, but was an outright refusal to take the test, and that such refusal had been expressed at the outset. We therefore hold that appellant\u2019s refusal to take the chemical test was admissible evidence at trial to prove his physical impairment at the time of his refusal. Appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b870-11\">Koehler and William W. Young, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b866-13\">. Appellant\u2019s answer \u201cin a galaxy far far away\u201d to Officer Nethers' question about appellant\u2019s place of birth is an example of a facetious answer. It is also the only facetious answer Nethers wrote down on the arrest report.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b867-10\">. At the time of his arrest, appellant, a resident of Minneapolis, Minnesota, was temporarily on business pursuits in Hamilton, Ohio.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
