Dennis had applied for a position as a firefighter with the city of Cleveland (\u201ccity\u201d). Dennis had taken the written examination, the physical agility test, a psychological evaluation and a medical examination, and was placed on the eligible-for-hire list. In February 1989 it was discovered that Dennis had a congenital eye condition which prevented him from completely closing his right eyelid. The city removed him from the eligibility list due to his medical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">The OCRC determined that probable discriminatory action had taken place and attempted to achieve a settlement between the parties. When this was not accomplished, the OCRC filed a complaint, May 17, 1990. The parties agreed on the facts at issue and to a ruling by the hearing examiner without an actual hearing. Both parties briefed their arguments and the examiner made findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">On March 29, 1991, the hearing examiner found that Dennis\u2019s condition did not otherwise limit his functional ability, and that his general health and vision were good. The examiner also found that the city\u2019s physician based his finding of unacceptability for hire on standards promulgated by the National Fire Protection Association, disapproving the hiring of persons with congenital malformations. The examiner further recognized the report of Dr. Gregory S. Kosmorsky, D.O., Dennis\u2019s physician at the Cleveland Clinic, which stated that Dennis\u2019s condition would not affect his performance as a firefighter.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">The examiner\u2019s conclusions of law determined that the OCRC had met its burden to submit evidence in support of a prima facie case of handicap discrimination. Under the first prong to prove a prima facie case, the OCRC proved that notwithstanding the fact that Dennis had no functional limitation, the city perceived Dennis as \u201cvirtually unemployable as a firefighter.\u201d Under the second prong, the examiner relied upon the report of Dr. Kosmorsky as evidence that Dennis could safely and substantially perform the duties of a firefighter. Furthermore, the city\u2019s reliance on the generalized medical standards of the National Fire Protection Association failed to rebut the proof of this element submitted by the OCRC. The city was responsible for making an individualized determination of Dennis\u2019s abilities, but failed to do so. Finally, under the third prong, no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>dispute existed regarding the fact that Dennis was removed from the city\u2019s eligibility list solely because of his physical impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Having proved a prima facie case of handicap discrimination, the burden of proof shifted to the city to show that its action qualified under one of the exceptions allowed by the statute. The examiner concluded that the city did not meet its burden to submit evidence to show that Dennis\u2019s condition created an occupational hazard. The city made a bare assertion that smoke or embers may get into Dennis\u2019s eye, impairing the performance of his duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The examiner determined that even if the city had submitted some evidence of an occupational hazard, this was rebutted by the OCRC\u2019s recommendation that Dennis wear a gas mask. The examiner found this to be a reasonable accommodation, which would rebut any evidence of an occupational hazard, had the city put forth any such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The examiner recommended that the city cease its discriminatory practices, offer Dennis employment at a pay scale comparable to what he would have been paid had he been hired with others off of the eligibility list, and back pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">The city filed its objections to the examiner\u2019s findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations. The OCRC affirmed the examiner\u2019s recommendations and filed its order on September 19, 1991. The city appealed to the common pleas court, which affirmed the OCRC\u2019s order on August 13, 1993. A timely notice of appeal was filed with this court on September 15, 1993. Appellant, the city, files three assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">\u201cThe common pleas court erred in affirming the determination of the Ohio Civil Rights Commission that [the] employer had committed unlawful handicap discrimination in violation of Ohio Rev.Code Section 4112.02(A) where the complainant was not \u2018handicap[ped]\u2019 as defined in Ohio Rev.Code Section 4112.01(A)(13).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">Appellant argues that the Administrative Code section relied upon by the OCRC for the definition of \u201chandicap\u201d impermissibly enlarges the scope of the legislation. Appellant\u2019s argument is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-11\">Ohio Adm.Code 4112-5-02(H) prohibits discrimination against not only those persons with functional disabilities, but also against those persons who are perceived by the employer as being handicapped. This perceived handicap language applied to the factual situation in this case because Dennis is not actually handicapped under the R.C. 4112.01(A)(13) definition as it existed at the time of the alleged discrimination. The definition was amended June 30, 1992 to incorporate the language at issue here from the Administrative Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>An administrative agency is given authority to enact provisions with the full force and effect of law to enable it to effectuate the legislative policy behind the Revised Code provisions passed by the General Assembly. \u201cThe basic limitation on this authority is that an administrative agency may not legislate by enacting rules which are in excess of legislative policy, or which conflict with the enabling statute.\u201d <em>English v. Koster </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 17, 19, 15 O.O.3d 9, 11, 399 N.E.2d 72, 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The hearing examiner concluded that the Ohio Adm.Code 4112-5-02(H) definition of \u201chandicap\u201d applied. This conclusion was affirmed by the OCRC ruling and also by the common pleas court. The standard of review which this court must follow is whether the court below abused its discretion in determining that the Administrative Code definition was valid:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">\u201cIn reviewing the lower court\u2019s reversal of a civil rights determination, the appellate court\u2019s standard of review is limited to abuse of discretion. * * * The term \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 refers to more than a minor error in law or in judgment, implying instead that the attitude of the court in its decision was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable.\u201d <em>Kent State Univ. v. Ohio Civ. Rights Comm. </em>(1989), 64 Ohio App.3d 427, 438-439, 581 N.E.2d 1135, 1143. We are constrained to hold that the court of common pleas did not abuse its discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">The enabling statute, R.C. 4112.04, mandated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-8\">\u201c(A) The Ohio civil rights commission shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-9\"><em>U </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-10\">\u201c(4) Adopt, promulgate, amend, and rescind rules to effectuate the provisions of sections 4112.01 to 4112.08 of the Revised Code, and the policies and practice of the commission in connection therewith[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">The definition contained in the Administrative Code prohibiting discrimination against one with a perceived handicap is not in conflict with this enabling provision and also furthers the policy of the legislation to prevent unfair discriminatory employment practices. Prohibiting discrimination against someone the employer believes to be handicapped, even if such is not the case, furthers the policy against discrimination aimed at persons with disabilities. We find that the common pleas court did not abuse its discretion in applying the Administrative Code definition to this set of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\u201cThe common pleas court erred in accepting the Ohio Civil Rights Commission\u2019s contention that the complainant in this case was \u2018perceived\u2019 as having a handicap simply because he was not hired as a result of a physical condition which caused him to fail to meet the medical standards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Appellant argues that it did not even perceive Dennis to be handicapped at the time it took him off the eligibility list. Appellant asserts that Dennis simply failed to meet the medical standards used to determine qualified applicants. Appellant\u2019s argument is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">We cannot find that the common pleas court abused its discretion in ruling upon this issue. Appellant\u2019s action in relying upon generalized standards without making individualized assessments of the abilities of the applicants is discriminatory. In this case, the hearing examiner found that based upon its reliance on the generalized medical standards, the city \u201cperceived Complainant [Dennis] as virtually unemployable as a firefighter. Based on the foregoing discussion, Complainant had a \u2018perceived handicap\u2019, as defined by Administrative Code Section 4112-5-02(H).\u201d We affirm the common pleas court\u2019s decision to uphold this ruling by the hearing examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">\u201cThe common pleas court erred in rejecting the employer\u2019s position that even if the complainant were handicapped, the Ohio Civil Rights Commission failed to prove he could safely and substantially perform the duties of firefighter where it offered no analysis assessing the risks posed in a fire situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">Appellant asserts that Dr. Kosmorsky\u2019s report was insufficient to support the OCRC\u2019s burden to prove that Dennis could safely and substantially perform the essential duties of a firefighter. Appellant\u2019s argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\"> A reviewing court may not substitute its judgment for that of an administrative body if there is some evidence supporting its decision. <em>Pushay v. Walter </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 315, 18 OBR 361, 481 N.E.2d 575. Dr. Kosmorsky\u2019s report constitutes some evidence in support of the second element of the prima facie case of discrimination asserted by the OCRC. The court of common pleas did not abuse its discretion in affirming the administrative agency\u2019s ruling which relied upon Dr. Kosmorsky\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled. The court of common pleas decision to uphold the rulings of the OCRC is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b281-6\">Blackmon and Matia, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
