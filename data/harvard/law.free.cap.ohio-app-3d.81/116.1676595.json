Donald and Brenda Davis filed a complaint against the press brake manufacturer, Cincinnati, Inc. (\u201cCincinnati\u201d), seeking damages for personal injury and loss of consortium. The complaint alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>a cause of action sounding in products liability based upon strict liability in tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-13\">The case proceeded to trial. On October 16, 1990, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Donald and against Brenda and awarded damages accordingly. Cincinnati filed motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial on October 24, 1990. The motions were denied on December 20, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-14\">Cincinnati filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-15\">Assignment of Error I</p>\n<p id=\"b150-16\">\u201cThe trial court committed prejudicial error instructing the jury that the plaintiff\u2019s misuse of a product constitutes an affirmative defense, on which the defendant carries the burden of proof, in a products liability action based on strict liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-17\">The trial court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-18\">\u201cIn order for the Plaintiff, Donald Davis, to recover in strict liability in tort against the Defendant, Cincinnati, Inc., with respect to his claim that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>product was defectively designed, Plaintiff must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-4\">\u201cOne, that the product was defective at the time that it left Cincinnati, Inc.\u2019s factory;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">\u201cTwo, that the injury to Donald Davis occurred while the product was being used in a way that was reasonably foreseeable by the Defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-6\">\u201cAnd, three, that the defective condition of the product was a direct and proximate cause of the injury to Donald Davis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-8\">\u201cTo establish the defense of misuse of the product, the Defendant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the misuse of the product was:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-9\">\u201cOne, not reasonably foreseeable by the Defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-10\">\u201cAnd, two, that said misuse was the sole proximate cause of the Plaintiff\u2019s injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-11\">\u201cIf you find that the Defendant has established these two elements, your verdict will be for the Defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-12\">\u201cIf, on the other hand, the Defendant does not prove these two elements by a preponderance of the evidence, the Defendant will have failed on the defense of misuse of the product.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-13\">The crux of Cincinnati\u2019s argument is that the instruction impermissibly shifted Davis\u2019s burden to Cincinnati, thereby relieving Davis from proving an element of his case, <em>i.e., </em>that he was using the product in a reasonably foreseeable manner when injury occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-14\">The Supreme Court of Ohio has recognized that an affirmative defense is available to a defendant in a products liability case if the plaintiff misused the product in an unforeseeable manner. <em>Bowling v. Heil </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 277, 282, 31 OBR 559, 563, 511 N.E.2d 373, 377; <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Chrysler Corp. </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 1, 4, 523 N.E.2d 489, 492, fn. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-15\">An affirmative defense is a new matter which, assuming the complaint to be true, constitutes a defense to it. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5 Ed.1979) 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-16\">Cincinnati asserts that establishing that the plaintiff misused the product is not a new matter, but rather, requires the defendant to negate an element of the plaintiff\u2019s case. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-17\">A product design is in a defective condition if: (1) the product is more dangerous than an ordinary consumer would expect when used in an intended or reasonably foreseeable manner, or (2) the benefits of the challenged design do not outweigh the risk inherent in such design. <em>Knitz v. Minster Machine </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number><em>Co. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 460, 23 O.O.3d 403, 432 N.E.2d 814, syllabus. Requiring the defendant to establish that the plaintiff misused the product in an unforeseeable manner which proximately caused the injury is a new matter, and does not negate an element of the plaintiffs case. We find no error in the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury concerning misuse. The first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Assignment of Error II</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">\u201cThe trial court committed prejudicial error by instructing the jury that the modification of a product is an affirmative defense on which the defendant carries the burden of proof in a products liability action based on strict liability in tort.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Cincinnati claims that the trial court erroneously instructed the jury that the defendant has the burden of proving by a preponderance of evidence that the press had been modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">In a products liability action based on strict liability in tort, a plaintiff must prove: (1) that there was, in fact, a defect in the product manufactured and sold by the defendant; (2) that such defect existed at the time the product left the hands of the defendant; and (3) that the defect was the direct and proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries or loss. <em>State Auto Mut. Ins. Co. v. Chrysler Corp. </em>(1973), 36 Ohio St.2d 151, 65 O.O.2d 374, 304 N.E.2d 891, paragraph two of the syllabus. Courts have held that a manufacturer or seller is not liable for injuries caused by a defective product if the defect was created by alteration which amounts to an intervening or superseding cause in a cause of action sounding in strict liability. <em>Bechter v. Haynes </em>(Sept. 16, 1987), Summit App. No. 12940, unreported, 1987 WL 16984. In Ohio, a defendant manufacturer or seller must show that there has been a substantial change in the product after it left his hands and that such change amounted to an intervening or superseding cause. <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Temple v. Wean United, Inc. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 317, 4 O.O.3d 466, 364 N.E.2d 267, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the appellee produced evidence that the press was designed and manufactured with a gap between the edge of the bolster plate and the stationary ram guide which created a crush point. Donald Davis\u2019s hand was caught in the crush point and injured. When this evidence was produced showing that the gap was a defect, and that the defect was the proximate cause of Davis\u2019s injury, the burden shifted to Cincinnati to show that the press was substantially altered after it left Cincinnati\u2019s hands and that such alteration was an intervening or superseding cause of Davis\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>injury. The jury was properly instructed. The second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Assignment of Error III</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">\u201cThe trial court committed error in failing to grant defendant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Appellant asserts that its motions for a new trial and judgment notwithstanding the verdict were improperly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">As stated by the Supreme Court of Ohio:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-9\">\u201cThe test to be applied by a trial court in ruling on a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is the same test to be applied on a motion for a directed verdict. The evidence adduced at trial and the facts established by admissions in the pleadings and in the record must be construed most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion is made, and, where there is substantial evidence to support his side of the case, upon which reasonable minds may reach different conclusions, the motion must be denied. Neither the weight of the evidence nor the credibility of the witnesses is for the court\u2019s determination in ruling upon either of the above motions.\u201d <em>Osler v. Lorain </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 345, 347, 28 OBR 410, 412, 504 N.E.2d 19, 21-22.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">The granting of a new trial as an alternative to a judgment notwithstanding the verdict is within the sound discretion of the trial court pursuant to Civ.R. 50(B), governing JNOV, and Civ.R. 59(A), governing new trials. <em>Highfield v. Liberty Christian Academy </em>(1987), 34 Ohio App.3d 311, 315, 518 N.E.2d 592, 597. A trial court abuses its discretion in granting a motion for a new trial where substantial evidence supports the verdict. <em>Verbon v. Pennese </em>(1982), 7 Ohio App.3d 182, 184, 7 OBR 229, 231, 454 N.E.2d 976, 979.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">A review of the record fails to demonstrate an abuse of discretion by the trial court. Cincinnati asserts that the jury\u2019s finding of a modification in the press precludes a finding of its liability under the theory of strict liability. Cincinnati points to the jury\u2019s interrogatory answers as reason for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-12\">The jury found that the modification of the press brake was not a proximate cause of Davis\u2019s injury. After reviewing the entire record, we find no inconsistency in the interrogatories warranting a new trial. Accordingly, the third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-13\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-14\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b153-15\">Baird, P.J., and Cook, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
