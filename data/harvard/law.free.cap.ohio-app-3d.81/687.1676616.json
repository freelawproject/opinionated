For the reasons set forth below, we affirm in part and reverse and remand in part for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-17\">In the 1960s, the Solon Chamber of Commerce began to actively pursue the establishment of a hospital in Solon. The chamber of commerce formed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>hospital feasibility study committee and raised funds for the hospital. Over a period of years, the committee met with existing hospitals, including Polyclinic, Women\u2019s General, and St. Luke, about possible relocation or transference of beds to Solon.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">In 1965, the chamber of commerce hospital committee expanded into a new Southeast Hospital Study Committee with six subcommittees. In 1967, hospital committee director George Eaton reported at a chamber of commerce board meeting that the Southeast Area Community Hospital (\u201cSoutheast\u201d) had been incorporated. Southeast never adopted regulations or bylaws, did not elect officers, and did not have a membership book or minute book. Correspondence on behalf of Southeast went out on the chamber of commerce letterhead. Trial testimony indicated that Southeast was the same entity as the chamber of commerce committee, and that it was incorporated in order to take title to land on which the hospital was intended to be built. However, not all of Southeast\u2019s original trustees were chamber of commerce members.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">In 1972, Southeast took title to approximately twenty-six acres of land in Solon, together with Polyclinic Hospital. At that time, Southeast was working with Polyclinic to establish the hospital in Solon. Southeast paid approximately $147,000 for the land. In 1975, Southeast\u2019s efforts to establish the hospital with Polyclinic ended when the city of Solon failed to issue industrial revenue bonds which would have financed the hospital. Polyclinic\u2019s articles of incorporation were cancelled in 1982. After 1975, the original Southeast trustees were not involved in efforts to get the hospital. A new chamber of commerce committee was formed to continue the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">In 1985, representatives of Southeast and Polyclinic signed a deed transferring the twenty-six acres in Solon to Women\u2019s General Hospital. The deed was not filed at that time. One of the original trustees of Southeast, George Eaton, signed the deed on behalf of Southeast. Eaton had not been active in the drive to obtain a certificate of need for the proposed Solon hospital since 1975. Eaton testified that he was not authorized to sign the deed by the Southeast trustees, but that he had signed it at the insistence of the Women\u2019s General Hospital trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">In September 1985, Women\u2019s General Hospital commenced dissolution proceedings. A representative indicated at trial that proceeds from the sale of the Solon property would be put into a trust fund with the Cleveland Foundation to be used for the same purposes for which the hospital was founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">In December 1985, Southeast\u2019s articles were cancelled for failure to file a certificate of continued existence. In 1986, Eaton applied for reinstatement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>Southeast without consulting the other trustees. The corporation was reinstated in early June 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">On June 30, 1986, Eaton obtained the signatures of all of the living trustees of Southeast on a document prepared by Women\u2019s General. The document purported to ratify the conveyance by Eaton of Southeast\u2019s Solon property to Women\u2019s General. Two of Southeast\u2019s trustees testified at trial that they did not read the ratification document. One testified that Eaton misrepresented what the document was. The deed conveying the Solon property to Women\u2019s General was filed July 30, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">In 1987, the Solon Chamber of Commerce filed a complaint for declaratory judgment against Women\u2019s General, the city of Solon, Southeast, and George Eaton. Solon was sued only because of its interest in appropriating the property at issue. The chamber of commerce asserted that it owned the property by virtue of its ownership interest in Southeast, or that Southeast was the successor to the chamber of commerce\u2019s hospital committee. It also asserted that the funds used to buy the property were the chamber of commerce\u2019s; that Polyclinic did not provide adequate consideration for its interest in the property; and that the deed was unauthorized. The chamber of commerce also requested an accounting of funds, and a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">A jury trial commenced on January 8, 1990. At the close of the evidence, the court determined that there were no factual issues for the jury to decide, and removed the case from the jury. The court subsequently issued an opinion which stated that the chamber of commerce\u2019s hospital committee was incorporated into Southeast. The court also concluded that Eaton had no authority to sign the deed, and voided it. The court found that the ratification was ineffective due to Eaton\u2019s misrepresentations and omissions of facts, and because the trustees had effectively resigned. The court also appointed the President of the Solon Chamber of Commerce as master of Southeast regarding the appropriation proceedings, and retained continuing jurisdiction of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">The court subsequently amended its judgment to state that there was no just cause for delay. Women\u2019s General timely appealed, and assigned eight errors. Eaton and Southeast filed a separate timely appeal, assigning four errors. The Solon Chamber of Commerce, as appellee, assigned five errors. Only the first two assignments can be considered pursuant to <em>Parton v. Weilnau </em>(1959), 169 Ohio St. 145, 8 O.O.2d 134, 158 N.E.2d 719, paragraph seven of the syllabus: \u201c[assignments of error of an appellee who has not appealed from the judgment may be considered by a reviewing court only when necessary to prevent a reversal of the judgment under review. (Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>2505.22, Revised Code, construed and applied.).\u201d Many of these assignments are interrelated and will be addressed together.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Appellants claim that the chamber of commerce lacked standing to bring a declaratory judgment action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">The entertainment of a declaratory judgment action rests within the sound discretion of the trial court, and will not be reversed absent abuse of discretion. <em>Arbor Health Care Co. v. Jackson </em>(1987), 39 Ohio App.3d 183, 530 N.E.2d 928, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>Schaefer v. First Natl. Bank </em>(1938), 134 Ohio St. 511, 13 O.O. 129, 18 N.E.2d 263. R.C. 2721.03 provides in pertinent part that \u201c[a]ny person interested under a deed * * * may have determined any question of construction or validity arising under such instrument * * * and obtain a declaration of rights, status, or other legal relations thereunder.\u201d \u201cPerson\u201d is defined in R.C. 2721.01 and includes nonprofit corporations. See, also, <em>N. Woods Civil Assn. v. Columbus Graphics Comm. </em>(1986), 31 Ohio App.3d 46, 31 OBR 62, 508 N.E.2d 676, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">The chamber of commerce alleged that it had an interest in the real property at issue by virtue of its alleged ownership interest in Southeast. The chamber of commerce also alleged it is a member of Southeast. As a member and/or owner of Southeast, the chamber of commerce alleged a sufficient interest in Southeast to bring suit contesting the validity of the conveyance of Southeast\u2019s sole asset. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the chamber of commerce had standing to bring this declaratory judgment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">Women\u2019s General\u2019s fourth assignment of error reads as follows: \u201cThe Ohio Statute of Fraud[s] bars the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action.\u201d Ohio\u2019s Statute of Frauds is found in R.C. Chapter 1335. Women\u2019s General cites R.C. 1335.05, which provides in general that oral promises for the sale of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>lands, <em>inter alia, </em>are unenforceable. Women\u2019s General argues that this statute precludes this lawsuit, because the chamber of commerce was not named on the deeds, and was a distinct entity from the party named on the deeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">R.C. 1335.05 is inapposite to this case, which is not a case to enforce an oral promise regarding the sale of land. Furthermore, the fact that a party is not named on a deed does not preclude an interested party\u2019s attempt to invalidate a deed. See, <em>e.g., Schueler v. Lynam </em>(1947), 80 Ohio App. 325, 36 O.O. 32, 75 N.E.2d 464. Women\u2019s General\u2019s fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Women\u2019s General\u2019s fifth assignment of error reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-7\">\u201cOhio Revised Code Section 1702.12(1) prohibits the plaintiff from being a party to this action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">R.C. 1702.12(1) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-9\"><em>\u201cNo lack of, or limitation upon, the authority of a corporation </em>shall be asserted in any action except (1) by the state in an action by it against the corporation, (2) by or on behalf of the corporation against a trustee, an officer, or a member as such, or (3) by a member as such or by or on behalf of the members against the corporation, a trustee, an officer, or a member as such. The division shall apply to any action brought in this state upon any contract made in this state by a foreign corporation.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">This subsection addresses the authority of a <em>corporation. </em>There is no question that Southeast, as a corporation, had the authority to sell its property pursuant to R.C. 1702.12(F). The question in this case is whether George Eaton had the authority to act on behalf of the corporation. Accordingly, R.C. 1702.12(1) is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b724-12\">Appellants claim that the chamber of commerce cannot attempt to void this deed, because it did not file a claim by December 15, 1985 in Women\u2019s General\u2019s dissolution proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, the deed from Southeast to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>Women\u2019s General was not filed until July 1986. Accordingly, the chamber of commerce had no claim against Women\u2019s General prior to the dissolution deadline, and its subsequent claim is not barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Appellants also claim that the chamber of commerce is barred from invalidating this deed by R.C. 1702.39(C).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That subsection provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-6\">\u201cAn action to set aside a conveyance by a corporation on the ground that any section of the Revised Code applicable to the lease, sale, exchange, transfer, or other disposition of all or substantially all the assets of such corporation has not been complied with, shall be brought within ninety days after such transaction, or such action shall be forever barred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">R.C. 1702.39 applies to actions brought regarding winding up transactions, with the purpose of lending finality to the dissolving corporation\u2019s affairs. This case is not about the winding up of a corporation. Although the property at issue may be Southeast\u2019s only asset, there is no allegation in the complaint indicating that the corporation was in the process of winding up its affairs, nor had the corporation passed a resolution to that effect pursuant to R.C. 1702.47. The trial court correctly determined that 1702.39(C) is inapplicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">Appellants contend that the trial court improperly took the case away from the jury at the close of the evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> R.C. 2721.10 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-10\">\u201cWhen a * * * [declaratory judgment action] involves the determination of an issue of fact, such issue may be tried and determined in the same manner as issues of fact are tried and determined in other civil actions in the court in which the proceeding is pending.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>R.C. 2311.04 defines the right to a jury trial in other civil cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-4\">\u201cIssues of law must be tried by the court, unless referred as provided in the Rules of Civil Procedure. Issues of fact arising in actions for the recovery of money only, or specific real or personal property, shall be tried by a jury, unless a jury trial is waived, or unless all parties consent to a reference under the Rules of Civil Procedure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-5\">\u201cAll other issues of fact shall be tried by the court, subject to its power to order any issue to be tried by a jury, or referred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Civ.R. 38(D) provides that a jury demand may not be withdrawn without the consent of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">This case involved specific real property, such that factual issues had to be submitted to the jury pursuant to R.C. 2311.04. However, the trial court determined that there were no factual issues for the jury to decide. It did not grant the chamber of commerce\u2019s directed verdict motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">The trial court correctly determined that the issue of whether Eaton was authorized to sign the deed was solely a legal issue. The facts surrounding Eaton\u2019s conveyance of the property are not disputed. Eaton admitted that the Southeast corporation was not meeting and that he did not have prior approval of the other trustees for the deed. Eaton later stated on direct examination that he had authority to sign the deed. However, he did not contradict any specific facts which indicated that he had no prior approval of the trustees to sign the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">The trial court also found that the ratification of Eaton\u2019s unauthorized act was a legal and not a factual issue.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-10\">\u201cRatification by a principal cannot occur unless that principal has full knowledge and understanding of the acts performed by the agent. * * * [T]he burden of proving that a principal ratified an agent\u2019s acts is upon the agent who must clearly show that the principal had knowledge of all the facts pertaining to the act.\u201d <em>Testa v. Roberts </em>(1988), 44 Ohio App.3d 161, 165, 542 N.E.2d 654, 659, see, also, paragraph four of the syllabus; <em>Morr v. Crouch </em>(1969), 19 Ohio St.2d 24, 48 O.O.2d 43, 249 N.E.2d 780, paragraph four of the syllabus; <em>Bernardo v. Anello </em>(1988), 61 Ohio App.3d 453, 573 N.E.2d 126, headnote eight.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-11\">It is essential to ratification that the ratifying party intends to be bound by the previously unauthorized act. <em>London &amp; Lancashire Indemn. Co. of Am. v. Fairbanks Steam Shovel Co. </em>(1925), 112 Ohio St. 136, 152, 147 N.E. 329, 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-12\">In this case, the alleged ratification consisted of a writing signed by all of the then-living trustees pursuant to R.C. 1702.25. That section allows trust<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>ees to authorize actions without meeting provided all of the trustees approve the action in writing. The ratifying document states in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-4\">\u201c[T]he undersigned do hereby ratify and approve the transfer and conveyance of the [Solon] Property to the [Women\u2019s General Hospital] Association and hereby authorize, ratify and approve any and all acts taken and to be taken by George D. Eaton, President of [Southeast], deemed necessary and appropriate by him, including but not limited to, execution of a general warranty deed transferring the Property to the Association.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">At trial, Eaton and Women\u2019s General relied on the document to show that the trustees had full knowledge of the acts performed by Eaton. Eaton also testified that he explained the document to each trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">However, although the writing clearly was intended to include Eaton\u2019s deed to Women\u2019s General, it did not state that Eaton had in fact already signed the deed. Dr. Nancy Johnson stated that Eaton misrepresented the nature and effect of the ratification document, and did not show it to her when she signed. Another trustee who signed the ratification document stated that he did not read the document. Eaton also testified on cross-examination that he obtained the trustees\u2019 signatures at the behest of Women\u2019s General, the grantee, and not at the request of the Southeast trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">The above evidence reflects that factual questions existed regarding ratification, <em>i.e., </em>whether or not Eaton disclosed to the trustees that he had already signed a deed conveying the Solon property to Women\u2019s General, and whether the trustees intended to be bound by that deed. Accordingly, these issues should have been submitted to the jury. This case is reversed and remanded for jury determination of the ratification issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">Appellants claim that Southeast\u2019s trustees continued in office and that they were properly authorized to authorize and/or ratify the deed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">R.C. 1702.28(A) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>\u201cUnless the articles or the regulations provide for a different term, each trustee shall hold office until the next annual meeting of voting members and until his successor is elected, or until his earlier resignation, removal from office, or death.\u201d See, also, Fletcher Cyclopedia Corporations (1990) 160, Section 344.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">Resignation or abandonment of a corporate office is not presumed by the corporation\u2019s failure to meet and observe formalities, but requires an overt refusal to act or lack of attendance at actual meetings. See, <em>e.g., id. </em>at 167, Section 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">In this case, the chamber of commerce claimed, and the court found, that Southeast\u2019s trustees had effectively resigned their offices. However, there was no evidence that any of the trustees refused to act on behalf of the corporation or were absent from meetings, since no formal meetings were conducted. As of the time of trial, the trustees continued in office and the corporation continued to exist as a viable corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">The case of <em>Bartholomew v. Bentley </em>(1852), 1 Ohio St. 37, predates R.C. Chapter 1702 and is distinguishable. That case involved a for-profit corporation which effectively went bankrupt in 1818. Many years later a minority of its officers engaged on various stock transfers and issued worthless stock. When sued, they claimed that they had \u201cheld over\u201d in order to avoid personal liability, which the court did not allow.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">This case is reversed insofar as the trustees remained trustees at the time of the alleged ratification pursuant to R.C. 1702.28(A). This case is reversed and remanded for a jury determination of the factual issues concerning the Southeast trustees\u2019 purported ratification of the deed. If the jury determines that the ratification was properly authorized, then Southeast\u2019s conveyance should be declared valid. If the jury determines that the ratification was unauthorized, then the deed should be declared void, and Southeast should be declared the rightful owner of its interest in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b728-9\">Matia, C.J., and Harper, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b723-10\">.
