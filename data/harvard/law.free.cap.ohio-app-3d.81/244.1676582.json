Harr, appeals her conviction for operating a motor vehicle with a suspended driver\u2019s license in violation of R.C. 4507.-02(B)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-12\">On December 14, 1990, while on patrol, Officer Hanwell of the Medina Police Department observed Harr at a local service station putting gasoline in her automobile. Having responded to prior complaints filed by Harr, Officer Hanwell knew her identity and suspected that her driver\u2019s license was under suspension. After confirming through the police dispatcher that her license was in fact suspended, Officer Hanwell stopped Harr after she drove from the service station and onto the public highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-13\">In response to Officer Hanwell\u2019s questions, Harr explained that she was driving to a nearby restaurant to meet two friends, Claude Burton and (Kern) Hampton. She said that Burton had telephoned her at home and asked her to come quickly because Hampton was in trouble. Officer Hanwell agreed to follow Harr as she drove the short distance to the restaurant. When they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>arrived neither of Harr\u2019s two friends was there. Officer Hanwell proceeded to cite Harr for driving under a suspended license.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">At trial, Burton was called to testify in Harr\u2019s defense. He corroborated Harr\u2019s testimony that he had called for her help because he was afraid that Hampton was overdosing on cocaine. He explained that while telephoning Harr from inside the restaurant, Hampton had wandered off and that was the reason they were not at the restaurant when Officer Hanwell and Harr arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The parties stipulated at trial that Harr\u2019s license was under suspension on December 14, 1990. Harr raised the affirmative defense of necessity pursuant to R.C. 4507.02(E), claiming that she drove in response to an emergency. She appeals the jury\u2019s guilty verdict raising five assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Assignment of Error I</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">\u201cThe trial court erred when it overruled defendant-appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss on the grounds that her statutory right to a speedy trial had been violated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">Harr contends that she was not brought to trial within the time restraints imposed by R.C. 2945.71, and therefore the court erred in not granting her motion to dismiss the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">R.C. 2945.71(B)(2) mandates that a person charged with a first or second degree misdemeanor be brought to trial within ninety days of his arrest or summons. However, R.C. 2945.72 enumerates those circumstances in which an extension in this time limit is permitted and not chargeable to the time between arrest and the start of trial. See <em>Akron v. Couchois </em>(July 18, 1990), Summit App. No. 14415, unreported, at 3-7, 1990 WL 102417.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">Harr was cited for driving under a suspended license on December 4, 1990. Her trial was originally set to begin on February 14, 1991, but was continued because another case proceeded to jury trial on that date. The court, <em>sua sponte, </em>rescheduled Harr\u2019s trial for April 16, 1991, which was one hundred twenty-three days after she was cited, and thirty-three days past the speedy trial requirements. Because no portion of the one hundred twenty-three days is chargeable to Harr in causing the delay, the only issue is whether the delay was excusable under any other provision of R.C. 2945.72.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">In <em>State v. Lee </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St.2d 208, 2 O.O.3d 392, 357 N.E.2d 1095, the Ohio Supreme Court recognized a trial court\u2019s crowded docket as a reasonable basis necessitating a continuance under R.C. 2945.72(H). Since <em>Lee, </em>the court has held that a trial court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>continuance beyond the statutory time limits is not a basis for dismissal if the \u201ctrial record affirmatively demonstrates the necessity for a continuance and the reasonableness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>thereof.\u201d <em>Aurora v. Patrick </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 107, 109, 15 O.O.3d 150, 151, 399 N.E.2d 1220, 1221. In order for the continuance to fall within the ambit of R.C. 2945.72(H), the trial court must: (1) record the continuance through its journal entry prior to the expiration of the speedy trial requirements, (2) identify the party to be charged with the continuance, and (3) briefly indicate the reasons requiring the continuance. <em>State v. Reuschling </em>(1986), 30 Ohio App.3d 81, 82-83, 30 OBR 138, 139, 506 N.E.2d 558, 559. See, also, <em>State v. Mincy </em>(1982), 2 Ohio St.3d 6, 2 OBR 282, 441 N.E.2d 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">In the present case, the trial court\u2019s journal entry dated February 14, 1991, satisfied all of these requirements. The court\u2019s entry gave as the basis of the delay \u201ca previously scheduled case * * * went forward to a jury.\u201d The entry stated that the continuance was not chargeable to Harr and ordered the case \u201creset as the number one jury trial on the next available open jury date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Harr argues the court\u2019s journal entry did not adequately demonstrate the reasonableness of the continuance. She claims that rescheduling the case for the next open jury date is unreasonable unless the court demonstrates that a sooner date, as a result of later changes in the court\u2019s docket, is not available. This claim is without merit. The court cannot anticipate future changes in its docket and then be expected to journalize a record of whether any changes have in fact occurred. We find nothing inherently unreasonable in using the next open trial date as the length of the continuance. Whether it is in fact unreasonable depends on the \u201cpeculiar facts and circumstances\u201d of each case. <em>State v. Saffell </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 90, 91, 518 N.E.2d 934, 935. In this case Harr has not demonstrated any prejudice resulting from the court\u2019s continuance, and we find the purpose and necessity for the delay were reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Harr\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">Assignments of Error II and III</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-9\">\u201cII. The trial court erred when it overruled defendant-appellant\u2019s objection to improper comments made by the prosecuting attorney during final argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-10\">\u201cHI. The trial court erred in its charge to the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">In her defense Harr claimed that she drove under a suspended driver\u2019s license in response to an emergency situation and therefore her conduct is excused pursuant to R.C. 4507.02(E), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-12\">\u201cIt is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought pursuant to division (B), (C), or (D) of this section that the alleged offender drove under suspension or in violation of a restriction because of a substantial emergency, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>provided that no other person was reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">In raising this necessity defense, the accused has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that: (1) there was a \u201csubstantial emergency,\u201d and (2) the urgency of the circumstances made it necessary for him to drive at the time and place in question because no other driver was available. See <em>Oregon v. Haley </em>(1983), 64 Ore.App. 209, 211-212, 667 P.2d 560, 561-562.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The issue presented by Harr is what standard should be adopted in determining what constitutes a \u201csubstantial emergency\u201d as used in the first part of this defense. In closing argument the prosecution used an objective standard, defining an emergency in terms of what a reasonable person would believe to be an emergency. The court in its jury instruction went further, and defined a \u201csubstantial emergency\u201d as \u201ca real and then existing unforeseen combination of circumstances that call for immediate action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Harr argues that this instruction incorrectly placed a burden on her to prove that the emergency was, in hindsight, real. She claims the jury was thus directed to reject her affirmative defense unless it found from the evidence that an actual emergency existed. Harr analogizes the affirmative defense provided under R.C. 4507.02(E) to self-defense, contending that the correct standard is a subjective one. . She asserts that the jury should have been instructed to decide, based on the evidence, whether she sincerely believed an emergency existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">We disagree with Harr\u2019s interpretation of this statute and her attempt to analogize two completely different defenses. The affirmative defense of self-defense is applicable to specific intent crimes, in which the defense, once established, negates the purposefulness of the defendant\u2019s actions in causing the harm. Under such circumstances the honesty of the accused\u2019s belief that he is threatened with imminent harm, coupled with the reasonableness of that belief for a person with similar mental and physical capacities, is decisive in determining the accused\u2019s intent. See <em>State v. Cope </em>(1946), 78 Ohio App. 429, 436-437, 34 O.O.171, 174, 67 N.E.2d 912, 916; 28 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (1981) 270-271, 345-346, Criminal Law, Sections 1740 and 1817.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">In contrast, this offense, R.C. 4507.02(B)(1), is a strict liability crime. When a statute reads, \u201cno person shall * * *\u201d commit the proscribed conduct, absent any reference to the required mental state of the accused, the statute indicates a legislative intent to impose strict liability for the commission of the prohibited act. <em>State v. Cheraso </em>(1988), 43 Ohio App.3d 221, 223, 540 N.E.2d 326, 328-329. R.C. 2901.21(B). Therefore, unlike self-defense, the defense of necessity provided by R.C. 4507.02(E) does not negate any required culpable mental state as an element of the crime. Instead, this defense provides the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>only exception to the strict liability imposed for driving with a suspended license. Presumably the defense exists because the legislature recognized that under certain circumstances it is preferable to permit a person to drive in response to an emergency, such as an auto accident, than to refrain from driving because of the suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">In creating this exception to an otherwise strict liability offense, the legislature set forth the condition that the emergency be \u201csubstantial.\u201d \u201cSubstantial\u201d is defined as \u201c[b]elonging to substance; actually existing; real; * * * true; veritable.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6 Ed.1990) 1428. By legislative decree, words and phrases shall be construed according to their common usage. R.C. 1.42. Regardless of the policy implications, plain and unambiguous language may not be ignored. <em>Bd. of Edn. v. Fulton Cty. Budget Comm. </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St.2d 147, 156, 70 O.O.2d 300, 305, 324 N.E.2d 566, 571. Accordingly, we find, in using the words \u201csubstantial emergency,\u201d the legislature expressed an intent that the necessity defense for driving under a restricted license be available only when the emergency exists in fact. Additionally, this construction conforms with the legislative intent to impose strict liability for the offenses listed in R.C. 4507.02. Accepting Harr's position, basing the defense on the sincerity of the accused\u2019s belief that an actual emergency exists, runs the risk that the prohibited conduct might be swallowed up by the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Therefore, the correct definition of \u201csubstantial emergency\u201d is those unforeseen combination of factors which exist in fact and which a reasonable person would perceive as an emergency requiring an immediate response. The second part of the necessity defense still requires the accused to present evidence that no other person was available to drive in response to the emergency. That is lacking in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Based on the foregoing analysis, there was no error in the prosecutor\u2019s closing statement or in the jury instructions. Harr\u2019s second and third assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">Assignments of Error IV and V</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">\u201cIV. The jury\u2019s verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">\u201cV. The trial court erred when it overruled appellant\u2019s Crim.R. 29 motions for a judgment of acquittal made at the end of the state\u2019s case and at the end of all the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">In her last two assignments of error, Harr urges us to find that the jury verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence. From the outset it should be realized that there is no question that the state presented sufficient credible evidence supporting Harr\u2019s conviction. It was stipulated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>that Harr\u2019s driver\u2019s license was under suspension, and the evidence was uncontroverted that she did drive. The only issue was whether Harr made out her defense of necessity by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">A manifest-weight argument requires the reviewing court to weight the evidence in total and decide whether the jury\u2019s verdict was clearly erroneous. <em>Tibbs v. Florida </em>(1982), 457 U.S. 31, 42, 102 S.Ct. 2211, 2218, 72 L.Ed.2d 652, 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">\u201cThe court, reviewing the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses and determines whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\u201d <em>State v. Martin </em>(1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 20 OBR 215, 219, 485 N.E.2d 717, 720.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">In reviewing the evidence we fail to find that the jury \u201clost its way\u201d in rejecting Harr\u2019s necessity defense. Harr failed to establish an essential element of her defense, that her driving was the only means available in responding to the perceived emergency. Additionally, the evidence demonstrated that not only was there no actual emergency, but that there was no sense of urgency on Harr\u2019s part in responding to the emergency. After being summoned by her friend, Harr stopped approximately one-half mile from her destination to put gas in her car. In total, the evidence supports the jury\u2019s verdict in rejecting Harr\u2019s defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">The fifth and sixth assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">Having overruled all of Harr\u2019s assignments of error, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b283-11\">Cacioppo, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b283-12\">Quillin, P.J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
