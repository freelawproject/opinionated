O\u2019Neill II, was involved in a high-speed chase with another car. The chase ended when the two cars collided. Both drivers were arrested by the Akron Police Department. O\u2019Neill was indicted on one count of aggravated vehicular assault, in violation of R.C. 2903.08.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">The state presented the testimony of seven witnesses. Of the seven witnesses, four were witnesses to the chase or crash. At the close of the state\u2019s case, O\u2019Neill moved for acquittal pursuant to Crim.R. 29. The court denied this motion. The jury found O\u2019Neill guilty as charged. O\u2019Neill appeals, raising one assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-12\">Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b338-13\">\u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of the defendant-appellant in denying his motion for acquittal made at the close of the State\u2019s case since the State had failed to present sufficient evidence as to the element of serious physical harm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-14\">O\u2019Neill asserts that the trial court erred by denying his Crim.R. 29 motion because the state failed to present sufficient evidence on a material element of the crime charged. We agree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-15\">O\u2019Neill was charged with violating R.C. 2903.08, which states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-16\">\u201c(A) No person, while operating or participating in the operation of a motor vehicle * * * shall recklessly cause serious physical harm of the type described in division (E)(2) or (5) of section 2901.01 of the Revised Code to another person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-17\">The state limited its argument to presenting evidence of serious physical harm as described in R.C. 2901.01(E)(2), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>\u201c(E) \u2018Serious physical harm to persons\u2019 means any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">\u201c(2) Any physical harm which carries a substantial risk of death[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">The state failed to introduce sufficient evidence on the essential element of causing \u201cserious physical harm,\u201d as defined in R.C. 2901.01(E)(2). The evidence presented at trial failed to demonstrate any physical harm which carries a substantial risk of death. The following colloquy is illustrative of the testimony on this element:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-8\">\u201cQ. [BY MS. BANDY:] And did anybody have any injuries, Mr. Matusicky?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-9\">\u201cA. Yes, My daughter had a cut on her forehead above her eye.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-10\">\u201cQ. How old is your daughter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-11\">\u201cA. Excuse me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-12\">\u201cQ. How old is your daughter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-13\">\u201cA. She\u2019s five.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-14\">\u201cQ. Okay. And how old is your son that was in the car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-15\">\u201cA. My son is seven.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-16\">\u201cQ. Did he have any injuries?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-17\">\u201cA. No, he did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-18\">\u201cQ. What about your wife?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-19\">\u201cA. No, she did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-20\">\u201cQ. What about yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-21\">\u201cA. Yes, I had stitches. I thought actually I broke my nose because I just felt blood coming out my nose. It was two cuts along my cheek and bottom of my nose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-22\">This evidence is insufficient to prove the essential element of causing serious physical harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-23\">The state failed to prove an essential element of the crime charged. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion by denying O\u2019Neill\u2019s motion for acquittal at the close of the state\u2019s case. The assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-24\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-25\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b339-26\">Quillin, P.J., and Cook, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
