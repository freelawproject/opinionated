Pace, $5,000 in attorney fees. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-13\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b146-14\">The case at bar commenced with Starinki\u2019s complaint wherein he alleged that Pace had perjured himself in a previous case between the parties by testifying that he had made a withholding tax payment to the Internal Revenue Service on behalf of Starinki\u2019s business. An amended complaint was also based upon Pace\u2019s testimony. Pace responded by filing a counterclaim sounding in malicious prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-15\">Starinki voluntarily dismissed his action the day before trial, following the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for a continuance. The case proceeded to trial on Pace\u2019s counterclaim and the court found in Pace\u2019s favor, awarding him $5,000 in attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-16\">Assignments of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b146-17\">\u2018T. The trial court erred by awarding defendant-appellee $5,000.00 in attorneys fees absent statutory authority and/or an award of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>\u201cII. The trial court erred by awarding defendant-appellee $5,000.00 in attorneys fees because defendant-appellee presented insufficient evidence that said fees were incurred by defendant-appellee and were reasonable and necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">\u201cIII. The trial court erred by finding in favor of the defendant-appellee on his counterclaim for malicious prosecution because there had not been a termination in defendant-appellee\u2019s favor of plaintiff-appellant\u2019s lawsuit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">As these assignments of error are interrelated, they will be addressed together.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Pace\u2019s counterclaim alleged that Starinki filed the case at bar which \u201ccontains untrue facts\u201d to \u201charass and damage the defendant,\u201d and that as a result of \u201cthis malicious action\u201d his reputation and credit would be damaged and he would incur attorney fees. Pace\u2019s counterclaim appears to sound in malicious prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">The four essential elements of malicious prosecution are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-9\">\u201c(1) malicious institution of prior proceedings * * *; (2) lack of probable cause for the filing of the prior lawsuit * * *; (3) termination of the prior proceedings in plaintiff\u2019s favor * * *; and (4) seizure of plaintiff\u2019s person or property during the course of the prior proceedings * * *[.]\u201d <em>Crawford v. Euclid Natl. Bank </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 135, 139, 19 OBR 341, 345, 483 N.E.2d 1168, 1171.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">In the case at bar, Pace simply did not produce evidence as to all of these elements. There was no evidence that Starinki acted maliciously in filing his complaint, nor was there an indication as to a lack of probable cause for doing so. Further, there was no adjudication in Pace\u2019s favor on Starinki\u2019s complaint, as Starinki exercised his right to voluntarily dismiss pursuant to Civ.R. 41. Based upon this conclusion, Pace was not entitled to damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">In addition to failing to prove his claim for malicious prosecution, Pace also failed to establish a right to attorney fees. The general rule in Ohio, in the absence of an applicable statute, is that a party is not entitled to attorney fees unless the other party proceeded in bad faith. <em>State ex rel. Kabatek v. Stackhouse </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 55, 55-56, 6 OBR 73, 73-74, 451 N.E.2d 248, 248-249. Ohio adheres to the \u201cAmerican Rule\u201d which does not permit the prevailing party to recover attorney fees, in the absence of statutory authority, as part of the costs of litigation. <em>Sorin v. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St.2d 177, 179, 75 O.O.2d 224, 225, 347 N.E.2d 527, 528-529. As this was Starinki\u2019s first dismissal of this cause of action, and the dismissal was taken pursuant to the right to voluntarily dismiss without penalty or sanction granted by Civ.R. 41(A)(1)(a), we do not believe that Pace was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>entitled to attorney fees as costs. See <em>Campbell v. Gallimore </em>(1990), 70 Ohio App.3d 342, 591 N.E.2d 1; <em>Sorin, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The appellant\u2019s assignments of error have merit. The judgment of the trial court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b148-7\">Cook, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b148-8\">Baird, P.J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
