Wheeler, employee-appellee, for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Wheeler\u2019s original application was disallowed by a district hearing officer in Akron on the grounds that the injury was not sustained during the course of employment. The Canton Regional Board of Review reached a contrary conclusion. This latter decision was affirmed by the Industrial Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">Wheeler\u2019s employer, Tamarkin Company, appealed to the court of common pleas on May 25, 1990. R.C. 4123.519. The judge determined that Wheeler had stated a valid claim for benefits. Further review is now sought in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">The parties have stipulated to the following statement of facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-12\">\u201cOn May 21,1988, the Plaintiff, Eric S. Wheeler, was employed as a baker\u2019s apprentice at the Giant Eagle Grocery Store. The Giant Eagle Grocery was owned and operated by the Defendant, The Tamarkin Company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-13\">\u201cOn May 21, 1988, the Plaintiff reported for work at 12 o\u2019clock a.m. He was scheduled to work from 12 o\u2019clock a.m. until 8 o\u2019clock a.m. He drove himself to work that day in his 1979 Jeep CJ7. He parked the jeep in the store parking lot and reported for work. The store parking lot is utilized by store patrons, employees and mass transit commuters. He punched his time card in the time clock and proceeded to carry on his normal work activities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-14\">\u201cSometime during the Plaintiff\u2019s shift his jeep was vandalized. At approximately 6:45 A.M. the plaintiff went to his jeep and ascertained that it had been vandalized. He neither punched out at the time clock nor was he told by his supervisor that he could go out and inspect the damage. While inspecting the damage he attempted to move a broken outside rear view <em>[sic </em>] mirror so that he could more easily enter the jeep. Upon doing so he lacerated the flexor tendon of his right little finger and the extensor tendon of his right middle finger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>\u201cAfter lacerating his right hand he then went back in to the store and reported the incident to the store co-manager. He was then taken to the hospital by his father, who was also employed by Giant Eagle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Tamarkin raises a single assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">\u201cThe trial court committed prejudicial error as a matter of law by granting plaintiff-appellee, Eric S. Wheeler, the right to participate in the Ohio Worker\u2019s Compensation Fund as the agreed statement of facts demonstrates that he did not sustain an injury in the course of and arising out of his employment as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">A compensable \u201cinjury\u201d must be \u201creceived in the course of, and arising out of, the injured employee\u2019s employment.\u201d R.C. 4123.01(C). The Supreme Court explained in <em>Bralley v. Daugherty </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 302, 303, 15 O.O.3d 359, 360, 401 N.E.2d 448, 449, that:</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">\u201cThe test of the right to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund is not whether there was any fault or neglect on the part of the employer or his employees, but whether a \u2018causal connection\u2019 existed between an employee\u2019s injury and his employment either through the activities, the conditions or the environment of the employment. * * *\u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">In an appeal of an Industrial Commission ruling pursuant to R.C. 4123.519, the court of common pleas conducts a trial <em>de novo </em>in which the burden of proof remains with the claimant. <em>Youghiogheny &amp; Ohio Coal Co. v. Mayfield </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 70, 71, 11 OBR 315, 316, 464 N.E.2d 133, 134; <em>Swift &amp; Co. v. Wreede </em>(1959), 110 Ohio App. 252, 254-255, 12 O.O.2d 240, 241-242, 168 N.E.2d 757, 759-760. Due to the parties\u2019 stipulation of fact, the only issue before the trial court was whether Wheeler\u2019s injury was sustained in the course of employment. An appellate court need not afford any special deference on such purely legal questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">\u201cThe purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is not to make an employer an absolute insurer of the employee\u2019s safety, but only to protect the employee against risks and hazards incident to the performance of his work.\u201d <em>Phelps v. Positive Action Tool Co. </em>(1986), 26 Ohio St.3d 142, 144, 26 OBR 122, 123, 497 N.E.2d 969, 970. The dual requirements that a compensable injury be \u201creceived in\u201d and \u201carising out of\u201d the course of employment have been combined into a \u201ccausal connection\u201d test. <em>Fisher v. Mayfield </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 275, 276-278, 551 N.E.2d 1271, 1273-1275. In <em>Lord v. Daugherty </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 441, 20 O.O.3d 376, 423 N.E.2d 96, syllabus, the court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>\u201cWhether there is a sufficient \u2018causal connection\u2019 between an employee\u2019s injury and his employment to justify the right to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund depends on the totality of the facts and circumstances surrounding the accident, including, (1) the proximity of the scene of the accident to the place of employment, (2) the degree of control the employer had over the scene of the accident, and (3) the benefit the employer received from the injured employee\u2019s presence at the scene of the accident.\u201d See, also, <em>MTD Products, Inc. v. Robatin </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 66, 70, 572 N.E.2d 661, 665.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Addressing the first prong, Wheeler\u2019s accident occurred, technically, at his place of employment. This circumstance must be tempered by the fact, however, that his duties as a baker\u2019s apprentice did not require him to be in the parking lot during working hours. The mere happenstance that an employee was injured on his employer\u2019s property, without more, is not sufficient to warrant benefits. See <em>Langenheim v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1927), 25 Ohio App. 1, 5, 158 N.E. 605, 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Turning to the second prong, it is readily apparent that Tamarkin\u2019s degree of control over the accident situs was minimal. We are at a loss to understand what the employer could have reasonably done to prevent Wheeler from cutting himself during the impromptu repair job. Cf. <em>Fisher, supra, </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 279, 551 N.E.2d at 1275.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Finally, we find that Tamarkin received <em>no </em>benefit whatsoever from Wheeler\u2019s activities in the parking lot. His attempt to repair his jeep was of his own doing and for his own interests. In <em>Kohlmayer v. Keller </em>(1970), 24 Ohio St.2d 10, 12, 53 O.O.2d 6, 7, 263 N.E.2d 231, 232, by contrast, the court reasoned that an employee injured at a company picnic was entitled to workers\u2019 compensation since his presence at the function, along with his co-workers, improved employee relations. Similarly, in <em>Fisher, supra, </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 279, 551 N.E.2d at 1275, the court noted that a teacher injured while collecting funds for a school related charity was providing her employer with \u201cheightened morale.\u201d No such benefit, real or intangible, was supplied in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">The trial court cites <em>Griffin v. Hydra-Matic Div., Gen. Motors Corp. </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 79, 529 N.E.2d 436, to support the determination that Wheeler is entitled to benefits. In that case, the employee slipped in the employer\u2019s driveway as she was heading to her car after work. The cause of the fall, \u201ca wet or icy spot,\u201d could have been remedied by the employer and was under its control. Moreover, the activity the employee was engaged in, walking to her car, was necessary to her job, thereby benefiting the employer. <em>Griffin </em>is therefore entirely distinguishable from the instant dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Any relationship between Wheeler\u2019s injury and Tamarkin was purely fortuitous. Cutting one\u2019s hand on a broken rearview mirror is not a risk incident to the duties of a baker\u2019s apprentice. <em>Phelps, supra. </em>The combined facts that (1) the vandal chose the Giant Eagle parking lot as the scene of the crime, and (2) Wheeler decided to attempt the hazardous repair during his working hours, are not sufficient to justify participation in the Worker\u2019s Compensation Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">This assignment of error is sustained. The judgment of the court of common pleas is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b268-9\">Cacioppo, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b268-10\">Quillin, P.J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b268-11\">Quillin, P.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AAk\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-12\">Because I believe, as did the trial judge, that <em>Griffin v. Hydra-Matic Div., Gen. Motors Corp. </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 79, 529 N.E.2d 436, controls, I must dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
