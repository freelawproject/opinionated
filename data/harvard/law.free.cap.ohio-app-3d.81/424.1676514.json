Because we find that under the language of the insurance policy at issue the employer-insurer was not entitled to recover from its insured, we reverse the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">Appellant is Jackie Ann Keegan who, in 1986, was an employee of appellee Allied Moulded Products, Inc. As a result of her employment, appellant and appellant\u2019s family were insured under appellee\u2019s \u201cGroup Health Plan.\u201d Appellee, Allied Moulded Products, Inc., was a self-insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">In October 1986, appellant and her son were injured in an automobile accident due to the negligence of an uninsured driver. Appellee, pursuant to its insurance policy for the group health plan, paid approximately $11,000 of appellant\u2019s $12,000 medical and associated expenses. Although no recovery was had from the uninsured tortfeasor, appellant did receive $50,000 as the result of uninsured/underinsured coverage provided by her automobile insurance with State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">Appellee asserted that because of the terms of the subrogation clause of its group health plan policy it was entitled to reimbursement out of the funds appellant received from State Farm for the monies it had expended on appellant\u2019s medical expenses. Appellee demanded payment, but appellant refused. Appellee then brought suit against appellant to recover the $11,000. Appellant answered by denying liability under the policy. Both parties moved for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-12\">On August 20, 1991, the trial court entered its decision on the motions, granting summary judgment to appellee and denying same to appellant. From this order appellant perfected this appeal asserting a single assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-13\">\u201cThe trial court erred in granting Plaintiff-Appellee\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment requiring Defendant-Appellant to subrogate Appellee for a first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>party insurance recovery when Appellee only required subrogation, in its self-insiirance program, from the Appellant for third party recoveries.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">The rules governing motions for summary judgment pursuant to Civ.R. 56 are well established. Three factors must be demonstrated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\">\u201c(1) that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact; (2) that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, who is entitled to have the evidence construed most strongly in his favor.\u201d <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 66, 8 O.O.3d 73, 74, 375 N.E.2d 46, 47.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The parties agree on the material facts in this matter. The only question is whether the subrogation clause of appellee\u2019s group health plan requires, as a matter of law, that appellant reimburse appellee out of monies she received from her uninsured/underinsured motorists coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">The contractual provisions upon which appellee based its claim are (1) a clause titled \u201cReimbursement Provisions,\u201d and (2) a rider entitled \u201cMiscellaneous Provisions,\u201d which essentially follows the language of the \u201cReimbursement Provision.\u201d The \u201cReimbursement Provision\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1x\">\u201cReimbursement Provision</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-8\">\u201cIf you or your covered dependent incurs covered medical expenses due to sickness or accidental injury that was caused by the act or omission of another person, you or your covered dependent must\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-9\">\u201creimburse the Plan or it\u2019s [sic] assignees for the amount of benefits provided, immediately upon collection of damages, whether by settlement, judgement, or otherwise, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-10\">\u201cprovide the Plan or its assignee with a lien and order directing reimbursement of covered medical benefits provided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-11\">\u201cThe lien and order may be filed with the person whose act caused the sickness or injury, his or her agent, the court, or your or your covered dependent\u2019s attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-12\">\u201cA representative of the Plan or its assignee shall have the right to intervene in any suit or other proceedings to protect the reimbursement rights under this Plan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-13\">The language of the rider is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-14\">\u201cMISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-15\">\u201c(Applicable only to Basic Health and Major Medical Coverage)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-16\">\u201cActs of Third Parties</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>\u201cIf a covered person is injured through the act or omission of another person, the Plan shall provide the benefits available only on the condition that the covered person shall agree in writing:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-4\">\u201c(a) to reimburse the Plan to the extent of benefits provided, immediately upon collection of damages by him, whether by legal action, settlement, or otherwise, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">\u201c(b) to provide the Plan with an Assignment of Benefits, to the extent of benefits provided under the Plan. The Assignment of Benefits shall be filed with the person whose act caused the injuries, his insurer, the court, or the provider of the services.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Appellant raised several arguments before the trial court. First, appellant argued that the contractual provisions in question clearly contemplate reimbursement from funds paid by third parties. State Farm was a first-party payor; therefore, no reimbursement was required. Second, appellant emphasized that compensation was not received from a tortfeasor as contemplated in the policy but from appellant\u2019s own insurance carrier. Therefore, appellant maintained no reimbursement was required. Finally, appellant contended that the $50,000 received from State Farm was for appellant\u2019s pain and suffering only. And, for that reason, appellant was not required to reimburse appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">The trial court rejected all of appellant\u2019s arguments stating, \u201c * * * the source of [appellant\u2019s] recovery is immaterial, whether it is from the tortfeasor personally, the insurance carrier of the tortfeasor or the employee\u2019s insurance carrier from uninsured motorist coverage. The [appellant] was obligated to rimburse [sic] the plan upon collection of damages by legal action, settlement <em>or otherwise.\u201d </em>(Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">While, as appellant properly points out, insurance policies should be construed liberally in favor of the insured, <em>Gibbons v. Metro. Life Ins. Co. </em>(1939), 135 Ohio St. 481, 486, 14 O.O. 387, 389-390, 21 N.E.2d 588, 591, these policies are contracts and the purpose of contract construction is to effectuate the intent of the parties. <em>Skivolocki v. East Ohio Gas Co. </em>(1974), 38 Ohio St.2d 244, 67 O.O.2d 321, 313 N.E.2d 374, at paragraph one of the syllabus. Where a contract contains ambiguous words or terms, courts will determine the meaning of these terms, <em>Mr. Mark Corp. v. Rush, Inc. </em>(1983), 11 Ohio App.3d 167, 169, 11 OBR 259, 261, 464 N.E.2d 586, 589, common words appearing in a written instrument are to be given their plain and ordinary meaning. <em>Alexander v. Buckeye Pipeline Co. </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 241, 7 O.O.3d 403, 374 N.E.2d 146, at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">Purged of its surplusage, the contract clause at issue provides, \u201cIf you * * * incur[] covered medical expenses * * * caused by the act * * * of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>another * * * you * * * must reimburse the plan * * * for the amount of benefits provided * * * upon collection of damages, whether by settlement, judgement, or otherwise * * The trial court mistakenly focused on the last six words of this clause and concluded that the parties had agreed to reimbursement of monies received from any source. In fact the event which precipitates reimbursement to the plan is not the receipt of monies, but the receipt of specific monies: damages.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-5\">\u201cDamages\u201d is not defined in the policy. The rules of construction then dictate we give the word its plain and ordinary meaning. \u201cDamages,\u201d in the plural, is defined as \u201ccompensation in money imposed by law for loss * * *,\u201d Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary (9 Ed.1990) 323, and \u201c[mjonetary compensation that may be recovered in court by someone who has suffered injury * * * through an unlawful act or omission of another.\u201d Statsky, West\u2019s Legal Thesaurus and Dictionary (1985) 206. This court has stated, \u201c \u2018[damages\u2019 has been defined as the pecuniary compensation paid by a wrongdoer for the losses suffered by an injured person.\u201d <em>Meek v. Gem Boat Service, Inc. </em>(1990), 69 Ohio App.3d 404, 409, 590 N.E.2d 1296, 1299, citing <em>Cincinnati v. Hafer </em>(1892), 49 Ohio St. 60, 67, 30 N.E. 197, 199; <em>Greer v. Knox Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1927), 33 Ohio App. 539, 169 N.E. 709; <em>Drayton v. Jiffee Chem. Corp. </em>(N.D.Ohio 1975), 395 F.Supp. 1081.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Our examination of each of the definitions of \u201cdamages\u201d reveals that it is contemplated there be a tortious activity and that the tortfeasor, by operation of law, be liable to the injured party. This definition is consistent with our reading of the disputed clause in its totality. There is nothing in the language of the clause which indicates that appellee intended to seek reimbursement from any person or entity other than a tortfeasor or the tortfeasor\u2019s insurer. Thus, the monies appellant received from her own insurer were not \u201cdamages\u201d subject to reimbursement to appellee. It was simply a monetary payment made pursuant to an independent contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Appellee asserts that to allow appellant to keep benefits from both appellee\u2019s policy and appellant\u2019s uninsured coverage would amount to double recovery. However, it is by no means clear that this is true. Even if this did amount to double recovery, we are not aware of any overarching policy which would proscribe the acceptance of benefits from two insurance policies where one has contracted for and paid separately for each.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>Grange Mut. Cos. Co. v. Lindsey </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 153, 22 OBR 228, 489 N.E.2d 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>In conclusion, there are no issues of material fact in this case. Following the standards set forth in <em>Harless, supra, </em>one of the parties was entitled to judgment as a matter of law, but that party was appellant rather than appellee. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">On consideration whereof, the court finds substantial justice has not been done the party complaining. Pursuant to App.R. 12(B), the judgment of the Williams County Court of Common Pleas is reversed and summary judgment is entered in favor of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b461-7\">Abood and Melvin L. Resnick, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b460-8\">. The record does not show whether appellee's group health plan required any payment by employees, but even if none were required, the coverage was provided as part of the employee\u2019s compensation package and, therefore, valid consideration exists.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
