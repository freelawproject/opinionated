Pastorious\u2019 (n.k.a. Rounds) motion to modify a previous order for child support, and for an order requiring appellant to reimburse appellee for one half of the medical expenses incurred for the minor children.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">In early 1986 the parties hereto were granted a divorce by the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. Appellant was ordered to pay child support in the amount of $40 per week for each of the parties\u2019 two minor children. Additionally, appellant was required to maintain health insurance coverage on the children, with any uninsured medical expenses to be divided equally between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">The record reflects that from the date of divorce through the initiation of this action, appellant remained current on his child support payments and, though insurance coverage on the children was maintained, appellant was never presented with any uninsured medical bills for purposes of his one-half reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">On October 1, 1991, pursuant to R.C. 3115.32, appellee filed a \u201cRegistration of Foreign Support Order\u201d with the Union County Court of Common Pleas and appellant was duly served with notice of said registration. On November 15, 1991, appellee filed a \u201cMotion for Modification of Order for Support\u201d based on a change in circumstances. Therein appellee also requested an order requiring appellant to reimburse her for one half of the medical expenses incurred for the minor children. Attached to the motion was a list of medical expenses, apparently compiled from check stubs dating back to 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">In appellant\u2019s memorandum contra appellee\u2019s motion, he argued that modification was not within the court\u2019s jurisdiction in an action filed under Ohio\u2019s version of the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (\u201cURESA\u201d). The case was heard by the trial court and, on December 13, 1991, the court ruled that it had jurisdiction under R.C. 3115.01 <em>et seq. </em>to modify a foreign support order, as part of the powers vested to enforce the support obligation of a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">Thereafter, in a judgment entered January 21, 1992, the court modified appellant\u2019s child support obligation, calculating pursuant to R.C. 3113.215, from $40 to $71.07 per week for each minor child. The court also ordered appellant to reimburse appellee in the amount of $1,708.94, as his one-half share of past uninsured medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">Appellant now appeals from the foregoing judgment, posing the following two assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b437-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Assignment of Error No. 1</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">\u201cThe court committed error when it determined that the registration of a foreign support order, pursuant to O.R.C. 3115.32, allowed the court to increase child support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">By this assignment of error appellant contends that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to increase the \u201cregistered\u201d foreign child support order. However, for reasons far more fundamental than those that appellant proposes, we find that the trial court not only lacked jurisdiction to increase the support award but, because the statutory provision expressly permitting \u201cinter-county\u201d URESA actions was explicitly repealed, the matter was improvidently brought before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Both the \u201cUniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act\u201d of 1950, as amended in 1952 and 1958, and the \u201cRevised Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act\u201d of 1968, contain similar provisions allowing for application of the Act to \u201cinter-county\u201d or \u201cintrastate\u201d matters. See 9B Uniform Laws Annotated 553, \u201cURESA\u201d of 1950, 601, Section 32; and 9B Uniform Laws Annotated 381, \u201cRURESA\u201d of 1968, 535, Section 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">In Am.H.B. No. 504, effective Oct. 27,1971, the Ohio legislature substantially enlarged Ohio\u2019s version of URESA, found in R.C. Chapter 3115. The legislation included the addition of R.C. 3115.32, a provision allowing an obligee the alternative enforcement remedy of registering a foreign support order in a court of this state. R.C. 3115.32 provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-8\">\u201c(A) If a duty of support is based on a foreign support order, the obligee has the additional remedies provided in this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-9\">\u201c(B) The obligee may register the foreign support order in a court of this state in the manner, with the effect, and for the purposes provided in this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-11\">\u201c(G) Upon registration the registered foreign support order shall be treated in the same manner as a support order issued by a court of this state. It has the same effect and is subject to the same procedures, defenses, and proceedings for reopening, vacation, or staying as a support order of this state and may be enforced and satisfied in like manner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-12\">R.C. 3115.05, the \u201cjurisdictional\u201d provision, became R.C. 3115.08 and was amended to provide, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-13\">\u201c(A) All duties of support, including the duty to pay arrearages, are enforceable by a proceeding under sections 3115.01 to 3115.34, inclusive, of the Revised Code, including a proceeding for civil contempt. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>\u201c(B) Jurisdiction of all proceedings under sections 3115.01 to 3115.22, inclusive, of the Revised Code, is vested in any trial court of record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Also included in the 1971 legislation was R.C. 3115.30, a provision, modeled after Section 33 of \u201cRURESA,\u201d <em>supra, </em>which authorized application of the traditionally \u201cinterstate\u201d URESA to actions of an \u201cintrastate\u201d nature. R.C. 3115.30 provided, in pertinent, part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-6\">\u201cSections 3115.01 to 3115.34, inclusive, of the Revised Code apply when both the obligee and the obligor are in this state, but in different counties. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aac\">However, effective June 29, 1988, the Ohio legislature explicitly repealed R.C. 3115.30 in order to <em>\u201celiminate intrastate use of URESA.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) See Am.Sub.H.B. No. 242. (142 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3038.)</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellee attempts an \u201cintrastate use of URESA\u201d by registering her Franklin County support order in the Union County Court of Common Pleas, under the guise that there is a \u201cduty of support\u201d based on a foreign support order, and she is registering the foreign support order \u201cin a court of this state.\u201d See R.C. 3115.32(A) and (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">We hold that appellee\u2019s attempt to utilize R.C. 3115.32 in a strictly intrastate action is improper under the law as it now stands. When R.C. 3115.30 was the law in Ohio, it expressly encompassed all of R.C. Chapter 3115. Thus, with the explicit repeal of R.C. 3115.30, logic dictates that neither R.C. 3115.32 nor 3115.08 should now be construed to permit exactly that for which the legislature rescinded its authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">The propriety of our interpretation is supported by the legislature\u2019s choice of \u201cinterstate\u201d nomenclature found throughout R.C. Chapter 3115, including the relevant guideline for statutory construction,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and indirectly by the fact that URESA registration is rarely utilized in interstate actions, let alone in the intrastate enforcement of support orders. The remarks that appellee\u2019s counsel gave at the close of the hearing are especially revealing on this point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1r\">\u201cI\u2019d like to state one more thing for the record, if I may, Judge. I want the Court to understand, in the event you find out you don\u2019t have jurisdiction on the support, that I don\u2019t know the answer to the question. I\u2019m submitting to you what I think is the answer, and what I think controls, and I\u2019m doing that on the basis of the fact that it was done to me in Franklin County, but that doesn\u2019t mean it was right, so I just didn\u2019t want you to think that \u2014 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AmX\">The case in which the trial court primarily relied upon in this matter was <em>Cochenour v. Bradley </em>(Nov. 8, 1988), Logan App. No. 8-87-13, unreported, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>1988 WL 122509. <em>Cochenour </em>was a URESA action, dealing solely with the availability of the laches defense, where we expressed doubts as to the applicability of R.C. 3115.01 <em>et seq. </em>to \u201cinter-county\u201d support actions. Unfortunately, as this issue was not sufficiently expounded upon, we find it necessary to modify our ruling in <em>Cochenour </em>to the extent that it is inconsistent with our opinion herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The other recent case dealing with the application of R.C. Chapter 3115 to \u201cinter-county\u201d matters is <em>Nardone v. Nardone </em>(1989), 63 Ohio App.3d 798, 580 N.E.2d 448. Paragraph one of the <em>Nardone </em>headnotes reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">\u201cCourt of Common Pleas located in Medina County where both husband and wife had moved after dissolution of marriage, had jurisdiction to enforce Cuyahoga County court\u2019s support order after wife filed the order in Medina County, despite husband\u2019s claim that statute provides for registration of foreign support order only when parties reside in separate counties or states. R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3115.08(B), 3115.09(A, B).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">After citing the statutory provisions mentioned at the end of the first headnote, the <em>Nardone </em>court\u2019s analysis consists of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-8\">\u201cSince Medina is the court of record, and Nancy [the obligee] filed the support order in the court located in the county in which she resides, that court cannot refuse jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 801, 580 N.E.2d at 449.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">Though we believe the analysis to be faulty and the result to be even more dubious, the ruling in <em>Nardone </em>is nevertheless factually distinguishable from the case <em>sub judice. </em>Notwithstanding the fact that the appellee in <em>Nardone </em>filed a \u201cPetition to Register a Foreign Support Order\u201d and the word \u201cregistration\u201d is frequently used, the court\u2019s analysis never refers to R.C. 3115.32. Rather, of the sections relied upon, R.C. 3115.08(B) provides that jurisdiction is vested in any trial court of record for proceedings under <em>R.C. 3115.01 to 3115.22, </em>and R.C. 3115.09(A) and (B) govern the contents of a <em>complaint </em>and where the complaint may be filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">As we find that the Union County Court of Common Pleas was without the statutory authority to initially \u201cregister\u201d a Franklin County support order pursuant to R.C. 3115.32, appellee\u2019s motion for \u201cRegistration of Foreign Support Order\u201d should have been dismissed. Thus, the trial court\u2019s ruling on appellee\u2019s motion for modification of support was void <em>ab initio. </em>Accordingly, the issue of whether a court of this state can modify a rendering state\u2019s support order, once it has been validly registered in this state, need not be addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">Therefore, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Assignment of Error No. 2</p>\n<p id=\"Aq9\">\u201cThe court committed error when Appellant was ordered to pay Appellee one half of her purported uninsured medical expenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Based on the above holding, it is clear that the trial court was also without the requisite subject matter jurisdiction in this circumstance to order appellant to pay one half of appellee\u2019s purported uninsured medical expenses. However, as the record reflects that appellant has fully reimbursed appellee for his share of the medical expenses, we find that the issue is rendered moot and appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Therefore, finding appellant\u2019s first assignment of error to be well taken, the judgment of the Union County Court of Common Pleas is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b440-8\">Thomas F. Bryant and Shaw, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b438-10\">. R.C. 3115.33 provides: \"Sections 3115.01 to 3115.34, inclusive, of the Revised Code shall be so construed as to effectuate the general purpose to make uniform the law of those states which enact a uniform reciprocal enforcement of support act.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
