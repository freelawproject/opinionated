Our previous holding was based upon an internal inconsistency in the court\u2019s journal entry wherein the court found \u201cthat the damages awarded by the jury in this case were inadequate and appear to have been given under the influence of passion or prejudice\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>that the judgment was \u201cnot sustained by the weight of the evidence,\u201d yet denied the motion for a new trial. <em>Bible v. Kerr </em>(1991), 81 Ohio App.3d 77, 610 N.E.2d 472.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Following our decision, the present appellant, Robert J. Kerr, Jr., appealed to the Supreme Court of Ohio. Kerr subsequently withdrew the appeal. Following this dismissal, the trial court ordered a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Assignments of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">\u201cI. The trial court erred and abused its discretion in ordering a new trial because it failed to made [sic] the necessary factual findings as required by Civil Rule 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">\u201cII. A presumption of validity attaches to a jury verdict and in the absence of any facts establishing prejudicial error, a trial court errs and abuses its discretion in granting a new trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">The appeal at bar presents this court with a unique situation wherein this court is requested essentially to reverse its previous holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">It is well recognized that the granting of a motion for a new trial rests in the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed upon review absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Verbon v. Pennese </em>(1982), 7 Ohio App.3d 182, 184, 7 OBR 229, 231, 454 N.E.2d 976, 979. The unique situation at bar, wherein this court stated that \u201cthe case is hereby reversed and remanded to the trial court for an order granting the appellant [Bible] a new trial,\u201d removed the exercise of discretion from the trial court. The ruling of this court left the trial court with no other option than to grant the new trial as mandated by this court. In the absence of any discretion, this court cannot contemplate how the court could have abused its discretion in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">While this court is certainly aware of, and sympathetic to, the frustration felt by the appellant, the court believes that the proper instrument through which to vent this frustration would have been through an appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio from this court\u2019s previous decision. The appellant voluntarily withdrew this appeal. Thus, the only option available to the appellant at this point is to proceed with a new trial, as previously ordered by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-12\">The assignments of error are not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-13\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-14\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b258-15\">Quillin, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b258-16\">Cook, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
