On March 20, 1991, the parties reached a settlement, which was entered on the record before the trial court. On April 23, 1991, appellee\u2019s complaint was dismissed with prejudice. This journal entry was signed by the court and attorneys for the parties. On April 29, 1991, appellee filed a motion to tax costs to appellants. On June 20, 1991, the trial court granted the motion to tax costs. Appellants appeal from this judgment, raising two assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Assignments of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">\u201cI. The trial court erred when it granted plaintiffs motion to tax costs to the defendant because the parties had entered into a prior binding settlement which precluded any further recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">\u201cII. The trial court erred in granting every item in plaintiffs motion to tax costs because certain costs, specifically depositions, are not to be taxed, as costs unless used at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The trial court granted appellee\u2019s motion to tax costs on June 20, 1991, almost two months <em>after </em>appellee\u2019s complaint was dismissed. When the complaint was dismissed, the cause of action terminated, as did the court\u2019s jurisdiction. As the court stated in <em>Goldstein v. Goldstein </em>(1988), 50 Ohio App.3d 4, 7, 552 N.E.2d 228, 231:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-7\">\u201cIn the final analysis, notwithstanding appellees\u2019 contention that the trial court retained jurisdiction to make the awards it made of costs and fees, the appellant\u2019s case ceased to exist at the moment she filed her notice of voluntary dismissal and the trial court was divested of jurisdiction in the matter. * * * \u201d See, also, <em>Clay Hyder Trucking Lines v. Riley </em>(1984), 16 Ohio App.3d 224, 225, 16 OBR 240, 241, 475 N.E.2d 183, 184 (after dismissal, \u201cno action remained pending before the court * * *.\u201d); <em>Torres v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>(1980), 68 Ohio App.2d 87, 91, 22 O.O.3d 99, 101, 427 N.E.2d 32, 35 (\u201cOnce appellants filed their notice of dismissal, no action remained pending before the court * * *.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">Further, the agreement reached by the parties was a settlement of <em>all </em>claims, as indicated from the following portion of the transcript:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-9\">\u201cMR. PERANTINIDES: May it please the Court,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-10\">\u201cCounsel:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-11\">\u201cYour Honor, let the record \u2014 the record should reflect that on behalf of the plaintiffs, Mr. and Mrs. Richard Ewing [Appellees] the Ewings have accepted the settlement offer of $190,000 in this case. And in addition to that, the defendants will pay for the professional witness fee of Dr. Ackerman whose deposition I took twice, as well as \u2014 which would normally be my cost \u2014 as well as Dr. Spitz. They took his deposition last week. That is their cost and they, of course, will pay that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-12\">\u201cThis is a settlement of all claims on behalf of Mr. and Mrs. Ewing, known and unknown, as between them and both of the \u2014 actually, four defendants: Mr. Henthorne, Dr. Henthorne individually; and his group, Summit County\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-13\">\u201cMR. TREADON: Summit Pathology Associates, Inc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>\u201cMR. PERANTINIDES: And Dr. Flickinger and the Akron Family Practice [Appellants]. That\u2019s it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: Is that your understanding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">\u201cMR. TREADON: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-7\">\u201cMR. AUGHENBAUGH: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">If appellees wanted something different than this, they should have indicated that and resolved the matter before the case was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">The trial court erred by granting appellee\u2019s motion to tax costs after the case had been dismissed. Appellants\u2019 first assignment of error is well taken. Based on our finding that the trial court erred by granting the motion, we do not need to address the second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">The judgment of the trial court granting costs is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b318-12\">Baird, P.J., and Reece, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
