Appellant pled guilty to the first conviction used to enhance his sentence without having counsel or being informed of his right to counsel. Appellant brought his claim of denial of the right to counsel before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>state courts, which denied relief. He then sought a writ of habeas corpus in the district court, which refused to grant relief. Appellant argues on appeal that he is due relief because he was denied counsel in the first drunken driving proceedings, under this circuit\u2019s holding in <em>Greene v. United States.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Alternately, he argues that his case should be remanded to allow him to show the indigency required for relief under <em>Baldasar v. Illinois.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We will discuss these claims in reverse order.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">I. Indigency</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">This court\u2019s decision in <em>Moore v. </em>Jarvis<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> precludes any relief to appellant on his claim that he was denied counsel because of his indigency. After conducting an analysis of the several concurring opinions in <em>Baldasar, Moore </em>held that <em>Baldasar </em>\u201cforbid[s] only the sentencing of a defendant to an increased term of incarceration solely upon consideration of a prior conviction obtained in a proceeding for which, due to the indigence of the defendant or some misconduct of the State, counsel was <em>unavailable </em>to the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court in <em>Moore </em>then denied relief because \u201cMoore has not alleged \u2014 let alone proven\u2014 that she was indigent at the respective times of her prior convictions or that the state somehow prevented her from obtaining the services of retained counsel.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The district court found that appellant had not proven his indigency at the time of the prior conviction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In fact, the record shows that appellant was selling mobile homes at the time of the first conviction and that his parents quickly came up with the $165 fine.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Appellant did not allege or show that the state prevented him from obtaining counsel.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Due to <em>Moore\u2019s </em>interpretation of <em>Baldasar, </em>no relief is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-17\">II. The Holding in <em>Greene</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-18\">In a somewhat confusing argument, appellant seems to maintain that there is a conflict between this circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>Moore </em>and our opinion in <em>Greene, </em>which states, \u201c[T]he Sixth Amendment prohibits the use to enhance a sentence of a conviction obtained in a proceeding in which defendant lacked the assistance of counsel.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The district court did not discuss <em>Greene.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-19\">Although the quoted language in <em>Greene </em>could be characterized as affording a basis for relief to appellant, it is apparent from our reading of other cases that it does not. <em>Greene </em>did not involve a situation where the sentence under attack was enhanced by a prior conviction for which there was no right to counsel. In the context of an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction, the Supreme Court in <em>Scott v. </em>Illinois<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> held that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is infringed only when a misdemeanor criminal defendant actually receives an uncoun-seled term of imprisonment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, <em>Greene </em>should be read more properly as forbidding the enhancement of a sentence on the basis of an uncounseled prior conviction for which there was the right to counsel. Moreover, binding precedent of this circuit allows the consideration during sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>tenting of uncounseled prior misdemeanor convictions for which a term of imprisonment was not imposed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Seen in this light, <em>Moore </em>and <em>Greene </em>are not at odds. <em>Moore </em>involved enhancement on the basis of prior, uncounseled misdemeanor convictions for which no imprisonment was imposed, while <em>Greene </em>involved enhancement on the basis of a prior, un-counseled felony conviction. Appellant received only a fine of $165 on his first drunken driving conviction, which was a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Because the enhancement of appellant's conviction was based on a prior, uncoun-seled misdemeanor conviction for which he served no time in prison, no relief is appropriate here.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">III.
