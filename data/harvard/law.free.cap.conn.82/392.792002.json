J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJ8\">Costs are never taxable unless given by statute. <em>Studwell </em>v. <em>Cooke, </em>38 Conn. 549. General Statutes, \u00a7 1521, grants a right to the defendant in a criminal prosecution before the Criminal Court of Common Pleas, to an appeal to this court, \u201cin the same manner, and with the same effect as in civil actions.\u201d The defendant was successful (a<em>nte, </em>p. 111, 72 Atl. 648), in procuring, on appeal, a reversal of a judgment of conviction rendered in the Criminal Court of Common Pleas. General Statutes, \u00a7 811, provides that when a judgment shall be reversed by this court \u201c it may render judgment in favor of the plaintiff in error, or appellant, to recover of the defendant the damages he has sustained by such erroneous judgment, together with his costs on the writ of error or appeal; or may remand the cause to the court below to be proceeded with by said court to final judgment; in which case the whole costs, except the costs on the writ of error, or appeal, shall be taxed in favor of the prevailing party; and the costs in the supreme court of errors shall be taxed in favor of the plaintiff in error, or appellant.\u201d The rules of this court, under this statute (Practice Book, 1908, p. 284, \u00a7 62), provide that \u201cin all cases on appeal, whether for legal or equitable relief, when \u2018error\u2019 is found, whether a new trial be awarded or not, the costs of this court (including the expense allowable for printing evidence or evidence and rulings made a part of the record), in the absence of special order to the contrary, will be taxed in the judgment of this court in favor of the prevailing party in this court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">The words of General Statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 1521, 811, and of our rules, \u00a7 62, if taken literally, would support the defendant\u2019s claim. But it is a general principle that what courts cannot enforce they cannot decree. <em>Clarke\u2019s Appeal, </em>70 Conn. 195, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>209, 39 Atl. 155. The State, by which the prosecution was brought, cannot be sued without its consent. It holds the immunities from legal process, mesne or final, belonging by the English common law to the King. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kilburn, </em>81 Conn. 9, 11, 69 Atl. 1028. Among these were that he is not included under general words in a statute, and that he pays no costs. <em>State </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em>47 Conn. 400, 405 ; 1 Blackstone\u2019s Comm. 261 ; 3 id. 400. The consent of the State in this cause to be made a defendant on appeal did not imply a consent to pay costs, should the appeal be successful.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The ruling of the clerk is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
