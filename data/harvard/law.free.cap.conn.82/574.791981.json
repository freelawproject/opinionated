J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ak5\">The complaint alleged that \u201cthe plaintiff was a passenger on one of the trains of said defendant company, and lawfully travelling thereon,\u201d and was inj\u00farcd by its negligence in causing another train \u201cto collide</p>\n<p id=\"b587-14\">\u00cdith the rear end and caboose, or passenger-car, of the ain upon which the plaintiff was then a passenger and in ( hich he then was.\u201d These averments were denied by the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-15\">I The evidence which he introduced was to the following [effect: He went to the defendant\u2019s station at Millers Falls in Massachusetts, intending to take a regular passenger train then about to leave for New London, and having a telegraphic order to its conductor to pass him free. Shortly before the time for its departure, this pass was revoked. He, however, proceeded to have his baggage checked and was intending to travel as a passenger upon the train, but it started before he got on board. He was a telegraph operator by profession, and had been, until that day, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>employed as such on a railroad which connected with the defendant\u2019s railroad at Millers Falls. A freight train on the defendant\u2019s railroad was soon to leave for New London, and he asked the conductor if he would carry him there, saying that he had missed the morning passenger train and \u201cwanted to get to New London that afternoon, money or no money.\u201d The conductor assented, and the plaintiff entered the caboose and took a seat in the \u201cmonitor,\u201d or cupola. Here he rode for some seventy miles until the train stopped at South Willington in this State, wher\u00e9 the caboose was wrecked by a rear-end collision with another train of the defendant following on the same track. The conductor had not asked him for a ticket, pass, or fare. It was the plaintiff\u2019s understanding of his arrangement with him that \u201cif he wanted to take money, it was his privilege of doing it,\u201d and that he (the plaintiff) would pay his fare, if fare were required of him; and otherwise go free.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">There is a prima facie presumption that every one ridi'ng in a regular passenger-car upon a railroad operated by\u00a1 a common carrier is there lawfully as a passenger. Thelre is a like presumption that one riding on a train which |s purely a freight train, upon such a railroad, is not these lawfully as a passenger; and, if he claim the rights of one, the burden of proof is upon him to show that, under the special circumstances of the case, the presumption ha\u00a13 been rebutted. That a caboose was part of the train, and that he was seated in that, was insufficient to support this] burden. <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>Delaware, L. &amp; W. R. Co., </em>57 N. Y. 382, 389, 15 Amer. Rep. 513. Such a car is defined as one \u201cused on freight or construction trains for workmen or the train crew.\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary. The plaintiff had been in the service of a railroad, and must have known what purposes the caboose legitimately serves. It is indeed common knowledge, of which courts take judicial notice. He was neither a passenger nor lawfully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>riding in the car, unless by reason of his arrangement with the conductor. That could not avail for the purpose unless the conductor were the authorized agent of the defendant to make such an arrangement. It was for the plaintiff to show, if he could, that the authority had been conferred. The only evidence of that nature was that the flagman, when told by the plaintiff that the conductor had given him permission to ride to New London, said that he could not let him board the caboose until the conductor calme up; and that he did not \u201clike to tell anybody to get on, without his authority.\u201d This declaration of a railroad servant, even if it could be regarded as a recognition of the conductor\u2019s right to receive passengers, could not bind the railroad company. Proof that passengers were customarily received by the defendant or its conductors upon its freight trains would have tended to establish such a right, but none was offered. The conductor of a freight train, in the absence either of actual authority, or of any to be implied from custom, has no right to receive passengers upon it, and, if he does, his employer does not.become a common carrier of them. <em>Murch </em>v. <em>Concord Railroad Corporation, </em>29 N. H. 9, 61 Amer. Dec. 631. No attempt was made by the plaintiff to show actual authority; and there was nothing on which a jury could reasonably find that there was apparent authority. <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>153 Mass. 188, 26 N. E. 446.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">There was no testimony as to the cause of the collision. It may have occurred through no fault of the defendant. Not being a passenger, the plaintiff, even if he could be regarded as a licensee, could not claim that a presumption of fault arose from the mere fact that a collision occurred. A nonsuit therefore was properly ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
