The ground of the motion is that the judgment is merged in a judgment obtained by the plaintiff on <em>scire facias </em>against the Waterbury National Bank, who was factorized in this action as the debtor of the defendant. If such be the fact, the defendant has a remedy in the nature of an equitable action or of <em>audita querela. </em>A proceeding in either of these ways would result in a final judgment, from which an appeal is provided by statute. The statute provides for appeals only from final judgments. The present appeal is not from such a judgment. It was therefore unwarranted and improper, and gives to this court no jurisdiction over the case. The appeal is erased from the docket.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
