The defendant claims that no costs were taxable, on the ground that costs are an incident to a cause, and the judgment shows that there was no cause pending. General Statutes, \u00a7 4840, authorizes the allowance of costs to the prevailing party \u201cin causes pending in the Supreme Court of Errors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-15\">The defendant brought here what she claimed to be an appeal, and it was docketed as such. Had the want of jurisdiction been so apparent as to found a motion to erase, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>an order erasing it from the docket would not have carried costs. <em>Parmalee </em>v. <em>Bethlehem, </em>57 Conn. 270, 18 Atl. 94. But the proper office of a plea in abatement is to state facts not apparent on the record. <em>O\u2019Brien\u2019s Petition, </em>79 Conn. 46, 63 Atl. 777. If an issue is presented as to whether they are true or sufficient, the court necessarily has jurisdiction to determine that issue, and its determination, if in favor of the pleader, disposes of what, within the meaning of the statute, is, as between the parties to the proceeding, a pending cause, and makes the appellee the prevailing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">A form of judgment on such a plea was prescribed by this court in 1897, and concludes thus: \u201c It is therefore considered and adjudged that the appeal abate and be dismissed and that the appellee recover $ \u2014 \u2022 costs, and execution issue accordingly.\u201d This is justified by the considerations above stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">The action of the clerk is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
