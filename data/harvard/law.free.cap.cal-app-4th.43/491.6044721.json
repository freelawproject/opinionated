Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b200-11\">This case involves a conspiracy among two lawyers and numerous non-attorneys to defraud insurance companies by staging automobile accidents. Myron Jay Toplitzky, defendant, appeals from a judgment of conviction, after a jury trial, of conspiracy (Pen. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 182, subd. 1, now \u00a7 182, subd. (a)(1), Stats. 1989, ch. 897, \u00a7 15, p. 3062) to commit: insurance fraud and grand theft (count 1) (\u00a7 487, subd. 1 (now \u00a7 487, subd. (a), Stats. 1993, ch. 1125; former Ins. Code \u00a7\u00a7 556, 1871.1, see now \u00a7 550, added by Stats. 1992, ch. 675 and attorney capping (count 2). (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 6152, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>subd. (a).)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant, an attorney, was sentenced to state prison to serve concurrent terms of five years (count 1) and three years (count 2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He was also ordered to pay a $25,000 fine. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">A. <em>Defendant\u2019s Sentence for Conspiring to Commit Insurance Fraud and Grand Theft Did Not Violate the State and Federal Constitutional Prohibitions of Ex Post Facto Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">Defendant argues his sentence for conspiring to commit insurance fraud and grand theft violated the state and federal constitutional prohibitions of ex post facto laws. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 9; U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 10, cl. 1.) He argues an unconstitutional increased sentence was imposed under a statutory amendment which took effect after the conspiracy began but before it ended. This contention is without merit. The grand jury indictment charged and the testimony indicated defendant was a participant in the conspiracy between November 1, 1988, and July 19, 1991. The increased penalty imposed upon defendant took effect on January 1, 1989. (Former Ins. Code, \u00a7 556, Stats. 1988, ch. 1609, \u00a7 1, pp. 5864-5865; see now \u00a7 550.) The jury found defendant guilty as charged of participation in a conspiracy lasting from November 1, 1988, to July 19, 1991. The evidence supported that finding. Defendant\u2019s defense was that he had no knowledge of the conspiracy. There was no evidence he withdrew from the conspiracy. Under these circumstances, defendant\u2019s participation in the conspiracy was properly subject to the increased penalty which took effect while the criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>scheme was ongoing; there was no ex post facto violation. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Packard </em>(1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 622, 627 [182 Cal.Rptr. 576]; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Giry </em>(1st Cir. 1987) 818 F.2d 120, 135; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Borelli </em>(2d Cir. 1964) 336 F.2d 376, 386, fn. 5; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Gibbs </em>(3d Cir. 1987) 813 F.2d 596, 601-602; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Goldberger </em>(3d Cir. 1952) 197 F.2d 330, 331; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Baresh </em>(5th Cir. 1986) 790 F.2d 392, 404; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(5th Cir. 1988) 845 F.2d 1262, 1264-1265; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Todd </em>(5th Cir. 1984) 735 F.2d 146, 150-151; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Henson </em>(6th Cir. 1988) 848 F.2d 1374, 1385-1386; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Canino </em>(7th Cir. 1991) 949 F.2d 928, 951-952; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Pace </em>(7th Cir. 1990) 898 F.2d 1218, 1238; <em>U.S. </em>v <em>Marks </em>(8th Cir. 1994) 38 F.3d 1009, 1015-1016; <em>Leyvas </em>v. <em>United States </em>(9th Cir. 1967) 371 F.2d 714, 717-718; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Campanale </em>(9th Cir. 1975) 518 F.2d 352, 365.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">B., C.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">III.

[QQ (b) An agent is one who represents another in dealings with one or more third persons.\u201d Business and Professions Code section 6152 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) It is unlawful for: [Qfl (1) Any person, in his individual capacity or in his capacity as a public or private employee, or for any firm, corporation, partnership or association to act as a runner or capper for any such attorneys or to solicit any business for any such attorneys in and about [any public or private place]. [U (2) Any person to solicit another person to commit or join in the commission of a violation of subdivision (a). . . .\u201d Business and Professions Code section 6153 describes the penalty for a violation: \u201cAny person, firm, partnership, association, or corporation violating subdivision (a) of Section 6152 is punishable, upon a first conviction by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year. Upon a second or subsequent conviction, a person, firm, partnership, association, or corporation is punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year, or by imprisonment in the state prison for 16 months or 2 or 3 years, or by a fine up to ten thousand dollars ($10,000), or by both that imprisonment and fine.\u201d However, defendant was charged with a felony violation of <em>conspiring </em>to commit the crime of attorney capping.
