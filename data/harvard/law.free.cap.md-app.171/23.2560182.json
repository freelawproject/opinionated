(\u201cETS\u201d), a non-profit corporation, develops, administers, and grades standardized tests. On September 11, 2004, one of ETS\u2019s standardized tests was administered to Elba H. Hildebrant (\u201cHildebrant\u201d) at Montgomery College in Rockville, Maryland. The test taken by Hildebrant was a Praxis Series School Leaders Licensure Assessment Test (\u201cthe Praxis test\u201d). The Praxis test is a standardized licensing examination required to be taken by teachers in Montgomery County (and elsewhere) who hope to become school principals.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">Hildebrant, a principal-intern at a Montgomery County elementary school, was among the candidates taking the test at Montgomery College. Dana Baker administered the test on behalf of ETS.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">After the test was concluded, Ms. Baker submitted a \u201cSupervisor\u2019s Irregularity Report\u201d to ETS. The report said that Hildebrant, in Session I of the test, engaged in \u201cmisconduct\u201d because she \u201crefused to stop writing when time was called. Warning given. Material Taken.\u201d In regard to Session II, Ms. Baker reported that Hildebrant engaged in \u201cmisconduct\u201d when she \u201chad to be instructed twice to stop work and close the test book. (She insisted on completing her thought.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">On September 30, 2004, ETS sent Hildebrant a letter telling her that it had been reported that she continued to work on a section of the test after time was called and that she failed to follow a direction to stop writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Hildebrant responded to ETS\u2019s letter with a missive dated October 9, 2004, in which she said that she was \u201cwilling to accept that the staff may think they were doing what they were instructed to do to maintain the secure, standard conditions\u201d of the test center, but that she had \u201cconformed completely to those standards, and that the report to the contrary was an error in judgment on the part of the proctor.\u201d Shortly thereafter, ETS canceled Hildebrant\u2019s test scores, based on its belief that Hildebrant engaged in the misconduct alleged in Ms. Baker\u2019s report. Subsequently, ETS returned to Hildebrant the fee she had paid to take the exam. ETS reported Hildebrant\u2019s (alleged) misconduct to no one.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">Hildebrant filed a complaint and then an amended complaint in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County against Ms. Baker and ETS. The second count of the amended complaint was against ETS only and alleged that ETS breached its contract with plaintiff by failing to \u201cfairly and accurately report her leadership assessment scores\u201d to the Montgomery County Board of Education.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">ETS filed a motion for summary judgment as to the breach of contract count. Hildebrant filed an opposition to that motion. After a hearing, the motions judge granted summary judgment in favor of ETS. The court then dismissed all remaining counts<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against both Ms. Baker and ETS.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Hildebrant filed a motion to alter or amend judgment, arguing that summary judgment should not have been granted as to the breach of contract count because issues of material fact existed regarding whether ETS acted in good faith in determining that Hildebrant was guilty of misconduct. After ETS responded, the motion was denied on April 12, 2005. Hildebrant filed this timely appeal and raises one question, viz.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-7\">Did the trial court err in entering summary judgment for ETS on appellant\u2019s breach of contract claim despite the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>presence of outstanding issues of material fact regarding whether ETS acted in good faith in determining that appellant engaged in misconduct?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">I. <em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Summary judgment may be granted on the ground that \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Md. Rule 2-501 (a). In ruling on a summary judgment motion, the court must view all facts and all inferences that may be drawn legitimately from those facts, in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. Summary judgment should not be granted if the party opposing the motion can demonstrate that there is a genuine dispute as to material facts. <em>Ritter v. Ritter, </em>114 Md.App. 99, 104, 689 A.2d 101 (1997). A fact is \u201cmaterial\u201d if the outcome of the case depends on how the fact-finder resolves the disputed fact. <em>Id. </em>Thus, when reviewing the circuit court\u2019s grant of a motion for judgment, we determine whether a material fact is in dispute and whether the motions judge was legally correct in granting the motion. <em>Converge Services Group, LLC v. Curran, </em>383 Md. 462, 476, 860 A.2d 871 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">II. <em>DEPOSITION EXCERPTS, AFFIDAVITS, AND EXHIBITS PRESENTED TO THE MOTIONS JUDGE</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">A. <em>Dana Baker\u2019s Deposition Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">Dana Baker was deposed on December 21, 2004. She testified that she had worked for ETS for approximately eight years and that she administered roughly ten to fifteen tests per year for that organization. She further testified that she was \u201can associate supervisor of a testing site\u201d and that she \u201cgenerally [has] no knowledge of what ETS does after the testing session is over.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">In regard to the test administered on September 11, 2004, the deponent said that Hildebrant continued to write after time had been called during the test, that a Supervisor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Irregularity Report was filled out by her because of that infraction, and that she informed Hildebrant that such a report would be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">B. <em>Dana Baker\u2019s Affidavit</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Ms. Baker\u2019s affidavit read, in material part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-6\">1.

I had never previously met Ms. Hildebrant, nor did I know anything about her before the test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-13\">8. On September 11, 2004, I filled out a \u201cSupervisor\u2019s Irregularity Report\u201d regarding Ms. Hildebrant. I provided this report to the test site supervisor, who sent the report on to ETS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>C. <em>The Registration Bulletin</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">All candidates who take the Praxis test are sent a \u201cRegistration Bulletin\u201d that spells out the rules governing the taking of the test. On the date Hildebrant took the test, she signed a certificate that read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-5\">CERTIFICATION STATEMENT: (Please write the following statement below. DO NOT PRINT.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-6\">*1 hereby agree to the conditions set forth in the Registration Bulletin and certify that I am the person whose name and address appear on this answer sheet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-7\">\n<em>Is/1 hereby agree to the conditions set [sic] in the Registration Bulletin an[d] certify that I am the person whose name and address appear on this answer sheet.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2\">SIGNATURE: <em>Is/ E.

The Bulletin also alerts the test taker to the fact that ETS has the right to cancel a test taker\u2019s score if \u201cmisconduct\u201d occurs. Misconduct is defined as directly observable violation of the rules during test administration, but the Bulletin also defines \u201cmisconduct\u201d to include \u201cworking on any test, or test section, <em>when not authorized to do so, </em>or working after time has been called.\u201d Included in the Registration Bulletin are the following paragraphs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-9\">ETS reserves the right to take all action\u2014including, but not limited to, barring you from future testing and/or canceling your scores\u2014for failure to comply with test administration regulations or the test administrator/supervisor\u2019s directions.

Misconduct includes, but is not limited to, noncompliance with the \u201cTest Center Procedures and Regulations,\u201d <em>pages 10-12 </em>of this <em>Bulletin.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">D. <em>Hildebrant\u2019s Affidavit</em></p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">Hildebrant\u2019s opposition affidavit read, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-8\">1.

These statements are so contrary to any reasonable understanding or interpretation of anything that could have been observed that I have readily concluded that they were made with the knowledge that they were false and with the intent to harm me personally.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-12\">III. <em>THE MOTIONS JUDGE\u2019S OPINION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b52-13\">The motions judge granted summary judgment in favor of ETS because (1) the contract between the parties (i.e., the Registration Bulletin) explicitly gave ETS the right to cancel the test scores whenever, in ETS\u2019s judgment, a test taker engages in misconduct; (2) ETS, pursuant to that right, exercised its judgment when it decided to cancel Hildebrant\u2019s score; (3) therefore, ETS did not breach its contract with the plaintiff when it exercised its judgment and canceled Hildebrant\u2019s scores.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>IV. <em>ANALYSIS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">In this appeal, Hildebrant does not take issue with the fact that ETS had the contractual right to cancel her scores if, in ETS\u2019s judgment, she had engaged in the conduct of which Ms. Baker accused her. Hildebrant argues, however, that ETS\u2019s exercise of its judgment in deciding whether to cancel the test scores must be exercised in good faith. According to Hildebrant, an issue of material fact existed as to whether ETS canceled the test scores in good faith. Her reasoning is as follows: (1) Hildebrant said in her affidavit that everything Ms. Baker said in the \u201cIrregularity Report\u201d concerning Hildebrant\u2019s failure to stop writing after time was called was false; (2) if what Ms. Baker said was false, then she knew it was false when she wrote the report; (3) Ms. Baker was, at all times here pertinent, ETS\u2019s agent; (4) ETS is bound by the knowledge of its agents; (5) because Ms. Baker knew the allegations of misconduct were bogus, then so did ETS; and (6) therefore, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the movant, when ETS exercised its discretion to cancel the test scores, it did so in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">As Hildebrant correctly points out, in every contract there exists an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. <em>See, e.g., Food Fair Stores, Inc. v. Blumberg, </em>234 Md. 521, 534, 200 A.2d 166 (1964) (\u201c[I]n every contract there exists an implied covenant that each of the parties thereto will act in good faith and deal fairly with the others.\u201d); <em>First Union Nat\u2019l Bank v. Steele Software Sys., </em>154 Md.App. 97, 139, 838 A.2d 404 (2003) (\u201cGood faith is a standard that has honesty and fairness at its core and that is imposed on every party to a contract.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">In this appeal, ETS does not contest the fact that it was required to act in good faith when dealing with Hildebrant. ETS contends, however, that under applicable Maryland law, the knowledge of Ms. Baker cannot be imputed to it. ETS gives two reasons in support of that contention, which will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>discussed <em>infra</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">In <em>Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund Bd. v. Fortney, </em>264 Md. 246, 255, 285 A.2d 641 (1972), the Court of Appeals said: \u201c \u2018The ordinary law of principal and agent\u2019 is that knowledge of the agent is knowledge of the principal.\u201d (quoting <em>Boring v. Jungers, </em>222 Md. 458, 463, 160 A.2d 780 (1960)). There are exceptions to that rule, however. One of the exceptions to the rule is the \u201cadverse interest\u201d exception. <em>See Hecht v. Resolution Trust Corp., </em>333 Md. 324, 346, 635 A.2d 394 (1994) (knowledge of agent whose interests are adverse to principal cannot be imputed to principal); <em>Shah v. HealthPlus, Inc., </em>116 Md.App. 327, 342, 696 A.2d 473 (1997) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The Restatement (Second) op Agency \u00a7 282 recognizes an exception to this exception. Section 282 reads, in material part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">Agent Acting Adversely to Principal</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">(1) A principal is not affected by the knowledge of an agent in a transaction in which the agent secretly is acting adversely to the principal and entirely for his own or another\u2019s purposes, except as stated in Subsection (2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-8\">(2) The principal is affected by the knowledge of an agent who acts adversely to the principal:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-9\">(a) if the failure of the agent to act upon or to reveal the information results in a violation of a contractual or relational duty of the principal to a person harmed thereby;____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">Hildebrant relies upon the exception to the exception set forth in section 282(2)(a). She contends that the failure of Ms. Baker to reveal the falsity of her report resulted in a violation of a contractual duty that the principal (ETS) owed to her, which caused her harm. The exception to the exception set forth in section 282 of the Restatement (Second) of Agency has been recognized, albeit impliedly, by the Maryland Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>of Appeals. <em>See Louis K Liggett Co. v. Rose, </em>152 Md. 146, 163, 136 A. 651 (1927).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">In <em>Liggett, </em>a landlord, one Diener, leased the same property to two tenants for portions of the same term. <em>Id. </em>at 150, 136 A. 651. The first lease was to Henry Rose and Emil Horowitz. <em>Id. </em>The second lease was to the Louis K. Liggett Company. <em>Id. </em>The central issue presented in the <em>Liggett </em>case was whether the Liggett Company had knowledge of the earlier lease when it signed the second lease. <em>Id. </em>It was proven at trial that a broker named Richards was employed by both the landlord and the Liggett Company in connection with the lease of the premises in question. <em>Id. </em>at 162, 136 A. 651. It was also proven that prior to the signing of the second lease Richards had seen the lease in which the landlord demised the subject premises to Messrs. Rose and Horowitz (the first parties to lease the premises). <em>Id. </em>at 163,136 A. 651. Despite Richards\u2019 notice of the earlier lease, he did not communicate this knowledge to Liggett Company or to any of its agents. <em>Id. </em>at 163, 136 A. 651. The reason for the broker\u2019s nondisclosure evidently was greed, i.e., he stood to be paid a $10,000 commission if the second lease was signed and enforced. <em>Id. </em>at 162,136 A. 651.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-5\">The Liggett Company contended, <em>inter alia,</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag1\">that brokerage fees to the amount of about $10,000 depended upon the success of the broker\u2019s efforts and that this made the interest [of Richards] adverse to the Liggett Company, so that even if [Richards] were its agent, the principal would not be charged with the knowledge of the agent acquired in the transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 162, 136 A. 651. The Court of Appeals in <em>Liggett </em>rejected this contention, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">Richards had seen the agreement between Diener [landlord] and Rose and Horowitz, dated November 11,1925, and knew its terms, but testimony is that he did not communicate this knowledge to Masters, the real estate agent of the Liggett Company, to Watt, its vice president or to anyone connected with the company. However lamentable this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>silence in the discharge of his duty to his principal may be, <em>it would nevertheless be a repudiation of the fundamental principles of agency and of justice to entertain a proposition that such a non-disclosure by an agent would be the shield of the principal, while it encompassed the destruction of the contractual rights of a third party [Rose and Horowitz].</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 163, 136 A. 651 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">We agree with Hildebrant that the principles set forth in section 282 Restatement (Second) op Agency, which were applied in <em>Liggett, supra, </em>prevents ETS from successfully arguing that the knowledge of Ms. Baker was not imputable to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">ETS also argues that to impute Ms. Baker\u2019s knowledge to it contravenes the express contractual language set forth in the Registration Bulletin. According to ETS, the Registration Bulletin \u201ccould not be clearer\u201d in this regard because the contract \u201c(i) distinguished between ETS and its test center administrators and (ii) reserved for ETS alone, not any administrator, the sole \u2018judgment\u2019 concerning whether to cancel a test score for misconduct.\u201d In support of this argument, ETS relies on four sentences that appear in the Registration Bulletin:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-7\">\u2022 To promote these objectives [i.e., to report scores that accurately reflect the performance of every test taker], ETS reserves the right to cancel any test score when, in ETS\u2019s judgment, a testing irregularity occurs____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-9\">\u2022 When ETS or test center find that there is misconduct in connection with a test, the test taker may be dismissed from the test center, or ETS may decline to score the test, or cancel the test score.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-10\">\u2022 When, in ETS\u2019s judgment, or the judgment of test center personnel, there is a discrepancy in a test taker\u2019s identification, the test taker may be dismissed from the test center.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>\u2022 In addition [when there is a discrepancy in the test taker\u2019s identity], ETS may decline to score the test or cancel the test score.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">As the Supreme Court said almost two hundred years ago in <em>Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward, </em>17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 518, 636, 4 L.Ed. 629 (1819), \u201c[a] corporation is an artificial being, invisible, intangible and existing only in contemplation of law____\u201d And, as an \u201cartificial being,\u201d a corporation can act only through its agents. This being so, it is impossible to see how the language used in ETS\u2019s contract proves ETS\u2019s point that the contract contemplates that even if the administrator of the test acts in bad faith such actions are not imputable to the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">It is, of course, true that ofttimes ETS\u2019s judgment (as to whether the test taker has engaged in misconduct) is exercised by ETS agents other than test center administrators. For instance, if after the tests are scored, it comes to the attention of agents of ETS that the handwriting by the person who took a second test is different from that of the person who took an earlier test under the same name, the judgment as to whether there has been misconduct is made by someone other than \u201ctest center personnel.\u201d On the other hand, in certain situations, if misconduct occurs in the presence of test center personnel, test center personnel are empowered to dismiss the test taker from the test center without consulting with any other ETS agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">The language relied on by ETS in this appeal, in our view, simply makes the obvious point that in many situations, agents of ETS other than test center administrators decide what is to be done about test taker misconduct. But nothing in the contractual language suggests that when making its corporate judgment, the knowledge of all ETS\u2019s agents (including the test center administrator) is not to be imputed to ETS.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-8\">Appellee also makes the following argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AI\">Appellant\u2019s \u201cimputed bad faith\u201d argument would drain all significance from ETS\u2019s contractual reservation of the right to use its \u201cjudgment.\u201d <em>Every </em>case of misconduct would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>subject to second-guessing and protracted litigation. Although ETS of necessity relies on thousands of test center personnel throughout the country, it would not be able to rely on eyewitness reports from any of them in deciding whether to cancel a score for misconduct, but would instead have to conduct its own independent investigation of each case and be exposed to the possibility of lengthy and costly litigation in every case. That would be a highly unfortunate result as a matter of public policy; but in any event, it is foreclosed by the plain language of the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">We disagree with the argument that if the knowledge of Ms. Baker were imputed to ETS then the result would be that the provision in the contract reserving to ETS the right to use its judgment would have no significance. Numerous cases have been decided in favor of ETS in which the court has enforced the contract provision at issue (i.e., the provision that ETS may exercise its judgment as to whether to cancel the test score) in situations where test site administrators have had no input. <em>See, e.g., In the Matter of K.D. v. Educ. Testing Serv., </em>87 Misc.2d 657, 386 N.Y.S.2d 747 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.) (1976) (ETS acted within its rights and within its obligation and duties in requesting that the plaintiff take a re-examination when it had good reason to believe, based on the large increase in score by the plaintiff in the second law school admission test (\u201cLSAT\u201d) taken by plaintiff, coupled with striking similarities between plaintiffs answers and the answers of a person seated adjacent to him, that the score was not authentic); <em>Johnson v. Educ. Testing Serv., </em>754 F.2d 20 (1st Cir.1985) (ETS did not breach its contract by canceling plaintiffs LSAT scores when plaintiffs score increased by approximately three hundred points from the score achieved approximately four months earlier and when handwriting experts employed by ETS opined that the test had been taken by someone other than the plaintiff); <em>Murray v. Educ. Testing Serv., </em>170 F.3d 514 (1999) (ETS did not act in bad faith or breach its contract with student even though ETS canceled the student\u2019s score on an examination based on the fact that there was a huge increase in the test score when compared with student\u2019s prior test and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>when the student\u2019s answers were strikingly similar to those of a nearby seatmate). Thus, it is not true that if the knowledge of agents, such as Ms. Baker, were imputable to ETS, then every case of perceived misconduct would be subject \u201cto second-guessing and protracted litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">Moreover, ETS\u2019s cries of doom if courts were to impute to it the knowledge of the test taker administrator are greatly overblown. Although ETS has been involved in numerous cases resulting in reported appellate opinions, none of those opinions have involved a case like the subject one where the plaintiff alleges that the test taker administrator simply made up the allegations of misconduct. There is a good reason for this dearth of cases. Unless the test taker and the administrator were previously acquainted, it would be exceedingly difficult for any plaintiff to convince a fact-finder that a test site administrator would pick out some unfortunate test taker, invent a story demonstrating that the test taker had engaged in misconduct, and then report a false story of \u201cmisconduct\u201d to others further up the ETS chain of command. Obviously, in order to succeed, a plaintiff in such a case would have to surmount a gigantic hurdle, unless the plaintiff could suggest some plausible motive for the administrator to lie. Absent cases where a motive to lie can be shown, it is difficult to believe that a test site administrator would act in such a fashion. Such dim prospects of victory in cases of this sort make it unlikely, in the extreme, that recognition that knowledge of the test site administrators is imputable to ETS would cause ETS to be inundated with similar lawsuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Issues of credibility of witnesses are to be made by the jury and not by the judge who rules on a summary judgment motion. In this regard, we also stress what we said at the outset, i.e., in deciding whether summary judgment should be granted, all facts presented to the motions judge, together with all legitimate inferences that may be drawn from those facts, must be taken in the light most favorable to Hildebrant. Here there exists a material dispute of fact as to whether Ms. Baker made up her allegations of misconduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>against Hildebrant. If she did make up those allegations, her knowledge of the false allegation is imputable to ETS and that imputed knowledge would suffice to show bad faith on the part of ETS.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">SUMMARY JUDGMENT REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b48-9\">. ETS had filed a motion to dismiss the other two counts in the complaint, which was granted. Hildebrant does not contend in this appeal that the court erred in dismissing the other counts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b54-11\">. In'the facts section of ETS\u2019s brief, ETS asserts that Ms. Baker was an independent contractor as opposed to an agent of ETS. No similar assertion was made before the motions court by ETS and for good reason. There is simply nothing in the record to support that contention.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
