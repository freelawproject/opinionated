The Prince George\u2019s County police responded immediately to the scene of the shooting. The first police officer to arrive was Officer Jeremy George. With the strong smell of gunpowder still in the air, Officer George asked Darby: \u201cWho shot you?\u201d Darby answered: \u201cBobby\u201d\u2014referring to Robert Head. Darby died about forty minutes after giving this answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Head was charged and later found guilty of second-degree murder of Darby, along with the attempted second-degree murder of one Roderick Sanders, who was shot by the same gunman who fatally wounded Darby.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Several questions are raised by Head in this appeal. The most important (and interesting) is: Did the trial court err in allowing Officer George to testify that the decedent told him that he had been shot by \u201cBobby\u201d? Head claims that the court\u2019s decision to allow this statement into evidence was erroneous because it denied him the ability to confront the witnesses against him in contravention of the rights afforded him by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">At the time Head was tried in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County and when this case was argued before us, the most recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the right-to-confront-witnesses issue raised by Head was <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). In <em>Crawford, </em>the Court held that the confrontation clause, with one possible exception, barred \u201cadmission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless [the witness] was unavailable to testify, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d 541 U.S. at 53-54, 124 S.Ct. 1354. Critical to the holding in <em>Crawford </em>was the phrase \u201ctestimonial statements,\u201d because (the court implied) only statements of that sort caused the out-of-court declarant to be a \u201cwitness\u201d within the meaning of the confrontation clause. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 124 S.Ct. 1354. Non-testimonial statements by an out-of-court declarant, while still subject to traditional limitations upon hearsay evidence, are not governed by the confrontation clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">About six weeks after we heard oral argument in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Davis v. Washington, 547 </em>U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006). In <em>Davis, </em>the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-8\">Without attempting to produce an exhaustive classification of all conceivable statements\u2014or even all conceivable statements in response to police interrogation\u2014as either testimonial or nontestimonial, it suffices to decide the present cases to hold as follows: Statements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency. They are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">126 S.Ct. at 2273-74 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">In deciding the confrontation issue raised by Head, we shall use the just-quoted definition to decide whether the trial court erred in allowing Officer George to tell the jury what Darby said.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">The central issue presented to the jury was whether Head was the criminal agent who fatally shot Darby and wounded Roderick Sanders. Head presented an alibi defense and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>called several witnesses who testified that at the approximate time of the shooting he was elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">A. <em>Roderick Sanders\u2019 Trial Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The State\u2019s star witness was Roderick Sanders. He testified that prior to the shooting he was well acquainted with Head. On the afternoon of the shooting, Head and Darby (a close friend of Sanders\u2019) visited Sanders\u2019 home in Upper Marlboro. Darby complained that he could not find a ring of keys that belonged to him, and throughout the afternoon, he talked about locating the keys. Finally, when Head, Darby, and Sanders were all sitting on the living room couch, making plans for the evening, Darby said that he wanted to look for the keys at the home of Head\u2019s girlfriend. Darby then remarked that he could kick in the door of the house to conduct the search, but he did not want to do so because Head was dating the woman whose house would be invaded. This remark upset Head, who immediately left the house. Head returned shortly thereafter, began pacing around, and then asked Darby and Sanders why his girlfriend \u201cwas becoming involved.\u201d Without waiting for a reply, Head (according to Sanders) next pulled out a gun and shot him and then repeatedly shot Darby. After the shooting, Head left the house. Darby then got up from the couch and ran into the kitchen where he collapsed. Sanders called 911 and reported the shootings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">B. <em>The Motion in Limine Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">Prior to commencement of trial, appellant\u2019s counsel made a motion in limine to prevent the State from introducing into evidence the statement Darby made to Officer George. A hearing on the motion was held, out of the presence of the jury, on the morning of the first day of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">Officer George testified at the hearing that he arrived at Sanders\u2019 residence at 6:46 p.m., which was eight minutes after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>the police received a 911 call advising them of a shooting at Sanders\u2019 home. Immediately after he entered the front door, Officer George saw Sanders lying injured on the living room couch. He went outside to get a first-aid kit in order to provide medical assistance to Sanders. When Officer George returned, Sanders told him that somebody else had also been shot. The officer followed a trail of blood into the kitchen. He found Darby lying on the kitchen floor. When Officer George first saw Darby, he \u201cdidn\u2019t seem to be in very good condition at all,\u201d although the officer \u201cdidn\u2019t see a lot of blood.\u201d One of Darby\u2019s arms appeared to be broken, and the victim kept moving the broken arm and \u201cwasn\u2019t focusing on\u201d the officer. When Officer George asked Darby if he was \u201cokay,\u201d Darby \u201ckept saying, \u2018help me, help me.\u2019 \u201d Officer George next asked Darby \u201cwho shot him.\u201d Darby replied, \u201cBobby.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Officer George testified upon cross-examination by defense counsel that when he arrived at Sanders\u2019 house \u201ca chaotic situation\u201d existed. When he spoke to Darby, there was the \u201cfresh smell of gunpowder in the air,\u201d and Officer George \u201cdidn\u2019t even know if ... the person who caused that gunpowder was still in the house.\u201d Darby kept \u201cyelling out\u201d the words \u201chelp me, help me,\u201d and in the officer\u2019s view, it was still \u201cpotentially even a dangerous situation____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">C. <em>Resolution of the in Limine Motion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Appellant\u2019s counsel, citing <em>Crawford, supra, </em>contended at the in limine hearing that Darby\u2019s out-of-court statement identifying appellant as the shooter was \u201ctestimonial\u201d in that the inquiry by Officer George was made \u201cfor purposes of investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">Counsel for Head was asked by the court whether the statement by Darby came within the ambit of the \u201cdying declaration\u201d exception to the hearsay rule. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-804(b)(2). In reply, defense counsel took the position that because Darby\u2019s statement was \u201ctestimonial\u201d it should be excluded under <em>Crawford, </em>whether it fit within the definition of one or more of Maryland\u2019s exceptions to the hearsay rule. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>In the alternative, counsel argued that the dying declaration exception to the hearsay rule was inapplicable because there was insufficient proof that Darby believed that death was imminent at the time he identified the defendant as the person who had shot him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The trial court ruled that the statement made by Darby was an excited utterance and also met all the prerequisites of a dying declaration. Relying on a footnote in <em>Crawford, </em>the Court observed that the Supreme Court had \u201cleft for another day\u201d the question of whether the distinction made in <em>Crawford </em>between testimonial and nontestimonial hearsay should be applied to the dying declaration exception to the rule prohibiting the admission of hearsay evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALv\">I do not believe that ... the United States Supreme Court or any court applying <em>Crawford </em>will rule that [dying declarations should be excluded from evidence], nor have [any courts] to date [ruled], that ... to admit a dying declaration ... under the facts of this case would deny the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>defendant due process under either the United States or Maryland Constitutions....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The trial judge did not say explicitly whether he believed the objected-to testimony was \u201ctestimonial.\u201d But the court ruled that the statement made to Officer George, in which Darby identified appellant as the man who shot him, was admissible. The court then granted defense counsel, pursuant to Maryland Rule 2\u2014517(b)(2), a continuing objection to any testimony by Officer George concerning what Darby told him.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">In this appeal, Head does not take issue with the proposition that Darby\u2019s statement fell within two firmly rooted exceptions to the hearsay rule, i.e., the excited utterance exception and the exception for dying declarations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">Appellant argues that the <em>Crawford </em>case <em>made </em>it \u201cclear that a direct accusation of a past crime admitted in lieu of the accuser\u2019s live testimony at trial is a core testimonial statement requiring confrontation.\u201d As will be shown, appellant reads the holding in <em>Crawford </em>too broadly.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>In <em>Crawford, </em>it was unnecessary for the Court to define precisely what it meant by the word \u201cinterrogations,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 53, 124 S.Ct. 1354, when it said, \u201cStatements taken by police officers in the course of interrogations are ... testimonial under even a narrow standard.\u201d 541 U.S. at 52, 124 S.Ct. 1354. But in <em>Davis, supra, </em>the Supreme Court was required to answer that precise question. <em>See Davis, </em>126 S.Ct. at 2276.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">The <em>Crawford </em>case concerned the admissibility of a tape-recorded statement given to the police by Sylvia Crawford (\u201cSylvia\u201d) at a police station. The statement was used by the State of Washington when it prosecuted Sylvia\u2019s husband, Michael Crawford (\u201cMichael\u201d), for assault with intent to murder one Kenneth Lee. Lee was stabbed by Michael after Sylvia told her husband that Lee had tried to rape her. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 39, 124 S.Ct. 1354. At trial, Michael interposed a claim of self-defense. Sylvia did not testify at trial because of the State\u2019s marital privilege. Over defense counsel\u2019s objection, the State introduced Sylvia\u2019s tape-recorded statement into evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 38-39,124 S.Ct. 1354. The State\u2019s theory in admitting the hearsay statement was that it came within an exception to the hearsay rule that allowed for admissions against penal interest made by out-of-court declarants.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 40,124 S.Ct. 1354.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Sylvia\u2019s tape-recorded statement was unhelpful to Michael because \u201cit implicated ... [him] in Lee\u2019s stabbing and at least arguably undermined his self-defense claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 65, 124 S.Ct. 1354. The <em>Crawford </em>Court held that Sylvia\u2019s tape-recorded statement was testimonial and that the introduction of the statement violated Michael\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him. <em>Id. </em>at 70, 124 S.Ct. 1354.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">In <em>Crawford, </em>the Court pointed out that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>Sylvia Crawford made her statement while in police custody, herself a potential suspect in the case. Indeed, she had been told that whether she would be released \u201cdepend[ed] on how the investigation continue[d].\u201d ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 65,124 S.Ct. 1354.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">In <em>Davis, </em>the Supreme Court considered two appeals that were consolidated for argument, i.e., <em>Davis v. Washington </em>(No. 05-5224) and <em>Hammon v. Indiana </em>(No. 05-5705). <em>Davis, </em>126 S.Ct. at 2270, 2272. In No. 05-5224, Adrian Davis, the petitioner, was charged by the State of Washington with felony violation of a domestic no-contact order. <em>Id. </em>at 2271. At Davis\u2019 trial, the State proved that on February 1, 2001, a 911 emergency operator in Washington state received a phone call from Davis\u2019 former girlfriend, Michelle McCottry. <em>Id. </em>at 2270. When the operator answered the call, the connection terminated before anyone spoke. <em>Id. </em>The operator reversed the call, and Ms. McCottry answered the phone. The operator and Ms. McCottry then engaged in a conversation in which the operator learned that a domestic disturbance between McCottry and her former boyfriend, Adrian Davis, had occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 2271. The pertinent part of the 911 conversation was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-7\">911 OPERATOR: Hello.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-8\">COMPLAINANT [McCOTTRY]: Hello.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-9\">911 OPERATOR: What\u2019s going on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-10\">COMPLAINANT: He\u2019s here jumpin\u2019 on me again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-11\">911 OPERATOR: Okay. Listen to me carefully. Are you in a house or an apartment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-12\">COMPLAINANT: I\u2019m in a house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-13\">911 OPERATOR: Are there any weapons?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-14\">COMPLAINANT: No. He\u2019s usin\u2019 his fists.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-15\">911 OPERATOR: Okay. Has he been drinking?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-16\">COMPLAINANT: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-17\">911 OPERATOR: Okay, sweetie. I\u2019ve got help started. Stay on the line with me, okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-18\">COMPLAINANT: I\u2019m on the line.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>911 OPERATOR: Listen to me carefully. Do you know his last name?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-5\">COMPLAINANT: It\u2019s Davis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-6\">911 OPERATOR: Davis? Okay, what\u2019s his first name?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-7\">COMPLAINANT: Adrian.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-8\">911 OPERATOR: What is it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-9\">COMPLAINANT: Adrian.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-10\">911 OPERATOR: Adrian?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-11\">COMPLAINANT: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-12\">911 OPERATOR: Okay. What\u2019s his middle initial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-13\">COMPLAINANT: Martell. He\u2019s runnin\u2019 now.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-14\">126 S.Ct. at 2271.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-15\">Approximately four minutes after the 911 call, police officers arrived at Ms. McCottry\u2019s residence and observed McCottry\u2019s \u201cshaken state, the \u2018fresh injuries on her forearm and her face,\u2019 and her \u2018frantic efforts to gather her belongings and her children so that they could leave the residence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2271 (quoting from <em>State v. Davis, </em>154 Wash.2d 291, 296, 111 P.3d 844, 847 (2005) (en banc)). At Davis\u2019 trial, the two officers who responded to the scene testified that McCottry exhibited injuries that appeared to be fresh, but neither officer testified as to the cause of the injuries. <em>Id. </em>at 2271. McCottry did not testify; but, over Davis\u2019 objection, the trial court admitted, <em>inter alia, </em>the portions of the recording of McCottry\u2019s conversation with the 911 operator that are quoted above. <em>Id. </em>Davis was convicted of violation of the domestic no-contact order, and his conviction was affirmed by both the Washington Court of Appeals and the Washington Supreme Court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b630-16\">The Supreme Court was required in <em>Davis </em>to determine whether the statements made by McCottry to law enforcement personnel during the 911 call were \u201ctestimonial\u201d and thus inadmissible based on the confrontation clause. <em>Id. </em>at 2270.' In resolving that issue, the <em>Davis </em>Court first discussed what it had meant when it said in <em>Crawford </em>that \u201c[statements taken by police officers in the course of interrogations fit within the core class of testimonial statements.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>541 U.S. at 51, 124 S.Ct. 1354; <em>see Davis, </em>126 S.Ct. at 2273. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-5\">The questioning that generated the deponent\u2019s statement in Crawford,\u2014which was made and recorded while she was in police custody, after having been given <em>Miranda </em>warnings as a possible suspect herself\u2014\u201cqualifies under any conceivable definition\u201d of an \u201cinterrogation,\u201d 541 U.S. at 53 n. 4, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. We therefore did not define that term, except to say that \u201c[w]e use [it] ... in its colloquial, rather than any technical legal sense,\u201d and that \u201cone can imagine various definitions ..., and we need not select among them in this case.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The character of the statements in the present cases is not as clear, and these cases require us to determine more precisely which police interrogations produce testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Later in its opinion, the <em>Davis </em>Court went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-8\">The question before us in <em>Davis, </em>then, is whether, objectively considered, the interrogation that took place in the course of the 911 call produced testimonial statements. When we said in <em>Crawford, supra, </em>at 53, 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177, that \u201cinterrogations by law enforcement officers fall squarely within [the] class\u201d of testimonial hearsay, we had immediately in mind (for that was the case before us) <em>interrogations solely directed at establishing the facts of a past crime, </em>in order to identify (or provide evidence to convict) the perpetrator. The product of such interrogation, whether reduced to a writing signed by the declarant or embedded in the memory (and perhaps notes) of the interrogating officer, is testimonial. It is, in the terms of the 1828 American dictionary quoted in <em>Crawford, </em>\u201c \u2018[a] solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.\u2019 \u201d 541 U.S. at 51, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. (The solemnity of even an oral declaration of relevant past fact to an investigating officer is well enough established by the severe consequences that can attend a deliberate falsehood. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Stewart, </em>433 F.3d 273, 288 (C.A.2 2006) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>(false statements made to federal investigators violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001); <em>State v. Reed, </em>2005 WI 53, \u00b6 30, 280 Wis.2d 68, 695 N.W.2d 315, 323 (state criminal offense to \u201cknowingly giv[e] false information to [an] officer with [the] intent to mislead the officer in the performance of his or her duty\u201d).) A 911 call, on the other hand, and at least the initial interrogation conducted in connection with a 911 call, is ordinarily not designed primarily to \u201cestablis[h] or prov[e]\u201d some past fact, but to describe current circumstances requiring police assistance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 2276 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Judge Sealia, speaking for the Court in <em>Davis, </em>said that the portions of McCottry\u2019s 911 call quoted <em>supra </em>were not testimonial even though the statements were given to agents of law enforcement, <em>id. </em>at 2276-77, and identified Adrian Davis as the person who had physically attacked the complainant. The Court stressed four factors, none of which were present in the out-of-court declaration made by Sylvia Crawford in concluding that what Ms. McCottry said to the 911 operator was nontestimonial: (1) Ms. McCottry was speaking to a law enforcement agent about facts that were \u201cactually happening,\u201d rather than describing past events; (2) unlike the out-of-court declarations made by Sylvia Crawford, Ms. McCottry was \u201cfacing an ongoing emergency\u201d and was plainly making \u201ca call for help against bona fide physical threats\u201d; (3) the nature of what was asked and answered, viewed objectively, was such that the elicited statements were necessary to be able to resolve the present emergency, rather than simply to learn (as in <em>Crawford) </em>what had happened in the past; and (4) Ms. McCottry\u2019s \u201cfrank answers\u201d were provided over the phone in an environment that was not tranquil, or even (as far an any reasonable 911 operator could make out) safe, which contrasted with the situation in <em>Crawford </em>where the declarant \u201cwas responding calmly, at the station house, to a series of questions, with the officer interrogator taking and making notes of her answers....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2276-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The <em>Davis </em>Court was careful to point out that \u201cconversations which begin as an interrogation to determine the need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>for emergency assistance can evolve into testimonial statements once that purpose has been achieved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2277. The Court explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">In this case, for example, after the operator gained the information needed to address the exigency of the moment, the emergency appears to have ended (when Davis drove away from the premises). The operator then told McCottry to be quiet, and proceeded to pose a battery of questions. It could readily be maintained that, from that point on, McCottry\u2019s statements were testimonial, not unlike the \u201cstructured police questioning\u201d that occurred in <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 53 n. 4, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. This presents no great problem. Just as, for Fifth Amendment purposes, \u201cpolice officers can and will distinguish almost instinctively between questions necessary to secure their own safety or the safety of the public and questions designed solely to elicit testimonial evidence from a suspect,\u201d <em>New York v. Quarles, </em>467 U.S. 649, 658-659, 104 S.Ct. 2626, 81 L.Ed.2d 550 (1984), trial court will recognize the point at which, for Sixth Amendment purposes, statements in response to interrogations become testimonial. Through <em>in limine </em>procedure, they should redact or exclude the portions of any statement that have become testimonial, as they do, for example, with unduly prejudicial portions of otherwise admissible evidence.[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">In resolving the companion case (No. 05-5705), the <em>Davis </em>Court was called upon to decide if an out-of-court statement made by one Amy Hammon (\u201cAmy\u201d) was testimonial hearsay and therefore inadmissible. <em>Id. </em>at 2272-73. On the night of February 26, 2003, the police responded to the home of Hershel and Amy Hammon due to a report of a \u201cdomestic disturbance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2272. Amy gave the police permission to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>enter the home, and when the officers did so, they noticed that the glass front to a gas heating unit had been broken and flames were being emitted from the front of the unit. <em>Id. </em>The police found Hershel Hammon, Amy\u2019s husband, in the kitchen. He assured the officers that, although he and his wife had been in an argument, the argument had never been physical and everything \u201cwas fine now.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While one of the officers remained with Hershel, the other went into the living room to talk to Amy. The officer who interviewed Amy was later to testify at Hershel\u2019s trial that Amy told him that Hershel, during an argument, \u201cpushed her onto the ground, had shoved her head into the broken glass of the heater, and that he had punched her in the chest twice____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2272-73. While Amy was being interviewed by the police officer, Hershel made several attempts to participate in the conversation between the police and Amy. <em>Id. </em>at 2272. The officers insisted, however, that Hershel stay separate from his wife so that they could investigate what had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">After discussing the events with Amy, the police had her fill out an affidavit in which she handwrote the following: \u201cBroke out Furnace &amp; shoved me down on the floor into the broken glass. Hit me in the chest and threw me down. Broke out lamp &amp; phone. Tore up my van where I couldn\u2019t leave the house. Attacked my daughter.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">Amy was not available to testify at trial because she disobeyed a subpoena. The trial judge, over Hershel\u2019s counsel\u2019s objection, allowed Amy\u2019s affidavit to be admitted into evidence as a \u201cpresent sense impression.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Amy\u2019s oral statement to the police officers was admitted as an \u201cexcited utterance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">Hershel was convicted at a bench trial of domestic battery and probation violation. <em>Id. </em>His convictions were affirmed by the Indiana Supreme Court, which concluded that Amy\u2019s oral statement was not \u201ctestimonial\u201d and was admissible for state-law purposes as an excited utterance. The Indiana Supreme Court also concluded that, although Amy\u2019s affidavit <em>was </em>testimonial and therefore should not have been admitted, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>admission of the affidavit was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 2273.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">The <em>Davis </em>Court reversed Hershel\u2019s conviction due to the erroneous admission of the testimony concerning what Amy orally told the police. In doing so, Judge Scalia, for the Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-5\">It is true that the <em>Crawford </em>interrogation was more formal. It followed a <em>Miranda </em>warning, was tape-recorded, and took place at the station house, see 541 U.S. at 53 n. 4, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. While these features certainly strengthened the statements\u2019 testimonial aspect\u2014 made it more objectively apparent, that is, that the purpose of the exercise was to nail down the truth about past criminal events\u2014none was essential to the point. It was formal enough that Amy\u2019s interrogation was conducted in a separate room, away from her husband (who tried to intervene), with the officer receiving her replies for use in his \u201cinvestigation].\u201d ... What we called the \u201cstriking resemblance\u201d of the <em>Crawford </em>statement to civil-law <em>ex parte </em>examinations, 541 U.S. at 52, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177, is shared by Amy\u2019s statement here. Both declarants were actively separated from the defendant\u2014officers forcibly prevented Hershel from participating in the interrogation. Both statements deliberately recounted, in response to police questioning, how potentially criminal past events began and progressed. And both took place some time after the events described were over. Such statements under official interrogation are an obvious substitute for live testimony, because they do precisely <em>what a witness does </em>on direct examination; that are inherently testimonial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">Although we necessarily reject the Indiana Supreme Court\u2019s implication that virtually any \u201cinitial inquiries\u201d at the crime scene will not be testimonial, see 829 N.E.2d at 453, 457, <em>we do not hold the opposite\u2014that no questions at the scene will yield nontestimonial answers. </em>We have already observed of domestic disputes that \u201c[o]fficers called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>to investigate ... need to know whom they are dealing with in order to assess the situation, the threat to their own safety, and possible danger to the potential victim.\u201d <em>Hiibel, </em>542 U.S. at 186, 124 S.Ct. 2451, 159 L.Ed.2d 292. Such exigencies may <em>often </em>mean that \u201cinitial inquiries\u201d produce nontestimonial statements. But in cases like this one, where Amy\u2019s statements were neither a cry for help nor the provision of information enabling officers immediately to end a threatening situation, the fact that they were given at an alleged crime scene and were \u201cinitial inquiries\u201d is immaterial. <em>Cf Crawford, supra, </em>at 52 n. 3, 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 2278-79 (footnotes omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">We turn now to the job of applying the teachings of <em>Davis </em>and the progeny to the case at hand. On August 29, 2006, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit decided a <em>post-Crawford </em>case involving facts that bear a close resemblance to those presented in the case <em>sub judice. See United States v. Clemmons, </em>461 F.3d 1057 (8th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">One of the issues presented in <em>Clemmons </em>was whether the trial court erred in denying a pretrial motion that sought to preclude the prosecution from introducing into evidence a statement made to the police on October 20, 2002, by one Jamil Williams. <em>Id. </em>at 1058, 1060. On October 20, two police officers were dispatched to an address in Kansas City, Missouri; when they arrived at the address, they found Williams \u201clying on the ground with a pool of blood gathering on his right leg.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1058. Although Williams had been shot multiple times, he was talking on a cell phone in a calm voice when the officers first saw him. <em>Id. </em>at 1058, 1060. Officer Steven Lester approached Williams and asked him to terminate the call. Williams did so. <em>Id. </em>at 1059. Lester asked Williams who had shot him. Williams replied that he had been shot by Antonio Clemmons (appellant). He also advised that Clemmons had stolen his pistol and that Clemmons had attempted to rob him one month earlier in Independence, Missouri. <em>Id. </em>at 1059.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>Williams was murdered about six weeks after he made the statement implicating Clemmons. <em>Id. </em>Thereafter, Clemmons was indicted on felony gun charges arising out of his (alleged) theft of the gun from Williams. <em>Id. </em>The trial judge denied Clemmons\u2019 motion to exclude from evidence the statement Williams made to Officer Lester. On appeal, Clemmons\u2019 conviction was affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 1062. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-4\">Viewing the facts in the light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Davis, </em>we conclude that Williams\u2019s statements to Officer Lester were nontestimonial. The circumstances, viewed objectively, indicate that the primary purpose of Lester\u2019s questions was to enable him to assess the situation and to meet the needs of the victim. Officer Lester testified that he had parked his vehicle several houses away from the address to which he was dispatched \u201cdue to the fact that there could be a party armed.\u201d ... When the officers arrived at the scene, Williams was lying in front of a neighbor\u2019s house, suffering from multiple gunshot wounds. Officer Lester further testified that his purpose in speaking to the victim was \u201c[t]o investigate, one, his health to order him medical attention and, two, try[ ] to figure out who did this to him.\u201d ... Any reasonable observer would understand that Williams was facing an ongoing emergency and that the purpose of the interrogation was to enable police assistance to meet that emergency. Accordingly, because Williams\u2019s statements were nontestimonial, they do not implicate Clemmons\u2019s right to confrontation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1060-61 (references to transcript omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">As in <em>Clemmons, </em>\u201c[a]ny reasonable observer would understand that [Darby] was facing an ongoing emergency and that the purpose of the interrogation was to enable police assistance to meet that emergency.\u201d Three main facts support this conclusion. First, as Officer George testified, the situation was \u201cchaotic.\u201d Second, the scent of gunpowder in the air would mean to an objective observer that the crime was very recent and the situation was dangerous\u2014at least potentially\u2014 because Officer George did not know whether the criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>who shot Darby was still in the house. Third, immediately before he identified his attacker, Darby was crying for help.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">As mentioned earlier, the <em>Davis </em>Court said that \u201c[statements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.\u201d <em>Davis, supra, </em>126 S.Ct. at 2273. Darby\u2019s statement met that test.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">It is true that, at the in limine hearing, no inquiry was made of Officer George regarding his primary purpose for asking Darby the question at issue. But the test to be applied is objective. Although Sanders testified at trial that Head left the house immediately after the shooting, Officer George was unaware of that fact when he questioned Darby. The officer needed to know, for safety reasons, who shot Darby. By way of example, if Darby had said that he had been shot by Roderick Sanders, this information would allow the officer to take precautions to protect himself and Darby. The same would be true if Darby had given no name in response to the question but instead identified the shooter by disclosing his whereabouts (e.g., \u201cthe man who shot me is in the basement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">The <em>Davis </em>case instructs us that statements <em>are testimonial </em>\u201cwhen the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency <em>and </em>that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u201d 126 S.Ct. at 2273-74. Viewed objectively, the primary purpose of Officer George\u2019s question does not appear to have been either to establish or prove past events for possible use at a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\"><em>Davis </em>made explicit what had been strongly implied in <em>Crawford, </em>i.e., the confrontation clause set forth in the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution applies only to testimonial hearsay. <em>Davis, </em>126 S.Ct. at 2274-76. The statement made by Darby was nontestimonial. Thus, appellant\u2019s right to confront witnesses was not violated when the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>court allowed Officer George to testify as to what Darby told him.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Appellant next argues that the \u201ctrial court erred when it failed to consider the unreliable nature of [Darby\u2019s hearsay statement] because reliability is required for any exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d (citing <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 65-66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980); <em>California v. Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 155-57, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 26 L.Ed.2d 489 (1970)). In support of this argument, appellant asserts that the Supreme Court in <em>Crawford </em>retained the <em>\u201cRoberts </em>test for nontestimonial hearsay.\u201d (citing <em>Crawford, </em>124 S.Ct. at 1370).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">During the motion in limine hearing, when Officer George was asked who Darby had said shot him, Officer George initially said that Darby \u201cdidn\u2019t really have an answer for me.\u201d Immediately thereafter, however, when Officer George\u2019s mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>ory was refreshed by a copy of a police report that he had written shortly after the incident, he testified that, when he asked Darby who shot him, Darby \u201cgave the name Bobby.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">There is no merit in appellant\u2019s argument that the trial judge erred when he admitted Darby\u2019s hearsay statement without considering whether the hearsay was reliable. Dying declarations and excited utterances both are hearsay exceptions \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d in the common law. <em>See Bourjaily v. United States, </em>483 U.S. 171, 193, 107 S.Ct. 2775, 97 L.Ed.2d 144 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">And, in <em>Chapman v. State, </em>331 Md. 448, 457, 628 A.2d 676 (1993), the Court of Appeals said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-7\">Where the hearsay in question falls within a \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d hearsay exception \u201cno independent inquiry into reliability is required....\u201d <em>Bourjaily v. United States, </em>483 U.S. 171, 183, 107 S.Ct. 2775, 2782, 97 L.Ed.2d 144, 157 (1987). \u201cAdmission under a firmly rooted hearsay exception satisfied the constitutional requirement of reliability because of the weight accorded longstanding judicial and legislative experience in assessing the trustworthiness of certain types of out-of-court statements.\u201d <em>[Idaho v.] Wright, </em>497 U.S. [805,] 817, 110 S.Ct. [3139,] 3147, 111 L.Ed.2d [638,] 653 [(1990)] (citations omitted). However, where hearsay statements are admitted under an exception which is not considered \u201cfirmly rooted,\u201d then they are \u201cpresumptively unreliable and inadmissible for Confrontation Clause purposes\u201d and must be excluded, at least absent a \u201c \u2018showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lee v. Illinois, </em>476 U.S. 530, 543, 106 S.Ct. 2056, 2063, 90 L.Ed.2d 514, 528 (1986) (quoting <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 77, 100 S.Ct. at 2539, 65 L.Ed.2d at 608). These guarantees of trustworthiness must be such that the evidence is \u201cat least as reliable as evidence admitted under a firmly rooted hearsay exception\u201d so as to assure \u201cthat adversarial testing would add little to its reliability.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>497 U.S. at 821, 110 S.Ct. at 3149, 111 L.Ed.2d at 656 (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number><em>See also Gray v. State, </em>368 Md. 529, 570-71, 796 A.2d 697 (2002) (no independent inquiry into reliability is required when evidence \u201cfalls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Moreover, even if the two exceptions to the hearsay rule relied upon by the trial court were not \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d in the common law, the trial judge would not have been required to make a factual assessment of the trustworthiness of the \u201cin-court relator\u201d (i.e., Officer George). <em>Gray, </em>368 Md. at 545, 796 A.2d 697. The credibility of an in-court witness as to what he or she heard outside the courtroom is assessed by the trier of fact (here the jury) and not by a judge considering admissibility issues. <em>Id. </em>Thus, appellant\u2019s contention that Officer George was an unreliable relator of what he heard Darby say was a matter to be determined by the jury, not by the trial court in ruling on a motion in limine.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">y.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Appellant\u2019s last claim is that \u201cthe trial court erroneously used coercive language to instruct the deadlocked jury to continue to deliberate\u201d after gaining knowledge regarding \u201cthe jury\u2019s numerical split.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">The jury in this case commenced deliberation at 9:30 a.m. on the fifth day of trial. That afternoon, at 3:30 p.m., the jury sent the judge a note that read: \u201cWe have been stalemated[:] not guilty two, guilty ten.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">After hearing this bad news, counsel for appellant asked the court to declare a mistrial on the grounds that \u201cthe Court and the parties are now privy to the numerical split and further deliberation, knowing that this is the numerical split, gets to be coercive.\u201d The trial judge disagreed and told counsel that he was going to give the jury an \u201cinterim instruction.\u201d Defense counsel objected to any further instruction on the ground that such an instruction was \u201ceven more coercive ... if you now give them a specific instruction dealing with [the stalemate].\u201d After defense counsel\u2019s objection was noted, the trial judge gave the jury the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>I have your note. And I appreciate the time you\u2019ve already put in. But I\u2019m going to have you continue to deliberate with one additional instruction. And I\u2019ll say now that <em>it is not unusual for there to be difficulty [sic] in part of the system. The verdict that we hope you reach must be the considered judgment of each of you, as I told you earlier. In order to reach a verdict, obviously, all of you must agree. And that is where the problem is coming in.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-5\">Your verdict must be unanimous. You must consult with one another and deliberate with a view toward reaching agreement if you can do so without doing violence to your individual judgment. And each of you must decide this case, as I told you earlier, for yourself, but only after an impartial consideration of the evidence with your fellow jurors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-6\">So what that means is during these deliberations, and when you go back to deliberate, don\u2019t hesitate to re-examine your own views.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-7\">You should change your opinion if you are convinced that you are wrong, but you should not surrender your honest belief as to the weight or effect of the evidence only because of the opinion of your fellow jurors or for the mere purpose of reaching a verdict or an agreement on a particular charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-8\">My suggestion is that you re-examine the evidence, discuss it further, as if anew. And see where that takes you. It is 10 after 3:00. It is my intention to continue to have you continue to deliberate until probably around the 4:15, 4:30 mark, and then we\u2019ll see where we are, all right? So with that further instruction, please resume your deliberations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">After the court gave the jury the above instruction, defense counsel voiced the following objection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-11\">Well, Your Honor, now that the Court has actually given the instructions, I renew my request for the mistrial now that the numerical split has been revealed. And not only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>the numerical split. It appears they have reached a verdict as to Count 1. They are working on Count 2. We now know the inner workings of that jury. So now, giving them ... that type of instruction, it is going to be coercive to the jurors who are in the minority, the two jurors. And I believe that is the problem with the Court\u2019s instruction. So I renew my request for a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">The trial judge disagreed with defense counsel and observed that he had no way of knowing whether the jury had reached a verdict as to Count 1. He also said (perceptively) that he did not believe that the fact that the jury had \u201crevealed a split on a particular count\u201d would make further instructions coercive inasmuch as the split would have existed whether or not the jury had announced the nature of their division. The court went on to reject defense counsel\u2019s argument because in its view if such logic were to obtain, any further instruction would be coercive, as would <em>any </em>further deliberation, which the court did not believe to be the law.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The jury continued its deliberation until 4:35 p.m., at which time they were excused for the evening. Jury deliberations commenced the next morning, and at 10:50 a.m., the jurors returned their verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Except for the emphasized portion of the instructions, and the benign two and one-half sentences that preceded it, the court\u2019s instructions were in conformity with the ABA approved Allen charge, which is set forth in the Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instructions. <em>See </em>MPJI-Cr 2:01 at 16 (1997).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>Appellant now complains that the trial judge deviated from the approved language of the ABA Allen charge when he included in the instruction the words that we have emphasized in the instructions. More specifically, appellant complains that it was improper for the court to tell the jury \u201cthat a hung jury is a difficulty for the judicial system.\u201d Also, according to appellant, it was improper for the court to tell the jury that \u201cthe fact that two of them are in disagreement with the others is a \u2018problem.\u2019\u201d Appellant argues that, while \u201cthe deviation from the approved ABA instruction may appear to be slight, the coercive effect on the two jurors voting to acquit is immeasurable because the trial court is telling them they [the dissenters] are the problem.\u201d None of these reasons for objecting to the instruction were raised below.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Maryland Rule 4-325(e) provides that unless an appellate court, on its own initiative or at the suggestion of a party, takes cognizance of \u201cplain error\u201d contained in an instruction, \u201c[n]o party may assign as error [on appeal] the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless the party objects on the record promptly after the court instructs the jury, stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the objection.\u201d In light of the provisions of Maryland 4-325(e), appellant waived the aforementioned objections.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">As an alternate argument, appellant alleges that the trial court abused its discretion by giving the American Bar Association version of the Allen charge after the court and counsel were advised as to the \u201cnumerical split\u201d among the jurors. This exact contention was considered and rejected in <em>Mayfield v. State, </em>302 Md. 624, 631-32, 490 A.2d 687 (1985). For the reasons set forth in <em>Mayfield, </em>we find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>JUDGMENT AFFIRMED;</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b622-10\">.

Whether a statement by an out-of-court declarant is testimonial and thus subject to the evidentiary restrictions is a question of constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>law subject to plenary review by an appellate court. <em>See Connecticut v.

In her tape-recorded statement, Sylvia Crawford admitted that she led her husband to the victim\u2019s apartment and therefore, according to the State, facilitated the assault upon the victim. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 40, 124 S.Ct. 1354.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b633-8\">. In <em>Davis, </em>portions of the 911 tape, which we have not quoted, were also admitted into evidence. The United States Supreme Court was not required to decide whether the admission of the other parts of the 911 tape (which were testimonial) was harmless error\u2014as the Washington Supreme Court had held.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b639-4\">. The State argues that it does not matter whether Darby's statement was testimonial because the Supreme Court, in <em>Crawford, </em>\"did not extend its ruling to dying declarations.\u201d Actually, the Supreme Court, in <em>Crawford, </em>simply left open the question as to whether the testimonialnontestimonial distinction was applicable to statements that fell within the ambit of the common law rule that dying declarations, although hearsay, were admissible. <em>See </em>fn. 3, <em>supra. </em>Some courts, which have decided cases since <em>Crawford, </em>have ruled that, even if a statement contained in a dying declaration is \"testimonial,\u201d it is still admissible. Other courts reject that view. It is, however, unnecessary for us to decide this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">In <em>People v. Monterroso, </em>34 Cal.4th 743, 22 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 101 P.3d 956 (2004), the Supreme Court of California said:</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Defendant asserts that <em>Crawford </em>has abrogated the exception for dying declarations. Yet the holding of <em>Crawford </em>does no such thing, inasmuch as the challenged out-of-court statements there were admitted by the state court under a finding that the statements bore \u2018particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Crawford, supra, </em>124 S.Ct. at 1357.) The analysis in <em>Crawford, </em>which relies heavily on the right of confrontation as it existed, \"at common law, admitting only those exceptions established at the time of the founding\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 1365), also fails to support defendant\u2019s position. Although the high court found \u201cscant evidence that exceptions were invoked to admit <em>testimonial </em>statements against the accused in a <em>criminal case </em>\u201d at common law <em>{id. </em>at 1367), \u201c[t]he one deviation we have found involves dying declarations. The existence of that exception as a general rule of criminal hearsay law cannot be disputed. [Citations.] Although many dying declarations may not be testimonial, there is authority for admitting even those that clearly are. We need not decide in this case whether the Sixth Amendment incorporates an exception for testimonial dying declarations. If this exception must be accepted on historical grounds, it is <em>sui generis.\" {Id. </em>at 1367, fn. 6.) Confronted now with the precise issue, we conclude that the dying declaration in this case passes constitutional muster.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Dying declarations were admissible at common law in felony cases, even when the defendant was not present at the time the statement was taken. (T. Peake, Evidence (3rd ed. 1808) p. 64.) In particular, the common law allowed \u201c 'the declaration of the deceased, after the mortal blow, as to the fact itself, and the party by whom it was committed,\u2019 \" provided that \" 'the deceased at the time of making such declarations was conscious of his danger.' \u201d <em>(King v. Reason </em>(K.B. 1722) 16 How. St. Tr. 1, 24\u201425). To exclude such evidence as violative of the right to confrontation \"would not only be contrary to all the precedents in England and here, acquiesced in long since the adoption of these constitutional provisions, but it would be abhorrent to that sense of justice and regard for individual security and public safety which its exclusion in some cases would inevitably set at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>naught. But dying declarations, made under certain circumstances, were admissible at common law, and that common law was not repudiated by our constitution in the clause referred to, but adopted and cherished.\u201d <em>State v. Houser </em>(Mo. 1858) 26 Mo. 431, 438; accord, <em>Mattox v. United States </em>(1895) 156 U.S. 237, 243-244, 15 S.Ct. 337, 39 L.Ed. 409 [\"from time immemorial they have been treated as competent testimony, and no one would have the hardihood at this day to question their admissibility\u201d]. Thus, if, as <em>Crawford </em>teaches, the confrontation clause \"is not naturally read as a reference to the right of confrontation at common law, admitting only those exceptions established at the time of the founding.\u201d <em>(Crawford, </em>supra, 124 S.Ct. at 1365, citing <em>Houser, supra, </em>26 Mo. at 433-435), it follows that the common law pedigree of the exception for dying declarations poses no conflict with the Sixth Amendment. We therefore conclude the admission of Patel\u2019s dying declaration was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">34 Cal.4th at 764-65, 101 P.3d at 972 (footnotes omitted). <em>See also Harkins v.
