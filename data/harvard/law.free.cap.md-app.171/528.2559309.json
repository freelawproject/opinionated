The parties [Margaret K. and appellant/cross-appellee Janice M.] are not and have never been married to each other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-10\">4. One child was adopted as a result of the parties\u2019 relationship, namely: Maya [M.] (hereafter \u201cMaya\u201d), born on January 8, 1999 and adopted from India by [Janice M.] in 2000. Maya is in the present care and custody of [Janice M.].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-11\">6. The parties entered into a committed domestic relationship in 1987 and continued to reside together until the Fall of 2004.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>9. [Margaret K.] participated in the adoption process to the extent she was able to but was limited in some respects because of the international laws related to children being adopted by gay parents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-5\">10. [Margaret K.] was present when Maya arrived in the United States and has acted as her parent ever since.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">11. Upon Maya\u2019s arrival home, [Margaret K.] participated fully as Maya\u2019s parent, she fed, bathed, played with and cared for Maya.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-7\">12. Prior to the parties\u2019 separation, [Margaret K.] regularly cared for Maya, regularly picked her up from daycare/pre-school, and regularly spent time with her attending school field trips, choir practices and horse back riding practices and competitions, family vacations and other social functions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-8\">13. [Margaret K] has provided for Maya\u2019s needs including purchasing essential baby and children\u2019s products, food, toys and providing financial support for [Janice M.] to purchase necessities for Maya.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-9\">14. Since the separation [Janice M.] has significantly, arbitrarily and unreasonably limited [Margaret K.] in her ability to participate in activities with Maya....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-10\">16. On or about January 18th [of 2005, Janice M.] left several threatening phone messages on [Margaret K.\u2019s] answering machine threatening to never allow her to see Maya again. [Janice M.] has placed Maya in the middle of this dispute and has not acted in Maya\u2019s best interest....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-11\">18. [Margaret] was listed as Maya\u2019s parent when she began daycare, however, [Janice] listed [Margaret] as Maya\u2019s \u201cgodparent\u201d when Maya entered kindergarten this past fall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>20. [Margaret] and Maya have a parent-child bond that is being adversely affected by [Janice\u2019s] actions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-4\">21. [Janice] consented to the relationship between Maya and [Margaret].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">22. [Janice] has consented to and fostered the relationship between Maya and [Margaret].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-6\">26. [Margaret] is Maya\u2019s de facto parent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-7\">27. It is in Maya\u2019s best interest that custody of her be granted to [Margaret].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-8\">29. It is in Maya\u2019s best interest that [Margaret] have an established schedule of visitation with her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">On April 26, 2005, Margaret filed a VERIFIED EMERGENCY MOTION FOR VISITATION WITH MINOR CHILD that included the following assertions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-10\">1. The parties in this action were in a romantic relationship for 17 years during which [Janice] adopted their daughter, Maya, from India in 1999. Neither party to this action is Maya\u2019s birth mother and, although [Janice] was the child\u2019s adoptive parent for reasons related to international adoption laws and preferences, the parties have at all times raised Maya as co-parents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-11\">10. [Janice] and Maya always referred to [Margaret] as Maya\u2019s parent. Attached as Exhibit E and incorporated here by reference are a few cards from Maya and [Janice] regarding [Margaret\u2019s] role as Maya\u2019s parent. These cards overwhelmingly establish through [Janice] herself, the parent-child bond and relationship between [Margaret] and Maya. Specifically, [Janice] states in one card, \u201cI love you <em>&amp; </em>I thank God every day you are my partner &amp; Maya\u2019s mom [emphasis in original].\u201d Some cards are from Maya written by [Janice] where Maya refers to [Margaret] as her \u201cbhati\u201d and the cards are wishing her a happy mother\u2019s day and are Mommy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>birthday cards from Maya. In addition, [Janice] and Maya gave [Margaret] a Mother\u2019s Day letter attached as part of this exhibit wherein [Janice] thanks [Margaret] for \u201ctaking on such a load of responsibility for Maya, the house and me\u201d and for \u201call the emotional, physical and financial support you give freely.\u201d Maya, through [Janice\u2019s] writings, thanks [Margaret] for \u201cfully focusing on my needs first-always\u201d and for \u201cpicking me up and hugging me on demand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-5\">12. The unjustifiable denial of all access between Maya and [Margaret] is harmful to Maya. It is not in Maya\u2019s best interest to be denied all access to one of her mothers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">13. Maryland law allows de facto parents to obtain visitation in cases such as this one. To determine if a person is a de facto parent, the Maryland courts rely on the test set forth in <em>S.F. v. M.D., </em>132 Md.App. 99, 751 A.2d 9 (2000) which was derived from <em>In re Custody of H.S.H.-K, </em>193 Wis.2d 649, 533 N.W.2d 419 (1995), and <em>V.C. v. M.J.B., </em>163 N.J. 200, 748 A.2d 539 (2000). The test requires that \u201cthe legal parent must consent to and foster the relationship between the third party and the child; the third party must be have lived with the child; the third party must perform parental functions for the child to a significant degree; and most importantly, a parent-child bond must be forged.\u201d <em>S.F. v. M.D., </em>132 Md.App. at 111, 751 A.2d 9. Margaret [K.] meets the requirements of a de facto parent and therefore is entitled to visitation with her de facto daughter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">After the parties filed many more motions than were necessary,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the circuit court held an evidentiary hearing on the merits of Margaret\u2019s requests for custody and visitation. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>the conclusion of that hearing, Margaret\u2019s counsel delivered a closing argument that included the following assertions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-5\">The law does not give [Janice M.] in this situation the unfettered right to say somebody who lived with Maya every single day that she was in this country until August of 2004 suddenly is out of her life. Let\u2019s not miss the fact that whether [Janice M.] is a biological parent, a natural parent, an adoptive parent, this is not a situation as in many of these cases where somebody has a child or adopts a child and then takes on a partner, a spouse, a domestic partner, and you have a bond that was created between the biological mother and the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">This is a case where regardless of who legally is the mother, both of these parties cared for and were with Maya everyday from the moment she came to this country at the end of 1999 until 2004. Other than the decree of adoption and the unquestionable fact that [Janice M.] was the adoptive parent, Maya was with Janice [M.]-I didn\u2019t butcher it until now. Maya was with Margaret [K.] every day of her life in this country until August of 2004.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-7\">... The only reason that Margaret [K.] has been deprived of the opportunity to have a relationship with her daughter is because she wasn\u2019t on that decree of adoption. You have basically a scorned partner after a 15, 16, 17 year relationship who says, I\u2019m going to get back at my partner. The hell with my child! I don\u2019t care that she had a relationship with my child and made her breakfast every morning. Something that was not refuted. Made her dinner every evening. Picked her up from school every single day. My kid be damned! I\u2019m hurt. This woman does not have a relationship with my child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-8\">Basically, everything that the testimony showed was that this relationship was no different than any committed relationship; be that, two, same sex partners, two heterosexual unmarried partners or an old married couple. I don\u2019t mean <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>to offend anybody, but in the sense of old married people together for 17 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-4\">They were together for an extended period of time and whatever precursors there may have been to have a child together, to raise that child together, and the fact that this relationship broke up is not a reason why the relationship between Maya and Margaret [K.] should be severed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">From the conflicting evidence presented at the hearing, the circuit court was not clearly erroneous in accepting that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">At the conclusion of Margaret\u2019s case-in-chief, the circuit court granted Janice\u2019s \u201cmotion for judgment\u201d on the issue of custody,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-7\">I find that whatever rights [Janice M.] has as a natural parent she would have as a adoptive parent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-8\">... [I]n this case where you have a disputed custody case between a third-party and a biological parent, a natural parent of the child, the presumption is in favor of custody in the biological parent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-9\">This presumption exists. It can be rebutted by a finding of a lack of fitness on the biological parent\u2019s part or the existence of extraordinary circumstances which are significantly detrimental to the child remaining in the custody of the biological parent or parents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-10\">At this stage in the proceedings the court has to look at all evidence\u2014all inferences of the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, who would be the plaintiff. Even looking at this in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, there\u2019s no evidence as to lack of fitness on the part of the defendant. So that prong is not satisfied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>... <em>Karen P. v. Christopher J.B. </em>at 163 Md.App. 250, 878 A.2d 646[ (2005)], I think that case can be distinguished from the facts of this case. In that case the biological parent abruptly removed the child from the State of Maryland making it almost impossible for the person seeking custody, Christopher in that case, to communicate with them. The biological parent did not allow the child to see Christopher except infrequently with restrictions, including that visitation had to be in her presence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\">Basically, in that case the court found that the biological parent through a pattern of immaturity and selfishness in an effort to elevate her own personal interests took actions which actually rendered the child fatherless to break the bond totally between the father and the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">... I don\u2019t see where the facts of this case rise to the level of extraordinary, exceptional or compelling circumstances or even close. So I\u2019m going to grant the motion as to custody, and we\u2019ll proceed on the visitation issues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">At the conclusion of all the evidence, the circuit court delivered an on-the-record opinion that included the following findings and conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">Under the case of <em>S.F. v. M.D.[, </em>132 Md.App. 99, 751 A.2d 9 (2000)], since we\u2019re dealing strictly with visitation right now, having already dismissed the issue of custody at the end of [Margaret K.\u2019s] case, I find that [Margaret K.] is a de facto parent under that case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-9\">The four factors are met. The first one being, did the legal parent consent to and foster the relationship between the third-party and the child? Clearly, I believe [Janice M.] did do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-10\">There\u2019s no question that the second prong is met. The third-party must have lived with the child. [Margaret K.] lived with the child for about three and a half years I believe it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-11\">The third factor, the third party must perform parental functions for the child to a significant degree. I think that\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>very clear from all the testimony. Plus, it\u2019s clear from a lot of exhibits, the cards and the letters\u2014I mean, the e-mails and so forth. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s much in dispute, or, if it\u2019s in dispute, Pm finding that [Margaret K.] did perform parental functions for the child to a significant degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\">And then the fourth factor, which the case says is the most important, is there a parent-child bond that had been forged? I think the evidence is clear that that\u2019s occurred as well. In fact, in [Margaret K.\u2019s] No. 10, the letter from Janice [M.] dated October 6th of '04, she says in here, I know that she, meaning Maya, cares about you, et cetera, et cetera. She acknowledges the fact that the child cares about [Margaret K.].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">So I find that [Margaret K.] is a de facto parent. Having found that in the context of visitation, there then is no presumption in favor of the biological parent, or here, the adoptive parent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-7\">So then you look at the best interests of the child, and the court finds as a matter of fact that it is in the best interests of the child that there be visitation with [Margaret K.]. It was not only her testimony, but it was also the testimony of the other witnesses that there is this relationship, and I\u2019m finding that it would be detrimental that it be cut off totally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-8\">That\u2019s not to say that [Janice M.] is not fit. I think both of these people are fit to be\u2014would be fit to be custodians of Maya.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">Neither party was entirely satisfied with the rulings of the circuit court. In support of her argument that Margaret K. is not entitled to visitation, Janice M. presents four questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-10\">I. DID THE TRIAL COURT ERR IN HOLDING THAT MARGARET [K.] WAS A <em>DE FACTO </em>PARENT WITH STANDING TO SEEK VISITATION WITH JANICE [M.]\u2019S DAUGHTER, MAYA [M.]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-11\">II. WAS THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S DECISION UNCONSTITUTIONAL BECAUSE IT FAILED TO GIVE <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>DEFERENCE TO [JANICE M.]\u2019S DECISION REGARDING VISITATION BETWEEN HER DAUGHTER AND A THIRD PARTY?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-5\">III. DID THE TRIAL COURT ERR IN AWARDING VISITATION TO A THIRD PARTY OVER THE OBJECTIONS OF A FIT CUSTODIAL PARENT IN THE ABSENCE OF EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-6\">IV. DID THE TRIAL COURT ERR IN ORDERING A SCHEDULE OF VISITATION THAT IS CONTRARY TO MAYA\u2019S BEST INTERESTS AND NOT SUPPORTED BY THE EVIDENCE?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">In support of her argument that the circuit court erroneously granted Janice M.\u2019s motion for judgment on the issue of custody, Margaret K. also presents us with four questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-8\">I. Was the trial court\u2019s finding that Margaret [K.] is a de facto parent supported by the record?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-9\">II. Was the trial court\u2019s determination that awarding visitation to Margaret [K.] is in the best interest of the child supported by the record?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-10\">III. If the trial court\u2019s award of visitation to a <em>de facto </em>parent consistent with constitutional requirements?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-11\">IV. Did the trial court fail to apply the correct legal standard for determining whether exceptional circumstances exist to support an award of custody to Margaret [K.]?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-12\">For the reasons that follow, we shall (1) affirm the order granting Margaret K.\u2019s request for visitation, and (2) affirm the judgment granting Janice M.\u2019s motion for judgment on the issue of custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-13\"><em>De Facto </em>Parenthood</p>\n<p id=\"b516-14\">In <em>S.F. v. M.D., </em>132 Md.App. 99, 751 A.2d 9 (2000), Judge James Eyler stated for this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-15\">In determining whether one is a de facto parent, we employ the test enunciated in <em>In re Custody of H.S.H.-K, </em>193 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Wis.2d 649, 533 N.W.2d 419 (1995), and <em>V.C. v. </em>163 N.J. 200, 748 A.2d 539 (2000). Under that test, \u201cthe legal parent must consent to and foster the relationship between the third party and the child; the third party must have lived with the child; the third party must perform parental functions for the child to a significant degree; and most important, a parent-child bond must be forged.\u201d ... Consequently, ... a non-biological, non-adoptive parent, ... [who] is a de facto parent, ... is not required to show unfitness of the biological parent or exceptional circumstances ... [to be] entitled to visitation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 111-12, 751 A.2d 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">The person who claims to be a child\u2019s <em>de facto </em>parent must successfully shoulder the burdens of (1) pleading, (2) production of evidence, and (3) persuasion. We can take judicial notice that in almost every home occupied by adults and children, the adults perform <em>some </em>parental functions on behalf of the children. Under the above quoted test, however, a person who performed parental functions is not entitled to <em>de facto </em>parent status unless the court finds as a fact that the child\u2019s legal parent has actually fostered such a relationship. Because the test we adopted in <em>S.F. v. M.D., supra, </em>is a strict one, neither our holding in that case nor our holding in the case at bar will open the floodgates to claims of <em>de facto </em>parenthood asserted by persons who can prove nothing more than that, while living with the natural or adoptive parent of a child, they performed some parental functions on behalf of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Rare are the cases like the case at bar, in which the circuit court was presented with evidence that (as summarized in the argument of Margaret K.\u2019s counsel) \u201cMaya was with Margaret [K.] every day of her life in this country until August of 2004[and][t]he only reason that Margaret [K.] has been deprived of the opportunity to have a relationship with her daughter is because she wasn\u2019t on that decree of adoption.\u201d Under these circumstances, there is no merit in Janice M.\u2019s argument that the evidence presented to the circuit court was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>insufficient to support the factual finding that Margaret K. is Maya\u2019s <em>defacto </em>parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Conclusions</p>\n<p id=\"Ah0\">A. Visitation</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Janice M. argues that our holding in <em>S.F. v. M.D. </em>has been modified by <em>Troxel v. Granville, </em>530 U.S. 57, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000), in which the United States Supreme Court addressed the constitutionality of a \u201cgrandparent visitation\u201d statute. According to Janice M., because the evidence presented in the case at bar does not establish that judicial action is necessary \u201cto prevent harm or potential harm to the child,\u201d the circuit court\u2019s visitation award constituted an unconstitutional interference with her fundamental right to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of Maya. We are persuaded, however, that <em>Troxel </em>did not modify <em>S.F. v. M.D. </em>We therefore hold that the circuit court neither erred nor abused its discretion in concluding that, because visitation with Margaret K. is in Maya\u2019s best interest, Margaret K. is entitled to visitation with her <em>de facto </em>daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">B. Custody</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">In <em>McDermott v. Dougherty, </em>385 Md. 320, 869 A.2d 751 (2005), the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-9\">In a [custody dispute] in which both parents seek custody, each parent proceeds in possession, so to speak, of a constitutionally-protected fundamental parental right. Neither parent has a superior claim to the exercise of this right to provide \u201ccare, custody, and control\u201d of the children____ Effectively, then, each fit parent\u2019s constitutional right neutralizes the other parent\u2019s constitutional right, leaving, generally, the best interests of the child as the <em>sole standard </em>to apply to these types of custody decisions. Thus, in evaluating each parent\u2019s request for custody, the parents commence as presumptive equals and a trial court undertakes a balancing of each parent\u2019s relative merits to serve as. the primary custodial parent; the child\u2019s best interests tips the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>scale in favor of an award of custody to one parent or the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-4\">Where the dispute is between a fit parent and private third party, however, both parties do not begin on equal footing in respect to rights to \u201ccare, custody, and control\u201d of the children. The parent is asserting a fundamental constitutional right. The third party is not. A private third party has no fundamental constitutional right to raise the children of others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 353, 869 A.2d 751. The <em>McDermott </em>Court thereafter established the following standards for \u201cthird-party\u201d custody disputes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-6\">[I]n private custody actions involving private third-parties where the parents are fit, absent extraordinary <em>(i.e. </em>exceptional) circumstances, the constitutional right is the ultimate determinative factor; and only if the parents are unfit or extraordinary circumstances exist is the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d test to be considered!)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 418-19, 869 A.2d 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">Janice M. argues that <em>McDermott, supra, </em>prohibits an award of custody to the child\u2019s <em>defacto </em>parent unless the court finds either that (1) the child\u2019s legal parent is unfit, or (2) the custody dispute presents (in the words of the <em>McDermott </em>Court) \u201cextraordinary (i.e. exceptional) circumstances.\u201d We agree with this argument, which is consistent with <em>Karen P. v. Christopher J.B., </em>163 Md.App. 250, 878 A.2d 646 (2005) in which Judge Deborah Eyler applied the \u201cfit parent/exceptional circumstances\u201d standard after reviewing all of the \u201creported Maryland custody cases in which the child, from the time of birth or infancy, grew up in a family unit with the biological mother and the third party occupying the role of father.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 269, 878 A.2d 646. In each of those cases, which included <em>Monroe v. Monroe, </em>329 Md. 758, 621 A.2d 898 (1993), \u201cthe third party occupied the role of a parent toward the child, and a parent/child bond developed between the third party and the child, while they both lived with the biological mother as a family unit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 274, 621 A.2d 898.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>In <em>Monroe, supra, </em>the Court of Appeals held that the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d test was applicable to a custody dispute between the child\u2019s mother and \u201can acknowledged, though, in fact, non-biological, parent,\u201d stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-5\">Prior to [the child\u2019s] birth, having been told, and after investigation, having come to believe, that she was his child, [the respondent] allowed his name to be placed on the birth certificate as her father and proceeded to act as her father. He was present in the delivery room when she was born and he lived with her and her mother ... both before and after he married her mother, from the time of [the child\u2019s] birth. He has, in short, treated the child as if she were his biological child from the time of her birth up to, and beyond, the determination that he is not.... Indeed, [the respondent] had joint custody with the petitioner. The evidence at the hearing further tended to prove that the child viewed the respondent as her father; she is bonded to him, and he to her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-6\">From this evidence, a trier of fact could find, as the master did, exceptional circumstances. In any event, the issue is not one that can be resolved as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 776-77, 621 A.2d 898.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">In the case at bar, the record shows that both parties lived with Maya from 1999 to September of 2004, when Margaret K. (in the words of her Motion for Visitation) \u201cleft the parties\u2019 home and moved into a two bedroom apartment 1.5 miles from the home so that she could visit regularly with Maya and have a place to sleep when Maya was with her.\u201d At this point, the parties agreed that Janice M. would be Maya\u2019s custodial parent, and that Margaret K. would have liberal visitation. Under these circumstances, the circuit court was not clearly erroneous in finding that Margaret K.\u2019s evidence was insufficient (in the words of the <em>Monroe </em>Court) \u201cto support [a] determination that exceptional circumstances existed in this case to rebut the presumption that [Maya\u2019s] best interest lay with being in the custody of her mother.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 777, 621 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>898. We therefore affirm the denial of Margaret K.\u2019s complaint for custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; EACH PARTY TO PAY 50% OF THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b508-12\">. There are cases in which it is appropriate that this Court, on its own initiative, change the caption of a case out of concern for the parties\u2019 privacy. <em>See, e.g., Karen v. Christopher, </em>163 Md.App. 250, 254 n. 1, 878 A.2d 646 (2005). As we are persuaded that the case at bar is such a case, we shall use the initials of the last names of the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b511-8\">.
