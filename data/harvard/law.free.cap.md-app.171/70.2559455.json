(retired, specially assigned), JJ.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b100-4\">DAVIS, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Appellant/cross-appellee Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (Wells Fargo), in its role as trustee for the registered holders of the commercial mortgage backed securities for a loan held by appellee/cross-appellant Diamond Point Plaza Limited Partnership, <em>et al. </em>(Diamond Point), brought suit in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County against Diamond Point alleging breach of contract based on loan default, fraud and misrepresentation and conversion of funds. Wells Fargo also sued appellees/cross-appellants Sam\u2019s P.W., Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (Sam\u2019s and Wal-Mart, respectively), for various breaches of a lease agreement between landlord (Diamond Point) and tenant (Sam\u2019s).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Upon considering cross-motions for summary judgment from the parties, the court denied Diamond Point\u2019s motion but granted partial summary judgment in favor of Sam\u2019s, concluding that it did not violate a radius restriction contained in the lease and partial summary judgment in favor of Wells Fargo, finding that Sam\u2019s violated a retail use restriction. After the remaining issues were presented at a bench trial, the court ruled in favor of Wells Fargo and entered judgment against Diamond Point and Sam\u2019s, finding several breaches. The court also concluded that Wells Fargo did not satisfy its burden of proof to recover reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. Wells Fargo presents the following three issues for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-7\">1. Whether the Circuit Court erroneously concluded that the seven mile radius restriction in the Sam\u2019s lease could not be violated in the absence of simultaneous operation of both the Diamond Point store and another store within the restricted area when the lease provided that, \u201cTenant agrees that it [and its Affiliates] shall not, during the term of this lease, own operate, manage or have any financial interest in, any store or business located within a radius of seven (7) miles from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Shopping Center and similar to that then being conducted upon the demised premises;\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-5\">2. Whether the Circuit Court erroneously concluded that the default provisions of the Sam\u2019s lease under Article 20 did not provide for recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees by Wells Fargo against Sam\u2019s and Wal-Mart; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-6\">3. Whether the Circuit Court erroneously concluded that Wells Fargo was not entitled to recover attorneys\u2019 fees or expenses from any of the [appellees/cross-appellants] under the contracts at issue because it failed to apportion its fees on a line-by-line basis as to every time entry on its bills.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Sam\u2019s and Wal-Mart responded by filing a cross-appeal, seeking our review of the following six questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-8\">1. Did the circuit court correctly conclude that the \u201cradius restriction\u201d in the subject lease was not violated absent the simultaneous operation of both the Diamond Point Plaza store and another store within the designated area?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-9\">2. Did the circuit court erroneously conclude that Appellant proved that The Wire\u2019s presence in the former Sam\u2019s Club space at Diamond Point Plaza proximately caused $1,250,000 in damages to the property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-10\">3. Did the circuit court erroneously award $56,000 damages for violation of the \u201cradius restriction\u201d arising from a Sam\u2019s Club store located in Port Covington, Maryland!;?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-11\">4. Did the circuit court erroneously conclude that WalMart is liable for breach of the subject lease to which it is not a party?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-12\">5. Did the circuit court correctly conclude that the default provisions of the subject lease do not permit Appellant to recover attorneys\u2019 fees against Sam\u2019s PW and WalMart in the instant case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-13\">6. Was any error in granting summary judgment on Appellant\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fee claim harmless inasmuch as Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>pellant failed to meet its burden of attributing reasonable and necessary fees to the claims against Sam\u2019s PW and Wal-Mart?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Diamond Point also filed a cross-appeal, presenting five questions for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\">1. Does carve-out liability for the full amount of the non-recourse loan at issue in this case exist for fraud, misrepresentation, or gross negligence when (a) the borrower disclosed information that forms the basis for the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment for recourse liability; (b) there is no evidence that the loan would not have been made or that its terms would have been any different but for the alleged misrepresentations; and (c) there is no evidence that Wells Fargo was even aware of the alleged misstatements, much less that it suffered any damages as a result of them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-7\">2. Did the borrower have the right under the loan documents to keep rents that it collected prior to its default and the lender\u2019s assignee\u2019s demand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-8\">3. Did the borrower commit \u201cwaste\u201d by allegedly failing to maintain roofs it was given no notice or opportunity to repair, or by failing to commence litigation to prevent a tenant from violating a lease radius restriction when the violation lasted less than three months?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-9\">4. Did the Circuit Court otherwise err in awarding damages?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-10\">5. Did the Circuit Court properly deny Wells Fargo\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">Diamond Point and its affiliates<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> own and operate Diamond Point Plaza (the Center), a retail shopping center located in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>eastern Baltimore County, which consists of three buildings containing space available for leasing to commercial tenants. Two of the largest tenants at the Center were Sam\u2019s Club, which executed an Assignment and Assumption of Lease on January 5,1994, and Ames Department Store, which began its tenancy on April 13, 1989. In 2002, both stores closed or \u201cwent dark.\u201d The Sam\u2019s Club store closed on July 31, 2002 and, pursuant to its lease, continued to pay its base monthly rent. After filing for bankruptcy in August 2001 and announcing its decision to liquidate its \u201coperations and to close all of the remaining Ames locations\u201d in August 2002, the Ames store at the Center closed in late October of 2002. After Ames rejected the lease in bankruptcy court, it made no further rent payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">In July of 1999, prior to the closing of the Sam\u2019s and Ames stores, Diamond Point and its affiliates sought to refinance the commercial loan on the Center because the original loan was scheduled to mature in January of 2000. Diamond Point submitted a refinancing application to Pinnacle Capital Group (Pinnacle), which was approved in June of 2000 in the amount of $15,300,000. At the loan closing, the loan and loan documents were assigned to Paine Webber Real Estate Securities, Inc. (Paine Webber), \u201cwhich provided the funding to close the [l]oan.\u201d Wells Fargo became the assignee of the loan \u201cby merger,\u201d resulting in the assignment of the \u201c[n]ote, [m]ortgage, and all [l]oan [documents\u201d to Wells Fargo as of August 15,2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">As a result of Ames\u2019 failure to pay rent to Diamond Point for November of 2002, Diamond Point failed to make its November 2002 loan payment to Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo initially filed suit on March 7, 2003 against Diamond Point, alleging breach of contract based on the loan default, fraud and/or misrepresentation in obtaining the refinancing loan and conversion of funds due and owing to Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo then amended its complaint on September 15, 2003 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>add breach of retail use restriction and radius restriction claims against Sam\u2019s and Wal-Mart. Subsequently, Wells Fargo filed a Third Amended Complaint on July 21, 2004, alleging the following in its complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-4\">Diamond [Point] and its affiliates, agents or employees breached the contracts within the Loan Documents in numerous ways including the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-5\">a. By failing to disclose to Paine Webber and Wells Fargo what it and its affiliates knew prior to closing on the Loan with regard to Sam\u2019s intention to vacate the Property, in violation of its duties____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-7\">b. By falsely affirming that it knew of no tenant\u2019s intention to vacate the Property when in fact it had specific knowledge of Sam\u2019s intention to vacate the Property, in violation of \u00b6 21 of the Certificate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-8\">c. By failing to disclose to Paine Webber and Wells Fargo attributes of the Property that could reasonably be expected to cause an institutional investor to regard the loan as an unacceptable investment and could affect the Loan\u2019s value and marketability, ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-9\">d. By failing to enforce the Lease provisions against Sam\u2019s when Sam\u2019s breached the Lease by owning, operating, managing or having a financial interest in any store or business within 7 miles of Diamond Point, ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-10\">e. By failing to enforce the Lease against Sam\u2019s and Wal-Mart when iVthey sublet the Property to a non-retail tenant without notifying Diamond and obtaining its consent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-11\">f. By committing waste upon the Property by not properly maintaining the roof and other structures, ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-12\">g. By failing to maintain its status as a Single Purpose Entity, ...; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-13\">h. By wrongfully transferring, misappropriating or otherwise converting Rents after an Event of Default,____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>These breaches constitute fraud, intentional misrepresentation, gross negligence, willful misconduct, waste, misapplication, conversion and a violation of the single purpose entity requirement and therefore entitle Wells Fargo to full recourse against Diamond [Point] for all sums due under the Loan Documents and for damages.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Atf\">Regarding Wells Fargo\u2019s allegations of fraudulent conveyance, it contended:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-5\">It is believed and therefore averred that the $633,000 conveyance by Diamond [Point] to Michael Konover and/or to MCK after Diamond\u2019s default on its payment obligations to Wells Fargo was made when Diamond [Point] was legally insolvent or when such payment rendered Diamond [Point] insolvent, was made by Diamond [Point] without fair consideration, was made by Diamond [Point] with the knowledge of its insolvency and intent or belief that it would cause Diamond [Point] to incur or continue to incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they matured, and was made by Diamond [Point] with the intent to hinder, delay and de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>fraud its largest creditor, Wells Fargo, all in violation of the Maryland Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act ... and in violation of the Loan Documents. Michael Konover and/or MCK knew of Diamond [PointJ\u2019s insolvency and accepted the conveyance with the intention of further depleting Diamond [Point]\u2019s assets to deprive Wells Fargo of the Rents to which it was rightfully owed. That $633,000 transfer was fraudulent as to Wells Fargo and Wells Fargo has been damaged as a result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Wells Fargo\u2019s claims against Sam\u2019s and Wal-Mart included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-6\">Wells Fargo\u2019s absolute assignment of all rights, titles and interests in the Lease and of all causes of action related to the Property entitles it to enforce those rights against all lessees at Diamond Point Plaza, including Sam\u2019s PW.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-7\">Sam\u2019s PW has breached the Lease in the following ways:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-8\">a. By assigning or allowing an assumption of the Lease to Sam\u2019s East and/or Wal-Mart, without notice to Diamond [Point]____;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-10\">b. By owning, operating, managing or having a financial interest in other stores within a 7 mile radius of Diamond Point Plaza, ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-11\">c. By permitting related entities, including Sam\u2019s East and Wal-Mart, to own, operate, manage and/or have a financial interest in other stores within a 7 mile radius, ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-12\">d. By allowing Wal-Mart to sublet the demised premises to The Wire without providing notice to Diamond [Point] ...; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-14\">c. [sic] By allowing the demised premises to be used for a non-retail purpose....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-15\">Although not a party to the Lease, Wal-Mart has assumed all of the liabilities under the Lease by virtue of its <em>de facto </em>assumption of the rights and liabilities under the Lease. As a result of that assumption, Wal-Mart is bound by the terms of the Lease to the same extent as Sam\u2019s PW.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>Alternatively, Sam\u2019s made a constructive and non-gratuitous assignment of the Lease to Wal-Mart, insofar as WalMart agreed to be liable for Sam\u2019s contractual obligations under the Lease and Sam\u2019s assigned all of its rights under the lease to Wal-Mart. As a result of that assignment, Wal-Mart is bound by the terms of the lease to the same extent as Sam\u2019s. Wal-Mart entered into the Wire License in October 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The Wire License had an original term of one year. WalMart, not Sam\u2019s, has extended the Wire License at least two times. Under the Wire License, Wal-Mart has the contractual right to receive payments from The Wire Productions, Inc. for its use and enjoyment of the leasehold premises. Wal-Mart has received payments from The Wire Production, Inc. for its use and enjoyment of the leasehold premises. Wal-Mart also has made payment to Wells Fargo under the Lease. Therefore, Wal-Mart has assumed all rights and liabilities under the Lease and is jointly and severally liable with Sam\u2019s PW for the breach of the Lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">In any event, Wal-Mart was bound by the radius restriction when Sam\u2019s PW assumed the obligations under the Lease and agreed under \u00b6 4(H) that neither it nor its affiliates would own, operate, manage or have a financial interest in a store within a 7 mile radius of Diamond Point. Sam\u2019s PW was expressly, impliedly and apparently authorized, by and through its common officers and employees, to contract and bind its affiliates, including Wal-Mart.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">Wal-Mart furthermore expressly authorized, directed and actively joined with Sam\u2019s PW and Sam\u2019s East in committing the violations and breaches set forth herein. Wal-Mart is equally liable to Wells Fargo for those breaches. Those breaches and violations include, but are not limited to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-8\">a. Improperly assuming and/or accepting an assignment of the Lease without notice to Diamond [Point] as required by \u00b6\u00b6 17(B) and 38(C);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>b. Improperly entering into The Wire License for a portion of Sam\u2019s leasehold space, without notice to Diamond [Point]____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-5\">c. Subletting the premises to The Wire for a use other than retail ...; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-6\">d. Owning, operating, managing or having a financial interest in another store within a 7 mile radius of Diamond Point Plaza____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">After considering the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment and hearing argument, in an Order filed January 10, 2005, the court issued the following ruling from the bench:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-9\">1. [Wells Fargo]\u2019s Amended Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is granted in part and denied in part;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-10\">2. The Amended Motion for Summary Judgment filed by the Konover entities [Diamond Point] is denied;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-11\">3. The Cross Motion for Summary Judgment of the Wal-Mart entities [Sam\u2019s P.W., Inc. and Wal-Mart, Inc.] is granted in part and denied in part.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">The Court finds the language of the lease at issue concerning the radius restriction to be unambiguous. As such, tenant Sam\u2019s agreed that it would not:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-13\">... During the term of this lease, own, operate, manage or have any financial interest in, any store or business located within a radius of seven (7) miles from the Shopping Center and similar to that then being conducted upon the demised premises.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-14\">Sam\u2019s closed its store on one day; and as a result, no store business was being conducted upon the demised premises the next day. On that next day, Sam\u2019s opened its store at Golden Ring Mall.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-15\">[Wells Fargo] argues that Sam\u2019s violated the radius restriction slightly more than two years prior to the opening of the location at Golden Ring Mall when Sam\u2019s first acquired a \u201cfinancial interest\u201d in Golden Ring Mall by entering into a letter of intent for a ground lease at that location.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>The Wal-Mart entities argue that there was no violation of the radius restriction as the lease permitted Sam\u2019s to close at any time, and by closing, the radius restriction was no longer applicable. The fact that Sam\u2019s had employees and inventory at the Golden Ring Mall location prior to the Diamond Point location going dark does not violate the radius restriction. Furthermore, if Sam\u2019s employees and inventory at the Diamond Point location once it had gone dark and the Golden Ring Mall location had opened, that too did not violate the radius restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">For the radius restriction to have been violated, the Sam\u2019s at both the Diamond Point location and the Golden Ring Mall location would have had to be open at the same time. The language of the radius restriction is unambiguous in that it requires both stores to be operating simultaneously. Therefore, unless the doors of both locations were open for business and customers were being served simultaneously, then and only then would the radius restriction have been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Similarly, the language concerning use of the demised premises is also unambiguous. So long as the tenant is open for business, \u201cthe demised premises shall only be used for lawful retail and shopping center purposes ... \u201d. The sublease to The Wire violated this use provision in the lease despite the Wal-Mart Entities\u2019 argument that the restriction applies only to the tenant\u2019s own operations of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The case proceeded to trial on April 4, 2005. After reviewing the parties\u2019 submitted Proposed Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law, the court issued its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on August 15, 2005. The court\u2019s findings were amended in an Order dated August 24, 2005, in which the court ruled that the language in Sam\u2019s rental lease \u201c[did] not entitle Wells Fargo to attorneys\u2019 fees in this case,\u201d and that Sam\u2019s and Wal-Mart were jointly and severally liable for $1,250,000.00 and $56,260.86 in damages as a result of violating the retail use and radius restrictions contained in its lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>The court also reiterated its conclusion that Wells Fargo was not \u201centitled to its reasonable and necessary attorneys\u2019 fees in enforcing the Loan Documents.\u201d At the conclusion of the two-day hearing regarding Wells Fargo\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees, the court denied its request, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-4\">... I\u2019m just not persuaded, so it is my intention to vacate that part of the partial judgment which says that [Wells Fargo] is entitled to attorney fees from Wal-Mart and Sams and to revise the finding of fact and conclusions in those respects as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-5\">All right. In addition, even if I weren\u2019t making that finding, and I guess that is an alternative finding, I don\u2019t think that [Wells Fargo] has met its burden of proof by the preponderance of the evidence regarding the fees that it seeks from Wal-Mart and Sams or from the Konover [and Diamond Point] Defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-6\">[Wells Fargo has] to meet [its] burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence that the fees are necessary and reasonable. I\u2019ve considered the factors in Rule 1.5, the Court\u2019s own two decades of experience in commercial litigation such as this case, experience in presiding over other trials in which attorney fees are at issue, and the record in this ease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-7\">Um, there is no question that [Wells Fargo] attorneys have significant experience and solid reputation in commercial litigation. And the many papers filed in the case, the oral arguments at the hearings and presentation at trial and performance at trial demonstrate their excellent skills, and that is true of each of the four attorneys representing [Wells Fargo] that appeared in this Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-8\">I don\u2019t dispute that this litigation has been complex compared to most of the other cases tried in this Court. I think that the hourly rates charged by [Wells Fargo\u2019s] lawyers reflect that high level of skill that was required and necessary to present [Wells Fargo\u2019s] claims....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>The hourly rates charged by each of [Wells Fargo\u2019s] attorneys and their paralegals I would find are reasonable and consistent with or below the market in this region. And I do appreciate the' efficiency of the manner in which [Wells Fargo\u2019s] request for fees have been presented. I don\u2019t think any other method would have been as inexpensive for clients and the Defendants from whom the fees are sought, and no other method suggested at this hearing would have been as efficient in terms of the Court\u2019s time and resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">I think that the so-called Adelberg discount of 15 percent was an appropriate measure of the duplicating incurred by substituting the Proctor law firm for the Adelberg law firm. But I don\u2019t believe it is possible that fees are reasonable and necessary without undertaking a line-by-line analysis of each legal bill. Most reluctantly, I don\u2019t believe that is possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">I also don\u2019t believe it is possible to find that fees are reasonable and necessary where the description of services has been redacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Perhaps it was good trial strategy to have more than one attorney see certain witnesses testify at deposition, and that may have been good trial preparation, but I don\u2019t think that I could find it was necessary to have more than one lawyer at any of the depositions, particularly depositions being defended.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">Nor do I think it would be fair to recover fees for more than one lawyer at deposition and at many of the hearings that were held in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">From the Konover [and Diamond Point] defendants in this case Mr. Clark has appeared for most part alone at hearings, although at trial he did have other counsel, one other attorney appeared with him, and he was alone at the deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">I also don\u2019t think it would be fair and to recover fees for paralegals at the trial or at depositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Further, I wouldn\u2019t find it reasonable or fair to collect from the debtor, under the circumstances of the case, secretarial overtime or charges for faxes or for meals of the lawyers or others involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Although the defendants have only pointed out some examples of fees which it would not be reasonable or fair, which clearly were not necessary, such as the expense for travel to South Carolina or Mr. Joyce\u2019s travel to Minnesota, which was not really explained. The inclusion of those time entries highlights the problems with [Wells Fargo] not undertaking a line-by-line analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Without having the case presented that way, although I have looked at many, many pages of these legal bills and looked at a number of individual entries, it is impossible for the Court to determine from looking at them that way whether or not the apportionment would be fair between the time and resources expended for claims against Wal-Mart and Sams as opposed to the claims against the Konover or Diamond Point defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">I think that\u2019s it.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">The court filed its Amended Final Judgment Order on December 5, 2005:</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">1. Judgment in favor of [appellant], Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Trustee, is hereby entered against [appellees/crossappellants], Diamond Point Plaza Limited Partnership, Oriole Commercial Associates Limited Partnership and Diamond Point Management Corporation for breach of \u00b6 55(A) and (B) of the Mortgage for intentional misrepresentation and gross negligence and against ...

In its brief, Wells Fargo argues that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-9\">plain and unambiguous meaning of this provision of the lease is that the Sam\u2019s/Wal-Mart defendants cannot own, operate or have a financial interest in any other stores within 7 miles of the Diamond Point store at any time during the term of the lease. To interpret the lease any other way renders the language of the radius restriction surplusage and utterly defeats the purpose of the radius restriction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>Radius Restriction</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-4\">In accordance with Maryland Rule 2-501 (a)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-5\">Any party may make a motion for summary judgment on all or part of an action on the ground that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

(G) Subject to the other provisions of this lease, Tenant shall have the right to determine how any store on the demised premises is to be operated, and to discontinue the operation of any such store, and to operate stores in other locations which are in competition with any such store. Subject to the other provisions of this lease (i) Tenant reserves the right to operate its business whether on the demised premises, or elsewhere, as it sees fit, and (ii) Landlord shall have no express or implied right to interfere in the operation of Tenant\u2019s business, or complain about or hold Tenant liable for the manner in which Tenant\u2019s busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>ness is conducted.

The term \u201ccontrol\u201d with respect to a corporation means the ownership of, and the right to exercise, more than fifty percent (50%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of the capital stock of the controlled corporation issued, outstanding and entitled to vote for the election of directors, whether such ownership be direct or indirect through control of another corporation^) or firm(s)____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Wells Fargo asserts that the court erroneously granted Sam\u2019s motion for summary judgment because Sam\u2019s violated the radius restriction contained in its lease when it opened another location at Golden Ring Mall, which was located within seven miles from the Diamond Point store after the Diamond Point location went dark.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">Wells Fargo\u2019s interpretation of the lease restriction in provision (H) is that \u201cthe phrase \u2018then being conducted on the demised premises\u2019 unambiguously refers to the earlier phrase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>in the radius restriction clause, \u2018during the term of this lease.\u2019 \u201d Wells Fargo contends that \u201c[t]he language \u2018then being conducted on the demised premises\u2019 does not refer to specific moment in time,\u201d and interprets the circuit court\u2019s decision as concluding precisely that. Wells Fargo maintains rather that the language refers to a \u201ccontinuum in time\u201d versus a specific moment, \u201cthat being the time during which the lease is in effect, <em>i.e., </em>the term of the lease.\u201d In Wells Fargo\u2019s view, such an interpretation limits Diamond Point from circumventing the radius restriction by simply closing one store and opening another \u201cdown the street.\u201d The provision prohibits not only simultaneous operations, but all operations within the restricted area. Thus, the circuit court\u2019s interpretation in Wells Fargo\u2019s view renders the clause illusory and gives it a meaning not possibly intended by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">In its reply brief, Well\u2019s Fargo dismisses the interpretation of the clause to mean no \u201ccompeting\u201d stores can be in the seven mile radius as Sam\u2019s having done \u201cwhat it declares to be forbidden by the rules of contract construction.\u201d In support, Wells Fargo cites paragraph 4(G) <em>supra </em>and highlights language stating \u201ctenant shall have the right ... to operate stores in other locations which are in competition with any such store.\u201d The lease does not contain the word compete or competing.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Wells Fargo further states that Sam\u2019s interpretation renders the phrase \u201cduring the term of this lease\u201d meaningless and nonsensical because Sam\u2019s assigns the same meaning to it and the phrase \u201cthen being conducted.\u201d When the term of the lease expires, there is \u201cno business being conducted\u201d that could be similar to any business in the restricted area. Wells Fargo asserts that the phrase \u201cduring the term of the lease\u201d must be read to modify \u201cthen being conducted upon the demised premises.\u201d Thus, the word \u201cthen\u201d modifies the phrase \u201cthe term of the lease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Counsel for Wells Fargo, at oral argument posited that there are three possible outcomes. One is summary judgment for Wells Fargo; two is affirming the trial court\u2019s decision; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>and three is for the Court to find ambiguity and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The pivotal point of contention is the word \u201cthen.\u201d It is the position of Wells Fargo that \u201cthen\u201d refers to <em>\u201cat any time during the term of the lease, </em>\u201d and not to a specific moment in time as the trial court \u201cseemingly concluded.\u201d The time period referred to by \u201cthen being conducted on the demised premises,\u201d according to Wells Fargo, is unambiguous. It refers to a continuum of time which is the time \u201cduring which the lease is in effect\u201d, i.e. \u201cthe term of the lease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Sam\u2019s agrees with Wells Fargo and the court, that the language of the lease is clear and unambiguous. Sam\u2019s posits that the \u201cprovisions at issue should be interpreted as a matter of law.\u201d The lease was negotiated fifteen years prior and, thus, according to Sam\u2019s at oral argument, there is no parol evidence that could shed light on the intent of the parties. If the Court remands the case for further proceedings, according to Sam\u2019s, there are no witnesses or evidence. Thus, an objective interpretation of the four corners of the document is the only way to interpret the language and Sam\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Sam\u2019s contends that Wells Fargo \u201cmisinterprets the radius restriction by reading express language out of the lease and out of context.\u201d Sam\u2019s interprets Wells Fargo\u2019s construction as ignoring the language \u201cthen being conducted on the premises.\u201d Sam\u2019s focuses on the provision stating that the tenant shall not operate \u201cany store or business located within a radius of seven (7) miles from the Shopping Center <em>and similar to that then being conducted upon the premises.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in brief.) Sam\u2019s contends that the restriction has two parts that must be considered: \u201c(1) that the allegedly offending store is within seven miles of the demised premises; and (2) it must conduct a business similar to that then being conducted on the demised premises.\u201d Thus, according to Sam\u2019s, \u201c[i]f there is no business then being conducted on the demised premises, then another store within seven miles would not violate the second requirement of the restriction.\u201d Sam\u2019s concludes that, given its interpretation, Wells Fargo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>would render the second requirement \u201csuperfluous\u201d because a tenant would be in breach of a twenty-year lease if it opened another store within seven miles regardless of whether there was any business was being conducted on the demised premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">The circuit court\u2019s interpretation of the restriction did not, in Sam\u2019s view, ignore the rules of contract construction because it simply read the plain language in the lease \u201charmoniously\u201d such that the words created a requirement that two \u201ccompeting\u201d stores be operating simultaneously. According to Sam\u2019s, that is a plain reading of the language in the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Sam\u2019s next contention is that Wells Fargo\u2019s interpretation requires the court to ignore the fact that the language is \u201cpart of the Annual Rent provisions regarding percentage rent.\u201d Thus, read in context, Sam\u2019s contends that the restriction is to protect the opportunity for rental percentage collection while the \u201cDiamond Point store is open and operating.\u201d Another store opened in the radius would affect rental payments because it would necessarily detract from business and undermine the annual sales. Sam\u2019s concludes that, once the Diamond Point Store closed, the point became moot because there was no competing enterprise within the radius. Sam\u2019s also posits that this argument renders Wells Fargo\u2019s concern regarding circumvention of the clause and its being illusory and without merit because, \u201c[s]o long as the store is operating, the clause remains in effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Sam\u2019s cites the Court of Appeals for the proposition that the closing of the store was a \u201cdefined event in the future\u201d that rendered the contractual clause here moot. <em>Ledingham v. Bayless, </em>218 Md. 108, 116, 145 A.2d 434 (1958); <em>Tyler v. Capitol Indem. Ins. Co., </em>206 Md. 129, 137, 110 A.2d 528 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Finally, Sam\u2019s disregards Well Fargo\u2019s assertion that the court ignored the phrase \u201cduring the term of this lease\u201d because, as defined, it means the original term of the lease so long as the lease remains in effect. \u201cConcomitantly, the phrase [ ] means only that the radius restriction cannot extend beyond the initial term of the lease\u201d or its termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>It is well-settled that in regard to contract construction principles,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-4\">Contracts are interpreted \u201cas a whole to determine the parties\u2019 intentions.\u201d Ordinarily, the terms of a contract are construed consistent with their usual meaning, unless it is apparent that the parties ascribed a special or technical meaning to them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-5\">In ascertaining the parties\u2019 intent, Maryland follows the objective law of contract interpretation. Thus, the court is required to \u201cgive effect to [the contract\u2019s] plain meaning,\u201d without regard to what the parties to the contract thought it meant or intended it to mean. Generally, \u201c \u2018it must be presumed that the parties meant what they expressed.\u2019 \u201d Therefore, the \u201c \u2018true test of what is meant is ... what a reasonable person in.the position of the parties would have thought\u2019 the contract meant.\u201d \u201c \u2018If only one reasonable meaning can be ascribed to the [contract] when viewed in context, that meaning necessarily reflects the parties\u2019 intent.\u2019 \u201d In addition, \u201cthe parties to an agreement are deemed to have contracted with knowledge of existing law....\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-6\">When a contract is clear and unambiguous, \u201c \u2018its construction is for the court to determine.\u2019 \u201d Whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law, which is subject to <em>de novo </em>review by an appellate court. Contractual language is considered ambiguous when the words in it are susceptible of more than one meaning to a reasonably prudent person. A contract is not ambiguous, however, merely because the parties to it do not agree as to its meaning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-7\"><em>Young v.

The trial judge construed the language creating the restriction to mean that, \u201cunless the doors of both [Diamond Point and Golden Ring Mall] locations were open for business and customers were being served simultaneously, then and only then would the radius restriction have been violated.\u201d Contrary to the construction accorded by the court, as we see it, the lease is ambiguous and Sam\u2019s was not entitled to summary judgment because there remain genuine disputes as to material facts in regard to whether the opening or closing of a store constituted a violation of the restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">A lease contract, like any other contract, \u201cis measured by its terms unless a statute, a regulation, or a public policy is violated thereby.\u201d <em>Pacific Indem.

The court found that, under the lease, the two locations would have to be fully operational to invoke the radius restriction. It was also established that Sam\u2019s is an active tenant at both locations. The lease gave Sam\u2019s the right to \u201cdetermine how any store on the demised premises is to be operated, and to discontinue the operation of any such store,\u201d but that right, and the fact that Sam\u2019s took advantage of that right, is not inconsistent with the conclusion, by a rational fact-finder, that Sam\u2019s maintenance of a presence at both locations, under the lease, constituted a violation of the radius restriction which provides that Sam\u2019s should not \u201cown, operate, manage or have any financial interest\u201d in any store within a seven mile radius \u201csimilar to that then being conducted upon the demised premises.\u201d In other words, a dispute existed as to the material fact as to whether maintenance of a presence at both locations constituted ownership, etc. in any store similar to that being conducted. Wells Fargo, in our view, presented sufficient facts to demonstrate ambiguity as to whether a breach only occurred if there were competing businesses at the two locations. Operating or managing competing stores would not prevent the ownership or financial interest in those stores. Sam\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment, therefore, should have been denied and the issue submitted to the trier of fact for determination.

Co. v. Bd. of Educ. of Prince George\u2019s County, </em>341 Md. 155, 159, 669 A.2d 1352 (1996) (citations omitted; alterations in original). We have previously noted that \u201c[t]his is true whether the action seeking fees sounds in contract or tort.\u201d <em>Chang v. Brethren Mut. Ins. Co., </em>168 Md.App. 534, 552, 897 A.2d 854 (2006). In some instances, \u201ca trial court may award attorneys\u2019 fees only in the unusual situation where the trial court is authorized to award the prevailing litigant reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees or where, as more common, a contract between the parties specifically authorizes attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d <em>Maxima Corp. v. 6933 Arlington Development Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>100 Md.App. 441, 452, 641 A.2d 977 (1994) (citation omitted). <em>See Chang, </em>168 Md.App. at 552, 897 A.2d 854 (explaining \u201c[a]n exception to that general rule is when an action is brought to enforce an insurer\u2019s obligations under third party liability provisions in a policy, and it is determined that there is coverage.\u201d) (citation omitted). Notably, \u201cthe question of attorneys\u2019 fees is a factual matter which lies within the \u2018sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be overturned unless clearly erroneous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Maxima Corp., </em>100 Md.App. at 452, 641 A.2d 977 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Wells Fargo argues that the court erroneously denied its request for attorney\u2019s fees in its litigation against Sam\u2019s for lease violations despite the provision in the lease that Sam\u2019s was to be responsible for such fees in case of default. The default provisions of the lease provide, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMO\">20. (A) If (i) Tenant shall default in the payment of any rent or sum of money payable by Tenant to Landlord and if Tenant shall fail to cure said default within ten (10) days after receipt of notice of such default from Landlord, or (ii) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number><em>Tenant shall default in the performance or observance of any other agreement or condition on its part to be performed or observed and if Tenant shall fail to cure such default </em>...; Landlord in addition to all other remedies given to Landlord in law or in equity may terminate this lease, or without terminating this lease, terminate Tenant\u2019s right of possession, and in either event Landlord may reenter the demised premised by lawful proceedings and dispossess the Tenant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-4\">(B) Tenant agrees to be liable for all rent and other charges and sums due under this lease for the entire term, which liability shall survive the termination of this lease, the re-entry into the demised premises by Landlord, and the commencement of any action to secure possession of the demised premises. <em>Landlord shall have the right to maintain successive actions against Tenant for recovery of all damages including, without limitation, said lost rental and other charges and sums, and any expenses incurred by Landlord in connection with obtaining possession of the demised premises and in connection with any reletting, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees </em>and brokers\u2019 fees,.... Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Landlord shall have all other rights and remedies available to it at law and in equity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-6\">(D) All remedies available to Landlord are declared to be cumulative and concurrent, and may be exercised at one time or at different times. <em>In all events, Tenant shall be liable for all reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees Landlord incurs in exercising its remedies under this Article 20, whether or not litigation is instituted.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">The court, although having initially denied Sam\u2019s motion for summary judgment on this issue, later vacated that judgment and adopted Sam\u2019s argument that attorney\u2019s fees are generally not awarded. More specifically, it concluded that, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>subsections (B) and (D) of the lease were read together, Wells Fargo could only receive attorney\u2019s fees when it attempted to \u201cobtain possession of the demised premises\u201d after default. Because Wells Fargo did not seek to re-enter the premises at the Diamond Point Sam\u2019s store, these provisions are inapplicable. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">The reasonable attorney\u2019s fees referenced in subsection (B) discuss Sam\u2019s liability for such fees after default and the right of the landlord, or Wells Fargo to be substituted in the position of the landlord and to seek counsel fees \u201cin connection with obtaining possession of the demised premises and in connection with any reletting.\u201d The general rule that bars attorney\u2019s fees can be altered with the specific language contained in the lease. It is apparent that Wells Fargo intended to expressly provide for the collection of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The statement within the lease noting that the tenant would be liable for all reasonable attorney\u2019s fees comports with the well-settled rule that, under the American Rule, attorney\u2019s fees and expenses cannot be recovered by the prevailing party in an action, unless the specific contract provisions such as the lease in the case at bar, permit such recovery. As a result, we are satisfied that the court erred in ruling that Sam\u2019s was not liable for attorney\u2019s fees. Wells Fargo directs the Court to section 20(D) of the lease for the proposition that Sam\u2019s is liable for all reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees that Wells Fargo incurs in exercising its remedies under the default section of the lease. We agree. Contrary to Sam\u2019s assertion, section 20(D) does not subsume 20(A). It is a remedy for Wells Fargo under the Default provision of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">c. Attorney\u2019s Fees from Sam\u2019s/WalMart and Diamond Point</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">After conducting an evidentiary hearing to consider Wells Fargo\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees, the court vacated a prior judgment and granted summary judgment to Sam\u2019s and Wal-Mart, ruling that they were not liable for attorney\u2019s fees. The court also found that Diamond Point was not liable for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>attorney\u2019s fees. Wells Fargo assigns error to these judgments. We disagree with the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">An action tried below without a jury will be reviewed \u201con both the law and the evidence.\u201d Md. Rule 8-131(c) (2006). Pursuant to Rule 8-131(c), we \u201cwill not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous, and will give due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">In <em>Maxima Corp., supra, </em>we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-6\">In circumstances in which attorneys\u2019 fees are awarded based on a contractual right, the losing party is \u201centitled to have the amount of fees and expenses proven with the certainty and under the standards ordinarily applicable for proof of contractual damages.\u201d <em>Bankers [and Shippers Ins. Co. of N.Y. v. Electro Enters., Inc.], </em>287 Md. [641] at 661, 415 A.2d 278 [ (1980) ]. In <em>Bankers, </em>the Court of Appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s award of only 30 percent of the total attorneys\u2019 fees sought. The Court remarked that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Al\">the informal hearing conducted by the trial court neither required any real proof of the amount of the fees and expenses claimed <em>nor provided Bankers with a realistic opportunity to challenge those fees and </em>expenses____ Instead, the parties merely submitted, prior to the hearing, informal fee and expense petitions and made short, oral representations at the hearing of the amounts claimed. On remand, there should be a proper trial regarding the damages incurred____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 661-62, 415 A.2d 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">Other jurisdictions have delineated the detail required and the quantum of information that the prevailing party must provide. The overwhelming authority holds that (a) the party seeking the fees, whether for him/herself or on behalf of a client, always bears the burden of presenting evidence sufficient for a trial court to render a judgment as to their reasonableness; (b) an appropriate fee is always reasonable charges for the services rendered; (c) a fee is not justified by a mere compilation of hours multiplied by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>fixed hourly rates or bills issued to the client; (d) <em>a request for fees must specify the services performed, by whom they were performed, the time expended thereon, and the hourly rates charged; </em>(e) it is incumbent upon the party seeking recovery to present detailed records that contain the relevant facts and computations undergirding the computation of charges; (f) without such records, the reasonableness, <em>vel non, </em>of the fees can be determined only by conjecture or opinion of the attorney seeking the fees and would therefore not be supported by competent evidence. <em>Kaiser v. MEPC American Properties, Inc., </em>164 Ill.App.3d 978, 115 Ill.Dec. 899, 902-03, 518 N.E.2d 424, 427-28 (1987) (collecting Illinois case law for the foregoing propositions). <em>Accord Kinsey v. Preeson, </em>746 P.2d 542, 552 (Col.[Colo.]1987) (trial court\u2019s findings regarding award of attorneys\u2019 fees were insufficient where determination of reasonableness was based on an affidavit submitted after trial and no opportunity was provided to challenge the affidavit); <em>Sperber v. Penn Cent. Corp., </em>150 A.D.2d 356, 540 N.Y.S.2d 877, 878 (1989) (absent evidence regarding specifics as to the time and labor required, the record was insufficient to determine reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees); <em>see also Bosch Die Casting, Co. v. Lunt Mfg. Co., </em>236 Ill.App.3d 18, 177 Ill.Dec. 476, 482-83, 603 N.E.2d 546, 552-53 (Ill.App.Ct.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">Once presented with these facts, the trial court must still evaluate the reasonableness of the fees. Again, the burden is on the party seeking recovery to provide the evidence necessary for the fact finder to evaluate the reasonableness of the fees. Maryland courts consider a variety of factors including, but not limited to, those delineated in Md.Rule 1.5. Those factors are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-5\">\u201c(1) the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">\u201c(2) the likelihood, if apparent to the client, that the acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other employment by the lawyer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>\u201c(3) the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-4\">\u201c(4) the amount involved and the results obtained;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-5\">\u201c(5) the time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">\u201c(6) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-7\">\u201c(7) the experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AC\">\u201c(8) whether the fee is fixed or contingent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-8\"><em>Maxima Corp., </em>100 Md.App. at 453-55, 641 A.2d 977 (footnote omitted)(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">Wells Fargo presented testimonial and documentary evidence of its attorney\u2019s fees in litigation against Sam\u2019s, WalMart and Diamond Point. Its lead counsel testified that the bills showed allocations of expenses to cross-appellants, while also explaining that, during the organization of the bills, Wells Fargo decided not to present a line-by-line analysis of each time and expense entry. At oral argument before a panel of this Court, Wells Fargo\u2019s counsel intimated that it would require 8,000 opinions and judgment calls whether the charges were to Sam\u2019s or Diamond Point because they are not \u201cblack and white.\u201d Wells Fargo\u2019s counsel would be required to go through the billings to make such a det\u00e9rmination because there are multiple parties. Counsel for Wells Fargo reasoned that a line-by-line analysis would have been too time-consuming and costly. The court, however, found it \u201cimpossible\u201d to fully consider Wells Fargo\u2019s fee request without a line-by-line analysis and, therefore, denied counsel fees. Although Wells Fargo failed to properly provide a line-by-line itemization in its billing submitted to the court, the proper remedy is not for the court to deny all of the counsel fees requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">The complexity of this case is evident. Wells Fargo has successfully argued that the Diamond Point entities, Sam\u2019s Club and Wal-Mart have committed breaches of the subject lease and mortgage agreements. Counsel for Wells Fargo brought suit against the cross-appellants based upon several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>legal principles\u2014breach of contract, fraud, misrepresentation and waste\u2014and spent considerable time in presenting the cases against Sam\u2019s, Wal-Mart and Diamond Point. What Wells Fargo ultimately presented to the court, nevertheless, were legal bills totaling over $2,000,000; Wells Fargo sought payment of the fees, however, by arguing that Sam\u2019s and WalMart, collectively, and Diamond Point were each responsible for fifty percent of those fees, without specifying which entities were responsible for what obligations. The trial judge found that such an allocation was inadequate in assisting her to properly apportion the proper and reasonable fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">The judge remarked that she found that the hourly rates charged to Wells Fargo\u2019s counsel were indicative of counsel\u2019s level of expertise in the field and the \u201chigh level of skill ... required and necessary to present\u201d Wells Fargo\u2019s case. She further found that the rates were reasonable and similar to rates of this region. The judge also concluded that some charges were peculiar, for instance, expenses for several attorneys and paralegals attending depositions, secretarial overtime, meals, faxes, trips and descriptions of legal services that were redacted from the bill. The court\u2019s ruling was an improper exercise of its discretion in light of the substantial judgment of approximately $23,000,000 awarded against Diamond Point, and an amount in excess of $1.3 million awarded against Sam\u2019s and Wal-Mart. The fee split down the middle, as suggested by Wells Fargo, however, was wholly incongruent.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Wells Fargo cites <em>Myers v. Kayhoe, </em>391 Md. 188, 207-08, 892 A.2d 520 (2006), for the proposition that, because the pertinent lease and mortgage agreements executed by Sam\u2019s and Diamond Point, respectively, contained provisions for mandatory attorney\u2019s fees, the trial court\u2019s failure to award Wells Fargo fees that counsel documented constituted reversible error. In light of the court\u2019s discretion, the judge was within her authority not to render a piecemeal fee award against the cross-appellants when the party seeking the fees failed to specifically attribute the proper charges to the party responsible. The judge explained that she would have pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>ferred a line-by-line accounting of the charges and should have asked for one. The court\u2019s statement was not intended to require a line-by-line accounting for each case that involves complex litigation and a request for attorney\u2019s fees. According to the trial judge, however, additional details should have been provided within the bills submitted by Wells Fargo. She concluded that it was \u201cimpossible\u201d to calculate and fairly assess Wells Fargo\u2019s charges and expenditures to Sam\u2019s, WalMart and Diamond Point under the circumstances. The court should have compelled Wells Fargo to resubmit the bills for which it sought payment with a clearer indication of exactly what those charges represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">On remand, bearing in mind that the court has already discounted certain charges that it found not credible, Wells Fargo should itemize to the extent required by the court to enable the court to exercise its discretion as to allocation of charges proven to a certainty. <em>Maxima Corp., </em>100 Md.App. at 453, 641 A.2d 977. Wells Fargo, as the party seeking the fees, bears the burden of presenting evidence sufficient for the trial court to render a judgment as to their reasonableness. <em>Id. </em>Wells Fargo \u201cmust specify the services performed, by whom they were performed, the time expended thereon, and the hourly rates charged\u201d for the trial court to consider allocating payment. <em>Id. </em>Without detailed records, the trial court\u2019s determination of the reasonableness of the fees is accomplished only by conjecture or opinion of Wells Fargo, and would thus not be supported by competent evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 454, 641 A.2d 977. Even after submission of the documentation of fees, the court must determine the submission\u2019s reasonableness according to the factors listed <em>supra. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AVS\">We shall briefly address Sam\u2019s and Wal-Mart\u2019s sixth question concerning whether the court erred in granting summary judgment to Sam\u2019s and Wal-Mart and whether it was harmless. Sam\u2019s and Wal-Mart argue that, if we conclude that the court erred in granting summary judgment in their favor on the issue of attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to the lease, it was harmless inasmuch as Wells Fargo failed to meet its burden, of attributing reasonable and necessary fees to the claims against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Sam\u2019s and Wal-Mart. We have concluded that the court erred as to attorneys fees to Wells Fargo; a harmless error analysis is unnecessary because the court will reconsider on remand the contentions of Wells Fargo and apply the factors stated <em>supra </em>in determining the proper awards of attorney\u2019s fees. Thus, Sam\u2019s and Wal-Mart\u2019s contentions as to the line-by-line analysis will be alleviated. The court will determine reasonable attorney\u2019s fees from records that substantially comply with the obligations stated <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Sam\u2019s and Wal-Mart\u2019s Cross-Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Because we have addressed Sam\u2019s and Wal-Mart\u2019s first, fifth and sixth questions under section I, we turn to the second, third and fourth questions of their cross-appeal. Sam\u2019s and Wal-Mart, respectively, and as individual entities, dispute the court\u2019s rulings regarding the damage awards imposed by the court after finding that Sam\u2019s had violated the retail use restriction and the radius restriction. Wal-Mart also contends that, because it was \u201cnot a party to the subject lease or an express assignee of the lease,\u201d it could not be held liable for breaches of the lease to which Sam\u2019s, a separate entity, was a party. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">a. Restriction Breaches and Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Subsection 8(A) of the Lease, titled \u201cUse of Demised Premises and Shopping Center,\u201d states that Sam\u2019s, as the tenant, \u201cshall not be required to operate any business within the demised premises, but if Tenant is open for business the demised premises shall only be used for lawful retail and shopping center purposes.... \u201d Subsequent to the Diamond Point Sam\u2019s store closing, Wal-Mart, listed as Licensor and holder of a \u201cleasehold interest\u201d in the former Diamond Point Sam\u2019s premises, entered into a Revocable License Agreement with The Wire Productions, Inc. (The Wire), permitting The Wire to occupy the premises for the following purposes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>(a) constructing sets for motion picture/television series, (b) photographing and recording scenes for motion picture/television series, (c) maintaining production offices and (d) creating a post production facility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Wal-Mart retained the power to revoke the license if The Wire used the premises for any other purpose without obtaining permission from Wal-Mart. The Agreement, commenced on November 1, 2002, expired on October 31, 2003 and contained an option for The Wire to extend the Agreement for two one-year options. The Wire was a tenant, according to the court\u2019s Findings of Facts, from \u201cNovember 2002 and continuing through April 2005.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Concerning the computation of damages resulting from less profits, we have previously explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-7\">it is not necessary to show these amounts with absolute certainty.... Courts have modified the \u201ccertainty\u201d rule into a more flexible one of \u201creasonable certainty.\u201d In such instances, recovery may often be based on opinion evidence, in the legal sense of that term, from which liberal inferences may be drawn. Generally, proof of actual or even estimated costs is all that is required with certainty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-8\"><em>GAI Audio of New York, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting Sys., Inc., </em>27 Md.App. 172, 200, 340 A.2d 736 (1975) (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">At the outset, we address Sam\u2019s allegations that the court erred by using the incorrect standard and finding that the retail use restriction violation was not the proximate cause of $1.25 million in damages. We agree with Wells Fargo that Sam\u2019s misconstrues damages for breach of contract with the proof of damages required for a tort action. In a lead paint injury case, we reiterated that \u201c[i]n general, a plaintiff may recover only those damages that are affirmatively proved with reasonable certainty to have resulted as the natural, proximate and direct effect of the tortious misconduct____Where the conduct of a defendant was a substantial factor in bringing about the suffering of an injury, such conduct will be deemed to have caused the injury.\u201d <em>Bartholomee v. Casey, </em>103 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>App. 34, 56, 651 A.2d 908 (1994) (citations and quotation marks omitted). Because Wells Fargo\u2019s case against Sam\u2019s and WalMart was based upon breach of contract, the court was not required to use a proximate cause analysis to determine the relationship between Sam\u2019s and Wal-Mart\u2019s breach of the retail use provision and the damages suffered by Wells Fargo. There was thus no error insofar as the court\u2019s analysis was concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">The court found that The Wire\u2019s presence at the former Diamond Point Sam\u2019s Club store violated the retail use provision and held Sam\u2019s and Wal-Mart jointly and severally liable for $1.25 million in damages. There is credible record evidence from which the trial judge could draw inferences to support the finding of the breach and the $1.25 million judgment in damages against Sam\u2019s and Wal-Mart as a result of that breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The judge heard testimony from expert and lay witnesses, who testified to the harm suffered by Diamond Point as landlord and, in turn, Wells Fargo as Diamond Point\u2019s mortgage lender because the demised premises, previously held and occupied by one of the largest retailers for the Center, was now being used by an unauthorized tenant not involved in retail business. The trial judge specifically credited the expert testimony of William Thomas Baird, who was qualified as an expert in the field of management, leasing and marketing of commercial shopping centers; his testimony was noted as part of the court\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. When questioned about his opinion concerning having a dark store in a shopping center contrasted with the presence of a non-retailer, Baird stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\">Non-conforming use that is worse. The owner put in a non-retail use. The probability of my being able to participate in a vibrant center is diminished, even though other stores there with a lease, that is worse. But the worse that I have every [sic] seen, just about the worse I have ever seen is to have something like The Wire there presenting such an unattractive negative face to prospective tenants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>and shoppers that a prospective tenant is going to hope to sell to.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Baird also believed that the fact that The Wire occupied the space \u201caggravate[d]\u201d the rate of vacancy currently at Diamond Point Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Additionally, Neil Demchick, testifying as an expert for Wells Fargo, stated that, in his opinion, Diamond Point was \u201cimpair[ed]\u201d by the retail use breach because The Wire\u2019s presence as a non-retail entity made Diamond Point\u2019s ability to relet the vacant spaces to prospective retailers difficult. Demchick opined that \u201cThe Wire in there is going to deter the desirability of any tenant to move into the Ames space.\u201d Because the space occupied by The Wire was not being utilized as retail space, he attested, it \u201cwas not attractive to people coming in to shop having a non-retail use in there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Sam\u2019s experts also testified as to the manner of calculating damages, assuming the breach caused damages. They also countered Wells Fargo\u2019s experts, asserting that the dark Sam\u2019s location was just as damaging to Diamond Point\u2019s ability to relet the premises as having the space occupied by a non-retail entity. The trial judge, sitting as the trier of fact, weighed and balanced the credibility of each witness\u2019s testimony. The court\u2019s findings, extracted from the evidence before it, were not erroneous or unsupported. Patently, the testimony established reasonable certainty as to the cause of damages to Wells Fargo as a result of the retail use breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">We also reject Sam\u2019s contention that the court\u2019s judgment requires reversal because the court amended its findings regarding damage to Diamond Point and the impact of the vacant Ames space. The court initially stated under \u00b6 288 of the Factual Findings that it was \u201cunable to find that the presence of The Wire has caused Diamond Point damage by effectively preventing the former Ames space from being relet based on the reletting of Ames vacant spaces in other shopping centers.\u201d After hearing and considering additional testimony with respect to the closing of several Ames locations within the area, the court amended \u00b6 288, ruling that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>\u201cunable to find that the presence of The Wire has prevented the former Ames space from being relet based on the Ames vacant spaces in other shopping centers in the trade area.\u201d It is evident from the modification that the trial judge was convinced that the non-retail use permitted by Sam\u2019s and Wal-Mart damaged Diamond Point and Wells Fargo, regardless of whether the Ames space could be relet. There is no clear error in these findings, in our opinion, that would warrant reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">We similarly hold that the findings concerning damages assessed for Sam\u2019s breach of the radius restriction as a consequence of the opening of the Port Covington Sam\u2019s location, were not clearly erroneous, nor was the award of damages an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. The Diamond Point Sam\u2019s Club store and Sam\u2019s Club store in Port Covington were located within a seven mile radius<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> during the months of May, June and July of 2002, when both stores were also open for business. After ruling that a breach of the provision had, in fact, occurred, the damages to Diamond Point and Wells Fargo were apparent; the calculation of the subject damages, however, was not as clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The court expressly rejected Wells Fargo\u2019s argument that the accurate measure of damages should have consisted of Sam\u2019s expected profits for the Port Covington Sam\u2019s Club, \u201cmeasured by the gross sales there.\u201d Instead, the court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-7\">311. The sales at Port Covington could be treated as sales exceeding the percentage rent threshold in the Sam\u2019s Lease. Under Section 4(C) of the Sam\u2019s Lease, Sam\u2019s was required to pay 3/4% of all sales above $75 million, by reference to the formula provided in Section 4(C).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>312. Applying that formula, $56,260.86 would be due as percentage rents. The Court therefore makes the finding that the damages due Wells Fargo for Sam\u2019s breach of the Radius Restriction are $56,260.86.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">(Exhibit references omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The court pointed to the comparison between the rents that would be due and owing under the lease had Sam\u2019s adhered to the radius restriction, as opposed to focusing on expected or scheduled profits. In light of the lease provisions and the relationship among the parties, we conclude that the court\u2019s measure of damages was proper and well within its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">b. Wal-Mart\u2019s Liability Under Sam\u2019s Lease</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">In its brief, Wal-Mart argues that, because Sam\u2019s is a \u201cseparate, validly formed and existing corporate entity who was the express assignee of the Makro lease\u201d and it was not a party to the lease with Diamond Point, it should not have been held liable for breaching the retail use provision of the lease. The evidence before the court nevertheless properly persuaded the fact finder to conclude differently. The court referred to the subject lease, noting that Sam\u2019s, as tenant, was to remain \u201cprimarily liable\u201d for any breaches of the lease and the damages resulting from a breach \u201cnotwithstanding any assignment.\u201d The court noted that, under section thirty-eight of the lease, Diamond Point should have received written notice of Wal-Mart\u2019s intent to assign the lease for the dark Sam\u2019s Club location to The Wire, and that the notice should have included \u201c[the assignee\u2019s] intended use of the demised premises.... \u201d The section also provided that \u201cno such use [by the assignee] may violate the provisions of [the Use Restriction] or any other provision of this lease.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">Neither Wal-Mart nor Sam\u2019s notified Diamond Point of the lease assignment. Additionally, inasmuch as Wal-Mart claims that it was not an express assignee under the lease,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>License Agreement with The Wire suggests otherwise, based upon the court\u2019s following factual findings, which were supported by the evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-5\">258. Licensor is defined as Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., one of the defendants named in this lawsuit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-6\">259. Under the terms of the License, The Wire is to pay and has paid Wal-Mart $53,157.75 per month in rent since November, 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\">263. In all, The Wire has been a tenant for 30 months....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-8\">268. Since at least January of 2003, shortly after WalMart signed the License agreement with The Wire, WalMart, not Sam\u2019s, has paid all monetary obligations under the Sam\u2019s Lease, including base rent, common area maintenance costs, taxes, and insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-9\">269. Wal-Mart has collected $1,647,890.25 in rental payments from The Wire through May 2005.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">(Exhibit references omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">The court also found that it was undisputed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>Sam Harper, who was responsible for signing up The Wire, is a Wal-Mart employee; he presented a proposal to the Wal-Mart Realty Committee which authorized The Wire as a subtenant; Wal-Mart signed the License as the licensor stating it held a leaseable interest in the premises; the letter amending the License agreement was signed by WalMart; ____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">(Exhibit references omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Based upon this credible evidence, we conclude, as did the trial court, that \u201cWal-Mart expressly assumed and has <em>exercised the obligations and accepted the benefits of a Tenant </em>under the Sam\u2019s Lease.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, the court did not err in finding that both Sam\u2019s and Wal-Mart were tenants under the lease between Diamond Point and Sam\u2019s, resulting in both entities being jointly and severally liable for damages to Diamond Point and Wells Fargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Diamond Point\u2019s Cross-Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Having considered the trial court\u2019s denial of attorney\u2019s fees to Wells Fargo, we now address Diamond Point\u2019s remaining questions. Diamond Point argues that all judgments against it should be reversed because of several erroneous findings by the court. Diamond Point asserts that it made no misrepresentations and, accordingly, Wells Fargo is not entitled to recourse liability. It also contends that it was entitled to keep the rents and that the court erred in finding that Michael Konover fraudulently converted the same. Diamond Point challenges the court\u2019s findings with respect to the court\u2019s determination that its actions constituted waste and its calculation of the respective awards of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">a. Findings of Fraud, Misrepresentation and Gross Negligence</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">Diamond Point argues that the court committed reversible error in finding that Diamond Point committed fraud, gross negligence and that it misrepresented material informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>tion to Pinnacle and Paine Webber, Wells Fargo\u2019s assignors, concerning the tenancy status of the Diamond Point Sam\u2019s Club location before the parties agreed to the refinancing loan. Diamond Point contends that no carve out recourse liability exists in that Diamond Point did not misrepresent any facts and that Wells Fargo was not injured as a result of any of the alleged misrepresentations. It also claims that it could not have been liable because neither Pinnacle nor Paine Webber relied on the alleged misrepresentations. We see it differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">Under the Recourse Obligations section of the Amended and Restated Mortgage Security Agreement (Amended Mortgage), \u00b6 55 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-5\">... The [non-recourse] provisions of this paragraph shall not ... (vi) constitute a waiver of the right of [Wells Fargo] to enforce the liability and obligation of [Diamond Point], by money judgment or otherwise, to the extent of any loss, damage, cost, expense, liability, claim or other obligation incurred by [Wells Fargo] (including attorneys\u2019 fees and costs reasonably included) arising out of or in connection with ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">(A) fraud or intentional misrepresentation by [Diamond Point], or any Guarantor in connection with the Loan;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-7\">(B) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of [Diamond Point]....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">Days prior to the closing on the subject refinancing loan for $15.3 million between Diamond Point and Pinnacle, Steven Abney, Executive Vice President of Diamond Point, signed the \u201cCertificate of Borrower,\u201d where Diamond Point as Borrower affirmed that it knew</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-9\">of nothing involving the Loan, the Mortgage Property, [Diamond Point] or [Diamond Point\u2019s] credit standing that may reasonably be expected to (a) cause private institutional investors to regard the Loan as an unacceptable investment; (b) cause the Loan to become delinquent; or (c) adversely affect the Loan\u2019s value or marketability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>13. <em>No Change in Facts or Circumstances. </em>All information set forth in the application for the Loan submitted to [Pinnacle] ... and in all financial statements, certificates and other documents submitted in connection with the Loan Application or in satisfaction of the terms of the Loan Commitment submitted to [Pinnacle], is accurate, complete and correct in all material respects. There has been no adverse change in any condition, fact, circumstance or event that would make any such information inaccurate, incomplete, incorrect, or otherwise misleading.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-4\"><em>* * </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-5\">21. <em>Leases. </em>... As of the date hereof, ... (vii) except as otherwise provided in the rent roll, all Rents due and payable under each Lease have been paid in full and no said Rents have been paid more than one (1) month in advance of the due dates thereof; ... (ix) <em>with respect to any commercial tenant of the Mortgaged Property, [Diamond Point] has no knowledge of any tenant\u2019s intention or notice to vacate the premises and/or cease the payment of rent thereon.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">27. <em>Representations and Warranties True. </em>Each and every representation and warranty contained herein and which is within [ ] [Diamond Point\u2019s] reasonable control, will remain materially true and correct at all times from the date hereof until the Loan is repaid in full in accordance with its terms. In the event that any representation or warranty contained herein becomes untrue, in whole or in part, after the date hereof, [Diamond Point] will so advise [Pinnacle] in writing immediately.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">(Emphasis added.) The loan between Pinnacle and Diamond Point closed on June 2, 2000, after Richard Liljedahl, a Senior Vice President for Diamond Point entity Konover Management Corporation, had signed the Borrower\u2019s Certificate and Consent, certifying that the statements and representations it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>made in the Amended Mortgage and Certificate of Borrower were \u201caccurate and complete.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The critical question before the trial court was what was discovered with respect to imminent vacancies, by whom and when? More specifically, did Diamond Point know that Sam\u2019s intended to vacate its space prior to signing the loan with Pinnacle and did it share that knowledge with Pinnacle? Despite its arguments to the contrary, the evidence demonstrates that Diamond Point had knowledge of this material fact and failed to disclose that information to its mortgage lender. <em>See Carozza v. Peacock Land Corp., </em>231 Md. 112, 121, 188 A.2d 917 (1963)(explaining \u201c[i]n a business transaction, reliance upon a misrepresentation of fact, intentionally misrepresented or otherwise, is justifiable only if the fact misrepresented is material. <em>A fact is material if its existence or nonexistence is a matter to which a reasonable man would attach importance in determining his choice of action in the transaction, or the maker of the misrepresentation knows that its recipient is likely to regard the fact as important although a reasonable man would not so regard it. </em>\u201d )(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Liljedahl and Vice President of Konover Capital Advisors Susan Larkin,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> on behalf of Diamond Point, contacted prospective lenders to arrange refinancing in the summer of 1999. Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (Lehman Brothers), a mortgage broker with whom Diamond Point entities had other loans, was one of the companies contacted. In August of 1999, Lehman Brothers had learned, after visiting the Wal-Mart website, of Wal-Mart\u2019s attempts to sublease the Sam\u2019s Club location at Diamond Point. Larkin testified that Lehman Brothers also contacted Wal-Mart about the information and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>was told by \u201csomeone\u201d at Wal-Mart that \u201cthey were planning to close the store in November of 2000.\u201d Larkin expressed her concern upon receiving this news, stating that she contacted Liljedahl, Richard Cohen, head of her company\u2019s development group and several other executive-level personnel affiliated with Diamond Point by way of electronic mail.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Subsequent to the denial of Diamond Point\u2019s application by other brokers, Diamond Point contacted Pinnacle. Although Diamond Point claims it conveyed the circumstances surrounding Sam\u2019s tenancy to Charles Chamberlin, an executive with Pinnacle, there is no credible evidence, as found by the trial court, to demonstrate that such an exchange took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">It is axiomatic that facts which are discovered that indicate that one of the anchor tenants of a shopping center may vacate are material to a commercial lender\u2019s decision to approve a loan. The evidence contained in the record does show, however, that several Diamond Point personnel knew of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Sam\u2019s plans, regardless of whether they considered the rumored plans of Sam\u2019s to vacate the space mere speculation or a probability that Sam\u2019s would vacate the space. The knowledge of an agent is attributable to the principal. <em>See Duckworth v. Bernstein, 55 </em>Md.App. 710, 722, 466 A.2d 517, <em>cert. denied, </em>298 Md. 243, 469 A.2d 452 (1983)(noting \u201c[w]here an agent acquires knowledge in the course of his agency, and has no personal interest in the transaction adverse to the interest of the principal, the agent\u2019s knowledge is ascribed to the principal.\u201d) (citation omitted). Diamond Point knew of Sam\u2019s plans months before Pinnacle closed on the loan and agreed to assign the loan to Paine Webber for financing. Pinnacle, however, was never informed of these plans before the loan was consummated, nor was Paine Webber or its assignee, Wells Fargo, in clear violation of Diamond Point\u2019s guarantees under its Certificate of Borrower and Borrower\u2019s Certificate and Consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">Diamond Point avers that there was no misrepresentation because the fact that Pinnacle\u2019s representative, Chamberlin, was informed of Sam\u2019s plans to vacate is a circumstance covered by the introductory language of the Certificate of Borrower, which states: \u201cIn addition to all other representations, warranties and covenants----\u201d Having already rejected the argument that Chamberlin knew of Sam\u2019s plans, Diamond Point\u2019s assertion fails. We also reject Diamond Point\u2019s contention that, because the closing and relocation of the Sam\u2019s Club store were not approved until months after the parties closed on the loan, there was no misrepresentation. Paragraph twenty-one of the Certificate of Borrower required that Diamond Point certify that it had no knowledge, as of late May 2000, of \u201cany tenant\u2019s intention or notice to vacate the premises____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The final decision and action on Sam\u2019s part to relocate its store is certainly definitive, but were not the events which triggered the obligation imposed by the contract to put Pinnacle, as the lender, on notice of an imminent vacancy. The court discussed how the evidence revealed that Sam\u2019s plan to vacate was more than a rumor and had, in fact, been in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>company\u2019s plans since 1998. Even if Sam\u2019s plans were only a \u201crumor\u201d when Diamond Point learned of the former\u2019s plan, the \u201crumor\u201d conveyed Sam\u2019s intent to vacate the premises, a critical fact not disclosed to Pinnacle.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">In addition, there is evidence that Diamond Point continued to uncover information about Sam\u2019s before closing on the loan in June of 2000. Larkin emailed Liljedahl that Richard Cohen, an employee of a Diamond Point affiliate, contacted Wal-Mart and was told by a Wal-Mart representative that Sam\u2019s planned to vacate the Diamond Point location within the next one to two years. As noted, neither the Lehman Brothers communication, nor this information, was forwarded to Pinnacle. Discrediting Diamond Point\u2019s characterization of Sam\u2019s plans as rumors and the February email as a \u201cthin reed\u201d upon which the court based its findings of misrepresentation is the fact that Diamond Point continued to investigate the information, which further demonstrates that Diamond Point was concerned about the status of Sam\u2019s tenancy at the Center, as one would also expect Pinnacle, had it been so informed.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Diamond Point claims that the court erred in finding that it withheld other material information from Pinnacle and Paine Webber, <em>ie., </em>the Center was placed on a Performance Improvement Plan in April of 2000 because 140,020 square feet was at risk, with notes speculating as to Sam\u2019s closing. In its brief, Diamond Point criticizes Wells Fargo for failing to present evidence that \u201cknowledge of the Performance Improvement Plan would have caused Pinnacle not to make the loan or change any loan terms.\u201d The fact that the Center was on an improvement plan does not compel the conclusion that the finding is erroneous. As interesting as it may have been to Pinnacle, the court was focusing on why the Center was listed on the plan. The basis, for any reasonable fact finder, constitutes a material fact that should have been disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Diamond Point also challenges the court\u2019s finding that the Lehman Brothers\u2019 information on Wal-Mart listing the Sam\u2019s space for sublease and the decision of Lehman Brothers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>to deny financing constituted material information. Lehman Brothers\u2019 denial was based on facts regarding Sam\u2019s status as an anchor tenant at the Center; patently, it was material to Lehman Brothers\u2019 evaluation of the refinancing application submitted by Diamond Point.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">Finally, Diamond Point insists that the court should not have granted recourse liability to Wells Fargo because it did not prove that the damages it suffered arose from the carve outs under \u00b6 55 concerning fraud and misrepresentation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The fact that Sam\u2019s planned to close was a fact material to the value and marketability of Pinnacle\u2019s refinance loan. The evidence demonstrates that this vital information was misrepresented and kept from Pinnacle and Paine Webber. In light of the fact that the record shows that at least two lenders would not refinance the loan because of uncertainty surrounding Sam\u2019s tenancy, it is telling that, during the months that Pinnacle and Diamond Point were negotiating, there was little public discussion about Sam\u2019s status at the Center until after the parties closed on the loan. Had Pinnacle and/or Paine Webber known or been apprised of Sam\u2019s planned departure from the Center, it is unlikely that Diamond Point would have approved the loan. Diamond Point\u2019s omissions and misrepresentations about its anchor tenant, Sam\u2019s, impaired the collateral for the $15.3 million obligation. The balance of the loan, plus the applicable interest computations, totaling $22,862,399.66, constitute the proper calculation of losses and damages suffered as a result of the misrepresentations and/or gross negligence in making its loan application. The court\u2019s award of damages resulting from carve out liability was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">b. Collection of Wells Fargo Rent</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">According to Diamond Point, the court erred when it ruled that Wells Fargo was not required to demand rent from it and concluded that the amount of $633,000 represented rents that were to go to Wells Fargo. Diamond Point also posits that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>the court committed error by finding that the funds were fraudulently transferred. We are persuaded by the unambiguous and plain meaning of the pertinent documents and the evidence before the court that it did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Diamond Point\u2019s Assignment of Lease and Rents (Assignment) to Pinnacle, subsequently assigned to Paine Webber and Wells Fargo, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-5\">1. <em>Present Assignment. </em>[Diamond Point as] Assignor does hereby and unconditionally assign to [Pinnacle] Assignee Assignor\u2019s right, title and interest in all current and future Leases and Rents it being intended by Assignor that this assignment constitutes a present, absolute and unconditional assignment and not an assignment for additional security only.... Assignee grants to Assignor a revocable license to operate and manage the Mortgaged Property and to collect the Rents. Assignor shall hold the Rents, or a portion thereof sufficient to discharge all current sums due on the Debt for use in the payment of such sums. <em>Upon an Event of Default (as defined in the Mortgage), the license granted to Assignor herein shall be automatically revoked by Assignee and Assignee shall immediately be entitled to receive and apply all Rents, whether or not Assignee enters upon and takes control of the Mortgaged Property. Assignee is hereby granted and assigned by Assignor the right, at its option, upon the revocation of the license granted herein to enter upon the Mortgaged Property ... to collect the Rents. Any Rents collected after the revocation of the license herein granted may be applied toward payment of the Debt in such priority and proportion as Assignee, in its discretion, shall deem proper.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Regarding events of default, the Amended Mortgage stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-8\">20. <em>Events of Default. </em>The Debt shall become immediately due and payable at the option of [Pinnacle] Mortgagee, without notice or demand, upon any one or more of the following events (\u201cEvents of Default\u201d):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>(a) If any portion of the Debt is not paid on or before the fifth (5th) day after the same is due;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-4\">(b) If any of the Taxes or Other Charges is not paid when the same is due and payable ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-5\">(c) If the Policies are not kept in full force and effect, or if the Policies are not delivered to Mortgagee upon request;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-7\">(e) If any representation or warranty of [Diamond Point], or of any person guaranteeing payment of the Debt or any portion thereof or performance by [Diamond Point] of any of the terms of this Mortgage ... made herein or in an [sic] such guaranty, or in any certificate, report, financial statement or other instrument or document furnished to Mortgagee shall have been false or misleading in any material respect when made;....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-8\">\u201cRents\u201d under the Assignment are defined as</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnS\">... all accounts, deposits, rents, income, issues revenues, receipts, insurance proceeds and profits arising from the Leases and renewals thereof and together with all rents, income, issues and profits (including, but not limited to, all oil and gas or other mineral royalties and bonuses) from the use, enjoyment and occupancy of the Mortgaged Property, or the sale, lease, sublease, license, concession or other grant of right to use or occupy any portion thereof, vending machine proceeds, and any compensation received for the rendering of services by Assignor....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">In its brief, Diamond Point cites cases and the Restatement (Third) of Property in support of its claim that Wells Fargo did not prove that it was entitled to any rents collected prior to November 22, 2002. The court\u2019s findings, based upon its interpretation of the clear language of the Amended Mortgage and Assignment suggest otherwise. Upon any event of default, which included failure to pay the mortgage timely or failure to pay taxes or making a false or misleading representation concerning any terms of the mortgage, the debt became \u201cimmediately due.\u201d Wells Fargo was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>not required to notify or demand the debt once Diamond Point defaulted. Once the mortgage debt became due and payable upon default, pursuant to the Assignment, Wells Fargo was to receive \u201call Rents\u201d and retained the right to enter onto the property to collect the rents. Given the unambiguous language in these documents, once the court, as rational finder of fact, found that Diamond Point defaulted by misrepresenting material facts at the inception of the mortgage, it properly made further findings and conclusions of law regarding Wells Fargo\u2019s entitlement to the rents. Moreover, the clear language of the documents leaves no room for interpretation or construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">Diamond Point\u2019s argument concerning the incorrect calculation of rents due Wells Fargo also fails because the definition of \u201cRents,\u201d as listed in the Assignment, encompasses nearly all monies Diamond Point collected that arose from leases, lease renewals, subleases, and any other \u201cincome, issues ... and profits\u201d it received from the \u201cuse, enjoyment and occupation\u201d of the Center. Diamond Point employs the more restrictive, generic definition of \u201crent,\u201d which is inapplicable. Additionally, the date when Diamond Point received rents is irrelevant inasmuch as the critical date for purposes of when the rents became due and payable to Wells Fargo is the date of default. The evidence supports the court\u2019s finding that the default based on the mortgagor\u2019s misrepresentation occurred at the inception of the Mortgage, resulting in Wells Fargo\u2019s entitlement to all monies, in this case $633,000, that could be traced to \u201cRents\u201d under the Assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">With respect to the court\u2019s finding of conversion,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> it ruled that Diamond Point, specifically Michael Konover, violat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>ed paragraph 55(F) of the Amended Mortgage, prohibiting the \u201cmisapplication or conversion\u201d of \u201cany Rents following an Event of Default.\u201d Diamond Point contends that the findings were erroneous because Wells Fargo failed to show sufficient evidence of the fraudulent transfer to Konover and because the $633,000 at issue was repaid to the original transferor. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The trial judge described these financial transactions among the Diamond Point entities as being conducted \u201cin such a way as to hide the true nature of the transaction and to deceive creditors, including Wells Fargo. Specifically, the transfer was fraudulently characterized in the financial records of Diamond Point as an \u2018advance.\u2019 \u201d The court found that Diamond Point\u2019s \u201crepayment\u201d is suspicious because the funds that were partially repaid were \u201cimmediately distributed to the partners of Diamond Point as a partnership distribution and therefore did not remain an asset of Diamond Point.\u201d The record, which includes Diamond Point\u2019s general ledger and testimony discussing the transfer of funds, demonstrates sufficient evidence to support the court\u2019s findings.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">The court\u2019s prerogative to credit or discredit the testimony of witnesses at trial is paramount. The same holds true for deposition testimony from the Diamond Point property manager that the funds went to Konover personally. The court found that the manager\u2019s testimony was corroborated by the ledger entry that showed the funds payable to him personally, and not transferred to MCK, Inc. Testimony found by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>court to be credible, was further corroborated by objective, documentary proof. Consequently, the court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">c. Diamond Point\u2019s Commission of Waste</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Diamond Point contends that the $1.4 million judgment against it for waste in failing to maintain and repair roofs at the Center and failing to properly enforce the terms of Sam\u2019s lease should be reversed. The record evidence, in our view, supports the court\u2019s rulings regarding waste and the damage it caused Wells Fargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">We recently iterated what actions constitute waste:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFe\">A mortgagor\u2019s liability for waste \u201cis in the nature of a tort\u201d and is based upon \u201ca breach of a duty arising from the mortgage relationship.\u201d Restatement (Third) of Property: Mortgages \u00a7 4.6 cmt. a, at 264 (1996). <em>See also </em>93 C.J.S. Waste \u00a7 2 (1956) (stating that \u201cthe essence of liability for permissive waste is negligence.\u201d). There are principally two different types of waste: voluntary and permissive waste. Permissive waste, which is the type of waste at issue here, \u201cinvolves acts of omission rather than commission,\u201d <em>Coutant, </em>86 Md.App. [581], 596, 587 A.2d 1125 [1991], and \u201cresults generally from the failure of the possessor to exercise the care of a reasonable person to preserve and protect the estate for future interests.\u201d Powell \u00a7 56.05[2] at 56-19. Voluntary waste \u201cis active or positive, and consists in doing some act of destruction or devastation, such as the pulling down of a house, or the removal of parts fixed to, and constituting a material part of, the freehold.\u201d 93 C.J.S. Waste \u00a7 1 (1956). Traditionally, waste involves physical damage to real property. Restatement (Third) of Property: Mortgages \u00a7 4.6 cmt. a, at 263 (1996).... The law of waste ... has also been applied to a narrow range of cases, which do not involve physical damage to real property but do involve the impairment of a mortgagee\u2019s interest in that property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-8\"><em>Boucher Inv., L.P. v. Annapolis-West Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>141 Md. App. 1,18-19, 784 A.2d 39 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>At the outset, the court\u2019s finding that it committed waste was erroneous in part because, according to Diamond Point, the Amended Mortgage requires that it should have been notified of its default and given an opportunity to cure the alleged breach of the waste provision. Diamond Point appeal's to conflate the provisions that allow for acceleration of the mortgage debt in the event of default and the violations listed under the recourse obligations of the Amended Mortgage. Under \u00b6 8, titled \u201cMaintenance of Mortgaged Property,\u201d Diamond Point\u2019s responsibilities to maintain the Center in good condition and conducting repairs when necessary are set forth. Paragraph 20(k) governs the timetable Diamond Point was to follow upon receiving a notice of default from Wells Fargo and the proper procedure in attempting to cure that default. Under the Amended Mortgage, waste is not considered an event of default but rather, is one of the listed violations of \u00b6 55(a)(vi)(E) by which Wells Fargo had the right to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">enforce the liability and obligation of [Diamond Point], by money judgment or otherwise, to the extent of any loss, damage, cost, expense, liability, claim or other obligation incurred by [Wells Fargo] ... in connection with ... the committing of any waste on the Mortgaged Property by [Diamond Point] or any affiliate, agent, or employee of [Diamond Point].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Wells Fargo\u2019s right to enforce liability and the obligation of Diamond Point as a result of waste simply do not impose upon Wells Fargo a duty to notify Diamond Point and afford it an opportunity to cure waste, a condition it allowed to actualize.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Diamond Point cites a North Dakota case, <em>Vogel v. Pardon, et al., </em>444 N.W.2d 348 (N.D.1989), and our decision in a divorce proceeding, <em>Coutant v. Coutant, </em>86 Md.App. 581, 595, 587 A.2d 1125 (1991), for the proposition that the only damages it should be liable for, assuming that it is responsible for waste, are the actual damages to the property as a result of waste, not any expenses to repair or replace the property. The North Dakota Court\u2019s holding in <em>Vogel, </em>in our opinion, does not buttress Diamond Point\u2019s argument because there, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>the court affirmed the lower court\u2019s refusal to find that Pardon and other appellees did not commit waste; although there was water damage due to the leaking roof, \u201cthe roof had simply reached the end of its useful life through ordinary wear and age.... \u201d <em>Vogel, </em>444 N.W.2d at 350. Because the record supported the finding that the roof had reached the end of its useful life due to time and \u201cnot through any act or omission of the [appellees],\u201d the court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous and the appellants therefore were not entitled to receive <em>\u201cdamages for the replacement of the roof </em>itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Here, the court heard testimony from commercial roofing maintenance experts, testifying on behalf of Diamond Point and Wells Fargo, and reviewed the roofing records, which revealed a lack of consistent, reasonable repairs, inspection and maintenance to the roofs of the Center stores, particularly the vacant Ames store, the former Sam\u2019s Club store roof and the strip center\u2019s roof. This neglect, as discussed by both experts, prompted their opinions that Diamond Point\u2019s failure to maintain the roofs shortened the useful lives of the roofs. The court found that the roofing records demonstrated what Wells Fargo\u2019s expert opined: that \u201cnearly all work performed on Diamond Point\u2019s roofs relate to leak repairs, but not recommended and required preventative maintenance.\u201d Additionally, Diamond Point\u2019s expert stated his conclusion that failure to regularly maintain and inspect a roof \u201cwould constitute waste.\u201d As a result, the court found that Diamond Point had \u201cfailed to perform reasonable preventative maintenance work, thereby reducing the useful life of the roof, and constituting waste----\u201d The court concluded that Diamond Point violated one of the carve out provisions of \u00b6 55 and, more generally, failed to abide by the \u00b6 8 provisions, which resulted in the triggering of personal liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">It is clear that <em>Vogel </em>is distinguishable from the case at bar because the court did not rule that the Diamond Point roofs were damaged because of the passage of time, but rather because Diamond Point did not properly maintain and prevent roofing problems. The Supreme Court of North Dakota <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>concluded that it would not award roof replacement costs to appellants because appellants would have been unjustly enriched with an award of replacement costs where the damage did not constitute waste. The court, in this case, specifically found that the damage and waste were caused by the nearly non-existent maintenance of the Diamond Point roofs. Thus, the actual damages, as referenced in <em>Coutant, supra, </em>due to Wells Fargo\u2019s neglect, should consist of the costs to replace and repair the roofs that Diamond Point failed to maintain.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">The court considered three repair estimates from Diamond Point\u2019s expert\u2014$646,000, $1.4 million and $2.1 million\u2014and in a proper exercise of its discretion, concluded that the $1.4 million amount most accurately reflected the damages to Wells Fargo. The court\u2019s finding that the condition of the property was the result of waste and its calculation of damages were appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Diamond Point also challenges the court\u2019s finding that its failure to enforce the radius restriction of Sam\u2019s lease regarding the Port Covington location constituted waste under the carve out provisions of \u00b6 55 and by violating \u00b6 7. Paragraph 7(b) requires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-6\">All Leases shall provide that they are subordinate to this Mortgage and that the lessee agrees to attorn to [Wells Fargo]. [Diamond Point] (i) <em>shall observe and perform all the obligations imposed upon the lessor under the Leases and shall not do or permit to be done anything to impair the value of the Leases </em>as security for the Debt; ... (iii) shall enforce all of the terms, covenants and conditions contained in the Leases upon the part of the lessee thereunder to be observed or performed, short of termination thereof;....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">The court found that Diamond Point\u2019s failure to enforce the radius restriction, permitting the Port Covington store to serve customers while the Diamond Point Sam\u2019s store was still open, resulted in a decrease in gross sales for the Diamond Point location from \u201c$3,905,988 in May to $3,641,979 in July <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>[2002],\u201d while the gross sales at the Port Covington store for the same three month period totaled over $7.5 million. The court also accorded great weight to the fact that Konover Construction, a company \u201csolely owned by Michael Konover,\u201d accepted the bid and contracted to construct the Sam\u2019s location at Port Covington for $7.59 million on August of 2001. We recognize that there was broad language employed in \u00b6 7, requiring Diamond Point not to do \u201canything to impair the value\u201d of the leases, but based upon this record, we perceive no error in the court\u2019s finding that Diamond Point\u2019s failure to enforce, in conjunction with the building of a competing store within the restricted radius by Diamond Point, impaired the value of the leases, which adversely affected Diamond Point\u2019s bottom-line and led to damages suffered by Wells Fargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">d. Calculation of Damages Against Diamond Point</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The court, according to Diamond Point, also erroneously calculated the judgment amounts for the damages because the court failed to utilize the correct interest computation to determine the proper interest on the judgment total of $1,859,675.30 and, additionally, that damages should not have been awarded when Wells Fargo made no efforts to mitigate its damages through timely foreclosure proceedings. These arguments are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Paragraph Twenty-One of the Amended Mortgage provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-7\">21. <em>Default Interest. </em>Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, [Diamond Point] shall pay interest on the unpaid principal balance of the Note at the rate of the greater of (i) 5% above the Applicable Interest Rate or (ii) 5% above the Base Rate ... in effect at the time of the occurrence of the Event of Default (the <em>\u201cDefault Rate </em>\u201d). The term <em>\u201cBase Rate </em>\u201d shall mean the annual rate announced by Citibank, N.A., in New York City, New York as its base rate in effect at the time of the occurrence of the Event of Default. <em>The Default Rate shall be computed from the occurrence of the Event of Default until the actual receipt and collection of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number><em>the Debt. This charge shall be added to the Debt, and shall be deemed secured by this </em>Mortgage....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The court calculated the default interest rate on the outstanding principal balance of $15,031,132.84, which amounted to an additional five percent above the Applicable Rate of \u201c8.89%.\u201d As noted, the evidence demonstrated that Diamond Point defaulted under the default provision in the Amended Mortgage by making false misrepresentations of material facts and failing to remit the November 2002 payment to Wells Fargo. Because the default interest, as the plain language provides, applies in the event of default, the interest could be applied at the point of the inception of the loan, after the fraudulent misrepresentation, and when Diamond Point missed its payment, both assessments made by the court. The court properly interpreted and applied the default rate in determining the interest owed in light of Diamond Point\u2019s events of default. The court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">We are similarly not persuaded that we should reverse the award of damages based on Diamond Point\u2019s assertion that Wells Fargo failed to mitigate its damages and delayed foreclosing on the property. Diamond Point cites a portion of a sentence in a prior decision for the proposition that, because Wells Fargo failed to make reasonable efforts to mitigate its losses, it was not entitled to damages. The sentence, read in context, does not support Diamond Point\u2019s claim. The Court of Appeals has explained that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-7\">where one party to a contract commits a breach of contract, the other party is required by the \u201cavoidable consequences\u201d rule of damages to make all reasonable efforts to minimize the loss he sustains as a result of the breach, and he can charge the party in default with such damages only as, with reasonable endeavors and expense and without risk of additional substantial loss or injury, he could not prevent.... \u201c(T)he burden of proving that losses could have been avoided by reasonable effort and expense is upon the party who broke the contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number><em>Sergeant Co. v. Pickett, </em>285 Md. 186, 203, 401 A.2d 651 (1979) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Assuming, without deciding, that Wells Fargo was required to mitigate its damages, according to <em>Sergeant, </em>it was Diamond Point\u2019s burden to prove that Wells Fargo could have avoided all the losses it claimed \u201cby reasonable effort and expense without risk of additional loss or injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 204, 401 A.2d 651. Diamond Point argued in its brief that, although \u2018Wells Fargo was not required to take action that would have caused risk of additional loss, ... Wells Fargo presented no evidence that foreclosing on the property prior to trial in April 2005 presented any such risk.\u201d This argument and the support offered by Diamond Point are insufficient to sustain its burden. Diamond Point merely demonstrated that Wells Fargo considered its options and pursued its remedies as and when it saw fit to do so, under \u00b6 26 of the Amended Mortgage. Wells Fargo could have pursued any of the options, which included declaring the entire balance immediately due or initiating partial or complete foreclosure proceedings on the property, \u201cconcurrently or otherwise, at such time and in such order as [Wells Fargo] may determine, <em>in its sole discretion, </em>without impairing or otherwise affecting the other rights and remedies.... \u201d (Emphasis added.) Diamond Point\u2019s assertions certainly do not set forth a cognizable basis for reversing Wells Fargo\u2019s award for damages simply because Wells Fargo did not act timely enough to suit Diamond Point\u2019s needs as the mortgagor under the defaulted mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Diamond Point also refers to our decision in <em>Mattvidi </em>Assocs. <em>Ltd. P\u2019ship v. NationsBank of Virginia, </em>100 Md.App. 71, 89, 639 A.2d 228, <em>cert. denied, </em>336 Md. 277, 647 A.2d 1216 (1994), another case that is inapposite. In <em>Mattvidi, </em>like Diamond Point here, appellant borrowers contended that, because appellee bank failed to institute foreclosure proceedings soon after the note defaulted, the court erred by not finding appellee failed to mitigate its damages. <em>Id. </em>We pointed to the fact that appellant borrower did not cite \u201cany case from any jurisdiction in which any court has held that a lender in the bank\u2019s circumstances must foreclose on a loan in order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>to mitigate its damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We also reiterated that \u201ca plaintiff has no duty to take any action to mitigate its damages if that action causes the \u2018risk of additional loss or injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>As a result, we held that the court\u2019s finding that appellant had not met its burden to prove appellee\u2019s failure to mitigate was not clearly erroneous. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">Without Diamond Point\u2019s citing any law or other authority to support a finding that Wells Fargo\u2019s damages should be recalculated because it \u201cdelayed\u201d initiating foreclosure proceedings, we reject Diamond Point\u2019s argument. We perceive no error in the court\u2019s damage calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.

With respect to Konover Management Corporation, now known as Peerless Corp., Wells Fargo asserted:</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">Konover and its affiliates, agents or employees willfully, deliberately, and intentionally concealed and hid material facts which they had a duty to disclose, including but not limited to: the fact that WalMart and/or its affiliate expressly informed Konover and/or its affiliate months before the Mortgage that Diamond Point Plaza anchor tenant, Sam's PW, intended to vacate the Diamond Point Plaza within one to two years and the fact that Diamond Point Plaza was a property which had an unpleasant odor during certain weather conditions because of its proximity to a sewage treatment facility, which odor could not be readily determined through reasonable inspections conducted at other times. Konover and its affiliates, agent or employees withheld these material facts, knowing (a) that Diamond [Point], its affiliate, would not have received the $15,300,000 loan for the Diamond Point Plaza, and (b) that [Wells Fargo] would not have agreed to an assignment of that Loan had the true facts not been actively concealed. There was justifiable reliance by [ ] Wells Fargo, upon the deceptive misrepresentations by Konover and its affiliates, agents or employees. As a result of Konover\u2019s fraud, misrepresentation, [] Wells Fargo, was induced to enter into an assignment of the Diamond Point Plaza Loan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b137-8\">. Sam\u2019s posits that, because the stores were separated by 6.875 miles and the Patapsco River, that the breach is not too significant, given the proximity to the seven mile restriction. We however, agree with the trial court following the letter of the law or, in this case, the language contained in the lease, which was not subject to any elasticity to accommodate another store location that <em>nearly </em>comported with the restriction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b138-9\">. Wal-Mart cites <em>Scott v. First Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>224 Md. 462, 468, 168 A.2d 349 (1961) <em>and Brooks v. Mitchell, </em>163 Md. 1, 161 A. 261 (1932) for the proposition that gratuitous and constructive assignments, the type of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>assignment it argues occurred here, are unenforceable in Maryland. Wal-Mart\u2019s reliance on these cases is misplaced in that in <em>Scott, </em>the Court of Appeals applied Connecticut law to rule on an assignment of one-half of an expectancy from an estate where there was no contract or document to enforce the assignment. In <em>Brooks, </em>163 Md. at 3, 161 A. 261, the Court dealt with whether</p>\n<p id=\"b139-13\">a gift <em>causa mortis </em>of a deposit in a savings bank can be effected by the mere delivery to the donee of the passbook issued by the bank to the donor as evidence of his title to the same, where the donor sufficiently indicates an intention of assigning or transferring the fund to the donee but executes no written order for the transfer or assignment thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-14\">Wal-Mart\u2019s agreement, coupled with the authority it exercised in its dealings with The Wire after the subtenancy commenced, was sufficient to find that an assignment had occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b143-7\">.
