He was sentenced to life imprisonment, without the possibility of parole, for the first-degree rape; life imprisonment, with the possibility of parole, for the first-degree sexual offense; and thirty years\u2019 imprisonment for the kidnapping. The remaining convictions were merged for purposes of sentencing. All sentences were to run concurrently. Appellant noted a timely appeal and presents two questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-5\">I. Did the trial court abuse its discretion in admitting other crimes evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">II. Did the trial court abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s request for a postponement?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">I. <em>FACTS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">A. <em>Uncontroverted Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">On the evening of May 16, 2002, appellant had vaginal intercourse with Gertrude P., and on the same date, Ms. P. performed fellatio on appellant. Ms. P. testified that appellant forced her to have sex with him. Appellant testified that the sex was consensual.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">In May 2002, Ms. P., forty, lived on one side of a duplex in Hagerstown; her brother, John, lived on the other side. She was mentally challenged, yet for the most part, she was able to live independently.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">On May 16, 2002, she spent most of the day obtaining job applications at various fast-food restaurants in the Valley Mall located in Hagerstown. It was dark when she finished, and because she believed she had missed the last bus to her home, she began walking on Wessel Boulevard in the direction of her home.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">B. <em>Ms. P\u2019s Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-13\">As she walked along Wessel Boulevard, Ms. P. noticed a truck on the opposite side of the roadway. Appellant, whom she did not know, was the truck driver. Appellant asked Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>P. for directions to Frederick. Ms. P. told appellant that she was \u201cnot very good at giving directions\u201d and asked appellant to \u201cplease go to the gas station and ask the cashier to give ... directions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">Appellant drove off, but returned shortly thereafter. This time, his truck was on the same side of the road as Ms. P. Ms. P. approached the truck, and appellant again asked for directions to Frederick. Ms. P. attempted to give appellant directions, but he suggested that she show him how to get to that destination. She obliged by getting into the truck with appellant. After Ms. P. was seated, appellant identified himself as \u201cChristopher Cane\u201d and locked the doors of his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">As appellant drove, Ms. P. gave appellant directions to Frederick. Eventually, however, he stopped following those directions. This caused her to feel \u201cvery uncomfortable.\u201d As the two drove along Route 40, she saw a Sheetz Store and asked appellant to pull into the parking lot of the store because she had to use the bathroom. Appellant refused to stop, and thereafter the truck passed a \u201cwelcome to Frederick\u201d sign.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">During the trip, appellant brought up the topic of having sex. Ms. P. did not want to talk about that subject so that conversational gambit reached a dead end.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Appellant eventually turned his truck off Route 40 onto Hollow Road and then into a wooded area. After appellant stopped the truck, he unlocked the doors and told Ms. P. to get out. She complied. Appellant then walked to her side of the vehicle and told Ms. P. that he would not hurt her, but that he had a knife and, if she struggled, he would hurt her.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">Appellant placed one hand around Ms. P.\u2019s shoulder and neck and the other behind her back. Appellant then started \u201cdragging\u201d her down a hill. She fell and struck her back on sticks that were laying on the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">At the bottom of the hill, appellant told Ms. P. to get on the ground, \u201cspread her legs a little,\u201d and pull down her pants and underwear. Ms. P. complied because appellant told her that if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>she did not do what he said, he would hurt her. While restraining Ms. P., appellant forced Ms. P. to perform fellatio. Appellant next engaged in non-consensual vaginal intercourse with Ms. P. During these sexual acts, appellant placed his hand over Ms. P.\u2019s mouth so that she could not scream.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">After the rape, appellant told Ms. P. to get dressed and to get into the truck. She dressed, and appellant offered to take her to the Sheetz Store.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">At that point Ms. P. did not know where she was and was afraid of appellant so she got back in the truck. Appellant then drove back toward Hagerstown. As they approached the Sheetz store, appellant gave Ms. P. a $20.00 bill, saying the money was \u201cfor sex.\u201d He also said, \u201cDon\u2019t tell no one about this.\u201d Ms. P. did not ask for or want the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Ms. P. nevertheless took the money, got out of the truck, and went into the Sheetz Store. One of the cashiers then noticed that she was crying, found out why, and called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">C. <em>Testimony of Cindy Wagner</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">Cindy Wagner was working at the Sheetz Store when she observed Ms. P. enter. According to Ms. Wagner, Ms. P. \u201cwas standing there all excited looking, and I noticed she [had] messed up hair and her clothes were wrinkled and dirty ... so I went up and asked her if I could help her.\u201d Wagner added: \u201cWell she was so hyper, and I knew she, there must have been something wrong with her mentally because she acted like a child ten- or eleven-years old, and she had tears in her eyes.\u201d After Ms. P. explained what had happened, Ms. Wagner asked her if she would like her to call the police. Ms. P. responded in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">Ms. P. told Ms. Wagner that she was getting ready to go home from the store when a man offered her a ride home. The man did not take her home but, instead, drove to the woods by Hollow Road and \u201cmade her do things she didn\u2019t want to do.\u201d Ms. P. told Wagner that she repeatedly told the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>man \u201cNo,\u201d but that he nevertheless \u201cgrabbed her head and put it down there, put her mouth down there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">D. <em>Testimony of Police Officers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Deputy Brian Miller, who was employed by the Washington County Sheriffs Office in May of 2002,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> talked to Ms. P. on the night of the alleged sexual assault. During his interview, the deputy noticed that Ms. P. had \u201cslightly red marks all around ... the front of her neck.\u201d The deputy transported Ms. P. over the Frederick County line where they met with a deputy from Frederick County because Ms. P. said that the assault occurred in Frederick County.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Deputy First Class Paul Collantuno of the Frederick County Sheriffs Office met Deputy Miller and Ms. P. at the Washington County/Frederick County line. To Deputy Collantuno, Ms. P. appeared to have \u201ca mental deficiency.\u201d He added that her speech was \u201cvery labored,\u201d she \u201cstuttered a lot,\u201d and she had \u201cfacial ticks.\u201d Nonetheless, Ms. P. was able to tell the deputy that she had been on foot in the Hagerstown area when a brand new pick-up truck passed her by, circled around, and that the driver of the pick-up asked for directions to Frederick County. The driver told Ms. P. he was forty-seven-years old and that his name was Christopher Cane. He also told her that he would give her $20 or $30 if she showed him how to get to Frederick County. Ms. P. agreed to do so and got into the truck. Once she was in the truck, Ms. P. told the driver to get onto Interstate 70, but he did not do so. They then drove past the Sheetz Store on Route 40. Ms. P. asked the driver to stop at the store, but he refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Ms. P. told Deputy Collantuno that she recalled seeing a \u201cWelcome to Frederick\u201d sign and later a sign for Hollow Road and that the pick-up truck stopped a short distance later in a grassy area. Ms. P. reported that the driver then told her \u201cto do what she was told to do or else she\u2019d get hurt.\u201d After they got out of the truck, the driver forced her to perform oral sex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>on him even though she told him that she did not want to do it and did not like it. The driver then forced her to the ground and had vaginal intercourse with her. She told the driver to stop and that it hurt. Ms. P. also reported that she believed that the driver had a knife. She did not, however, say that she saw the knife, just that she believed he had one.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Ms. P. also reported to Deputy Collantuno that, following the assault, she and the driver got back into the pick-up truck, and she was driven to the Sheetz Store where she got out of the truck. The driver gave Ms. P. $20 for a taxi ride. After giving her statement, Ms. P. was transported to Frederick Memorial Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">D. <em>Testimony of Kim Day, R.N.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Kim Day, a registered nurse employed at Frederick Memorial Hospital, was qualified as an expert witness. On May 17, 2002, at 2:50 a.m., she came in contact with Ms. P. at the hospital emergency room. Ms. P. was \u201cchildlike,\u201d \u201capprehensive, frightened\u201d and appeared to be a person who did not understand a lot of the terminology she (Ms. Day) used.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">Ms. P. informed Day that she had driven with Christopher Cane from Hagerstown to Frederick County and then to a wooded area on Hollow Road, where \u201cCane\u201d \u201c[d]id something to me that I didn\u2019t ask for.\u201d Ms. P. also indicated that Cane told her that he had a pocket knife, but that he did not attack her with the knife. When they were in a field, Cane told Ms. P. that if she did not cooperate, he would hurt her. Cane then told her to put her mouth on his penis. Ms. P. told Cane that she was \u201cagainst it\u201d and that she \u201cdidn\u2019t like that.\u201d Cane also pulled her pants down. He told her that if she tried to scream he would put his hand over her mouth. At one point, cars drove by which caused Cane to put his hand over her mouth so she could not scream. She told Cane during intercourse that it hurt, and he stopped. Afterward, \u201cCane\u201d gave Ms. P. $20.00 for a ride home and dropped her off at Sheetz.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">Upon Day\u2019s examination of Ms. P., the nurse observed leaves and sticks on Ms. P.\u2019s clothing. Day also noticed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>several injuries, including an abrasion or scratch under her left breast and \u201c[r]ed, raised[,] ... linear pattern injuries\u201d on the inside of her left wrist. On Ms. P.\u2019s right flank, there were two linear pattern injuries of five and eight centimeters in length that were red and raised. Day opined that the injuries were consistent with a scrape to the back. Ms. P. also had multiple \u201cpunctate lesions\u201d on her buttocks, as if she had been lying on something sharp. Day opined that the linear patterns appeared to have been caused by Ms. P. lying on something \u201clike a twig or something like that.... \u201d There was also a bruise to the back of Ms. P.\u2019s leg. All the injuries were \u201cfresh.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Ms. P. complained of pain in the vaginal area. Upon conducting a genital exam, Day noticed that there was bleeding from the vagina and that there were two broken blood vessels in the vaginal area. Day opined that the ruptured blood vessels were \u201cconsistent with her [Ms. P.\u2019s] history of the event.\u201d Oral and vaginal swabs were collected from Ms. P.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">E. <em>Testimony of Corporal Buyers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Corporal Eric Buyers of the Frederick County Sheriffs Office testified that he responded to the hospital and interviewed Ms. P. He noted that she was \u201cvery withdrawn,\u201d \u201cvery meek,\u201d and that \u201cshe was of limited mental capacity.\u201d Ms. P. related to Corporal Buyers her version of what occurred. This version was, in all material respects, the same as what Ms. P. told Nurse Day.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">F. <em>DNA Test</em></p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">In November of 2003, the police developed appellant as a suspect in the rape of Ms. P. A search warrant was executed, and oral swabs were obtained from him. Regarding the DNA analysis performed on those swabs and the swabs obtained from Ms. P.\u2019s vaginal area, the State and the defense agreed to the following stipulation, which was read to the jury: The ... DNA profile obtained from semen identified on the first vaginal swab matches the DNA profile obtained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>from the known standard of Richard David Hurst. Therefore, within reasonable degree of scientific certainty Richard David Hurst is a contributor to the DNA profile obtained on the first vaginal swab. The probabilities of selecting an unrelated individual at random having a DNA profile matching the DNA profile obtained from the first vaginal swab are one and 470.0 quadrillion using U.S. Caucasian population database.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">II. <em>APPELLANT\u2019S TESTIMONY</em></p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Appellant testified that he lived with his fianc\u00e9 in Boonsboro and that, on the evening of May 16, 2002, he was driving in the area of Valley Mall when he saw Ms. P. walking alongside the road heading toward Hagerstown. She was walking \u201creal slow\u201d and would stop to play with leaves and branches on the trees and then would start walking again. He made a U-turn, which put him on the same side of the road as Ms. P. He again saw her playing with the leaves and branches, which made him uncertain as to whether she was \u201ctrying to get picked up.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Appellant, who had previously seen prostitutes in the area, pulled up beside Ms. P. and said, \u201cExcuse me, ma\u2019am, do you know where Frederick is?\u201d Ms. P. told appellant that he had to head back in the other direction. Appellant responded that he did not know where Frederick was because he was from the Baltimore area. He used this verbal ploy because he \u201cwas trying to ... get her to talk to me, you know what I mean, a fast pickup is what I was doing.\u201d Although appellant knew the area, he pretended ignorance because he \u201cwas trying to use a pickup line____\u201d Ms. P. then told appellant to go to a gas station down the road to obtain directions. At that point, appellant \u201cthought [Ms. P.] wanted to be picked up\u201d based on the way she was acting and because, in the past six years, he had picked up four to six prostitutes in the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">Appellant then asked Ms. P. to show him how to get to Frederick. Ms. P. said that she would be willing to do so except for the fact that she was on her way home. Appellant responded by saying that he would give her a ride home. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>two then agreed that Ms. P. would show him how to get to Frederick as long as he later drove her to her home. Ms. P. then got in his truck. He did not lock the doors.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">Appellant followed Ms. P.\u2019s directions to Frederick, and as they traveled, they talked.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ms. P. told appellant about her brother and said that she did not have any money for the bus. She added that she had been out collecting job applications that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Appellant continued to follow her directions, and Ms. P. volunteered that she was not married. Appellant told Ms. P. that his name was David. This was his middle name and also the name he had given to the prostitutes in the past. Appellant next asked Ms. P. if she and her boyfriend ever \u201cmessed around\u201d or if she was a virgin. Ms. P. said that she was not a virgin. She also said that her boyfriend had abused her.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Eventually, they came to the Route 70 exit sign. Ms. P. told appellant that, if he was going to Frederick, that was his turnoff. Appellant thanked her for the directions and told her he would like to stop so that he could urinate. Ms. P. told him that she did not mind. At that point, they saw a Sheetz Store, and Ms. P. said that he could use the store\u2019s bathroom. Appellant responded that he was \u201cvery particular\u201d about which public restrooms he used and that he did not want to use the facilities provided by Sheetz.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">Appellant continued to drive, and eventually he saw a \u201cWelcome to Frederick County\u201d sign. After they crossed the county line, appellant took the first right onto a road. He then traveled approximately 100 yards down the road until he saw a field with a walkway. Appellant pulled the truck over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>to the side of the walkway, got out, and urinated while Ms. P. remained seated.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Appellant got back into the truck, lit a cigarette, and asked Ms. P. if she would like to make some money. Ms. P. asked how. Appellant responded: \u201cJust fooling around a little bit.\u201d When Ms. P. said that she had \u201cnever done that before,\u201d appellant confided that he was \u201cjust trying to have a little bit of sex, do a little something.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Ms. P. then got out of the truck and appeared angry \u201cbecause it was like she ... wanted to get home or something.\u201d Ms. P. started walking away, saying that she was going home. Appellant then persuaded her to come back to the truck because she did not know where she was. They both got back in the truck. Appellant lit another cigarette, they talked again, and Ms. P. again said that she wanted to go home. Appellant then offered Ms. P. $20 if she would \u201cfool around a little bit.\u201d After hearing this offer, Ms. P. agreed to engage in sexual intercourse with him as long as he took her back home afterward.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">The two walked down a path. When Ms. P. asked what time it was, appellant lied and said that it was earlier than it was, which relaxed Ms. P. because the lie convinced her that she was not already late getting home. As they walked, Ms. P. got caught in a rosebush. Appellant helped free her, and they continued walking along the path until Ms. P. slipped and fell down a slope. Eventually, they came to a creek where they stopped.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">Ms. P. got on her knees, appellant pulled his zipper down, and took out his penis, and Ms. P. performed fellatio on him. After 30 to 60 seconds, appellant \u201cpushed her off.\u201d He then asked her to place his penis inside of her. According to appellant, \u201c[s]he didn\u2019t say no and she didn\u2019t say yes. She just more or less did it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">Appellant proceeded to have consensual intercourse with Ms. P. Initially, she was \u201cokay,\u201d but when he started to ejaculate, she \u201cfreaked out on me\u201d and began \u201cto push and tug\u201d at him. Appellant grabbed Ms. P. and \u201c[tjhat\u2019s where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>the marks came from ... the marks that she had.\u201d Appellant conceded that at one point he had placed his hand over Ms. P.\u2019s mouth \u201cfor a couple seconds.\u201d He did so because he \u201cwas afraid ... she was turning it into something that [it] wasn\u2019t.\u201d Appellant added that during intercourse he knew \u201cthat something was wrong\u201d but did not think \u201cshe wanted me to stop until ... at the end where she just ... freaked out.\u201d He did not know why Ms. P. \u201cfreaked out.\u201d According to appellant, when Ms. P. asked him to stop, he did so immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Appellant next helped Ms. P. dress. At that point, Ms. P. said that she needed to get home and was worried about her brother\u2019s reaction to her being out late. They walked back to appellant\u2019s truck, and appellant gave her $20, which Ms. P. accepted. Nevertheless, Ms. P. was upset.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Appellant told Ms. P. that he was taking her home. As they approached the Sheetz Store, Ms. P. asked him to drop her off there. Appellant pulled into the Sheetz parking lot. Ms. P. said that she would take a cab home and got out of the truck. Appellant then drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Appellant denied ever threatening Ms. P. or saying that he would hurt her if she did not do what he told her to do. He also denied telling her that he had a knife or holding her against her will. Additionally, he testified that all sexual relations he had with Ms. P. were completely consensual.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">III. <em>REBUTTAL EVIDENCE</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">A. <em>Testimony of Jacqueline Yu E.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">Jacqueline Yu E. testified that, during the late evening to early morning hours of February 2, 1981, she was returning home and parked her car in the area of Guilford Avenue in Baltimore City. While she stood next to her car, she was approached by a strange man, later identified as appellant. Appellant told Ms. E. that he needed directions to Washington Street and University Avenue because he was going there to visit a friend. Ms. E. told appellant that she did not know where those streets were, but appellant replied that he just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>wanted to see his Mend and that the address was close by. According to Ms. E., appellant then moved toward her and indicated that he had a knife in his pocket. He did not, however, show Ms. E. the knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Appellant next forced Ms. E. to get into her car; he then forced his way into the car and had her roll up all the windows and lock all the doors. He then told her that \u201call he wanted was a lift to his Mend\u2019s apartment\u201d and counseled her to \u201crelax [and] that everything was going to be okay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">After driving for several hours, they stopped in a secluded residential area. Appellant had Ms. E. turn off the lights and the engine. Appellant said that he wanted one more thing and that he would then leave. That one thing was \u201ca blow job.\u201d Ms. E. told appellant that she did not know what that was so he \u201cforced [her] down ... on to him.\u201d After appellant forced Ms. E. to perform oral sex, he then forced her to engage in vaginal intercourse with him. After the rape, appellant allowed Ms. E. to dress and had her drive him to a location where he got out of her car. Ms. E. then drove away.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">B. <em>Testimony of Corporal David Deweiss</em></p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">Corporal David Deweiss of the Frederick County Sheriffs Office testified that, on November 26, 2003, he interviewed appellant at the Frederick County Law Enforcement Center. Also present during the interview was Maryland State Trooper First Class Rick Bachtel. After the corporal advised appellant of his Miranda rights, appellant said that he understood those rights and agreed to speak with the officers without an attorney being present. In the course of the ensuing interview, appellant admitted that he typically brings prostitutes to a secluded area near where he had picked them up. At first, appellant could not explain why he drove to another county with Ms. P., but later he said that it was \u201c[b]eeause she was talking,\u201d i.e., she talked continuously about looking for jobs and putting in applications. Her talkativeness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>caused appellant to become agitated because \u201che had picked her up for sex.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">Corporal Deweiss also testified that, when questioned by Trooper Bachtel, appellant denied placing his hand over Ms. P.\u2019s mouth. Later in the interview, in reply to the corporal\u2019s question, appellant once again \u201cadamantly denied\u201d covering Ms. P.\u2019s mouth with his hands. When the corporal inquired if appellant might have inadvertently placed a hand over her mouth, appellant again stated that he had not done so. After Corporal Deweiss informed appellant that Ms. P. had said that he had placed his hand over her mouth, appellant admitted that he had done so \u201cfor a couple of seconds\u201d during intercourse because she continued to talk about job hunting and putting in applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">According to Corporal Deweiss, appellant also recalled during questioning by the corporal that he and Ms. P. had argued over when she was to be paid. Ms. P. wanted to be paid before the sexual acts, but appellant wanted to pay her afterward.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">IV. <em>DISCUSSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"A93\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Prior to calling Ms. E. as a rebuttal witness, the prosecutor proffered that Ms. E. would</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-8\">testify that in 1981 she was approached by the defendant in Baltimore ... and asked for directions. She was standing next to her vehicle, that he forced her, that he told her that he had a knife in his pocket and threatened to harm her. He told her everything would be all right if she did what he said. And he forced her in ... her car that she\u2019s standing next to and abducted her. He forced her to perform oral sex, and then he forced sexual intercourse on her.

State, </em>94 Md.App. 715, 619 A.2d 155 (1993).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Defense counsel responded that the details of the offense were not so unusual as to distinguish it from a typical sex offense case. In this regard, counsel argues that there were \u201cnot enough distinctive common details\u201d to allow for admission of the prior offense. The trial court found that the other crimes evidence was admissible both to rebut the defense of consent and under the common scheme or plan exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">In this appeal, appellant contends that the trial court erred in admitting Ms. E.\u2019s testimony because (purportedly) it was offered simply to show appellant\u2019s propensity to commit crime or his character as a criminal. Appellant asserts that, in order for the other crimes evidence to be admissible to disprove consent, the prior criminal activity must qualify as a \u201csignature\u201d crime. Appellant refers us to out-of-state cases, primarily those cited in <em>Stevenson, supra, </em>in support of his position that, in order for \u201cother crimes\u201d to be admissible to prove lack of consent, the prior rape must qualify as a signature crime, the relevancy of which has not been diminished by the passage of time. Appellant further asserts that the prior rape and sexual assault did not have the attributes of a signature, which would make them relevant to the allegations in the present case. In addition, appellant maintains that the passage of more than twenty years between the two events makes the first crime even less relevant to the consent issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">To further support his argument, appellant refers us to Maryland Rule 5-609(b), which does not permit impeachment by use of a prior conviction more than fifteen-years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Appellant also argues that the prejudicial effect of the evidence presented by Ms. E. was demonstrated by the prose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>cutor\u2019s heavy reliance on that testimony during closing argument.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">Generally, \u201cevidence of a defendant\u2019s prior criminal acts may not be introduced to prove guilt of the offense for which the defendant is on trial.\u201d <em>Ayers v. State, </em>335 Md. 602, 630, 645 A.2d 22 (1994) (citations omitted). Prior criminal acts are excluded to avoid confusing the jurors, prejudicing their minds against the defendant, and predisposing them to a belief that the defendant is guilty. <em>Terry v. State, </em>332 Md. 329, 334, 631 A.2d 424 (1993). The rule excluding \u201cother crimes\u201d reflects a \u201cfear that jurors will conclude from evidence of other bad acts that the defendant is a \u2018bad person\u2019 and should therefore be convicted, or deserves punishment for other bad conduct and so may be convicted even though the evidence is lacking....\u201d <em>Harris v. State, </em>324 Md. 490, 496, 597 A.2d 956 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">\u201cEvidence of other crimes may be admitted, however, if it is substantially relevant to some contested issue in the case and if not offered to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt based on a propensity to commit crime or his character as a criminal.\u201d <em>State v. Faulkner, </em>314 Md. 630, 634, 552 A.2d 896 (1989) (citations omitted). Accordingly, Maryland Rule 5-404(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, common scheme or plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">These \u201crecognized \u2018exceptions\u2019 to the exclusionary rule are not exclusive.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>324 Md. at 501, 597 A.2d 956.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">\u201cBefore other crimes evidence is admitted, a three-part determination must be made by the trial court.\u201d <em>Sifrit v. State, </em>383 Md. 116, 133, 857 A.2d 88 (2004). <em>See also Skrivanek v. State, </em>356 Md. 270, 291-92, 739 A.2d 12 (1999), <em>Streater v.

First, the trial court must determine whether the evidence fits within one of the exceptions. <em>Faulkner, </em>314 Md. at 634-35, 552 A.2d 896.

Third, the trial court must carefully balance the necessity for and probative value of the other crimes evidence against any undue prejudice likely to result from its admission. <em>Id. </em>at 635, 552 A.2d 896. This is a discretionary determination on the part of the trial court. <em>Id.) see also Oesby, </em>142 Md.App. at 167-68, 788 A.2d 662 (\u201cThis final balancing between probative value and unfair prejudice is something that is entrusted to the wide discretion of the trial judge---- Reversal should be reserved for those rare and bizarre exercises of discretion that are, in the judgment of the appellate court, not only wrong but flagrantly and outrageously so.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">In <em>Stevenson v. State, </em>94 Md.App. 715, 619 A.2d 155 (1993), the defendant was charged with the rape of his estranged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>wife. The State\u2019s evidence demonstrated that Mr. Stevenson broke into his wife\u2019s home, demanded that she have sex with him, and raped her when she refused. The defense was that of consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">At trial, the defendant\u2019s wife was allowed to testify about an incident that occurred ten months prior to the alleged rape. In the prior incident, the defendant broke into his wife\u2019s home, asked her to make love to him, and when she refused, attacked her with a butcher knife and cut off her shoulder-length hair. Prior to trial, the defendant pled guilty to the battery as a result of the first incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">On appeal, this Court concluded that admission of the wife\u2019s testimony concerning the previous battery was not error because it was relevant to counter the husband\u2019s consent defense. <em>Stevenson, </em>94 Md.App. at 724, 619 A.2d 155. The prior battery helped explain why, at the time of the rape, the wife eventually stopped fighting the defendant in that it showed her fear of him and of the possibility that more violence might be directed at her. <em>Id. </em>at 725-26, 619 A.2d 155. In reaching this conclusion, we relied on numerous cases from other states, which had \u201crecognized that other crimes evidence is admissible to rebut a consent defense in a rape case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 726, 619 A.2d 155 (citations omitted).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We also noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-7\">The probative value of such evidence is so great that it has been permitted even when the prior bad activity took place <em>years </em>before the present charge. Indeed, many courts have permitted evidence of other previous bad acts by the defendant perpetrated on victims <em>other </em>than the prosecutrix to be admitted to counter a defense of consent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-9\">...

Thus, the battery possessed \u201cspecial relevance transcending mere criminal character.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>324 Md. at 504, 597 A.2d 956. Not only was the \u201cnecessity for the evidence ... obvious[,]\u201d but also proof of the March battery was \u201cclear, convincing and uncomplicated\u201d; appellant had pled guilty to the offense. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Finally, we believe that the \u201cprobative value\u201d of the evidence as to the March battery substantially outweighs the \u201cpotential for prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The evidence as to the March battery was obviously potentially inflammatory. [The defendant\u2019s wife\u2019s] testimony as to it, however, was a very limited portion of her extensive testimony; it is contained in only 6 transcript pages-her testimony consumed more than 120 pages. Moreover, her account in the transcript, considering the subject matter itself, appeared relatively passionless. Furthermore, here, as in <em>Howard v. State, </em>324 Md. 505, 516, 597 A.2d 964 (1991), the evidence of the prior crime came from the same witness who presented the principal evidence against the defendant. Thus, as in Howard, \u201c[i]f the jury chose to reject\u201d that witness\u2019s testimony \u201cas to how this incident occurred, it is likely they would reject as well her testimony concerning the alleged prior\u201d crime. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we conclude as the Court of Appeals did in Howard, that \u201cthe trial judge did not err in finding that the relevance of this testimony,\u201d crucial as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>was, \u201cwas not outweighed by its potential for unfair prejudice.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><em>Stevenson, </em>94 Md.App. at 728-29, 619 A.2d 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Many cases cited in <em>Stevenson </em>allowed evidence of other sex crimes that were quite similar to the offenses for which the defendant was on trial. <em>See, e.g., Williams v. State, </em>95 Nev. 830, 603 P.2d 694, 696-97 (1979) (the defendant was charged with raping a woman in 1978 after the victim met with the defendant for a job interview and at the interview he demonstrated his expertise in the art of karate; other crimes evidence admitted through testimony of two other women, who each testified that, in 1976, they had met defendant at a job interview and that he subsequently coerced them into submitting to intercourse after demonstrating his karate abilities; Court noted the \u201cremarkable similarity of the modus operandi in the testimony regarding the other crimes, and their relative proximity in time to the charged offense\u201d); <em>People v.

For example, in <em>State v. DeBaere, </em>356 N.W.2d 301 (Minn.1984), the victim testified that the defendant entered her residence and, after a struggle, raped her. The victim did not know how the defendant, who had on other occasions entered her residence uninvited, gained access to her home, but she explained that her children sometimes forgot to lock the door. The defendant claimed that the victim invited him into her house and consented to the act of intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The following other crimes evidence was admitted at the <em>DeBaere </em>trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">(i) Testimony by two women that in the fall of 1979 defendant, whom they both knew but had never dated, came to their apartment early in the morning after a dance they had all attended and, after being admitted, attempted but failed to force each of them to have sexual intercourse with him before they joined forces and pushed him out of the apartment. They did not report the matter to the police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-8\">(ii) Testimony by a woman that on April 27, 1980, she met defendant at a dance and afterward he offered to drive her to a restaurant but instead drove her to a field where he raped her. Defendant was convicted of criminal sexual conduct in the fourth degree (apparently as a result of a guilty plea) in connection with that incident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>(iii) Testimony by a woman, who knew defendant but had not dated him, that early on the morning after Halloween, 1981, defendant, after gaining entrance to her apartment by saying that he needed to talk, attempted to force her to have sexual intercourse with him before she broke free, picked up a chair and ordered him to leave. She did not report the incident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">(iv) Testimony by a female relative of defendant that early on January 1, 1982, defendant entered her room at her father\u2019s house without permission, jumped into bed with her, and tried to force her to have sexual intercourse with him before he was scared off when a light flickered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-6\"><em>DeBaere, </em>356 N.W.2d at 304-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">The Minnesota Supreme Court upheld the admission of this evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-8\">In this case the defendant allegedly entered the house of a female acquaintance without consent, forced himself on her, and then, when complaint was made, claimed consent. The other-crime evidence showed a pattern of similar aggressive sexual behavior by defendant against other women in the community. Given our prior <em>cases\u2014e.g., State v. Morrison, </em>310 N.W.2d 135 (Minn.1981)\u2014we believe that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence, which was highly relevant to the issue of consent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4H\"><em>Id. </em>at 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">As can be seen, the prior bad acts admitted in <em>DeBaere </em>were similar but by no means identical or signature crimes. <em>See also Fisher v.

Further, according to the victims, appellant told both women that he had a knife. He also told both women that everything was going to be okay if they cooperated.

Cox, </em>787 P.2d 4 (Utah Ct.App.1990), in support of his argument that a prior offense of the sort admitted in this case was inadmissible. In <em>Cox, </em>the Utah Court of Appeals held that the similarities between two incidents were not sufficient. Those similarities were that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa9\">(1) defendant knew each victim; (2) defendant had nonconsensual intercourse, at each victims\u2019 home, while the victims\u2019 boyfriends or husbands were not home; (3) defendant was uninvited and began the assaults soon after entering the home; (4) defendant laid on top of the victims; (5) defendant did not completely remove his clothing or the victims\u2019 clothing, and in each instance, attempted to kiss the victim on the face and neck; and (6) defendant left the premises after completing the assault.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">787 P.2d at 6. The <em>Cox </em>Court concluded that the defendant\u2019s actions did not constitute common design or modus operandi. <em>Id. </em>Rather, the similarities were common to many assault or rape cases and were not peculiarly distinctive of the defendant\u2019s conduct. <em>Id. </em>By contrast, appellant\u2019s ploy of asking directions, traveling with the victims on long trips, threatening them with a knife, and after forced sex, letting the women go free cannot be characterized as common to many rape or assault cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Also, we reject appellant\u2019s proposed bright-line rule that a more than twenty-year-old offense is <em>per se </em>inadmissible for the purpose of rebutting the defense of consent to a sexual act. Rather, the remoteness of the offense is an item for the trial court\u2019s consideration when engaged in the third step of the required analysis, i.e., the probative value of the evidence against the danger of unfair prejudice. In this regard, we note that other courts have permitted some very old offenses to be admitted at trial as proof of prior bad acts. <em>See, e.g., United States v.

We perceive no abuse by the trial court in admitting the rebuttal testimony of Ms. P.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Appellant also refers us to Maryland Rule 5-609, which addresses the admission of prior convictions for purposes of impeachment. Under Rule 5-609(b), a prior <em>conviction </em>is not admissible for purposes of impeachment of the defendant\u2019s credibility if more than fifteen years have elapsed from the date of the conviction. Maryland Rule 5-404 addresses the admission of other crimes evidence and does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>contain a time limit for admission of that evidence. We decline to engraft such a requirement onto Rule 5-404.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">On Monday, July 12, 2004, shortly before trial began, appellant, through his defense counsel, requested a postponement of his case on three grounds. First, appellant believed that he and defense counsel were not prepared for trial because they had met only twice and appellant had not been able to give his counsel a detailed account of the events at issue. Second, appellant indicated that he would like to retain additional counsel to assist in his defense. Third, appellant had not been aware previously that trial was to start that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The following exchange then occurred between the court and defense counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-8\">THE COURT: [Defense Counsel], are you prepared to go to trial today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Uh, pretty much. Uh, I, I, I would say that, uh, if there were more time I would be more prepared. Uh, there have been some things that have come to light, uh, for instance, uh, uh, I just, just learned pretty much over the weekend that the State may be bringing another witness down to testify about a prior offense in a signature or pattern type crime. And, uh, that was just disclosed yesterday, because I don\u2019t think the State knew it any, any earlier than that. Uh, and if that evidence came in, uh, it would be very devastating in this case, and that\u2019s something that we were not aware of until just, in fact, it was yesterday, Sunday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-10\">Uh ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-11\">THE COURT: [0]ther than that are you prepared to go to trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-13\">Appellant then reiterated: (1) that he had not had enough time to speak with his attorney and (2) that he did not know he was to proceed to trial that day. The trial court, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>response, pointed out that, on March 8, appellant appeared before the court and was twice informed of the trial date. Further, a worksheet, which also listed the trial date, had been provided to counsel for appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Defense counsel then reminded the court that the State was seeking life imprisonment without the possibility of parole and that there had not been a prior request for a postponement by either the defense or the State. Counsel added that he was \u201ccertainly amenable to having other Counsel involved in this case because of the ... serious nature of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The prosecutor informed the court that she was prepared to go forward with trial and was opposed to a postponement.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">The trial court noted that appellant met with counsel on Friday (July 9, 2004, which was three days before trial) and that defense counsel indicated that in his (defense counsel\u2019s) view his discussions with appellant were sufficient. The court also said that the evidence to which counsel referred (testimony of Ms. E.) had not yet been ruled upon and, even if admitted, would not come in until rebuttal. Finally, even though appellant believed trial was to start the following week, appellant had made no effort to secure additional counsel. As a result, the court found: \u201cThere are no valid reasons for continuance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">A discussion regarding appellant\u2019s rejection of two proposed plea agreements next ensued. When defense counsel advised the court that appellant would not accept either agreement and would rather go to trial, the court asked appellant if that was correct and appellant responded: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I need more time.\u201d Appellant then inquired: \u201cIs there anyway possible I can get other legal representation?\u201d The court immediately asked appellant why he sought new counsel. Appellant replied that his lawyer did not know \u201cevery single detail of the incident that night.\u201d The court thereafter once again noted that appellant had met with his counsel on the past Friday and that defense counsel had advised the court that the visit ended because there was nothing more to discuss.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Appellant next asked what would happen if he dismissed his lawyer in order to obtain new counsel. The court explained that, if he did not have a valid reason to discharge counsel, and the court had not yet heard such a reason, appellant would go to trial that day without an attorney. Appellant again said that he was not prepared to go to trial, and the court once again inquired as to appellant\u2019s reasons for seeking new counsel. Appellant replied that his attorney did not \u201cknow everything that happened that night from beginning to end____\u201d In addition, appellant said that his counsel had read the victim\u2019s statement to him, and he had not had time to go through the statement and inform counsel what were and were not the \u201clies in the statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Defense counsel indicated that he was prepared to try the case and that, on Friday, appellant had not informed him of the concerns he had just related to the court. Counsel added, however, that at their last meeting appellant had asked him whether he was prepared, and counsel responded that he believed that he was prepared. The court then once again denied appellant\u2019s motion for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Appellant contends that the trial court abused the discretion granted to the trial court under Maryland Rule 4-215(e) when it refused to grant him a postponement in order to obtain new counsel. He alleges that his reasons for requesting the postponement and his justified dissatisfaction with counsel were more than ample proof that a postponement was warranted. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">First, and most important, appellant\u2019s dissatisfaction with his counsel was not shown to be justified. His reasons for a postponement were likewise not well grounded. Appellant was explicitly advised of the trial date long before trial. Appellant had no valid reason to believe trial was set for a week later than the date actually scheduled. Moreover, even if it was true that appellant thought trial was one week later, he gave no indication as to how he would utilize the extra time except to say that he wanted to retain new counsel. In light of the fact that new counsel had not been either retained or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>even contacted as of July 12, 2004, the trial judge had good reason to doubt that appellant had been diligent in attempting to obtain replacement counsel. Under these circumstances, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to grant appellant\u2019s request for a continuance so that he could obtain new counsel.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b251-8\">.

On cross-examination, the prosecutor inquired if Ms. P. spoke to appellant as she had while on the witness stand the previous day.

But that was no ice-breaker. He intended to abduct. His scheme was to threaten and commit sexual assault, and we don\u2019t have to look any further than what Jacqueline Yu [E.] told you to understand that. You can consider her testimony when assessing the defendant\u2019s intent, his common scheme, his absence of mistake. He wasn\u2019t looking for a prostitute. Without question the defendant told Ms. [E.] or the defendant approached Ms. [E.], asked her for directions, told her he had a knife in his pocket, but never showed it, abducted her for hours, forced her head and made her perform oral sex, then raped her, and then he let her go.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b262-12\">.
