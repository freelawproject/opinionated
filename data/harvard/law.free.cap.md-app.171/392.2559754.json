We shall hold that it may.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-12\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b375-13\">Appellants Fred S. Sommer, an attorney, and Shulman, Rogers, Gandal, Pordy &amp; Ecker, P.A., his law firm (collectively referred to in the singular as Sommer), appeal the grant of summary judgment in favor of their former client, appellee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Lori Denise Rhoads. Appellants are attempting to collect the alleged balance due for attorney\u2019s fees incurred by Rhoads in connection with her employment discrimination lawsuit against her former employer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The First Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">In June 1994, Sommer filed a federal suit on behalf of Rhoads, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>violations of the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), arising from Rhoads\u2019s exposure to secondhand smoke in her workplace and her employer\u2019s allegedly retaliatory termination after she threatened to file an ADA discrimination claim. <em>See Rhoads v. F.D.I.C., </em>257 F.3d 373, 377-79 (4th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 933, 122 S.Ct. 1309,152 L.Ed.2d 219 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">In February 1997, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the employer on nine of Rhoads\u2019s ten claims. <em>See Rhoads v. FDIC, </em>956 F.Supp. 1239 (D.Md.1997). A February 1998 jury trial of the remaining FMLA claim resulted in a defense verdict for the employer. Sommer filed various post-trial motions on Rhoads\u2019s behalf, none of which were successful.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">Rhoads\u2019s Bankruptcy</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">By that time, Rhoads claims, she had paid Sommer approximately $20,000 in attorney\u2019s fees and costs. On March 27, 1998, Rhoads filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, thereby staying the discrimination suit before the time for noting an appeal from the district court judgment expired. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">In her bankruptcy schedules, Rhoads listed a $190,000 debt to Sommer for \u201cLegal services\u201d as \u201can unsecured nonpriority claim.\u201d Rhoads also disclosed her \u201c[cjivil claim for damages,\u201d which she noted resulted in a \u201cjudgment for defendant 3/4/96, time for appeal has not expired.\u201d Sommer was identified as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>creditor and served notice. He did not file any response or other claim in the bankruptcy proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The bankruptcy trustee concluded that there was no value to the estate in pursuing the litigation through appeal, and ultimately that there was \u201cno property available for distribution from the estate.\u201d He therefore released to Rhoads any interest she might have in the litigation. Rhoads\u2019s debts were unconditionally discharged on July 2,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The First Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">That summer, Sommer discussed with Rhoads an appeal of the district court judgment. He wrote Rhoads that he was \u201cwilling to bring an appeal challenging the special verdict form used\u201d to try the FMLA claim, and, depending on further research, <em>\u201cmight </em>also be willing to challenge the district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling\u201d dismissing the ADA claim and limiting the period of back pay. Sommer stated that he was \u201cnot willing to raise any other issues or argument on appeal.\u201d In addition, Sommer proposed that Rhoads \u201cwould remain responsible for all unpaid fees and costs incurred to date and any future fees and costs, pursuant to the terms of our original fee agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">While they continued to negotiate, Sommer noted an appeal on Rhoads\u2019s behalf to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in order to preserve her right to challenge the district court judgment. During their discussions about such an appeal, Rhoads questioned, <em>inter alia, </em>whether a new retainer agreement would revive the debt that she believed had been discharged in bankruptcy. In response, Sommer took the position that, although he did \u201cnot intend to seek recovery from you of the unpaid attorney\u2019s fees and costs,\u201d he still had \u201ca statutory lien for those fees and costs against any recovery you obtain in this case,\u201d and that this lien was not discharged in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">Disagreements between attorney and client continued. Sommer officially withdrew as Rhoads\u2019s attorney, effective August 29, 1998. One month later, on September 28, 1998, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Sommer asserted an attorney\u2019s lien for $159,729.74 (hereinafter, \u201cSommer\u2019s Lien Claim\u201d), asserting the right to require the FDIC or the Court \u201cto hold any money payable ... to Ms. Rhoads relating to the action, proceeding, judgment, or award.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Rhoads proceeded with the appeal <em>pro se. </em>Although the Fourth Circuit affirmed the judgment against Rhoads on her FMLA claims, the appellate court held that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on Rhoads\u2019s retaliation claim under the ADA. <em>See Rhoads, </em>257 F.3d at 394. The case was remanded for a new trial on that cause of action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">According to Rhoads, the ADA retaliation claim was what Sommer refused to pursue on appeal, whereas the FMLA arguments that Sommer advocated as grounds for appeal were rejected as contrary to the plain meaning of the statute. Not surprisingly, Sommer disputes Rhoads\u2019s contentions, asserting that she prevailed by relying on theories and evidence that he developed in discovery, pleadings, and trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">The Second Trial And Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">Rhoads continued to represent herself during the second trial. In December 2002, more than four years after Sommer withdrew as Rhoads\u2019s attorney, a federal jury found that the employer terminated Rhoads for asserting her rights under the ADA. The jury awarded Rhoads damages of approximately $120,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">Rhoads then moved for an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs. In support, she cited Sommer\u2019s \u201cstatutory lien in the amount of $159,729.74\u201d and stated that she had \u201calready paid Mr. Sommer a total of $20,398.52[.]\u201d Rhoads asserted that during the five years of Sommer\u2019s representation, he billed \u201capproximately 270 hours per year,\u201d which \u201cwas, in all regards, reasonable.\u201d She requested a total award of $175,744.99, which included fees and expenses for legal work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>performed by her first attorney,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Sommer, and herself. In June 2003, Sommer moved to intervene for the purpose of being heard on the fee issue. The district court denied leave to intervene and also denied Rhoads\u2019s claim for fees and costs. <em>See Rhoads v. FDIC, </em>286 F.Supp.2d 532, 545 (D.Md.2003), <em>aff'd, </em>94 Fed.Appx. 187 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>543 U.S. 927, 125 S.Ct. 331, 160 L.Ed.2d 226 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">In its ruling, the federal court pointed out that Rhoads had asserted \u201cthat she owes nothing to Sommer as a result of the bankruptcy discharge.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 543. In addition, \u201c[i]t could be a windfall ... to award her attorney\u2019s fees when she is simultaneously pursuing a judgment for attorney\u2019s fees in another forum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court suggested that, \u201ceven if [Sommer] were entitled to fees\u201d for work performed prior to Rhoads\u2019s bankruptcy, \u201cthe amount would be very small\u201d because \u201cthe prevailing party is not entitled to fees incurred in pursuing unsuccessful claims\u201d and, \u201c[o]f the approximately ten original claims, only one was ultimately successful.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 542 n. 7. Finally, the federal court observed that, due to Sommer\u2019s withdrawal \u201cbefore Rhoads prevailed at the Fourth Circuit and second trial,\u201d Sommer \u201cwould need to establish that [his] efforts, and not those of Rhoads or <em>amicus, </em>produced the final judgment in favor of Rhoads.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rhoads\u2019s second appeal to the Fourth Circuit was unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Sommer\u2019s Lien Action</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">In December 2004, Sommer filed in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County a verified complaint in this action, seeking a declaration \u201cthat the Attorney\u2019s Lien is valid and enforceable against the\u201d judgment Rhoads obtained in the second trial, and asking the court to \u201cenforce the Attorney\u2019s Lien against\u201d \u201cthat judgment.\u201d The amount of Sommer\u2019s lien claim is $159,729.74, the same amount Sommer claimed when he withdrew six years earlier. Sommer also requested injunctive relief to ensure payment of his fees from any FDIC payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>made to satisfy the judgment in favor of Rhoads. In response, the circuit court ordered the FDIC to pay $40,000 of the $120,000 judgment into the court registry.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Rhoads moved to dismiss Sommer\u2019s lawsuit. While that motion was pending, Sommer moved for summary judgment. After briefing and oral argument, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County granted judgment in favor of Rhoads, treating her motion to dismiss as one for summary judgment. The court interpreted the Retainer Agreement between Sommer and Rhoads to be a waiver of Sommer\u2019s statutory lien rights. It held that Sommer agreed to forego his statutory lien rights by agreeing that, if his representation did not yield a judgment or settlement in Rhoads\u2019s favor, she would not be obligated to pay more than $500 per month toward the outstanding fee balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Sommer noted this appeal, raising six issues.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We address only the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>I. Under the terms of the Retainer Agreement and in light of Sommer\u2019s withdrawal as counsel after the unsuccessful first trial, did Sommer waive his right to a lien against the judgment Rhoads obtained in the second trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-5\">II. Did Rhoads\u2019s Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge her debt to Sommer arising from the first unsuccessful trial?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">We answer both questions no, vacate the judgment, and remand to the circuit court for resolution of the remaining issues that were not decided on summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AD3\">The Retainer Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">The Retainer Agreement (the Agreement) between Sommer and Rhoads provides for a hybrid attorney\u2019s fee, consisting of both a \u201cGuaranteed Fee\u201d accruing at $100 per hour and a \u201cContingent Premium\u201d that potentially could raise the total compensation to 30 percent of Rhoads\u2019s recovery \u201c[i]n the event that [she] obtains a judgment or settlement in her favor[.]\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Guaranteed Fee is \u201cpayable regardless of whether a judgment or settlement is obtained in Client\u2019s favor.\u201d In no event could the Guaranteed Fee plus the Contingent Premium exceed 30 percent of the total recovery from settlement or judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">With respect to the payment of fees and costs, the Agreement provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">1. <em>Monthly Payments</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-11\">Client will be billed monthly for all fees and costs incurred. Except for certain additional fee payments set forth below, Client will be required to pay within 30 days of the monthly bill:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>\u2022 Either the balance of the fees outstanding or $500 toward the outstanding balance, whichever is less, plus</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">\u2022 all costs advanced by Attorney</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">In addition to the $500 monthly installment toward fees, Client will also be required to pay on a monthly basis for all hours worked in excess of 25 in a calendar month, provided that Attorney has obtained authorization for Client from such hours____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">2. <em>Payment Upon Receipt Of Judgment Or Settlement Proceeds Or Conclusion Of Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\"><em>Attorney will be entitled to payment of all fees and costs owed upon Client\u2019s receipt of the proceeds of a judgment or settlement upon the conclusion of any action brought by Attorney upon Client\u2019s behalf If there is no judgment or settlement in favor of Client, Client will pay the outstanding balance to Attorney in $500 monthly installments. </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">Lien Law</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">Under Maryland common law, attorneys do not have a charging lien. <em>See Tucker v. Dudley, </em>223 Md. 467, 472, 164 A.2d 891 (1960). In 1985, the General Assembly established a statutory attorney\u2019s lien. <em>See </em>1985 Md. Laws, ch. 723; <em>Con-sol. Constr. Servs., Inc. v. Simpson, </em>372 Md. 434, 460-61, 813 A.2d 260 (2002). Md.Code (1989, 2004 Repl.Vol.), section 10-501 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article (BOP), provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-11\">(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014Subject to subsection (b) of this section, an attorney at law has a lien on:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-12\">(1) a cause of action or proceeding of a client of the attorney at law from the time the cause of action arises or the proceeding begins; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-13\">(2) a settlement, judgment, or award that a client receives as a result of legal services that the attorney at law performs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>(b) <em>Limited fee </em>agreement.\u2014A lien under this section attaches only if, and to the extent that, under a specific agreement between an attorney at law and a client, the client owes the attorney at law a fee or other compensation for legal services that produced the settlement, judgment, or award....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-5\">(d) Execution.\u2014An attorney at law may ... bring an action for execution under the lien only in accordance with rules that the Court of Appeals adopts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">In turn, Md. Rule 2-652 specifies certain procedures that attorneys must follow to assert a lien under BOP section 10-501:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-7\">(b) Statutory lien. An attorney who has a lien under [BOP] \u00a7 10-501, may assert the lien by serving a written notice by certified mail or personal delivery upon the client and upon each person against whom the lien is to be enforced. The notice shall claim the lien, state the attorney\u2019s interest in the action, proceeding, settlement, judgment, or award, and inform the client or other person to hold any money payable or property passing to the client relating to the action, proceeding, settlement, judgment, or award.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-8\">(c) Adjudication of rights and lien disputes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-9\">(1) When a circuit court action has been filed. If a lien asserted pursuant to this Rule relates to an action that has been filed in a circuit court of this State, on motion filed by the attorney, the attorney\u2019s client in the action, or any person who has received a notice pursuant to section (b) of this Rule, the court shall adjudicate the rights of the parties in relation to the lien, including the attorney\u2019s entitlement to a lien, any dispute as to the papers subject to a lien under section (a) of this Rule, and the amount of the attorney\u2019s claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-10\">(2) When no circuit court action has been filed. If a lien is asserted pursuant to this Rule and a related action has not been filed in a circuit court of this State, the attorney, the attorney\u2019s client, or any person who has received a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>notice pursuant to section (b) of this Rule may file a complaint with a circuit court to adjudicate the rights of the parties in relation to the lien, including the attorney\u2019s entitlement to a lien, any dispute as to the papers subject to a lien under section (a) of this Rule, and the amount of the attorney\u2019s claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Fee Agreement And Waiver Of Lien</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The circuit court held that, under the terms of the Retainer Agreement, Sommer was not entitled to assert a statutory lien against the judgment Rhoads obtained in the second trial. In successfully arguing for that result, Rhoads relied on the provision in the Retainer Agreement stating that Sommer is \u201centitled to payment of all fees and costs owed upon client\u2019s receipt of the proceeds of a judgment ... upon the conclusion of any action brought by the attorney upon client\u2019s behalf.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Rhoads interpreted \u201cthe conclusion of the action brought by the attorney on the client\u2019s behalf\u2019 to refer to judgment entered in favor of the FDIC after the first trial. Under the terms of the Retainer Agreement, Rhoads asserted, the balance due on the guaranteed fees was not \u201cimmediately due and payable\u201d as it would have been if Rhoads had prevailed, but rather was due and payable only in $500 monthly installments.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Sommer countered that the meaning of the phrase \u201cupon the conclusion of any action brought by the attorney\u201d does not refer to the judgment in the first trial, but to the final conclusion of the entire lawsuit brought by Sommer on Rhoads\u2019s behalf, which is the $120,000 judgment in favor of Rhoads.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">The circuit court agreed with Rhoads\u2019s construction of the Agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-9\">[T]he Court finds that the phrase was reasonably understood by the parties to be limited to the initial trial conducted by Sommer. [Rhoads] ... points to numerous exhibits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>which clearly evidence that Sommer interpreted the agreement as being limited to the initial trial....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\">Since the Agreement covered representation through the initial trial only, then the test of whether the outcome was favorable or not is measured as of the conclusion of that proceeding. Here it was unfavorable. Judgment was entered for the employer. Therefore, Ms. Rhoads\u2019 only obligation under the Agreement was to pay the guaranteed fee at the rate of $500 per month. This has particular relevance for the issue of whether the attorney\u2019s lien survived the bankruptcy____[Generally an attorney\u2019s lien is perfected upon the commencement of the representation. Therefore, such [perfected] liens typically would not be extinguished in bankruptcy. Here, however, a plain reading of the fee agreement leads inevitably to the conclusion that [Sommer] has waived his right to assert such a lien in the event that a judgment in favor of the employer resulted from the initial trial. ... To grant the attorney a lien would be inconsistent with [Rhoads\u2019s] limited [payment] obligation. Accordingly, [Sommer] waived his right to assert any attorney lien if judgment was entered in the employer\u2019s favor at the conclusion of the initial trial. For that reason, any obligation owed under this agreement following the initial trial was an unsecured personal obligation of [Rhoads] and was discharged in bankruptcy. Therefore, [Rhoads] is entitled to judgment on [Sommer\u2019s] claim. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">We disagree with the motion court\u2019s conclusion that the Agreement reasonably can be interpreted to mean that Sommer waived his right to assert a lien if Rhoads lost at the first trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Rhoads has pointed to no language in the Agreement that says or implies this, and we have found none. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>circuit court apparently relied on the clause in paragraph 2 of the Agreement calling for a $500 per month payment schedule, which applied only if there were no judgment or settlement in Rhoads\u2019s favor. The circuit court reasoned that a monthly payment schedule was inconsistent with the notion that the payment would be secured by any judgment, and from this inconsistency, inferred a waiver. We conclude this was error because there is no inconsistency between payment by installments over a period of time and holding security for those payments, <em>ie., </em>a lien against the cause of action. There is nothing in BOP section 10-501 or Rule 2-652 requiring that the proceeds of a cause of action subject to the lien must be immediately paid to the attorney holding the lien. Both subsections (1) and (2) of Rule 2-652(c) simply direct that \u201cthe court shall adjudicate the rights of the parties in relation to the lien[.]\u201d The circuit court could easily direct, for example, that the appropriate part of the amount owed under the judgment or settlement be paid into court or an escrow account, and held as security or paid to the attorney in monthly increments.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Effect Of Bankruptcy Discharge</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Rhoads argues we should affirm because she was discharged in bankruptcy before the attorney\u2019s lien attached, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>and therefore she had no indebtedness to Sommer. She reasons that Sommer cannot have acquired a lien because BOP section 10-501 authorizes a lien only to the extent the client \u201cowes ... compensation for services.\u201d Rhoads insists that \u201c[i]t is textbook bankruptcy law that the automatic stay and subsequent discharge injunction bar efforts to collect prepetition debts,\u201d citing <em>In re McNickle, </em>274 B.R. 477, 480 (Bankr.S.D.Ohio 2002)(\u201cthe majority rule, that strictly adheres to the Bankruptcy Code, holds that pre-petition legal services are subject to the discharge, and subsequent collection efforts violate the automatic stay and the discharge injunction\u201d). <em>McNickle, </em>however, did not involve a claim for an attorney\u2019s lien, and there was no judgment or settlement the attorney claimed was produced by his services. The attorney simply sought compensation for legal work performed for the debtor in connection with the bankruptcy before the bankruptcy filing, and therefore he had the status of an ordinary unsecured creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">A claimant under an attorney\u2019s lien statute stands in a different position. As the circuit court recognized, generally, a lien survives bankruptcy discharge because the discharge \u201cextinguishes only one mode of enforcing a claim\u2014namely, an action against the debtor <em>in </em>personam\u2014while leaving intact another-namely, an action against the debtor <em>in rem.\u201d Johnson v. Home State Bank, </em>501 U.S. 78, 84, 111 S.Ct. 2150, 2154, 115 L.Ed.2d 66 (1991).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Our Court of Appeals has adopted this general rule. <em>See Hernandez v. Suburban Hosp. Ass\u2019n, </em>319 Md. 226, 236-37, 572 A.2d 144 (1990)(\u201c \u2018We follow the majority of courts which hold that the Bankruptcy Code and its legislative history plainly establish the better rule of law-that valid liens that have not been disallowed or avoided survive the bankruptcy discharge of the underlying debt\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted). Although the effect of bankruptcy discharge on an attorney\u2019s right to a lien under BOP section 10-501 is a matter of first impression in this state, cases involving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>attorney\u2019s Kens in other jurisdictions have held that comparable attorney charging Kens survived the bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Many courts interpreting attorney\u2019s Kens have agreed that, although the Ken does not attach until after the bankruptcy, once it does attach, it relates back and takes effect from the commencement of the attorney\u2019s services or the action. <em>See Hanna Paint Mfg. Co. v.

Generally, however, once the Ken attaches it relates back and is effective from the time the attorney begins his efforts on behalf of his cKent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWJ\"><em>Id. </em>at 233. Because of the relation back, the Ken is not affected by initiation of bankruptcy proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Thus, as <em>Sea Catch </em>instructs, the date of attachment of the Ken is not the material issue in determining whether an attorney\u2019s Ken will survive the cKent\u2019s bankruptcy. Rather, state law governing the effective date of the Ken will determine whether the Ken relates back to the commencement of the action (or the attorney\u2019s representation). <em>See, e.g., Albert, </em>206 B.R. at 640 (state law determines whether pre-bankruptcy Ken, once perfected, takes priority over interests which were perfected before the Ken).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Rhoads does not agree that Sommer\u2019s Ken relates back to a date preceding her bankruptcy. Relying on <em>Hoffman &amp; Schreiber v. Medina, </em>224 B.R. 556 (D.N.J.1998), Rhoads argues that Sommer\u2019s Ken right could not survive her bankruptcy discharge because Sommer did not perfect his Ken before the bankruptcy petition, having failed to \u201cassert\u201d the Ken by serving the notice required by Md. Rule 2-652. In <em>Hoffman &amp; Schreiber, </em>as Rhoads contends, the court held that the law firm failed to commence an action to determine and enforce its Ken claim before the cKent filed her bankruptcy petition and therefore the claim was unperfected, unsecured, and discharged. <em>See id. </em>at 563.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>We disagree with Rhoads\u2019s contention that <em>Hoffman &amp; Schreiber </em>controls, because of how we construe BOP section 10-501. \u201c \u2018[T]he cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intention.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Green, </em>367 Md. 61, 81, 785 A.2d 1275 (2001) (citations omitted). When interpreting a statute, our starting point is the text of the statute. <em>See Adamson v. Corr. Med. Servs., Inc., </em>359 Md. 238, 251, 753 A.2d 501 (2000). \u201c[I]f the plain meaning of the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, and consistent with both the broad purposes of the legislation, and the specific purpose of the provision being interpreted, our inquiry is at an end.\u201d <em>Breitenbach v. N.B. Handy Co., </em>366 Md. 467, 473, 784 A.2d 569 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">There is nothing in the Maryland statute or rules that suggests that an attorney\u2019s right to a lien is lost because the attorney does not take steps to enforce the lien before the client files bankruptcy. Rather, BOP section 10-501 explicitly provides that the attorney \u201chas a lien ... from the time the cause of action arises or the proceeding begins,\u201d without any notice requirements. Additionally, Md. Rule 2-652, titled \u201cEnforcement of Attorney\u2019s Liens,\u201d says nothing to suggest that the BOP section 10-501 lien right is lost if the notice required by Rule 2-652(b) is not sent before a bankruptcy filing. Rather, this rule talks only about how to \u201cassert\u201d the lien. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-652(b)(\u201cAn attorney who has a lien under Code, Business and Professions Article, \u00a7 10-501, may assert the lien by serving a written notice by certified mail or personal deliver upon the client and upon each person against whom the hen is to be enforeed\u201d)(emphasis added). The rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>says nothing about perfection of the lien or losing the lien for failing to serve the written notice within a particular time.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Our reading of the statute is also consistent with the purpose of section 10-501 and like statutes, which is \u201c \u2018to protect the rights of an attorney unable to get possession against a client who seeks to avoid payment for services.\u2019 \u201d <em>Vangrack, Axelson &amp; Williamowsky, P.C. v. Est. of Abbasi, </em>261 F.Supp.2d 352, 363 (D.Md.2003)(applying Maryland lawXquoting 2 Robert L. Rossi, <em>Attorney\u2019s Fees </em>\u00a7 12:13, at 12-23 &amp; n. 10 (3d ed.2001)). <em>See also Sea Catch, </em>36 B.R. at 234 (The object of attorney lien statutes is \u201cto furnish security to attorneys for their efforts by giving them a lien upon the subject of the action\u201d). In keeping with this purpose, and given the clear language of the statute, we think that in a contest between the attorney and the trustee, general creditors, or the bankrupt client herself, the requirement that notice be given in order to assert the lien is a condition for <em>enforcement </em>of the lien, but not for <em>continuation </em>of the <em>right </em>to a lien. In other words, failing to comply with the notice requirement does not interfere with the attorney\u2019s lien priority over general creditors of the client, including a trustee in bankruptcy, or cause the attorney to lose the Ken in a dispute with the client herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">In construing and applying the notice requirement in Rule 2-652, we find helpful the reasoning of the <em>Sea Catch </em>bankruptcy court, which discussed the notice provision in the Alaska attorney\u2019s lien statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-7\">[A] special agreement for compensation .... would have related back to be effective against not only an assignee (who takes subject to the contractual obligations of his assignor), but also against any third party who claims a right to the fund in question. The notice provision is for the purpose of protecting a judgment or potential judgment debtor, not a third party creditor. It would be inequitable to give a third party creditor (or a trustee representing such creditors) a prior right over the value of the pre-petition services which contributed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>creation of the fund, especially in a case such as the instant one where the fund in question was awarded as compensation for the attorney\u2019s services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-5\"><em>Sea Catch, </em>36 B.R. at 234 (footnote omitted; emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">We think that the Court of Appeals, in adopting the requirement of Rule 2-652(b) that the attorney send notice to \u201ceach person against whom the lien is to be enforced,\u201d intended, <em>inter alia, </em>to protect the judgment debtor from innocently paying all the money to satisfy the judgment (that the attorney helped produce), to the client or his assignee.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Given this purpose, the failure to send notice to Rhoads\u2019s employer would not justify giving Rhoads\u2019s general creditors or her trustee in bankruptcy priority ahead of Sommer. Moreover, there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>showing that Rhoads\u2019s employer actually paid out the judgment to the client or someone else, in ignorance of Sommer\u2019s lien.-</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">A second purpose of the notice requirement in Rule 2-652 is to satisfy the due process concerns recognized in <em>Barry Props., Inc. v. Fick Bros. Roofing Co., </em>277 Md. 15, 353 A.2d 222 (1976), by guaranteeing that the <em>client </em>knows of the attorney\u2019s intent to enforce the lien before the attorney is able to transfer a <em>possessory </em>interest to himself as a part of his enforcement action. <em>See </em>Mar. 10, 1995 Minutes of Court of Appeals Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure (\u201cSection (b) has a constitutional requirement of notice by certified mail or personal delivery which is similar to the notice required in mechanics\u2019 liens\u201d). As we discuss in Section III, <em>infra, </em>Rhoads suffered no impairment of her due process rights from Sommer\u2019s failure to give notice of his lien before she filed bankruptcy, because any loss or injury she suffered from the existence of the lien before she received notice was not sufficiently severe or grievous to violate such rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Sommer\u2019s Failure To File Claim In Bankruptcy</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Rhoads also insists that Sommer cannot now claim an attorney\u2019s lien because he failed to file any claim for such lien in Rhoads\u2019s bankruptcy. Sommer, however, correctly points out that the trustee in Rhoads\u2019s bankruptcy abandoned the cause of action, and thus never initiated an adversary proceeding to avoid the lien pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 545(2).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Sommer is also right that, as a result of this abandonment, he was not required to file any proof of claim in the bankruptcy estate. <em>See In Re Marriage of Berkland, </em>762 P.2d 779, 783 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>(Colo.Ct.App.1988). \u201cThe effect of abandonment by a trustee is to divest the bankruptcy estate of control over the abandoned property and revest title in the debtor. In doing so, the property becomes part of the debtor\u2019s non-bankruptcy estate, just as if no bankruptcy occurred.\u201d <em>In re Moody, </em>277 B.R. 858, 861 (Bankr.S.D.Ga.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">\n<em>In Personam v. In Rem</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Pursuing a different line of attack, Rhoads contends that Sommer\u2019s attorney\u2019s lien rights are conditioned on the viability, after bankruptcy, of his <em>in personam, </em>cause of action against Rhoads. We do not agree. An attorney\u2019s lien under B.O.P section 10\u2014501(b) is an action <em>in rem. </em>Although section 10\u2014501(b) recognizes the lien only to the extent that, \u201cunder a specific agreement between an attorney at law and a client, the client owes the attorney at law a fee or other compensation for legal services that produced the settlement, judgment, or award[,]\u201d this requirement does not change the <em>in rem </em>nature of the claim. There is nothing in the language of section 10-501 to suggest that a lien, which was to be effective \u201cfrom the time the cause of action arises or the proceeding begins,\u201d is intended by the legislature to be invalid if the client filed for bankruptcy before the attorney sought to enforce the lien. To hold otherwise would undermine the remedial purpose of the statutory attorney\u2019s lien, which is to protect the attorney who helped produce a judgment against the client\u2019s attempts to avoid payment. <em>See Vangrack, Axelson &amp; Williamowsky, </em>261 F.Supp.2d at 363. <em>See also Reinhardt, </em>81 B.R. at 568-69 (\u201c \u2018[Attorney lien statutes are to be regarded as remedial and should be liberally construed in aid of the object sought by the legislature, which is to furnish security for attorneys for their efforts by giving them a lien upon the subject of the action\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Falconer v. Adams, </em>20 P.3d 583, 586 n. 21 (Alaska 2001)(same).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Legislative History Of BOP Section 10-501 Regarding Priority Of Lien</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">\u201c[C]ourts may consider the context in which a statute appears, including related statutes and legislative history,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number><em>Ridge Heating, Air Conditioning &amp; Plumbing, Inc. v. Brennen, 3</em>66 Md. 336, 350-51, 783 A.2d 691 (2001), and we have done so here. The purpose statement of the Senate bill proposing what is now BOP section 10-501 says:<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzN\">For the purpose of providing that an attorney has a lien on certain actions of the attorney\u2019s client; providing that an attorney\u2019s lien extends to attorney\u2019s fees and compensation specially agreed on or to the reasonable value of the attorney\u2019s -services under certain circumstances; providing for the priority of an attorney\u2019s lien, <em>with exceptions; </em>and generally providing for an attorney\u2019s lien on certain actions of the attorney\u2019s client and on certain judgments entered in favor of the attorney\u2019s client.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-5\"><em>See </em>Senate Bill No.1985-36. The exceptions contained in the bill were those in the current statute: \u201c(1) A prior lien based on salaries or wages due to employees for work which is related to or a part of the award, order, decree or judgment; or (2) A lien against the client for state taxes due.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">This legislative history suggests that the General Assembly intended that other creditors would <em>not </em>be able to obtain priority over the attorney\u2019s charging lien, except those falling within the specified exceptions. To interpret the statute to mean that an attorney\u2019s lien rights were lost simply because the client filed bankruptcy before the attorney gave the requisite notice to the client under Rule 2-652 would be contrary to the legislative intent that the lien have priority over all but specified creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">In sum, under BOP section 10-501, which accords an attorney \u201ca lien on ... an action or proceeding of a client of the attorney at law from the time the action or proceeding begins,\u201d Sommer had a lien or a right to a lien<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> on Rhoads\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>cause of action, which, subject to a later determination of whether Sommers \u201cproduced the judgment,\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> BOP section 10\u2014501(b), was effective from the \u201ctime the cause of action [arose] or the proceeding beg[an]\u201d against other creditors except those named in subsection (b) of section 10-501.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\"><em>Barry Properties </em>And Procedural Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">As part of her response to Sommer\u2019s lien survival theory, Rhoads argues that \u201cwere section 10-501 given the construction and effect Appellants need to prevail ..., it would be manifestly unconstitutional.\u201d Relying on <em>Barry Props., Inc. v. Fick Bros. Roofing Co., </em>277 Md. 15, 33, 353 A.2d 222 (1976), she asserts that in Maryland, \u201ca statute cannot create a lien \u2018without notice and opportunity for a prior hearing,\u2019 for a statute that authorizes a lien without these safeguards \u2018deprives the owner of his property without procedural due process.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">In <em>Barry Properties, </em>our Court of Appeals declared the mechanic\u2019s lien statute to be unconstitutional in its then existing form, because it allowed prejudgment seizures of a debtor\u2019s property \u201cwithout notice or a prior hearing or other safeguards[.]\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 33-34, 353 A.2d 222. Rhoads argues that BOP section 10-501 is similarly flawed, and that despite the language saying that an attorney \u201chas a lien ... from the time the cause of action arises or the proceeding begins,\u201d no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>lien could constitutionally exist at the time Rhoads filed bankruptcy. Because the lien could not exist at the time Rhoads filed for bankruptcy, Rhoads argues, it cannot be a lien entitled to survive bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Sommer counters that Rhoads suffered no impairment of a substantial interest in property, a necessary ingredient for a violation of due process claim under the principles explained in <em>Barry Properties. </em>We agree with Sommer that the difference between the harm suffered by Barry Properties materially differs from that allegedly suffered by Rhoads.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">In <em>Barry Properties,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\">\u201cFick\u2019s lien kept Barry from being paid the balance of its construction mortgage (the construction lender withheld payment pending resolution of this and other mechanics\u2019 lien claims) and prevented Barry from either closing a permanent mortgage or obtaining a second mortgage on the property\u2019s equity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 227. These consequences all occurred before there had been any judicial review of the lien petitioner\u2019s claim. \u201c[T]o invoke the protections of procedural due process in a property context, the party asserting unconstitutionality must show that (1) State action has been employed (2) to deprive that party of a substantial interest in property.\u201d <em>Golden Sands Club Cond., Inc. v. Waller, </em>313 Md. 484, 488 n. 4, 545 A.2d 1332 (1988)(emphasis added). In some contexts, whether an interest is \u201csubstantial\u201d has turned on a determination of whether it is a possessory interest. <em>See Lucky Ned Pepper\u2019s Ltd. v.

In <em>Mitchell </em>the Court addressed the constitutionality of a Louisiana statute which provided for the sequestration of personal property, pending the outcome of a suit for accrued payments on the property. Under the statute, a seller, who had a vendor\u2019s lien on the goods sold, would request a writ for sequestration of the goods and submit an affidavit setting forth specific facts giving rise to the claim, its nature and the amount thereof. A judge would then issue the writ if a clear showing had been made and the \u201ccreditors seeking the writ ha[d] filed a sufficient bond to protect the [debtor] against all damages in the event the sequestration is shown to have been improvident.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 606, 94 S.Ct. at 1899 (footnotes omitted). Although the Louisiana statute provided no pre-sequestration hearing, the statute did entitle the debtor \u201cimmediately to seek dissolution of the writ, which must be ordered unless the creditor \u2018proves the grounds upon which the writ was issued,\u2019 the existence of the debt, lien, and delinquency, failing which the court may order return of the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>and assess damages in favor of the debtor, including attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 287-38, 494 A.2d 947 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">We explained that the Supreme Court considered a hearing on the merits of the dispute either before the sequestration or shortly after, to be imperative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">The Court held this statute constitutional. In so doing the Court observed that the statute was aimed at protecting the dual interests of the creditor and the debtor in the property to be seized. It noted that \u201c[t]he danger of destruction cannot be guarded against if notice and a hearing before seizure are supplied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 609, 94 S.Ct. at 1901. Nonetheless, ... \u201cthe debtor may immediately have a full hearing on the matter of possession following the execution of the writ, thus cutting to a bare minimum the time of creditor-or-court-supervised possession.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">This final provision was significant in upholding the constitutionality of the Louisiana statute. For example, in <em>Fuentes v. Shevin, </em>407 U.S. 67, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 32 L.Ed.2d 556 (1972) the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional prejudgment replevin statutes of Florida and Pennsylvania. The statutes provided for the seizure upon the issuance of a writ. The writ was issued by a court clerk upon the application of anyone asserting an interest in the property to be replevied and the posting of a bond. Neither statute provided for notice or a hearing prior to or shortly after the seizure. Similarly, in <em>Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp., </em>395 U.S. 337, 89 S.Ct. 1820, 23 L.Ed.2d 349 (1969) the Court struck down, as unconstitutional, a Wisconsin statute which permitted the prejudgment garnishment of wages. The statute allowed a creditor to freeze the wages of an alleged debtor without any form of notice or hearing prior to the garnishment. The statute was also unclear as to whether the alleged debtor had any immediate remedy by virtue of a post-garnishment hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 237-38, 494 A.2d 947 (emphasis added). We glean from <em>Mitchell </em>and the other Supreme Court cases discussed above, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>that the dual interests of the creditor and the debtor should be considered, but where the debtor is deprived of a possessory interest, there must be an opportunity for a hearing, either before or <em>immediately </em>after the seizure of the personalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">In <em>Lucky Ned Pepper\u2019s, </em>we concluded that the rent escrow requirement was constitutional because the tenant had a sufficient right to a hearing before he risked loss of possession of the tenancy or his money, but not earlier:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\">[B]eeause some sort of hearing is necessary, the statute, to the extent that it provides for the escrowing of accruing rents, must provide at least the opportunity for a hearing in order to be constitutionally acceptable. We believe that it does. Eliminating the unconstitutional portions, subsection (a) of the statute provides for a district court order requiring the payment of future (accruing) rents into escrow. The statute\u2019s only sanction for a tenant\u2019s failure to make the escrow payment appears in subsection (c) and must be invoked by a landlord who moves for judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">It is apparent that subsection (c) does not expressly provide for a hearing. We believe, however, that this subsection when read in connection with Maryland Rule 2-311(f), which prohibits \u201ca decision dispositive of a claim or defense without a hearing\u201d, provides a tenant with a sufficient opportunity for a hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-7\">If a tenant disputes the district court\u2019s escrow order, the tenant may elect not to comply with it. There is no automatic, self-executing sanction for such noncompliance; the tenant becomes directly at risk only when the landlord moves for judgment. Upon such a motion, however, the tenant may request a hearing in order to dispute the validity or terms of the district court\u2019s escrow order or raise any other defense to his alleged noncompliance. At that hearing the landlord must show that the escrow order is valid and that the tenant, without legal justification, has failed to comply with it. If the landlord fails to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>such a showing the circuit court must deny the motion for judgment and hold the case for trial by jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 288-39, 494 A.2d 947 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Thus, in <em>Lucky Ned Pepper\u2019s, </em>we evaluated the tenant\u2019s procedural due process claim by focusing on the tenant\u2019s actual risk of losing his money or his tenancy before a hearing was held, a concept that is also useful here. Sommer\u2019s attorney\u2019s lien (or right to a lien), which existed from \u201cthe time the cause of action [arose] or the proceeding beg[an],\u201d posed no actual risk to Rhoads because, if Rhoads disputed the lien, Sommer could do nothing to enforce the lien without a hearing. Also, public notice of Sommer\u2019s lien did not occur until after he gave notice to Rhoads and the judgment debtor pursuant to Md. Rule 2-652. When Rhoads raised a dispute about the lien in circuit court, the court was required to adjudicate the dispute before any money changed hands, a process that accorded Rhoads procedural due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">More recently, in <em>Roberts v. Total Health Care, Inc., </em>349 Md. 499, 514-17, 709 A.2d 142 (1998), the Court of Appeals considered <em>Barry Properties </em>and the Supreme Court cases it relied on in concluding that a child participating in a medical assistance program was not deprived of procedural due process by the statutory and equitable subrogation rights of the State to the proceeds of a tort settlement in a lead poisoning case.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Although the State\u2019s subrogation right addressed in <em>Roberts </em>was not a lien like an attorney\u2019s BOP \u00a7 10-501 lien,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>the children argued that \u201cthe statutory obligation to withhold funds constitutes a lien imposed without the opportunity for a prior hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 508, 709 A.2d 142. The court rejected this argument, providing a useful analysis of procedural due process in the establishment of liens, which distinguished the state\u2019s subrogation rights from the mechanic\u2019s lien statute found unconstitutional in <em>Barry Properties:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-5\">[T]he obligation to hold sufficient funds from the settlement proceeds to satisfy the Department\u2019s subrogation claim [does] not violate due process principles.... Under the mechanics\u2019 lien statute at issue in <em>Barry Properties, </em>\u201cthere [was] a \u2018subsisting lien\u2019 as soon as materials [were] supplied or work [was] performed, ... which constituted] a cloud on the property owner\u2019s title____[Thus,] he no longer [had] unfettered title [and] his equity [was] diminished to the extent of the lien.\u201d 277 Md. at 23-24, 353 A.2d 222. <em>See also Connecticut v. Doehr, </em>501 U.S. 1, 11, 111 S.Ct. 2105, 2113, 115 L.Ed.2d 1 (1991) (prejudgment attachment of real property \u201cclouds title; impairs the ability to sell or otherwise alienate the property; taints any credit rating; reduces the chance of obtaining a home equity loan or additional mortgage; and can even place an existing mortgage in technical default where there is an insecurity clause\u201d); <em>North Georgia Finishing, Inc. v.

We glean from this discussion that the question of whether due process has been violated turns on the extent to which the lien actually interferes with the debtor\u2019s property rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The significance that governmental seizure of control plays in finding a procedure due process violation was highlighted, as the <em>Roberts </em>Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">In <em>United States v. James Daniel Good Real Property, supra, </em>510 U.S. 43, 114 S.Ct. 492, 126 L.Ed.2d 490, there was a due process challenge to pre-hearing government seizure of a residence subject to forfeiture under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881(a)(7) as property used to commit or facilitate the commission of a federal drug offense. The Supreme Court upheld the challenge, holding that the government could not seize the property without affording the owner prior notice and hearing. <em>United States v. James Daniel Good Real Property, supra, </em>510 U.S. at 62, 114 S.Ct. at 505. In so holding, however, the Supreme Court specifically endorsed various governmental means of preventing disposal of property prior to forfeiture judgment as less onerous alternatives to seizure, and indicated that no prior notice and hearing would be required by such action. One such action cited with approval by the Supreme Court was the filing of a notice of <em>lis pendens. </em>The Supreme Court stated that (510 U.S. at 58-59,114 S.Ct. at 503-504):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-8\">\u201cThe Government\u2019s legitimate interests at the inception of forfeiture proceedings are to ensure that the property not be sold, destroyed, or used for further illegal activity prior to the forfeiture judgment.\u201d These legitimate interests can be secured without seizing the subject property. \u201cSale of the property can be prevented by filing a notice of lis pendens ... There is no reason to take the additional step of asserting control over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>property without first affording notice and an adversary hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 515-16, 709 A.2d 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Roberts </em>considered the filing of a lien notice no more onerous than a <em>lis pendens </em>notice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">Subsequently, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit was presented with a due process challenge to a state procedure providing for the filing of a lien notice against property subject to civil forfeiture prior to judgment. <em>Aronson v. City of Akron, </em>116 F.3d 804 (6th Cir. 1997). Relying on <em>United States v. James Daniel Good Real Property, supra, </em>the Court of Appeals held that the filing of the lien notice did not violate due process principles even if filed without prior notice and hearing. This was so because <em>(Aronson v. City of Akron, supra, </em>116 F.3d at 811-812)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-8\">\u201c[t]he filing of a lien notice has the same practical effect as the filing of a <em>lis pendens </em>notice. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-9\">\u201cIn addition to impairing the owner\u2019s ability to sell his interest in the property, a <em>lis pendens </em>or corrupt activity lien may taint the owner\u2019s credit rating, may place an existing mortgage in technical default, may make it impossible to obtain a second mortgage, and may have other adverse consequences. But under <em>Good\u2019s </em>evaluation of the <em>Mathews </em>factors, as our court recognized in <em>129 South Main Street, </em>this \u2018would not trigger the notice and hearing requirement.\u2019 <em>129 South Main Street, </em>52 F.3d at 1421. The mere filing of an ordinary lien or <em>lis pen-dens </em>notice simply does not represent the sort of \u2018grievous <em>loss\u2019\u2014see Mathews, </em>424 U.S. at 333, 96 S.Ct. at 901-02-that necessitates prior notice and an opportunity to be heard.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 516-17, 709 A.2d 142 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">We conclude that an attorney\u2019s lien is no more onerous than a <em>lis pendens </em>notice. An attorney\u2019s lien under BOP section 10-501 (d) does not result in the sort of \u201cgrievous loss\u201d that necessitates an opportunity to be heard before it is effective in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>the sense that it will be considered. An attorney\u2019s lien will not typically affect the client\u2019s credit rating, or place the client in default under a loan. Indeed, a creditor or potential creditor of the client would reasonably expect that an attorney\u2019s fee would be payable from a litigation recovery, and knowledge of the lien would not render the client less creditworthy. Although, in some circumstances, a person might not be -willing to take assignment of the judgment <em>{e.g., </em>as collateral for a loan) without knowing the amount owed to the attorney, following the reasoning of <em>Roberts, </em>we do not see this as a \u201cgrievous loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">BOP section 10-501(d) spells out that \u201can attorney ... may bring an action for execution under the lien only in accordance with rules that the Court of Appeals adopts.\u201d Md. Rule 2-652(c) provides for a hearing if the client or interested third party contests the lien after notice is given by the attorney. Although the lien dates from the time the cause of action arises or the proceeding begins, and there is no provision in Rule 2-652 for a hearing until after the attorney gives notice, the Court of Appeals has established a procedure that adequately protects the procedural due process rights of the client. There is no opportunity for the attorney to seize or take possession of his or her portion of the judgment proceeds or settlement proceeds until after there has been an adjudication of any dispute relating to the existence or amount of the lien. Applying the principles discussed in <em>Roberts, </em>we conclude that the operation of BOP section 10-501 under these procedural rules does not violate Rhoads\u2019s procedural due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the summary judgment entered by the circuit court and remand to that court for resolution of the remaining issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">JUDGMENT VACATED AND CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.

Nor do we agree with Rhoads that Sommer\u2019s claim is a quasi-contract claim that would not meet the BOP section 10\u2014501(b) requirement that there must be a \"specific fee agreement.\u201d If Sommer were asserting the 30 percent contingency fee called for in the Agreement, then his claim might be based on quantum meruit because he did not complete the work necessary to obtain the full fee. <em>See Somuah v. Flachs, </em>352 Md. 241, 258, 721 A.2d 680 (1998)(In a contingency fee context, \u201cwhere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>a client terminates an attorney-client relationship without any cause, or an attorney terminates the relationship with cause, the attorney may be entitled to <em>immediate quantum meruit recovery </em>from the client, <em>i.e., </em>the reasonable value of the legal services rendered prior to the attorney's discharge\u201d).
