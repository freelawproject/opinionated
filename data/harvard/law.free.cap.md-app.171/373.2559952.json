We shall hold that the trial court can make such a fee award and that the court properly exercised its discretion to do so in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">George Kenneth Ridgeway, appellant, appeals from an order of the Circuit Court for Calvert County reducing, but not terminating, the indefinite alimony he pays to his former wife, Nancy G. Ridgeway, appellee. Nine months after the parties were divorced and appellant was ordered to pay alimony to appellee, and in anticipation of his upcoming retirement, appellant filed a petition for modification or termination of alimony (\u201cpetition for modification\u201d). Fifteen months after the divorce, appellant voluntarily retired from employment, and the parties began receiving retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">The circuit court subsequently granted the petition for modification and reduced, but did not terminate, appellant\u2019s monthly alimony obligation. The court also awarded attorney\u2019s fees to appellee. Appellant appealed, and appellee sought attorney\u2019s fees to defend the case on appeal. The circuit court granted appellee\u2019s petition for advanced appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>attorney\u2019s fees, and appellant appealed from that order as well. We consolidated the two appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Appellant presents three questions for our review, which we have reworded slightly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">1. Given the change in the parties\u2019 respective economic circumstances, did the court err or abuse its discretion in refusing to terminate alimony, considering in particular that appellee\u2019s total income is greater than appellant\u2019s total income?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">2. Did the court err or abuse its discretion in awarding appellee attorney\u2019s fees as part of its ruling on appellant\u2019s petition to modify or terminate alimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-8\">3. Did the court have jurisdiction to consider appellee\u2019s post-appeal motion for advanced attorney\u2019s fees relating to the instant appeal, and if so, did the court err or abuse its discretion in awarding appellant $3,700.00 in advanced appellate attorney\u2019s fees?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">We affirm the judgments of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">The parties divorced on June 18, 2003. In the judgment of absolute divorce, the court ordered, <em>inter alia, </em>that appellant pay indefinite alimony to appellee in the amount of $1,750.00 per month, and that appellee is entitled to a \u201cpro-rata share\u201d of appellant\u2019s retirement benefits. The court cautioned appellant in its oral ruling at the divorce hearing that alimony would not necessarily be adjusted upon his retirement. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-12\">[Appellant] has talked about retirement. That will be a decision he will have to make. The only thing I would caution him is that there is not necessarily an assurance that any award would be adjusted based on retirement. Obviously that retirement would create income for [appellee], but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean there would be a dollar for dollar adjustment. I\u2019m not saying there wouldn\u2019t be. I am just saying you can\u2019t assume that there would be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>On March 12, 2004, appellant filed the petition for modification in anticipation of his upcoming retirement. Appellant stated in the petition that he expected both parties to begin receiving retirement benefits upon his retirement. He asked the court to terminate his obligation to pay alimony once appellee began receiving her pro-rata share of the retirement benefits. He also requested an award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Appellee filed a motion to dismiss the petition for modification, arguing that appellant\u2019s request was \u201cpatently premature\u201d because appellant was not yet retired when he filed the petition. The court denied the motion and set the matter in for a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Meanwhile, in September 2004, appellant retired from his job as a facilities manager at the Washington Navy Yard. Appellant was 55 years old. At the time of his retirement, he earned an annual salary of $84,127.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">On January 28, 2005, appellee filed a petition for contempt and show cause order (\u201cpetition for contempt\u201d), requesting the court to find appellant in contempt because he had failed to make alimony payments for December 2004 and January 2005. Appellee sought attorney\u2019s fees incurred in the filing of the petition for contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">On March 11, 2005, the court held a hearing on appellant\u2019s petition for modification and appellee\u2019s petition for contempt. Appellant testified that the parties decided during the marriage that he would retire at age 55 because the males in his family die at approximately age 70. He currently receives a net retirement payment of $1,662.00 per month, and in 2004, he received approximately $100.00 per month in interest income as well. Appellant acknowledged that he has not made an alimony payment to appellee since November 2004, explaining that she began to receive retirement benefits in December 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">Appellant testified further that, upon his retirement in September 2004, he received a payment of $23,634.33 from his employer. That payment represented a $25,000.00 incentive for retiring plus compensation for accumulated annual leave, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>minus taxes. Appellant did not notify appellee of the payment or share any portion of it with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Appellant received approximately $110,000.00 in proceeds from the sale of the parties\u2019 marital home. At the time of the hearing, he had approximately $90,000.00 in his bank accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Appellant testified that he presently resides with his fiancee in her home in Willards, Maryland. He pays her $200.00 each month toward the mortgage and half the costs of operating the home. He also has a monthly car payment of approximately $662.00 per month. From March through October, he works about three days per week at a golf course near his current residence. He earns a low wage, but he is able to golf at the course for free. Appellant stated that he has a number of medical problems, including asthma, high blood pressure, and carpal tunnel syndrome in both hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Appellee, in turn, testified that she works in the Calvert County school system as an assistant manager of a cafeteria in an elementary school. She earns approximately $17,084.00 a year. She purchased a new home in Prince Frederick, Maryland, in September 2003, shortly after selling the house that she lived in with appellant. Appellee\u2019s monthly mortgage payment is $1,285.00 and her monthly car payment is $403.00. She has approximately $30,000.00 in a savings account. She can retire from her current position in 2008 and earn a monthly retirement allowance of $163.00. If she remains employed until 2014, however, she will receive $393.00 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Appellee testified further that, in December 2004, she received about $3,200.00 from appellant\u2019s retirement fund. Since then, she has received a monthly retirement benefit of approximately $1,239.00. The cost of a former spouse survivor annuity, $238.00, is subtracted from her portion of the retirement benefit. Appellee stated that she has a number of medical problems, including arthritis, Grave\u2019s disease, and psoriasis. Appellee incurred approximately $5,800.00 in attorney\u2019s fees for services rendered in defending the petition for modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Appellant argued in closing that alimony should be terminated because his monthly income is less than appellee\u2019s. He further argued that he should not be found in contempt because, the lack of the requisite show cause order aside, he withheld the alimony payments only after appellee began receiving her share of his pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">Appellee acknowledged that appellant\u2019s retirement from full-time employment qualified as a change in circumstance. Evidently alluding to her house purchase, appellee argued that she had reasonably anticipated receiving, under the court\u2019s order, both an indefinite alimony award of $1,750.00 and her share of appellant\u2019s retirement, and that the equities dictated that the original award not be modified. Appellee further argued that appellant should be considered to be in contempt, \u201cshow cause order or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The court noted that it could not find appellant in contempt because a show cause order had not been issued. The court held <em>sub curia </em>the petition for modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">On April 6, 2005, the court issued an order reducing appellee\u2019s monthly alimony obligation from $1,750.00 to $500.00. The court stated that it \u201cis satisfied that some modification is necessary and that [appellant] is entitled to a reduction of his monthly alimony payment, but that some alimony continues to be due.\u201d The court dismissed the petition for contempt, denied appellant\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees, and granted appellee\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $2,500.00. Appellant noted a timely appeal from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">On May 10, 2005, appellee filed a petition for appellate attorney\u2019s fees to enable her to prepare a response to appellant\u2019s appeal to this Court. In the petition, appellee argued that Maryland Code (1984, 2004 RepLVol.), \u00a7 11-110 of the Family Law Article (\u201cFL\u201d) permits the court to award attorney\u2019s fees \u201c \u2018at any point in a proceeding^]\u2019 \u201d which includes anticipated fees and costs incurred in defending an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">Ten days later, appellee filed another petition for contempt and show cause order, arguing that appellant failed to pay her $500.00 in alimony on May 1, 2005, as required by the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>April 6, 2005 order. Appellee further alleged that appellant failed to comply with the court\u2019s order that he pay within 30 days the $2,500.00 in counsel fees that she incurred in defending the petition for modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Appellant did not answer appellee\u2019s petition for contempt, and, on July 15, 2005, the court granted the petition and entered an order of default. The court ordered appellant to pay $4,000.00 to appellee, representing past due alimony and the attorney\u2019s fees that the court had awarded appellee in connection with the petition for modification. The court granted appellee\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees related to the contempt petition and ordered appellant to pay an additional $1,303.75 in attorney\u2019s fees associated with appellee\u2019s prosecution of that petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">On August 1, 2005, appellant filed a motion to set aside the court\u2019s order of default. In the motion, appellant claimed that he did not file a response to appellee\u2019s contempt petition because he believed that, upon noting his appeal in this Court, the circuit court was divested of jurisdiction. Five weeks later, appellant filed a supplemental memorandum in support of his response to appellee\u2019s petition, again arguing that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to take action in the case once the appeal was noted. Appellant further argued that an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs before the fees and costs were actually incurred would be unprecedented and that FL \u00a7 11-110 does not permit an award of appellate attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">On December 21, 2005, the court conducted a hearing on appellee\u2019s petition for advanced appellate attorney\u2019s fees. At the hearing, appellee testified that she had not yet signed an attorney retainer agreement for the case on appeal because she could not afford to pay an attorney. Appellee argued that she was a privileged suitor entitled to an advanced award of attorney\u2019s fees. She offered, and the court accepted, Mr. John Erly, a Maryland attorney, as an expert in the area of appellate attorney\u2019s fees. Mr. Erly testified that, for appellate work, he generally charges a retainer of $5,000.00. He fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>ther testified that, in his experience, the total cost of bringing an appeal to the Court of Appeals or the Court of Special Appeals typically ranges from $5,000.00 to $10,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Appellant responded that, because an appeal in the case was pending before this Court, the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to award attorney\u2019s fees to appellee. He argued in the alternative that appellee is not entitled to advanced appellate attorney\u2019s fees because she is not a \u201cprivileged suitor,\u201d she failed to demonstrate the need for an award of fees, and such an award would be speculative, in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">The court determined that it had jurisdiction to grant an advanced award of appellate attorney\u2019s fees, and the court ordered appellant to pay $3,700.00 in attorney\u2019s fees to appellee pending the appeal in this case. Appellant noted a timely appeal from that order, and we consolidated the appeal with the earlier appeal from the court\u2019s judgment modifying alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">Appellant first contends that the court erred in denying his petition to terminate indefinite alimony. He claims that, because appellee\u2019s monthly income exceeds his monthly income, the relative economic positions of the parties necessitate the termination of alimony. He further claims, as he did before the circuit court, that \u201cthe retirement payment replaces the alimony payment, warranting termination of alimony.\u201d Appellee responds that the court properly analyzed the financial circumstances of the parties and exercised proper discretion by reducing the alimony award from $1,750.00 per month to $500.00 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">\u201c[I]n reviewing an award of alimony we \u2018defer[ ] to the findings and judgments of the trial court[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Simonds v. Simonds, </em>165 Md.App. 591, 606 n. 4, 886 A.2d 158 (2005) (quoting <em>Brewer v. Brewer, </em>156 Md.App. 77, 98, 846 A.2d 1 (2004)). We will not disturb an alimony determination \u201cunless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>the trial court\u2019s judgment is clearly wrong or an arbitrary use of discretion.\u201d <em>Blaine v. Blaine, </em>97 Md.App. 689, 698, 632 A.2d 191 (1993), <em>aff'd, </em>336 Md. 49, 646 A.2d 413 (1994). Furthermore, \u201c[t]he doctrine of res judicata applies in the modification of alimony ... and the [appellate] court may not re-litigate matters that were or should have been considered at the time of the initial award.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 702, 632 A.2d 191 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">FL \u00a7\u00a7 11-101 to 11-112 govern the award of alimony in Maryland. FL \u00a7 ll-107(b) addresses the modification of alimony awards and provides that, \u201c[s]ubject to \u00a7 8-103 of this article and on the petition of either party, the court may modify the amount of alimony awarded as circumstances and justice require.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cA party requesting modification of an alimony award must demonstrate through evidence presented to the trial court that the facts and circumstances of the case justify the court exercising its discretion to grant the requested modification.\u201d <em>Langston v. Langston, </em>366 Md. 490, 516, 784 A.2d 1086 (2001). Upon a proper petition, the court may modify a decree for alimony \u201cat any time if there has been shown a material change in circumstances that justify the action.\u201d <em>Lieberman v. Lieberman, </em>81 Md.App. 575, 595, 568 A.2d 1157 (1990) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">There is no dispute in the instant case that appellant\u2019s retirement constituted a material change in circumstance warranting the court\u2019s consideration of the petition for modification. Concerning appellant\u2019s request to terminate or reduce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>his alimony obligation, the court heard evidence of the following: At age 55, appellant earned almost $85,000 per year. He currently receives a retirement benefit each month, which, after taxes and appellee\u2019s pro-rata share, equals $1,662.00. He also earns $8.00 to $9.00 per hour working three days per week for six months per year at a golf course. He pays $200.00 toward his fiancee\u2019s mortgage each month and makes a monthly car payment of about $662.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Appellee continues to work eight hours per day, five days per week, albeit only nine months per year. She earns $657.08 every two weeks. She has a monthly mortgage payment of approximately $1,285.00 and a monthly car payment of $403.00. After the cost of the former spouse survivor annuity is subtracted from appellee\u2019s retirement benefit, she receives a monthly payment of $1239.00, which is $511.00 less than the $1,750.00 alimony payment that she received following the divorce. Appellee\u2019s expenses have not decreased in proportion to the decrease in her income; the retirement benefit, therefore, cannot serve as a complete substitute for the alimony payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The court determined that, although appellant was properly entitled to a reduction in the amount of his monthly alimony payments, \u201csome alimony continues to be due.\u201d Appellant has not persuaded us that the court\u2019s decision to reduce but not terminate alimony was an arbitrary exercise of discretion. We therefore affirm that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">Appellant next contends that the court erred in awarding attorney\u2019s fees to appellee in defending against the petition for modification. He argues that the circumstances of this case did not warrant a fee award. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">FL \u00a7 11-110 governs the award of attorney\u2019s fees and related expenses in alimony proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Subsection (c) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>authorizes the court to award either party in an action for alimony reasonable and necessary counsel fees after considering the financial resources and financial needs of both parties and whether there was substantial justification for prosecuting or defending the proceedings. <em>See Lemley v. Lemley, </em>109 Md.App. 620, 632, 675 A.2d 596 (1996). In awarding attorney\u2019s fees, the court should consider and articulate the parties\u2019 resources and needs. <em>See Blake v. Blake, </em>81 Md.App. 712, 730, 569 A.2d 724 (1990). Although the court\u2019s decision to award attorney\u2019s fees is subject to appellate review, this Court \u201cwill not disturb the award unless that discretion was exercised arbitrarily or the judgment was clearly wrong.\u201d <em>Bro</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number><em>seus v. Broseus, </em>82 Md.App. 183, 200, 570 A.2d 874 (1990); <em>accord Dave v. Steinmuller, </em>157 Md.App. 653, 675, 853 A.2d 826 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">In the instant case, the court heard testimony and received evidence regarding the financial resources and needs of the parties. In the opinion accompanying the order for attorney\u2019s fees, the court set forth detailed findings and noted that appellee \u201cwas forced to file her contempt petition because [appellant] had ceased making any alimony payments.\u201d The court then determined that, from the evidence adduced at the hearing, appellant was \u201cclearly ... in a position to contribute to [appellee\u2019s] attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d The court ordered appellant to pay appellee $2,500.00 in attorney\u2019s fees, which represented less than half of the fees she incurred in defending the petition. Under these circumstances, the court\u2019s decision that appellant should contribute a portion of appellee\u2019s counsel\u2019s fees was not an arbitrary exercise of judicial discretion or clearly wrong. We therefore affirm it.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Appellant next argues that the court erred in granting appellee\u2019s petition for advanced appellate attorney\u2019s fees. He contends that the court lacked jurisdiction to grant attorney\u2019s fees once the matter was the subject of an appeal. He further contends that appellee is not entitled to advanced attorney\u2019s fees in any event, because she cannot claim on appeal the status of a privileged suitor. And, he argues that the award itself is inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">Appellee responds that the only court with jurisdiction to make an award of counsel fees and costs is the trial court. She maintains that appellant ignores the appellate courts\u2019 \u201calready tailored case law in this area.\u201d Appellee has the better part of the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">We first address appellant\u2019s jurisdictional argument. Certainly, once an appeal is pending, the circuit court is prohibited from \u201cexercising its jurisdiction in a way that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>would affect the subject matter of the appeal.\u201d <em>See County Comm\u2019rs of Carroll County v. Carroll Craft Retail, Inc., </em>384 Md. 23, 45, 862 A.2d 404 (2004). The circuit court, however, may act upon a spouse\u2019s petition for attorneys fees in a divorce proceeding even after an appeal has been entered. <em>See Staley v. Staley, </em>25 Md.App. 99, 112, 113 n. 4, 335 A.2d 114 (noting that the trial court should act upon a wife\u2019s application to order her husband to pay her attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred during the prosecution of an appeal <em>\u201ceven after the appeal has been entered, </em>as such matters are within the jurisdiction of the trial court\u201d (emphasis supplied)), <em>cert, denied, </em>275 Md. 755 (1975). Appellant\u2019s appeal from the court\u2019s order reducing alimony did not divest the circuit court of jurisdiction to act upon appellee\u2019s petition for attorneys fees. The court retained the fundamental power to make the attorney\u2019s fees award, \u201ceven after the appeal ha[d] been entered.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">We have said repeatedly that the circuit court is in the best position to make determinations concerning an award of attorneys fees pursuant to FL \u00a7 11-110. <em>See Randolph v. Randolph, </em>67 Md.App. 577, 581, 508 A.2d 996 (1986) (declining to address appellee\u2019s petition for attorneys fees, which she filed in the appellate court, \u201cbecause there are various factors to be considered, including the financial status, resources, and needs of each of the parties ... with which the trial court is familiar\u201d); <em>Wallace v. Wallace, </em>46 Md.App. 213, 230, 416 A.2d 1317 (1980) (declining to award attorney\u2019s fees to appellee but remanding the issue to the circuit court for consideration of the request). Our cases also make clear that the trial court may award attorney\u2019s fees attendant to prosecuting the appeal from an award of alimony. In <em>Randolph, </em>for example, we stated our agreement with the contention that FL \u00a7\u00a7 11-110 and 12-103 contemplate an award of appellate attorneys fees when an appeal is taken from a decision resolving alimony and child custody issues. 67 Md.App. at 581, 508 A.2d 996; <em>see also Staley, </em>25 Md.App. at 113 n. 4, 335 A.2d 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Appellant contends that, even if a circuit court is permitted to award attorney\u2019s fees after an appeal has been filed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>appellee is not a \u201cprivileged suitor\u201d and therefore is not entitled to an award of appellate attorney\u2019s fees. The status of privileged suitor, appellant insists, is accorded only to the party who initiates a trial level proceeding or request for relief, and appeals when such relief was denied in whole or part by the trial court. Appellant points out that, in the instant case, appellee did not initiate the proceeding to modify or terminate alimony and she is not the party appealing from the result in that proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">We do not construe the concept of privileged suitor as narrowly as does appellant. Generally speaking, the award of attorney\u2019s fees enables a privileged suitor, <em>inter alia, </em>to \u201cinvestigate, and decide upon the merits of the case.\u201d <em>Guarino v. Guarino, </em>112 Md.App. 1, 9, 684 A.2d 23 (1996) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We have recognized that a party seeking alimony from his or her spouse may be a privileged suitor, entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees, if it appears that the party has insufficient funds to pursue the matter. <em>See Staley, </em>25 Md.App. at 113, n. 4, 335 A.2d 114. We said in that case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-5\">The Court of Appeals has long and consistently held that a wife living separate and apart from her husband is a privileged suitor when she seeks alimony, that as such she is entitled to counsel fees and costs for the prosecution of the trial, and that <em>the husband should be required to pay counsel fees for services rendered his wife and her costs on an appeal concerning the matter of alimony </em>when it appears that her income is insufficient to care for her needs and when her appeal was taken in good faith.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMC\"><em>Id. </em>(concluding that the appellant, the mother in a child support case, was a privileged suitor and remanding the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>\u201cto permit the trial court to make a proper allowance for counsel fees for prosecuting [the] appeal\u201d) (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">What neither the Court of Appeals nor this Court has directly decided, however, is whether a spouse defending an appeal from an award of alimony is a privileged suitor entitled to advanced attorney\u2019s fees. The cases nevertheless strongly suggest as much, and we now make explicit what is implicit in those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">We stated the general rule in <em>Guarino </em>that the party seeking alimony is a privileged suitor \u201c ^whether [he] or she be plaintiff or defendant^]\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 8, 684 A.2d 23 (citation omitted), if that party is \u201c \u2018without means\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018destitute of the pecuniary means of carrying on her suit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11 &amp; n. 2, 684 A.2d 23. As a privileged suitor in the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellee is entitled to advanced attorney\u2019s fees for carrying on the suit, regardless of whether she is the appellant or appellee on appeal. <em>See id. </em>at 8, 11 &amp; n. 2, 684 A.2d 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Moreover, whether or not the court and the parties use the term \u201cprivileged suitor,\u201d the general rule in Maryland is that a party to a divorce proceeding may be required to pay reasonable counsel fees for services rendered to his or her spouse, both in the trial court and on appeal, when it appears that the spouse\u2019s income is insufficient to care for his or her needs. <em>See Eberly v. Eberly, </em>12 Md.App. 117, 128-29, 278 A.2d 107 (1971) (stating that a party to a divorce proceeding may be required to pay the reasonable counsel fees for services rendered to his or her spouse at trial and on appeal, but declining to award attorney\u2019s fees to the wife because she earned an income sufficient to cover her own fees); <em>see also Randolph, </em>67 Md.App. at 581, 508 A.2d 996 (stating that FL \u00a7 11-110 contemplates an award of attorney\u2019s fees when an appeal is taken from a decision resolving alimony issues).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">We have said that an award of attorney\u2019s fees is within the discretion of the presiding trial judge. <em>Dave, </em>157 Md.App. at 675, 853 A.2d 826. Although the award is subject to appellate review, we will not disturb it \u201cunless it is shown that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>discretion was exercised arbitrarily or the judgment was clearly wrong.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The trial court in the instant case decided to award appellee advanced appellate attorney\u2019s fees and costs, reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">One of the things it says in <em>\\Guarino </em>], the general rule is clear and undisputed that the wife, in these cases, is a privileged suitor and that the court without inquiring into the merits and whether she be a plaintiff or defendant will allow her alimony pendente lite and a sum for carrying on the suit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">I think it would be a little disingenuous to say that you are not a privileged suitor and you could lose your alimony or your award, whatever it was, if you couldn\u2019t afford to pay an attorney to represent you as an appellee---- [To] say somebody is a privileged suitor if they want to bring a suit, but they are not a privileged suitor to defend a suit I think is a little bit inconsistent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">The court was correct in its analysis of what the law permits, and the court did not abuse its discretion in deciding to make the fee award. There is, then, no reason to disturb that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">Finally, appellant contends that, even if the court properly granted appellee\u2019s petition for advanced appellate attorney\u2019s fees, the court erred in awarding appellee $3,700.00. We disagree. As discussed above, the court heard ample evidence from which it could conclude that appellee was not financially positioned to pay an attorney to defend the appeal. The court also heard evidence that the attorney\u2019s fees incurred in bringing or defending an appeal typically range from $5,000.00 to $10,000.00. Given appellee\u2019s inability to retain counsel to mount a proper defense to the appeal, the court did not abuse its discretion by making the award of $3,700.00.</p>\n<p id=\"AnN\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-12\">APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b362-7\">.
