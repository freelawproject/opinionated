Rahman is an inmate who is committed to the custody of the Commissioner of Correction and has been serving a term of confinement continuously since 1992. In a previous opinion,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> this Court determined that Haskins is entitled to have his term of confinement reduced by four years and four days\u2014a portion of the time he was incarcerated on convictions that were later vacated by this Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In this appeal, Haskins seeks a reduction of his term of confinement equal to the remainder of the time he was incarcerated on those convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">Haskins argues that the trial court erred by denying his motion to correct an illegal sentence. We shall affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">Haskins\u2019 history with Maryland\u2019s legal system and the Division of Correction is a long and convoluted one. We shall recite only those facts necessary to an understanding of the appeal now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">Haskins was convicted on October 25, 1985 in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City of assault with intent to murder, assault, and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. The court imposed concurrent prison sentences of 25 years for assault with intent to murder and 20 years for the handgun violation, but suspended all but 10 years in favor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>five years\u2019 probation. The sentences commenced as of August 14, 1984. Haskins did not timely appeal from the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">On November 27, 1991, after serving approximately seven years and three months in confinement on the 1985 sentences, Haskins was released on parole. He was subsequently arrested and detained in connection with a robbery committed on March 4, 1992 in Baltimore County. On January 13, 1993, Haskins was convicted in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County of robbery with a deadly weapon and related offenses in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">As a result of the 1993 convictions, Haskins was found to be in violation of his parole in the 1985 case. His parole was therefore revoked. Subsequently, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County imposed prison sentences in the robbery case to run consecutively to the reimposed sentences for the 1985 convictions. Relying on the 1985 assault with intent to murder conviction and another, earlier conviction for a crime of violence, the court imposed a mandatory sentence of 25 years without possibility of parole for robbery with a deadly weapon.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">In 1995, Haskins filed a petition for post-conviction relief in connection with the 1985 case. His petition was granted and ultimately, on March 5, 1997, this Court vacated the judgments entered in the 1985 case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This Court\u2019s mandate issued on April 4, 1997. Through counsel, Haskins then filed a \u201cMotion to Modify Illegal Sentence\u201d in the Gircuit Court for Baltimore County, seeking to have the mandatory 25-year sentence modified since it was based on a predicate conviction that was no longer valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">A hearing was held on the motion to modify. Apparently, counsel for Haskins also argued at the hearing that the amount of time Haskins served in confinement on the 1985 sentences should be subtracted from the total length of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>term of confinement for the 1993 convictions. The trial court granted the motion to modify as to the mandatory sentence, but refused to grant Haskins credit against the sentences for the 1993 convictions for time served in confinement on the 1985 sentences. Haskins then appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">In his brief in that appeal, Haskins argued that the Circuit Court for Baltimore County erred by \u201crefusing to give appellant credit for time served on another case, when the judgment in the other case was reversed on appeal[.]\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He specifically asserted that the trial court \u201cwas required to give appellant credit for the seven and one half years he served on [the 1985] case.\u201d The State responded in its brief that Haskins was attempting improperly to use \u201cbanked\u201d time. Thereafter, in a reply brief, Haskins asserted that he was not attempting to use \u201cbanked\u201d time but sought only to receive credit for \u201c4 years and 4 days\u201d that he was incarcerated on the 1985 sentences <em>after </em>his parole on those sentences was revoked. Apparently because the sentences imposed for the 1993 convictions were to run consecutively to the reimposed sentences for the 1985 convictions, Haskins argued that he \u201cwas serving multiple sentences within the meaning of [former \u00a7 638C(c) of Article 27] when he was serving both the sentence for the violation of [parole] in [the 1985] case and the sentence in the instant robbery case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">This Court accepted Haskins\u2019 argument, as clarified in his reply brief, in that appeal. Without commenting on Haskins\u2019 initial request that he receive credit for all seven and a half years he was imprisoned on the 1985 sentences, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5\">The appellant clearly has been a \u201cperson serving multiple sentences\u201d since March 30, 1993. As such, we hold that the appellant is entitled to the four years and four days he served as a result of violating his parole in [the 1985] case, a case that was subsequently reversed on appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>As a result of this Court\u2019s decision, the trial court then issued a new Commitment to the Division of Correction reflecting that Haskins had been credited with an additional four years and four days of \u201ctime served.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">On August 26, 2005, Haskins filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County another \u201cMotion to Correct Illegal Sentence.\u201d Haskins argued that the trial court had erred by failing to \u201cstart\u201d his sentences for the 1993 convictions \u201con the date of the appellate opinion.\u201d Presumably, Haskins was referring to the date of the opinion by which this Court vacated the 1985 convictions, although he does not specify whether he means the date the opinion was filed or the date the mandate issued. In any event, the trial court denied the motion without comment. Haskins timely filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Haskins asserts in his brief that \u201cany time [he] served [on the 1985 sentences] between 1985 and when he was released prior to incarceration for the 1992 crime was time served that was not ultimately credited to a valid sentence.\u201d Haskins argues that, based on \u00a7 6\u2014218(b)(2) or (b)(3) of the Criminal Procedure Article, all of \u201cthe time [he] spent incarcerated for the vacated [1985 convictions] should have been credited to the time to be served for his subsequent conviction[s].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">Preliminarily, there is considerable question as to whether the argument is a proper subject for a motion to correct illegal sentence. Maryland Rule 4-345(a) provides, \u201cThe court may correct an illegal sentence at any time.\u201d An illegal sentence is \u201ca sentence not permitted by law....\u201d <em>Walczak v. State, </em>302 Md. 422, 427, 488 A.2d 949 (1985), <em>abrogation on other grounds recognized by Savoy v. State, </em>336 Md. 355, 648 A.2d 683 (1994). A motion to correct an illegal sentence is \u201c \u2018not appropriate where the alleged illegality did not inhere in [the defendant\u2019s] sentence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Baker v. State, </em>389 Md. 127, 133, 883 A.2d 916 (2005) (citation omitted). <em>See generally State v. Wilkins, </em>393 Md. 269, 273-75, 900 A.2d 765 (2006). Ordinarily, a motion to correct an illegal sentence is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>entertained only \u201cwhere the alleged illegality was in the sentence itself or the sentence never should have been imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, Haskins does not challenge the legality of the sentences imposed in the 1993 case, which he is now serving. He merely contends that he should receive credit against those sentences for time served in confinement on other, vacated sentences. It thus appears that the motion did not have a proper basis, and the trial court correctly denied it for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">Assuming, without deciding, that the motion to correct an illegal sentence was a proper recourse, the State correctly points out that Haskins is bound by the law of the case as set forth by an earlier opinion of this Court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As we have indicated, in <em>William, Haskins a/k/a Bilal Abdul Rahman v. State of Maryland, </em>No. 698 September Term, 2000 (Court of Special Appeals January 4, 2001), we determined that Haskins was entitled to four years and four days of credit for time served in confinement after the revocation of his parole on the 1985 sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">As the Court of Appeals has summarized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-6\">[T]he \u201claw of the case doctrine is one of appellate procedure.\u201d ... Under the doctrine, once an appellate court rules upon a question presented on appeal, litigants and lower courts become bound by the ruling, which is considered to be the law of the case.... Not only are lower courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>bound by the law of the case, but \u201c[decisions rendered by a prior appellate panel will generally govern the second appeal\u201d at the same appellate level as well, unless the previous decision is incorrect because it is out of keeping with controlling principles announced by a higher court and following the decision would result in manifest injustice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ab\"><em>Scott v. State, </em>379 Md. 170, 183-84, 840 A.2d 715 (2004) (citations omitted). In <em>Scott, </em>the Court recognized that the law of the case doctrine applies to motions to correct illegal sentences. <em>See id. </em>at 182-83, 840 A.2d 715. The Court ruled that the doctrine had been misapplied in that case, however, since there had been no appellate rulings but only rulings by the trial court. <em>See id. </em>at 184, 840 A.2d 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">In Maryland, the law of the case doctrine prevents the revisiting of not only an issue that has been properly raised on appeal but also \u201ca question that <em>could </em>have been raised and argued in that appeal on the then state of the record----\u201d <em>Martello v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Maryland, Inc., </em>143 Md.App. 462, 474, 795 A.2d 185 (2002) (emphasis added). Under the law of the case doctrine, \u201c[njeither the questions decided nor the ones that could have been raised and decided are available to be raised in a subsequent appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis omitted). As the Court of Appeals has made clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-7\">It is the well-established law of this state that litigants cannot try their cases piecemeal. They cannot prosecute successive appeals in a case that raises the same questions that have been previously decided by this Court in a former appeal of that same case; and, furthermore, they cannot, on the subsequent appeal of the same case raise any question that could have been presented in the previous appeal on the then state of the record, as it existed in the court of original jurisdiction. If this were not so, any party to a suit could institute as many successive appeals as the fiction of his imagination could produce new reasons to assign as to why his side of the case should prevail, and the litigation would never terminate. Once this Court has ruled upon a question properly presented on an appeal, or, if the ruling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>be contrary to a question that could have been raised and argued in that appeal on the then state of the record, as aforesaid, such a ruling becomes the \u201claw of the case\u201d and is binding on the litigants and the court alike, unless changed or modified after reargument, and neither the questions decided not the ones that could have been raised and decided are available to be raised in a subsequent appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOC\"><em>Fid.-Baltimore Nat. Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>217 Md. 367, 371-72, 142 A.2d 796 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">As we have indicated, Haskins asserted in his appellant\u2019s brief in <em>Haskins, </em>No. 698, September Term, 2000, that the trial court \u201cwas required to give appellant credit for the seven and one half years he served on [the 1985] case.\u201d After the State responded in its appellee brief that Haskins was attempting improperly to use \u201cbanked\u201d time, Haskins seemingly changed his position and argued, in a reply brief, that he sought only to receive credit for <em>\u201c4 </em>years and 4 days\u201d served in confinement on the 1985 sentences <em>after </em>his parole on those sentences was revoked. Clearly, the argument that Haskins now urges this Court to accept could have been\u2014and indeed temporarily was\u2014urged in the previous appeal. Our decision in <em>Haskins, </em>No. 698, September Term, 2000, is now the law of the case, and Haskins is precluded from arguing that he is entitled to more credit based on the 1985 sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the law of the case doctrine did not apply, we would hold that Haskins is not entitled to the credits he now requests. Section 6-218 of the Criminal Procedure Article provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-7\">\u00a7 6-218 Credit against sentence for time spent in custody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-8\">(a) This section does not apply to a parolee who is returned to the custody of the Division of Correction because of a subsequent crime and is confined before being sentenced for the subsequent crime.[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>(b)(1) A defendant who is convicted and sentenced shall receive credit against and a reduction of the term of a definite or life sentence, or the minimum and maximum terms of an indeterminate sentence, for all time spent in the custody of a correctional facility, hospital, facility for persons with mental disorders, or other unit because of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-5\">(1) the charge for which the sentence is imposed; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANB\">(ii) the conduct on which the charge is based.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">(2) If a defendant is in custody because of a charge that results in a dismissal or acquittal, the time that would have been credited if a sentence had been imposed shall be credited against any sentence that is based on a charge for which a warrant or commitment was filed during that custody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-7\">(3) In a case other than a case described in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the sentencing court may apply credit against a sentence for time spent in custody for another charge or crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-8\">(d) A defendant who is serving multiple sentences, one of which is set aside as the result of a direct or collateral attack, shall receive credit against and a reduction of the remaining term of a definite or life sentence, or the remaining minimum and maximum terms of an indeterminate sentence, for all time spent in custody under the sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>set aside, including credit applied against the sentence set aside in accordance with subsection (b) of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Md.Code (2001, 2005 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 6-218 of the Crina. Pro. Art.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The Court of Appeals has summarized the criteria for interpreting the statute in issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-7\">The construction of [\u00a7 6-218] of the Criminal Procedure Article implicate^] a <em>de novo </em>review---- Our goal, when interpreting statutes, is to \u201cidentify and effectuate the legislative intent underlying the statute(s) at issue.\u201d ... The best source of legislative intent is the statute\u2019s plain language, and when the language is clear and unambiguous, our inquiry ordinarily ends there.... When there is more than one reasonable interpretation of a statute, however, the statute is ambiguous.... When the statutory language is ambiguous, we resolve that ambiguity in light of the legislative intent, considering the legislative history, case law, and statutory purpose____\u201cWe consider not only the ordinary meaning of the words, but also how that language relates to the overall meaning, setting, and purpose of the act.\u201d ... The statute\u2019s provisions must be read in \u201ca commonsensical perspective to avoid a farfetched interpretation.\u201d ... We construe the statute as a whole so that no word, clause, sentence, or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless, or nugatory....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-12\"><em>Gilmer v. State, </em>389 Md. 656, 662-63, 887 A.2d 549 (2005) (citations omitted) (holding that under the facts of that case the entry of a charge <em>nolle prosequi </em>amounted to a dismissal within the meaning of \u00a7 6-218(b)(2)). \u201cUnder Maryland law, an ambiguity in penal statutes is to be construed against the State.... Similarly, if doubt exists as to the proper penalty, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>punishment must be construed to favor a milder penalty.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Simms, </em>157 Md.App. 82, 98, 849 A.2d 88, <em>cert. denied, </em>382 Md. 687, 856 A.2d 723 (2004). We perceive no ambiguity as to the application of \u00a7 6-218 in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Although Haskins directs this Court\u2019s attention to subsections (b)(2) and (b)(3) of \u00a7 6-218, those subsections are inapplicable. By its plain language, \u00a7 6-218(b)(2) mandates that a defendant be given credit for time served prior to trial on a charge that results in dismissal or acquittal. Haskins\u2019 case involves no such time served. The Court of Appeals has explained that, under \u00a7 6\u2014218(b)(3), a trial court has discretion to allow credit for time served prior to trial on a charge that is disposed of in some manner other than dismissal or acquittal, such as a stet. <em>See Gilmer, </em>389 Md. at 677 n. 17, 887 A.2d 549. Again, no such time served is implicated in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">It is apparent that the subsection with potential applicability to Haskins\u2019 case is \u00a7 6-218(d). Indeed, Haskins\u2019 argument seemingly paraphrases that subsection. Haskins points out that he was \u201con parole\u201d for the 1985 sentences when he was arrested on the charges that led to his 1993 convictions and sentences. He suggests that even though he was on parole he was \u201cin custody\u201d or \u201cserv[ing] ... sentence^] beyond [prison] walls.\u201d Haskins maintains that he \u201cis not seeking credit for time spent on parole\u201d and asserts that \u201cthe significance of [his] being on parole is that he was in custody when ... he was subsequently charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Subsection (d) of \u00a7 6-218 \u201caddresses the situation where a defendant is serving multiple sentences and one of them is set aside as a result of a direct or collateral attack.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>157 Md.App. at 95, 849 A.2d 88. Haskins argues that he <em>was </em>serving multiple sentences at the relevant times, including: his initial incarceration on the 1985 sentences; the time spent on parole for the 1985 sentences; his incarceration upon the revocation of his parole; and his consecutive sentences for the 1993 convictions. The argument rests on the supposition that Haskins was serving a sentence within the meaning of the statute even while on parole. That is, that he was serving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>multiple sentences during the entire period despite the break in physical custody, or confinement, that occurred while he was on parole. Haskins concedes that he is not entitled to credit against the 1993 sentences for any portion of the 1985 sentences served on parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">It is true, in a technical sense, that \u201cparole constitutes service of the sentence beyond the prison walls,\u201d and that \u201ca parolee may be considered \u2018in custody\u2019 \u201d for certain purposes. <em>State v. Parker, </em>334 Md. 576, 587, 640 A.2d 1104 (1994) (explaining that parole does not constitute service of sentence such that another sentence can be imposed to run consecutively to parole). \u201c[Tjhis characterization, while correct, is incomplete,\u201d however. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals has made clear that \u201cparole is fundamentally different in nature from actual service within the prison walls.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAlthough a sentence continues to be served whether within prison walls or without, it is clear that parole is different in nature from, and serves a purpose different from that of, incarceration.\u201d <em>Stouffer v. Pearson, </em>390 Md. 36, 56, 887 A.2d 623 (2005) (where sentence imposed on new sentence was to run consecutively to sentence for which defendant was on parole, but parole had not been revoked at time of sentencing, new sentence was deemed to begin on date of sentencing). \u201cA defendant is not in \u2018custody\u2019 for purposes of [\u00a7 6-218] if the conditions of the defendant\u2019s confinement do not impose substantial restrictions on the defendant\u2019s freedom of association, activity and movement such that unauthorized absence from the place of confinement would be chargeable as the criminal offense of escape....\u201d <em>Dedo v. State, </em>343 Md. 2, 11, 680 A.2d 464 (1996). <em>See generally </em>Code (2002, 2005 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 9-401, 9-404, and 9-405 of the Crim. Law Art. (setting forth the crime of escape).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">\u201cParole is not a sentence <em>in </em>esse....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 59, 680 A.2d 464. It \u201cis unique in nature and should not be treated analogously\u201d to incarceration. <em>Id. </em>at 57, 680 A.2d 464. As the Court of Appeals has opined, \u201c[t]o treat the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>identically in the context of multiple sentences ... is overly simplistic.... \u201d <em>Parker, </em>334 Md. at 588-89, 640 A.2d 1104.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">To summarize the instant case, Haskins was released on parole\u2014and thus from confinement\u2014after serving time on the 1985 sentences. While on parole, he committed new offenses of which he was convicted in 1993. Haskins\u2019 parole for the 1985 sentences was revoked, and he was subsequently sentenced for the 1993 convictions. Eventually, the 1985 judgments were vacated. Haskins was given credit against the 1993 sentences for time served on the 1985 sentences after his parole was revoked. That is because the post-parole sentences formed \u201cmultiple sentences\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 6-218(d). Haskins was not given\u2014and in his previous appeal expressly declined to request\u2014credit against the 1993 sentences for time served on the 1985 sentences before he was paroled because the pre-parole sentences were not part of the \u201cmultiple sentences.\u201d <em>Cf. Geddings v. Filbert, </em>144 Md.App. 95, 105, 796 A.2d 834 (2002) (for purposes of calculating diminution of confinement credits for prisoners committed to the custody of the Division of Correction, \u201c[a]ny sentence being served on parole ... is not aggregated into a term of confinement because it is not being served in \u2018confinement\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Section 6-218 \u201chas a dual purpose: to preclude a defendant from \u2018banking\u2019 time before he or she commits a new offense and to eliminate \u2018dead\u2019 time, which is time spent in custody that will not be credited to a future sentence.\u201d <em>Dedo, </em>343 Md. at 9, 680 A.2d 464.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-7\">Credit statutes are designed to avoid the obviously undesirable effect of permitting a defendant to \u201cbank\u201d time before he commits a new offense.... Indeed, the possibility that an accumulated reserve of time could be used to offset a sentence for a future, yet uncompleted crime would destroy the deterrent value against the commission of such a crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APg\"><em>Fleeger v. State, </em>301 Md. 155, 163-64, 482 A.2d 490 (1984) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">The application of \u00a7 6-218 urged by Haskins would permit Haskins to take advantage of \u201cbanked\u201d time. That is, Haskins <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>would be permitted to use time served prior to a break in confinement to offset a sentence for a crime committed during that break. It is truly unfortunate that Haskins was incarcerated for a period of time, prior to his parole, on convictions that were later vacated. Due to the break in physical custody effected by the parole, however, the pre-parole period simply can not be aggregated to form \u201cmultiple sentences\u201d with any other sentence against which the so-called \u201cdead\u201d time could be credited.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">We observe that our holding leaves Haskins in the position of any person who serves time and is paroled on a criminal conviction that is later vacated, and who does <em>not </em>commit another criminal offense while on parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b207-12\">. <em>William Haskins a/k/a Bilal Abdul Rahman v.

Although the matter is of little pertinence in light of our resolution of this case, we note that Haskins' argument on appeal is different than the argument he made in the \u201cMotion to Correct an Illegal Sentence\u201d which was hied in the trial court and which is at the root of this appeal. In support of his motion, Haskins argued that the trial court erred by failing to \"start\u201d his sentences for the 1993 convictions \"on the date of the appellate opinion.\u201d Haskins did not argue, as he argues on appeal, that he was entitled to credit for time served in confinement on the 1985 sentences before his parole on those sentences. Because the legality of a sentence may be raised at any time\u2014even, for the first time, at the appellate level\u2014the argument would properly be before this Court xf it truly went to the legality of the sentences. <em>See, e.g., Fisher v. State, </em>367 Md. 218, 238-40, 786 A.2d 706 (2001); <em>Walczak v. State, </em>302 Md. 422, 425-27, 488 A.2d 949 (1985), <em>abrogation on other grounds recognized by Savoy v.

In arguing in <em>Haskins, </em>No. 698, September Term, 2000, that he was entitled to credit for four years and four days served in confinement on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>the 1985 sentences after the revocation of his parole, Haskins had the predecessor to this subsection in mind. He asserted in a footnote in his reply brief:</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">Actually, it was four years and 65 days [that Haskins served on the 1985 sentences after the revocation of his parole but before the judgments were vacated], but appellant is not entitled to credit for time spent in custody after a parole violation and before he was sentenced for a subsequent offense. Four years and 65 days intervened after appellant was sentenced in the instant robbery case. <em>See, </em>art. 27, \u00a7 638C(a) (\"This section does not apply to a parolee who is returned to the custody of the Division of Correction as a result of a subsequent offense and is incarcerated prior to the date on which he is sentenced for the subsequent offense\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b215-13\">.
