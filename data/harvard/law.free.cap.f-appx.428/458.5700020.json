A COA is not required to challenge the denial of \u00a7 3582 relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">To obtain a COA, Dyer must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Where, as here, the district court has denied relief on the merits, to obtain a COA the petitioner must demonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong. <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-16\">Dyer argues that \u00a7 3582(a) authorizes the district court to reduce a sentence when an amendment to the Guidelines has the effect of lowering a sentencing range. He also contends that \u00a7 lBl.ll(b)(2), p.s., allows a district court to lower a sentence that has already been imposed when there is a subsequent clarifying amendment to the Guidelines. He argues that the district court erred when it declined to address his motion under \u00a7 lBl.ll(b)(2), and he asks this court to determine whether Amendment 503 is clarifying or substantive.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-17\">Section 3582(a) does not authorize the district court to reduce a sentence but instructs the district court to consider the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in determining whether to impose a sentence and in determining the length of any such sentence. \u00a7 3582(a). The relief that Dyer seeks falls more properly under \u00a7 3582(c), which permits the district court to modify a sentence once it has been imposed, and under \u00a7 2255, which permits a prisoner to attack a sentence collaterally. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c); \u00a7 2255. Dyer\u2019s argument that Amendment 503 to the Guidelines entitled him to a reduction in his sentence is not cognizable under \u00a7 2255 and fails to make the required showing. <em>See Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595. Nor does Dyer\u2019s argument entitle him to relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Drath, </em>89 F.3d 216, 217-18 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-18\">IT IS ORDERED a COA is DENIED; the denial of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b483-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
