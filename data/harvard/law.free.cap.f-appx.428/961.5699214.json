Escobar-Pineda contends that the district court erred by applying a 16-level enhancement for deportation following conviction for a crime of violence. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-23\">In 1995 Escobar-Pineda was convicted of the felony offense of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.021(l)(a). The district court concluded that conviction qualified as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Sentencing Guidelines and applied a 16-level enhancement. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). Escobar-Pineda argues that was error. \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>whether a defendant\u2019s prior conviction qualifies as a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d 1317, 1326 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-24\">The Sentencing Guidelines impose a 16-level enhancement if an alien \u201cwas deported, or unlawfully remained in the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>States, after ... a conviction for a felony that is ... a crime of violence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L 1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) (Nov.2009). A \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is defined as any of the following offenses under federal, state, or local law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-4\">murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, <em>aggravated assault, </em>forcible sex offenses (including where consent to the conduct is not given or is not legally valid, such as where consent to the conduct is involuntary, incompetent, or coerced), statutory rape, sexual abuse of a minor, robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of credit, burglary of a dwelling, or any other offense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b986-5\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. n. 1 (B)(iii) (emphasis added); <em>see also United States v. Searcy, </em>418 F.3d 1193, 1195 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cWe treat the commentai'y in the Sentencing Guidelines Manual as authoritative.\u201d). The definition \u201cis disjunctive and we have held that a felony conviction qualifies as a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2 if either (1) the defendant was convicted of one of the enumerated offenses; or (2) the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force was an element of the offense.\u201d <em>Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d at 1326.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">To determine whether a prior conviction qualifies as an enumerated offense, we use the \u201ccategorical approach.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1330-31 (explaining that \u201cthe label a state attaches to an offense is not conclusive of whether a prior conviction qualifies as an enumerated offense under \u00a7 2L1.2\u201d). Under that approach, \u201cwe consider the offense generically, that is to say, we examine it in terms of how the law defines the offense and not in terms of how an individual offender might have committed it on a particular occasion.\u201d <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 141, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 1584, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008) (citing <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2160, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990)); <em>see also Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d at 1331. In <em>Palomino Garcia, </em>we held that \u201cthe generic offense of \u2018aggravated assault\u2019 under \u00a7 2L1.2 of the Guidelines involves a criminal assault accompanied by the aggravating factors of either the intent to cause serious bodily injury to the victim or the use of a deadly weapon.\u201d 606 F.3d at 1332.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-9\">The Florida statute under which Escobar-Pineda was convicted provides that \u201c[a]n \u2018aggravated assault\u2019 is an assault ... [wjith a deadly weapon without intent to kill.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.021(l)(a). \u201cAssault\u201d is defined as \u201can intentional, unlawful threat by word or act to do violence to the person of another, coupled with an apparent ability to do so, and doing some act which creates a well-founded fear in such other person that such violence is imminent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 784.011(1). Because Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.021(l)(a) requires the use of a deadly weapon, it \u201cprohibits behavior that is ... within the generic, contemporary meaning of aggravated assault as it is used in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2.\u201d <em>Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d at 1333 (quoting <em>United States v. Fierro-Reyna, </em>466 F.3d 324, 329-30 (5th Cir.2006)). For that reason, Eseobar-Pineda\u2019s prior conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.021(1)(a) qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). The district court did not err in applying the 16-level enhancement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b986-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b986-7\">. Escobar-Pineda also challenges the reasonableness of his sentence. He argues only that the district court procedurally erred by applying the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) enhancement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>For the reasons explained above, the enhancement was proper and no procedural error occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
