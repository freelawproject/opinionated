In his application for asylum, Chen asserted that he was eligible for relief based on his past persecution and well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his political opinion. Specifically, Chen asserted that he was entitled to relief based on his wife\u2019s forced sterilization and his \u201cother resistance\u201d to China\u2019s coercive family planning policy. The IJ and BIA determined that Chen was not credible and denied relief. After review, we deny Chen\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">\u201cWe review the decision of the [BIA], and we review the decision of the [IJ] to the extent that the [BIA] expressly adopted the opinion of the [IJ].\u201d <em>Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1350 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation marks omitted). In this case, we review both decisions because the BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s findings. See <em>id. </em>We review the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo, </em>but we review findings of fact, including credibility determinations, for substantial evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">The substantial evidence test is highly deferential. \u201c[W]e review the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cWe may not \u2018re-weigh the evidence from scratch.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1351. We must \u201caffirm the [BIA\u2019s] decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1286 (quotation marks omitted). \u201cTo reverse the [BIA\u2019s] fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii), as amended by the REAL ID Act of 2005, \u00a7 101(a)(3), a credibility determination may be based on \u201cany inaccuracies or falsehoods in [the applicant\u2019s] statements, without regard to whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim, or any other relevant factor.\u201d An adverse-credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application, especially if the applicant fails to produce corroborating evidence. <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1231 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cIf the IJ explicitly determines that the alien lacks credibility, the IJ must offer specific, cogent, reasons for the finding.\u201d Id. The burden then shifts to \u201cthe applicant alien to show that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision was not supported by \u2018specific, cogent reasons\u2019 or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-11\">To qualify for asylum, an alien must show that he is a refugee. <em>Id. </em>at 1286. \u201cAn alien qualifies as a refugee if [he] can establish that [he] has suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution, based on a protected ground, in [his] country of origin.\u201d <em>Tang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>578 F.3d at 1270, 1277 (11th Cir.2009). The five protected grounds are: race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>Ayala v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>605 F.3d 941, 948 (11th Cir.2010). The Immigration and Nationality Act expressly recognizes forced sterilizations as persecution based on political opinion. Under 8 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>\u00a7 1101(a)(42), \u201ca person who has been forced ... to undergo involuntary sterilization, or who has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population control program, shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion.\u201d We have explained that provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-4\">does not confer automatic refugee status on an individual merely because his or her spouse (or unmarried partner) underwent a forced ... sterilization. Rather, the person who did not physically undergo the forced procedure ... must establish \u2018actual persecution for resisting a country\u2019s coercive family planning policy, or a well-founded fear of future persecution for doing so.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b918-5\"><em>Yu v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1328, 1332-33 (11th Cir.2009) (citations omitted). \u201cResistance\u201d that could confer refugee status on a spouse includes \u201cexpressions of general opposition, attempts to interfere with enforcement of government policy in particular cases, and other overt forms of resistance to the requirements of the family law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1334 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">In this case, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the IJ and BIA\u2019s finding that Chen was not credible. The IJ and BIA noted that before his hearing Chen never mentioned that he argued with a family planning official on the day of his wife\u2019s sterilization. At his hearing, Chen pointed to the argument as a central basis of his entitlement to relief. Chen testified that he feared future persecution because of the argument and that it was the reason that he left China.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">The IJ and BIA also noted that Chen testified at his hearing that he was not at home when family planning officials took his wife for involuntary sterilization. During an interview with a Department of Homeland Security asylum officer, however, Chen stated that he was at home when the officials arrived.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In light of these discrepancies, substantial evidence supports the IJ and BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-11\">Substantial evidence also supports the IJ and BIA\u2019s denial of Chen\u2019s application for asylum because none of the documentary evidence in the record supports or compels the conclusion that Chen was persecuted or that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his resistance to China\u2019s coercive population control program.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-12\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b918-7\">. Chen contends that the BIA and IJ's reliance on the asylum officer\u2019s notes from the interview violated his due process rights. He argues that he was deprived of a fair hearing because the asylum officer did not testify. A due process claim that an applicant was \u201cdenied a full and fair hearing ... is precisely the kind of procedural error which requires exhaustion.\u201d <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1251 (11th Cir.2006). Chen failed to raise any claim concerning a due process violation to the BIA. Because he failed to exhaust the issue, we lack jurisdiction to consider it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b918-15\">. Because Chen has failed to establish a claim of asylum on the merits, he necessarily fails to establish eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1293 (11th Cir.2001). We lack jurisdiction to consider Chen\u2019s claim for CAT relief because he failed to raise it before the BIA. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
