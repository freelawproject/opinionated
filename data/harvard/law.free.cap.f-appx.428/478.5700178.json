He was sentenced, based upon his being a career offender, to, <em>inter alia, </em>100 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-23\">For the first time on appeal, McCullough contends the district court erred by assessing a two-level enhancement under advisory Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2A2.2(b)(l) (assess two-level enhanee<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>ment if assault \u201cinvolved more than minimal planning\u201d). As he concedes, because he did not preserve this issue in district court, review is only for plain error. <em>E.g., United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009). For reversible plain error, there must be a clear or obvious error (plain error) that affected McCullough\u2019s substantial rights; even then, we retain discretion to correct the error and, generally, will do so only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings\u201d. <em>E.g., United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 358-59 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">McCullough maintains: there was a plain error because the undisputed facts show that the offense did not involve \u201cmore than minimal planning\u201d; and, the error affected his substantial rights because, without the enhancement, his advisory sentencing range would have been 84-106 months, instead of the 100-120 months range utilized by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">For starters, whether McCullough engaged in \u201cmore than minimal planning\u201d is a factual determination. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Floyd, </em>343 F.3d 363, 371 (5th Cir.2003). Under our court\u2019s well-established precedent, \u201c[qjuestions of fact capable of resolution by the district court upon proper objection at sentencing can never constitute plain error\u201d. <em>United States v. Vital, </em>68 F.3d 114, 119 (5th Cir.1995) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">In any event, the more-than-minimal-planning enhancement did not affect McCullough\u2019s sentence because he was sentenced as a career offender, which carried a higher offense level than that calculated using the enhancement. Accordingly, McCullough has not shown the enhancement affected his substantial rights. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Guevara, </em>408 F.3d 252, 263 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b502-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
