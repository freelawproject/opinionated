On appeal, Green argues that his sentence, which runs consecutively to an undischarged 51-month state sentence for violation of probation, is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to achieve the goals of sentencing as set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and because the district court relied on an erroneous finding that he was involved in drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-24\">We review a sentence imposed by a district court for \u201creasonableness,\u201d using an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008). The review for substantive reasonableness involves examining the \u201ctotality of the circumstances,\u201d including an inquiry into whether the section 3553(a) factors support the sentence in question. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>38, 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The defendant has the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). We defer to the district court\u2019s judgment of the weight given to the section 3553(a) factors unless the court has made \u201ca clear error of judgment\u201d and has imposed \u201ca sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1203 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">Pursuant to \u00a7 3553(a), the sentencing court shall impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in ... this subsection,\u201d namely, to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, protect the public from future crimes of the defendant, and provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The sentencing court must also consider the following factors in determining a particular sentence: the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">Green challenges only the substantive reasonableness of his sentence. He argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals outlined in section 3553(a)(2), and because it \u201crelies on a finding of narcotics involvement when [he] was not charged with or arrested for [narcotics possession].\u201d We find these arguments unavailing. First, the district court explained that Green\u2019s sentence was justified on account of his criminal record, which included a \u201clong history of violent conduct.\u201d Moreover, the court heard but ultimately rejected Green\u2019s rationale for a reduced sentence, which was a proper exercise of \u201cthe institutional advantage that district courts have in applying and weighing the section 3553(a) factors in individual cases.\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190-91. Green has thus failed to show that his sentence is greater than necessary to achieve section 3553\u2019s sentencing goals. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">Second, although Green was not charged with drug involvement in this case, unobjected-to facts in the Pre-Senteneing Investigation (\u201cPSI\u201d) make clear that drug paraphernalia was found in Green\u2019s residence. The district court was permitted to take into account the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d when fashioning Green\u2019s sentence, and as a result its decision to consider the presence of drug paraphernalia does not render Green\u2019s sentence substantively unreasonable. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 49-51, 128 S.Ct. at 596-97; <em>See also United, States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2005) (unobjected to facts in PSI are deemed admitted). Thus, we reject Green\u2019s argument that the district court inappropriately considered whether Green was involved with narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-11\">For these reasons, we hold that Green\u2019s sentence is substantively reasonable,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b906-7\">. To the extent Green challenges the district court\u2019s decision to impose a term of imprisonment consecutive to an existing state term of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>imprisonment, as opposed to a term concurrent with that state sentence, we note that this result is well within the discretion of the district court. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a), (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
