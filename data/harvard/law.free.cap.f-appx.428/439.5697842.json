The district court denied Garcia IFP status on appeal and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith under \u00a7 1915(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-20\">By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Garcia is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Garcia\u2019s July 12, 2010, notice of appeal from the district court\u2019s June 30, 2009, dismissal of his suit for lack of jurisdiction, is untimely. <em>See </em>Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(1)(A). Further, Garcia has not adequately briefed and has thus abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s denial of IFP as to his Rule 60(b) motions. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-21\">Garcia has not demonstrated that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, Garcia\u2019s motion to proceed IFP is denied. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24. Because his appeal is frivolous, <em>see Howard,, </em>707 F.2d at 219-20, the appeal is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-22\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Garcia\u2019s claims against the defendants in <em>Garcia v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number><em>Henderson, </em>No. A-09-CA-377, as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e) and our dismissal of this appeal as frivolous both count as strikes for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Garcia is warned that, if he accumulates three strikes pursuant to \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AOV\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
