For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-25\">In 1999, Chung was convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846. In the presentence investigation report (PSI), the probation officer noted that Chung was responsible for at least 100 kilograms of cocaine, which placed Chung\u2019s base offense level at 36 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. With no enhancements or reductions, and a criminal history category II, Chung\u2019s guideline imprisonment range was 210 to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment. Chung objected that his base offense level should not have been based on more than 50 kilograms of cocaine because an amount higher than 50 kilograms was inconsistent with grand jury testimony. At sentencing, the court overruled Chung\u2019s objections and also applied enhancements for obstruction of justice under \u00a7 3C1.1 and possession of a firearm under \u00a7 2D1.1. Under the court\u2019s calculations, Chung had an offense level of 40 and a guideline range of 324 to 405 months\u2019 imprisonment. Chung was sentenced to 400 months\u2019 imprisonment. On direct appeal, this court affirmed Chung\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">In December 2010, Chung filed the instant <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 3582(c) motion to reduce his sentence based on Guideline Amendment 591. Chung argued that the change made by Amendment 591 required that the applicable offense guideline be determined according to the offense of conviction rather than on judicial findings of actual conduct. Thus, he alleged, the district court failed to select the correct guideline for the offense of conviction. Chung concluded that, because he was challenging the district court\u2019s guideline selection and not its determination of his base offense level, Amendment 591 was applicable and his sentence should be reduced to the 20-year mandatory maximum under \u00a7 841(a) offenses for which no drug quantity is alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">The court denied Chung\u2019s motion, finding that Amendment 591 was not applicable and that a \u00a7 3582 claim was not appropriate for an alleged violation under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). This is Chung\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>United, States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">\u201cUnder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court has discretion to reduce the term of imprisonment of an already incarcerated defendant when that defendant was sentenced based on a sentencing range that was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). But \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not grant the district court jurisdiction to reconsider all original sentencing determinations. <em>Id. </em>at 781. Moreover, the district court may not modify an imposed term of imprisonment upon a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion unless the defendant\u2019s sentencing range was subsequently lowered by an amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Id,.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">Amendment 591 added language to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lBl.l(a) instructing the district court to \u201cdetermine, pursuant to \u00a7 1B1.2 (Applicable Guidelines), the offense guideline section from Chapter Two (Offense Conduct) applicable to the offense of conviction.\u201d U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 591.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Furthermore, Amendment 591 changed U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.2(a), instructing the sentencing court to \u201c[rjefer to the Statutory Index (Appendix A) to determine the Chapter Two offense guideline, referenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>in the Statutory Index for the offense of conviction____ For statutory provisions not listed in the Statutory Index, use the most analogous guideline.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(amending U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.2(a)). In <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>we explained that Amendment 591</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-6\">was designed to clarify whether enhanced penalties provided by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.2 (relating to drug offenses near protected locations or involving underage or pregnant individuals) apply only where the offense of conviction is referenced to that guideline, or whether such enhanced penalties can be used whenever a defendant\u2019s relevant, uncharged conduct includes drug sales in a protected location or drug sales involving a protected individual. Specifically, in order for the enhanced penalties in \u00a7 2D1.2 to apply, the defendant must be convicted of an offense referenced to \u00a7 2D1.2, rather than simply have engaged in conduct described by that guideline.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b932-7\"><em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation and citation omitted). Under Appendix A, \u00a7 2D1.1 is the applicable guideline section for \u00a7 841(a) offenses. U.S.S.G. App. A.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">Amendment 591, however, only applies to the selection of the relevant offense guideline, not the selection of a base offense level within the applicable offense guideline. <em>Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1219-20. Furthermore, Amendment 591 does not constrain the use of judicially found facts to select a base offense level within the relevant guideline. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">Here, in determining Chung\u2019s sentence, the district court applied the applicable guideline selection from Appendix A, and thus, Amendment 591 does not apply to him. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b931-6\">. Amendment 591 became effective on November 1, 2000 and is retroactively applicable. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 IB 1.10(c); U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 591.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
