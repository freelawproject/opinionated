Gilley appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motions for relief from judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) and (d) and for attorneys\u2019 fees. In his third appeal, Gilley argues the district court abused its discretion by denying his motion for relief from judgment under Rule 60(b)(3), (4), (5), and (6) and under Rule 60(d)(3). Gilley also claims the district court abused its discretion by denying his request for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b908-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-18\">Gilley contends the district court should have granted relief because the defendants schemed to usurp the court\u2019s jurisdiction to deprive Gilley and others of their vested rights to a pension governed by the Employee Retirement and Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b908-19\">Rule 60(b) allows a party to request relief from a final judgment. The appellant must \u201cdemonstrate a justification so compelling that the court was required to vacate its order.\u201d <em>Cavaliere v. Allstate Ins. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number><em>Co., </em>996 F.2d 1111, 1115 (11th Cir.1993). In relevant part, Rule 60(b) provides the following grounds for relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-5\">(3) fraud ..., misrepresentation, or misconduct by an opposing party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-6\">(4) the judgment is void;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-7\">(5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged; it is based on an earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated; or applying it prospectively is no longer equitable; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-8\">(6) any other reason that justifies relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ake\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). Rule 60(d), a savings clause, provides that Rule 60 does not limit the court\u2019s power to set aside a judgment for fraud on the court. Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(d)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">Rule 60(c) requires that a Rule 60(b) motion \u201cbe made within a reasonable time \u2014 and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) no more than a year after the entry of the judgment....\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(c)(1). Nevertheless, an independent action for \u201cfraud on the court\u201d under Rule 60(d) may be brought at any time. <em>Rozier v. Ford Motor Co., </em>573 F.2d 1332, 1337-38 (5th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-12\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Gilley\u2019s motion for relief from judgment. To the extent Gilley sought relief under Rule 60(b)(3), his motion was untimely because it was filed more than a year after the district court\u2019s order dismissing the action. Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(c)(1). Furthermore, Gilley\u2019s allegations of fraud were merely a rehash of arguments previously considered and rejected by both this Court and the district court. Relief under Rule 60(b)(4) was not appropriate because Gilley identified no jurisdictional or other defect that would render the judgment void. Relief under Rule 60(b)(5) was likewise inappropriate because the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing the action for lack of standing has not been satisfied, released, discharged, reversed, or vacated. Moreover, the district court\u2019s order was final, permanent, and had no prospective effect within the meaning of Rule 60(b)(5). <em>See Gibbs v. Maxwell House, Div. of Gen. Foods Corp., </em>738 F.2d 1153, 1156 (11th Cir.1984) (\u201cThat [the] plaintiff remains bound by the dismissal is not a \u2018prospective effect\u2019 within the meaning of rule 60(b)(5) any more than if plaintiff were continuing to feel the effects of a money judgment against him.\u201d). Finally, Gilley failed to identify an \u201cexceptional circumstance\u201d warranting relief under Rule 60(b)(6). <em>See Cavaliere, </em>996 F.2d at 1115 (noting relief under Rule 60(b)(6) is an \u201cextraordinary remedy which may be invoked only upon a showing of exceptional circumstances\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-17\">Additionally, the record fails to reveal any evidence of fraud on the court. Gilley\u2019s evidence of \u201cfraud\u201d stems entirely from a purported scheme among the defendants to deny pension benefits to former employees. Gilley offers only a rehash of previously rejected arguments. Furthermore, in relying on a conflict of interest and \u201cbias\u201d among the defendants, Gilley fails to identify any improper misconduct designed to influence the decision of a court. <em>See Travelers Indem. Co. v. Gore, </em>761 F.2d 1549, 1551 (11th Cir.1985) (stating fraud between the parties is not fraud on the court). Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying relief under Rule 60(d)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-18\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-19\">Gilley also argues the district court erred by denying his request for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although Gilley asserted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>in the district court that he was entitled to fees and costs under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927 and Rule 11, Gilley argues on appeal only that he was entitled to fees and costs under ERISA and the court\u2019s inherent authority to sanction a party. Because Gilley failed to seek fees or costs under ERISA or under the district court\u2019s inherent authority before the district court, we decline to address these issues. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004) (stating this Court will not consider an issue not raised before the district court).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b908-10\">. <em>See Gilley v.
