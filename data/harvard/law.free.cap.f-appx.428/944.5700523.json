Before Berrio pled guilty, he fled the country and failed to appear at his initial plea hearing. The district court then issued a warrant for his arrest. In 2003, after Berrio was arrested in Brazil for an unrelated offense, provisional warrants were issued for Berrio\u2019s extradition to the United States. On direct appeal, Berrio argues that he should be given credit for the time he served in prison in Brazil from the time he was served the provisional arrest warrants in 2003 for the instant charge until the time his United States sentence commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"A6q\">The Attorney General through the BOP, and not the district courts, is authorized, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b), to compute sentence credit awards after sentencing. <em>Dawson v. Scott, </em>50 F.3d 884, 889 (11th Cir.1995). The Attorney General delegated his authority in this area to the BOP. <em>United States v. Lucas, </em>898 F.2d 1554, 1555-56 (11th Cir.1990). We have held that the granting of credit for time served is in the first instance an administrative, not a judicial, function. <em>United States v. Flanagan, </em>868 F.2d 1544, 1546 (11th Cir.1989). The district court, therefore, cannot circumvent the Attorney General\u2019s initial discretion concerning whether to credit a defendant\u2019s time in custody prior to sentencing. <em>Lucas, </em>898 F.2d at 1555.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-22\">Furthermore, an inmate must exhaust his administrative remedies with the BOP before seeking judicial relief. <em>Id. </em>In fact, the district court does not have jurisdiction to consider a defendant\u2019s claim if he fails to exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b968-23\">A claim concerning credit for time served is not appropriate on direct appeal, and should be filed as a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, against the BOP. <em>See, e.g., Rodriguez v. Lamer, </em>60 F.3d 745, 746 (11th Cir.1995) (noting that defendant filed a \u00a7 2241 peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>tion seeking credit for time he spent at his home under pre-trial, restrictive conditions); <em>Dawson, </em>50 F.3d at 886 (noting that defendant filed a \u00a7 2241 petition after exhausting his BOP administrative remedies, seeking credit for time he spent at a halfway house). Accordingly, we will not consider Berrio\u2019s claims here on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b969-19\">. Berrio's request for oral argument is denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
