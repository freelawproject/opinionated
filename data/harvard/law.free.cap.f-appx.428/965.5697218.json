On appeal, Kinsey raises several arguments relating to the merits of the \u00a7 2241 habeas petition he originally filed in the district court. However, because the district court lacked jurisdiction to hear the merits of his claim, the only issue before this Court is whether the district court erred by failing to transfer Kinsey\u2019s case to the proper district.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-20\">We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision not to transfer a case to another district due to a lack of jurisdiction. <em>Dobard v. Johnson, </em>749 F.2d 1503, 1507 n. 8 (11th Cir.1985). If a person files an action in the district court but the court lacks jurisdiction over the case, the court shall transfer the case to a proper court \u201cif it is in the interest of justice.\u201d \u00a7 1631. While we have not defined precisely what the \u201cinterest of justice\u201d means in the context of a \u00a7 1631 transfer, one important factor is whether a denial of a transfer would effectively bar the plaintiff from relief in the proper court. <em>See ITT Base Servs. v. Hickson, </em>155 F.3d 1272, 1276 (11th Cir.1998) (holding that a transfer was \u201cin the interests of justice\u201d because, without the transfer, an appeal to the appropriate district court would \u201cprobably be time-barred\u201d); <em>see also Slatick v. Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, </em>698 F.2d 433, 434-35 (11th Cir.1983) (per curiam) (transferring a case to another court of appeals where denying the transfer would time-bar the litigant from filing a petition for review in the proper court).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-21\">\u201cIt is a cardinal rule of appellate review that a party may not challenge as error a ruling or other trial proceeding invited by that party.\u201d <em>United States v. Love, </em>449 F.3d 1154, 1157 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (quotation marks omitted). We conclude that Kinsey invited any error by the district court. Before dismissing Kinsey\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>district court specifically requested input from the parties on whether it should transfer the case to a proper court. Kinsey responded by asking the court to assume jurisdiction and to rule on the merits of his claim. He appeared to affirmatively argue against a transfer. Therefore, Kinsey induced the court into denying the transfer and waived his right to challenge that decision on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">In any event, the interests of justice did not warrant a transfer because, after the court\u2019s dismissal, nothing prevented Kinsey from filing his \u00a7 2241 petition in the proper district. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to transfer Kinsey\u2019s petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b990-16\">. Kinsey moved this Court for a stay, pending appeal, of the Bureau of Prison\u2019s withholding of his income for purposes of restitution. We note that Kinsey\u2019s appeal does not concern the merits of his restitution claim and its outcome would not have affected the withholding of payments. In any event, the question is moot because this appeal has been resolved.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
