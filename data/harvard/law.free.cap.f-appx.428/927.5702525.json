Riley further contends his sentence is substantively unreasonable in light of his financial burden, his lack of criminal conduct since his release, and the technical nature of his violations. After review, we affirm Riley\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b952-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>The district court did not commit procedural error in imposing Riley\u2019s sentence. Despite Riley\u2019s claim that the court did not address the \u00a7 8553(a) factors and adequately explain the chosen sentence, the record indicates otherwise. The court considered Riley\u2019s history and characteristics, the need to promote respect for the law, and the need to provide just punishment for Riley\u2019s persistent violation of the terms of his supervised release. The court expressly noted Riley\u2019s previous violations of his supervised release and explained that Riley\u2019s history and attitude were \u201cincompatible\u201d with the successful completion of supervised release. The fact that the district court did not explicitly mention or discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors does not require a different result. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201c[Njothing ... requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Dorman, </em>488 F.3d 936, 944 (11th Cir. 2007) (holding that the defendant\u2019s sentence was procedurally reasonable, \u201cdespite the district court\u2019s failure to expressly articulate that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u201d because the record showed that the court did, in fact, consider a number of the sentencing factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">Riley\u2019s 11-month sentence is substantively reasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court expressly noted Riley\u2019s persistent failure to comply with the conditions of his supervised release and found that a sentence at the top of the advisory Guidelines range was necessary to accomplish the goals of sentencing. It was within the district court\u2019s discretion to weigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, especially in light of Riley\u2019s repeated and numerous violations of his supervised release conditions, and select a sentence at the top of the Guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007) (holding that it is within the district court\u2019s discretion to weigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and \u201c[w]e will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant [statutory] factors.\u201d) (citations omitted). Accordingly, we affirm Riley\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b951-11\">. The district court found that Riley violated numerous terms of his supervised release, including failing to obtain employment, failing to notify his probation officer of his change of residence and opening a new line of credit from T-Mobile without permission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b951-12\">. We generally review a sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006). In conducting this review, we apply a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The Government claims Riley failed to preserve his procedural reasonableness argument by not objecting in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>district court, and thus, we should review only for plain error. We decline to address this issue, as Riley\u2019s procedural reasonableness claim fails under either standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
