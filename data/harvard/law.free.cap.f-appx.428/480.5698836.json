He was sentenced to life imprisonment on the conspiracy count and to a consecutive term of five years of imprisonment on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>firearm count. <em>See United States v. Fisher, </em>22 F.3d 574, 575-76 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">In October 2008, the district court denied Dunkins\u2019s \u201cmotion to unfiled the original application and affidavit for the search warrant\u201d that had been filed in his criminal case in 1991 because it lacked the judicial officer\u2019s signature. On appeal, this court found that this was a meaningless, unauthorized motion with no jurisdictional basis and dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <em>United States v. Dunkins, </em>No. 08-11033 (5th Cir. Dec. 4, 2008) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Dunkins seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) challenging the October 2008 ruling. Because neither the motion to unfiled nor the Rule 60(b) motion was filed in a habeas case, a COA is DENIED AS UNNECESSARY. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A); <em>Ochoa Canales v. Quarterman, </em>507 F.3d 884, 888 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">In addition he moves for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal. The district court denied Dunkins\u2019s IFP motion and certified that his appeal was not taken in good faith because he failed to present a nonfrivolous, arguable issue for appeal. By moving for leave to proceed IFP on appeal, Dunkins is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(5). Dunkins has failed to show that his appeal from the denial of the Rule 60(b) motion involves \u201clegal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, his motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cm. R. 42.2. Dunkins is WARNED that filing further frivolous appeals will subject him to sanctions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b504-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
