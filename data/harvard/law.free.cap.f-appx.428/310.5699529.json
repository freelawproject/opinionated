He argues that his within-Guidelines sentence was substantively unreasonable because there was no actual loss, his offense was unsophisticated, he has no criminal history, and he made a serious effort to pursue his education when criminal charges were pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-21\">This court reviews a sentence for procedural error and for substantive reasonableness. <em>Gall v. United </em>States, 552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). A sentence within the guidelines range is presumed reasonable. <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 360 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Ekwuruke has not rebutted this presumption because he has not shown that the district court failed to account for a sentencing factor that should have been accorded substantial weight, gave substantial weight \u201cto an irrelevant or improper factor,\u201d or made \u201ca clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors.\u201d <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 1930, 176 L.Ed.2d 397 (2010). The Guidelines permit the district court to punish a defendant for intended loss. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.3(A)(ii)). Further, Ekwuruke\u2019s history and characteristics did not require a sentence lower than the sentence the guidelines provide. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 360, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Accordingly, his sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b334-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
