Evans challenges the district court\u2019s refusal to impose a sentence below the minimum sentence under the amended guidelines range, asserting that the district court erred in treating U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, p.s., as binding in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. Evans further argues that the district court violated his constitutional rights by relying on drug quantity and a leadership enhancement in making its resentencing determination and that his constitutional rights were violated when the court imposed sentence based upon an offense involving crack cocaine, a drug not listed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>as a Schedule II controlled substance and not identified in his indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence in certain cases where the sentencing range has been subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009); \u00a7 lB1.10(a), p.s. In those cases, the district court may reduce the sentence after considering the applicable factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and the pertinent guideline policy statements. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence for abuse of discretion and its interpretation of the Guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">Under \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A), \u201cthe court shall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under [] \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range.\u201d As this court previously explained in Evans\u2019s separate appeal from a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) order, \u201cBooker<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> does not alter the mandatory character of Guideline \u00a7 lBl.lO\u2019s limitations on sentence reductions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 670 (quoting <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 238); <em>see Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2687-93, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">Evans\u2019s challenges <em>to the </em>enhancements to his sentence based on the quantity of crack cocaine involved in the offense and his leadership role in the offense and his argument that he should not have been sentenced based on an offense involving crack cocaine are issues related to his initial sentencing proceeding. \u201c[A] \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is not a second opportunity to present mitigating factors to the sentencing judge, nor is it a challenge to the appropriateness of the original sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995). Evans\u2019s arguments pertaining to issues related to his initial sentencing are not cognizable in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 674. Moreover, to the extent that Evans argues that his sentence was enhanced based on facts not found by a jury, \u201cproceedings under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) do not implicate the Sixth Amendment right to have essential facts found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Dillon, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2692.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-15\">Evans has not shown that the district court abused it discretion or erred in interpreting the Guidelines in granting in part and denying in part his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 672. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b383-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
