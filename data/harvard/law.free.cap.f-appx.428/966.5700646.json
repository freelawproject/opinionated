Estevez appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for judgment on the pleadings, or alternatively, motion for summary judgment in an indemnity action against Northern Assurance Company of America (the Insurer). This action arises out of a collision in Biscayne Bay involving a City of Miami (the City) police boat operated by Officer Estevez and a vessel owned by Contender Fishing Team, LLC (Contender). Richard S. Sol, a passenger on the Contender vessel, filed a complaint against the City and others, including Officer Estevez seeking damages for his alleged bodily injuries sustained during the collision. The Insurer refused to defend or indemnify Officer Estevez in Sol\u2019s negligence action.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-15\">The primary issue on appeal is whether the district court erred when it found Officer Estevez was not covered under the protection and indemnity coverage section of the City\u2019s Marina Operators Legal Liability Policy (the Policy).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Officer Estevez contends that a plain reading of the protection and indemnity section of the Policy clearly and unambiguously requires the Insurer to defend and indemnify him for Sol\u2019s personal injury claim because (1) Estevez is an \u201cemployee\u201d of the City, (2) he operated a \u201cwatercraft,\u201d and (3) the operation of the City vessel was \u201cin conjunction with normal business operations.\u201d After careful review, we affirm the district court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b991-16\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Huff v. De</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number><em>Kalb County, Ga., </em>516 F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir.2008). The interpretation of disputed provisions in an insurance contract is a question of law reviewed de novo. <em>James River Ins. Co. v. Ground Down Eng\u2019g, Inc. </em>540 F.3d 1270, 1274 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">\u201c[I]n the absence of a specific and controlling rule, the interpretation or construction of a marine insurance contract is to be determined by state law.\u201d <em>See All Underwriters v. Weisberg, </em>222 F.3d 1309, 1313 (11th Cir.2000). Under Florida law, \u201c[t]he mere failure to provide a definition for a term involving coverage does not necessarily render the term ambiguous.\u201d <em>Jefferson Ins. Co. of New York v. Sea World of Florida, Inc., </em>586 So.2d 95, 97 (Fla. 5th DCA 1991). Further, \u201c[a]n isolated provision of an insurance policy cannot be considered as determinative on the issue of coverage[;] [r]ather, the \u2018insurance contract shall be construed according to the entirety of its terms and conditions as set forth in the policy and as amplified, extended, or modified by any application therefore or any rider or endorsement thereto.\u2019 \u201d <em>AAA Life Insurance Co. v. Nicolas, </em>603 So.2d 622, 623 (Fla. 3d DCA 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">Estevez first argues the phrase \u201cnormal business operations,\u201d which is not defined in the policy, includes any business the City regularly engages in. Under Florida rules of contract construction, Officer Estevez\u2019s reading of this section of the Policy is in error. When we read the entire policy, as amplified by the application,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we conclude that the phrase \u201cnormal business operations\u201d clearly means \u201cmarina operations\u201d and not other operations in which the City may happen to engage. The Policy itself is called \u201cMarina Operators Legal Liability Policy,\u201d and the introduction to the Policy states that the Policy is one for \u201cmarina owners\u201d and covers \u201cmarina operations.\u201d Moreover, the City listed \u201cmunicipal marinas and mooring facility\u201d on its renewal application. Under the principle that specific phrases (marina operations) govern general phrases (business operations), it is clear the phrase \u201cnormal business operations\u201d is limited to normal marina operations. <em>See Pottsburg Utilities, Inc. v. Daugharty, </em>309 So.2d 199, 201 (Fla. 1st DCA 1975) (stating \u201cwhere both general and specific language [is] used in a contract, the specific language will govern where there is a conflict.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b992-9\">Officer Estevez\u2019s claim that the \u201cwatercraft\u201d referred to in the protection and indemnity section encompasses all watercraft owned or operated by the City is equally without merit. First, the declarations pages show that \u201c5 Work Boats\u201d are included under this provision. Further, the City knew that only listed vessels were included in the Policy, as evidenced by its request to add an additional vessel on its most recent renewal. Lastly, the City chose which subsections of protection and indemnity to include in its policy. It could have chosen to cover \u201cother owned boats,\u201d or \u201crental boats,\u201d but instead, the City chose only the \u201cwork boats\u201d and \u201cmarina operators\u201d subsections.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-10\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Officer Estevez\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings, or alternatively, motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b991-12\">. Because we conclude that the Policy in question is unambiguous, we need not reach the issue of whether Officer Estevez automatically wins under the Florida Rule that ambiguous insurance contracts are construed against the insurer. Furthermore, Officer Estevez\u2019s argument that extrinsic evidence is not admissible to resolve ambiguities in an insurance contract is without merit. <em>See Reinman, Inc. v. Preferred Mut. Ins. Co., </em>513 So.2d 788 (Fla. 3d DCA 1987) (holding that \"extrinsic evidence may be introduced to explain [an] ambiguity.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b991-17\"><em>. </em>A panel of this Court has recently decided the issue of whether the protection and indemnity section contained within the Policy provides coverage for the City. <em>See Contender Fishing Team, LLC v. City of Miami, </em>405 Fed.Appx. 422 (11th Cir.2010). The opinion in <em>Contender </em>holding that the Policy did not provide indemnity coverage for the accident in question is consistent with our decision in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b992-6\">. Although Officer Estevez argues the application is separate from the insurance contract, it is clear under Florida law that the document is part of the contract. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.419(1); <em>AAA Life Insurance, </em>603 So.2d at 623.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
