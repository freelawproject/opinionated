Echevarria contends that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel failed to object when the trial judge ordered a juror who had been stricken for cause to sit through Echevarria\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-23\">Echevarria was indicted in state court for first degree murder, attempted first degree murder, felony causing bodily injury, armed burglary, attempted armed burglary, and armed kidnaping. Echevarria proceeded to trial on these counts. After juror questioning, Juror Cendan, who gave no indication that it would be improper for her to sit on the jury, was selected. After the jury was sworn in and outside the presence of the other jurors, Cendan informed the court that she did not \u201cthink that [she would] be fair in this trial\u201d because she did not \u201chave the ability of judging anybody\u201d and thought \u201cthat the guy [was] guilty.\u201d The judge said that he was very close to holding her in contempt for attempting to interfere with the jury selection process and told her: \u201c[Y]ou are on the jury. Please do not discuss it with anyone else. Do not discufss] it with any of the other jurors.\u201d The court further told Cendan, \u201cWhat I need you to do is not discuss this case with anyone. Do not discuss it with any family or friends and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>don\u2019t discuss it with the other jurors.\u201d The court then told her, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s make sure that you are clear.... You are on the jury. If you utter a word about this to any other juror I will lock you up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">After Cendan left the courtroom, the court and the attorneys agreed that she would be dismissed for cause and an alternate juror would replace her. However, the court said that Cendan would be \u201can alternate in spirit\u201d and would be present for the trial \u201cto get an education in our system.\u201d No one objected. A few minutes later, when the jury was brought back into the courtroom, the judge repeatedly told the jury that they could not talk to anyone about the case during the trial, even each other. The judge, emphasizing the point, concluded by telling the jury you \u201cneed to follow that instruction to the letter and not discuss the case with anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AZO\">At the conclusion of the evidence and before the jury retired to deliberate, Cendan was dismissed. Echevarria was convicted all counts, except attempted first degree murder. That resulted in a sentence of life without parole, a sentence of fifteen years imprisonment, and another life sentence, all to run concurrently. His convictions and sentences were upheld on direct appeal and in the state court post-criminal collateral proceedings. Echevarria then filed a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition in the district court, which included the argument that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel failed to move to strike Cendan from the jury. The district court denied his habeas petition but granted his certificate of appealability on the question of whether \u201che was denied effective assistance of counsel for his attorney\u2019s failure to request the removal of a biased juror.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">\u201cWhen examining a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition, we review questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact <em>de novo, </em>and findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>Maharaj v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Com., </em>432 F.3d 1292, 1308 (11th Cir.2005). However, we may not grant habeas relief on claims that were previously adjudicated on the merits in state court unless the adjudication resulted in a decision that \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-10\">To prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, Echevarria must show that (1) his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) the deficiency prejudiced him. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). \u201cThe defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-11\">Echevarria is unable to show that he was prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s failure to object to Cendan being an \u201calternate in spirit.\u201d Not only did the trial court dismiss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>Cendan before juror deliberations and instruct both Cendan and the jurors not to talk with each other beforehand, <em>see Richardson v. Marsh, </em>481 U.S. 200, 206, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 1707, 95 L.Ed.2d 176 (1987) (there is an \u201calmost invariable assumption of the law that jurors follow their instructions\u201d), but Echevarria admits that he cannot show prejudice. Echevarria concedes \u201cthat he cannot identify any specific prejudice\u201d and \u201ccannot say what Ms. Cendan discussed with other members of the jury nor can he demonstrate that she actually tainted the jury.\u201d Accordingly, Echevarria has not shown that the state collateral court\u2019s denial of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b935-6\">. Echevarria also filed a motion to expand the COA to include whether his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to call a witness, Pedro Rodriguez, to testify. The state, in Echevarria\u2019s collateral proceeding, found that his counsel\u2019s decision was tactical or strategic\u2014 his counsel chose not to call Rodriguez because doing so would have resulted in \u201copening the door\u201d to statements \"which, in great detail, implicated [Echevarria].\u201d Because the state court reasonably applied <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), Echevarria cannot make \"a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2253(c)(2), and his motion is therefore DENIED.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
