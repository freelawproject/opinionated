Kim concedes that a \u00a7 7206(1) offense may qualify as an aggravated felony for immigration purposes, but he contends that the Government failed to carry its burden of proving that his \u00a7 7206(1) offense involved a loss of more than $10,000. Our review of the record controverts this assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-21\">The record contains the indictment and judgment for Kim\u2019s offense, which establish that the actual loss was $54,232. Because the indictment charged both Kim and his wife, Kim contends that the government has failed to establish the amount of the loss that is attributable solely to Kim. However, spouses who file a joint tax return, such as Kim and his wife, are jointly and severally liable. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6013(d)(3); <em>Cheshire v. Comm\u2019r of Inter</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number><em>nal Revenue, </em>282 F.3d 326, 331 (5th Cir. 2002). So the entire amount is attributable to Kim. The indictment and judgment constitute \u201creasonable, substantial, and probative evidence\u201d and show that the Government has established Kim\u2019s removability by clear and convincing evidence. <em>See Arguelles-Olivares v. Mukasey, </em>526 F.3d 171, 178 (5th Cir.2008). The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b509-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <em>Has. </em>limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
