Stewart, Louisiana prisoner # 307065, appeals the dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 application as time-barred. Stewart\u2019s application challenged his convictions for armed robbery, attempted second-degree murder, and second degree murder. He contends that his \u00a7 2254 application was timely in light of <em>Jimenez v. Quarterman, </em>555 U.S. 113, 129 S.Ct. 681, 172 L.Ed.2d 475 (2009), and <em>Melancon v. Kaylo, </em>259 F.3d 401 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-21\">A one-year limitations period applies to state prisoners filing federal habeas petitions. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). In most cases, this limitations period runs from the date that the conviction being challenged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>became final through \u201cthe conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\u201d \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). Stewart did not file a direct appeal; however, as a result of his initial state post-conviction relief application, he was granted permission to file an out-of-time appeal. He argues that, in light of <em>Jimenez, </em>his conviction was not final for federal limitations purposes until this out-of-time appeal was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Under <em>Jimenez, </em>when a habeas petitioner is granted the right to file an out-of-time appeal, \u201c \u2018the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review\u2019 must reflect the conclusion of the out-of-time direct appeal, or the expiration of the time for seeking review of that appeal.\u201d <em>Jimenez, </em>555 U.S. at 120-21, 129 S.Ct. at 686-87. However, Respondent asserts that, as a result of the retroactivity rules of <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989), <em>Jimenez </em>does not apply to Stewart\u2019s application. This assertion is incorrect. <em>Teague </em>addressed whether a rule of criminal procedure relating to a petitioner\u2019s underlying trial and conviction should be applied retroactively. <em>See Teague, </em>489 U.S. at 299-316, 109 S.Ct. 1060. In contrast, <em>Jimenez </em>involved the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of a federal statute, \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), which provides a statute of limitations for \u00a7 2254 applications. <em>See Jimenez, </em>129 S.Ct. at 685. In addition, in several unpublished opinions, we have applied <em>Jimenez </em>to cases involving similar facts. <em>See Brooks v. Cain, </em>354 Fed.Appx. 870, 872 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Lemons v. Cain, </em>373 Fed.Appx. 487, 488 (5th Cir.2010). Because Stewart\u2019s conviction was not \u201cfinal\u201d until after the disposition of his out-of-time appeal, the one-year limitations period did not begin to run until September 22, 2005, upon expiration of the 90-day period for seeking a writ of certiorari from the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Stewart also argues that the district court erred in finding that his untimely appeal of his second post-conviction relief application was not \u201cproperly filed\u201d and, thus, that it did not toll the federal limitations period. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2244(d)(2). Relying on <em>Melancon v. Kaylo, </em>259 F.3d 401 (5th Cir.2001), Stewart asserts that, because an exception to the time limit allowed the state appellate court to consider his writ application, and because the state court did consider his writ application on its merits, the writ application was \u201cproperly filed\u201d and tolled the limitations period. <em>See also </em>La. Unif. CtApp. R. 4-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">In <em>Melaneon, </em>we determined that an untimely writ application was nevertheless \u201cproperly filed\u201d for \u00a7 2244(d)(2) purposes because an exception to the time limit allowed the state court to consider the writ application on the merits, and the court did consider it on the merits. <em>Melancon, </em>259 F.3d at 405; <em>accord Grillette v. Warden, </em>372 F.3d 765, 770 n. 5 (5th Cir.2004). In the instant case, the state appellate court did not clearly indicate that it had considered the writ application on its merits; however, we have held that opinions from Louisiana appellate courts \u201croutinely and unmistakably indicate\u201d when a writ application has been denied as untimely. <em>See Grillette, </em>372 F.3d at 775. Therefore, in light of <em>Melancon, </em>Stewart\u2019s writ application was \u201cproperly filed\u201d and tolled the federal limitations period. <em>See Melancon, </em>259 F.3d at 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">Accordingly, Stewart\u2019s conviction was final and the federal limitations period began to run on September 22, 2005. Stewart\u2019s second post-conviction relief application, filed on August 11, 2005, tolled the federal limitations period until January 27, 2006, when he failed to file a timely writ application. Three days of the feder<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>al limitations period ran until January 30, 2006, when his writ application was filed with the state appellate court. <em>See Melancon, </em>259 F.3d at 407. When the Louisiana Supreme Court finally denied Stewart\u2019s post-conviction relief application on February 1, 2008, 362 days of the federal limitations period remained. Therefore, Stewart\u2019s \u00a7 2254 application, which was filed on October 6, 2008, was timely. In view of the foregoing, we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">JUDGMENT VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b513-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
