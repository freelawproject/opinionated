He contends that his within-the-guidelines-range sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-21\">Flores-Figueroa, a citizen of Honduras, illegally entered the United States in the 1990s. On November 7, 2002, he was found guilty of first-degree sexual abuse. Specifically, while babysitting a seven year-old-girl he forced the child to remove her underwear so that he could \u201clook inside [her].\u201d About six months later he was ordered removed from the United States by an Immigration Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-22\">In December 2003 Flores-Figueroa illegally re-entered the United States. On October 27, 2009, he was arrested for falsely imprisoning a female friend. Thereafter he was charged with illegal reentry and the false imprisonment charge was dropped. On March 17, 2010, Flores-Figueroa pleaded guilty to that illegal reentry charge. Under the Sentencing Guidelines Flores-Figueroa had a base offense level of 8 with a 16-level enhancement because he had been previously convicted of a crime of violence. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2L1.2. He also received a 3-level downward adjustment because he accepted responsibility for his crime. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3El.l(b). The resulting recommended guidelines range was 37-46 months imprisonment. The district court, after discussing Flores-Figueroa\u2019s family background, his crime, the guidelines, the \u201crisks to the public\u201d because he sexually abused a child, and the need for detei\u2019rence, sentenced him to 37 months imprisonment \u2014 the very bottom of the guidelines range and well below the statutory maximum of 240 months imprisonment. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). Flores-Figueroa appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">To determine whether a sentence is substantively unreasonable, \u201cwe must, as the Supreme Court has instructed us, consider the totality of the facts and circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189 (11th Cir.2010). \u201c[O]rdinarily we ... expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). We will vacate a sentence for substantive unreasonableness \u201cif, but only if, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1190 (quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe party challenging the sentence bears the burden to show it is unreasonable in light of the record and the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">Here, the totality of the circumstances, including the fact that the sentence was at the bottom of the guidelines range and the fact that Flores-Figueroa had illegally reentered the United States after sexually abusing a seven-year-old girl, does not leave us with the firm conviction that his 37-month sentence was unreasonably long.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
