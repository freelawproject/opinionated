The immigration judge (IJ) denied their requests and ordered them removed to the United Kingdom. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) dismissed their appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">Rayshma, Asim, and Aysha argue that the IJ abused its discretion by denying Rayshma\u2019s application for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l) by ruling that Rayshma had not established that her removal would result in \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D), to her minor children, who are United States citizens.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They argue that the IJ failed to give adequate weight to evidence regarding Rayshma\u2019s medical condition and other factors that establish that Rayshma\u2019s removal would cause her minor children the requisite hardship. \u201cPursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i), this court does not have jurisdiction to review \u2018any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section ... 1229b.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sung v. Keisler, </em>505 F.3d 372, 377 (5th Cir.2007) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i)). While \u201c[tjhis provision is not applicable where the appeal involves constitutional claims or questions of law,\u201d Rayshma, Asim, and Aysha\u2019s \u201ccancellation of removal under \u00a7 1229b(b) does not involve a constitutional claim or a question of law.\u201d <em>See Sung, </em>505 F.3d at 377 (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D)). \u201c[Therefore, this court does not have jurisdiction to review this claim.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, we decline to remand Asim and Aysha\u2019s requests for cancellation of removal as they lack a qualifying relative. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-14\">The three family members also argue that the BIA erred in denying their requests for withholding of removal under \u00a7 1231(b)(3). \u201cIf [an] applicant [for withholding of removal] is determined to have suffered past persecution in the proposed country of removal on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, it shall be presumed that the applicant\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened in the future in the country of removal,\u201d and the Government \u201cshall bear the burden\u201d of rebutting that presumption. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(1). However, where, as here, \u201cthe applicant\u2019s fear of future threat to life or freedom is unrelated to the past persecution,\u201d no such presumption applies, and \u201cthe applicant bears the burden of establishing that it is more likely than not that he or she would suffer such harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>\u00a7 1208.16(b)(1)(iii). Whether an alien has demonstrated eligibility for withholding of removal is a factual determination that we review for substantial evidence. <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Zamora-Morel v. INS, </em>905 F.2d 833, 838 (5th Cir.1990)). Under the substantial evidence standard, \u201creversal is improper unless we decide not only that the evidence supports a contrary conclusion, but also that the evidence compels it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (\u201cthe administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary\u201d). In this case, the BIA found that the three family members failed to show that it was more likely than not that their life or freedom would be threatened by persecution based on their religion, and Rayshma, Asim, and Aysha have failed to show that \u201cany reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AXWU\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b491-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
