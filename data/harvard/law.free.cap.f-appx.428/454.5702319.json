He has moved this court for leave to appeal in forma pauperis and for appointment of counsel as he seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of two motions. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>one motion, Ricks contended that a hung jury in a 2007 mistrial equated to an acquittal and that he was entitled to a nunc pro tunc order of acquittal. In the other motion, Ricks sought a formal written ruling that his motion for acquittal during the 2007 mistrial had been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The motions filed by Ricks in the district court were meaningless, unauthorized, and without any jurisdictional basis. <em>See United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994) (addressing \u201ca meaningless, unauthorized motion\u201d that lacked any jurisdictional basis). Ricks has failed to show that his appeal from the denial of these frivolous motions involves \u201clegal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks omitted). The appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous, and Ricks\u2019s motions are DENIED. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 &amp; n. 24 (5th Cir.1997); 5th Cir. Rule 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b478-32\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
