Pursuant to a written plea agreement, Blancarte pleaded guilty as charged. Three months after the district court accepted his guilty plea, Blancarte moved to withdraw it. Following a hearing, the magistrate judge recommended that the motion be denied. Over Blancarte\u2019s objections, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and denied the motion. The district court sentenced Blancarte within the advisory guidelines range to 169 months of imprisonment, to be followed by five years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea for abuse of discretion. <em>United. States v. McKnight, </em>570 F.3d 641, 645 (5th Cir.2009). Because Blancarte did not seek to withdraw his guilty plea before the district court accepted it, he had no absolute right to withdraw his plea. <em>See United States v. Arami, </em>536 F.3d 479, 483 (5th Cir.2008); Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(d). Before sentencing, a defendant may withdraw his guilty plea that the district court has accepted if \u201cthe defendant can show a fair and just reason for requesting the withdrawal.\u201d Fed. R.CrimP. 11(d)(2)(B). \u201cThe burden of establishing a fair and just reason for withdrawing a guilty plea remains at all times on the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Still, </em>102 F.3d 118, 124 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-14\">In reviewing the denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea, we consider whether (1) the defendant asserted his innocence, (2) withdrawal would prejudice the government, (3) the defendant delayed in filing the withdrawal motion, (4) withdrawal would inconvenience the court, (5) close assistance of counsel was available to the defendant, (6) the plea was knowing and voluntary, and (7) withdrawal would waste judicial resources. <em>United States v. Carr, </em>740 F.2d 339, 343-44 (5th Cir.1984). Because we must consider the totality of the circumstances in applying these factors, <em>id. </em>at 344, \u201c[n]o single factor or combination of factors mandates a particular result,\u201d <em>United States v. Badger, </em>925 F.2d 101, 104 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-15\">Based on the totality of the circumstances, Blancarte failed, both in the court below and in this court, to carry his burden of establishing a fair and just reason for the withdrawal of his guilty plea. <em>See Still, </em>102 F.3d at 124. Our review of the record, Blancarte\u2019s arguments, and the district court\u2019s consideration of the <em>Carr </em>factors shows that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Blancarte\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-16\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b480-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
