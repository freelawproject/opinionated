Campbell, federal prisoner # 30685-048, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition challenging his conviction and 245-month sentence for conspiring to distribute an unspecified amount methamphetamine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C), 846. Campbell argues that the district court erred in determining that he was not entitled to challenge the validity of his conviction and sentence in a \u00a7 2241 proceeding because he did not meet the requirements of the savings clause in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-15\">As a general rule, a federal prisoner who seeks to collaterally challenge the legality of his conviction or sentence must file a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 426-27 (5th Cir.2005). Such claims may be raised in a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) only if the prisoner shows that the \u00a7 2255 remedy is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d \u00a7 2255(e). Campbell has not made the requisite showing. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901-04 (5th Cir.2001). Moreover, to the extent that Campbell alleges that he is actually innocent of being a career offender, this court has held that a claim of actual innocence of a career offender enhancement is not a claim of actual innocence of the crime of conviction and, thus, does not warrant review under \u00a7 2241. <em>Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 213-14 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-16\">As Campbell is not entitled to raise his claims in a \u00a7 2241 petition, his arguments that the district court erred or violated his constitutional rights by failing to address his substantive challenges to his conviction and sentence lack merit. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b407-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A7q\">. Incorporated in Campbell's \u00a7 2241 petition was a request for a writ of coram nobis. Because Campbell is still in custody, the district court did not err in denying that relief. <em>See United States v. Hatten, </em>167 F.3d 884, 887 n. 6 (5th Cir. 1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
