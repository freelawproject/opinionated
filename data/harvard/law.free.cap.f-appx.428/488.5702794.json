At sentencing, the district court applied a 16-level sentence enhancement based on its finding that Rodriguez-Serna\u2019s 2006 Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation was a crime of violence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). The district court de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>termined that the advisory guidelines range was 70 to 87 months and, after denying Rodriguez-Serna\u2019s requests for a downward departure or a variance for his cultural assimilation, imposed a 70-month term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">As the Government concedes, the record indicates that Rodriguez-Serna\u2019s pri- or conviction was under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 30.02(a)(3), which we have held does not meet the generic, contemporary definition of burglary. See <em>United States v. Constante, </em>544 F.3d 584, 586 (5th Cir. 2008). The Government failed to meet its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that Rodriguez-Serna\u2019s prior conviction qualified for the sentencing enhancement. <em>See United States v. Herrera-Solorzano, </em>114 F.3d 48, 50 (5th Cir. 1997). Accordingly, the district court erred in applying the 16-level enhancement for a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">In light of the district court\u2019s misapplication of the Sentencing Guidelines, this court must remand unless the Government establishes that the error is harmless. <em>United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 753 (5th Cir.2009). The Government also concedes that it cannot show that the error was harmless. Therefore, we VACATE Rodriguez-Serna\u2019s sentence and REMAND for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b512-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5 the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
