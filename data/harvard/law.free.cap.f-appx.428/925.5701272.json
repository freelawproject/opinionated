Scott argues the hypothetical questions posed by the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) to the vocational expert (VE) regarding her ability to work failed to address the full extent of her mental impairments or limitations. Specifically, Scott contends the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical failed to include her moderate inability to: maintain attention and concentration for extended periods, complete a normal workday or workweek without interruptions from psychologically based symptoms, and perform at a consistent pace without an unreasonable number and length of rest periods. After review, we affirm the ALJ\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b949-18\">The Social Security regulations establish a five-step, sequential evaluation process to determine disability for both SSI and disability insurance benefits claims. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520, 416.920. The last two steps are relevant to this appeal: whether the claimant has the Residual Functional Capacity (RFC) to perform her past relevant work, and whether, in light of the claimant\u2019s RFC, age, education, and work experience, there are other jobs the claimant can perform. <em>Id. </em>If a claimant proves she can no longer perform her past relevant work, at the final step, \u201cthe burden shifts to the Commissioner to show the existence of other jobs in the national economy which, given the claimant\u2019s impairments, the claimant can perform.\u201d <em>Jones v. Apfel, </em>190 F.3d 1224, 1228 (11th Cir.1999) (quotation omitted). An ALJ may rely solely on the testimony of a VE in determining whether there are other jobs the claimant can perform; however, \u201cthe ALJ must pose a hypothetical question which comprises all of the claimant\u2019s impairments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1229-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-19\">The record here demonstrates that the ALJ posed hypothetical questions which encompassed all of Scott\u2019s impairments. The ALJ asked the VE to assume \u201cmoderate limitations in maintaining eoncen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>tration, persistence, and pace\u201d in addition to the physical limitations discussed in the initial hypothetical. The specific limitations noted in Scott\u2019s argument are a subset of \u201csustained concentration and persistence\u201d concerns in the Mental RFC Assessment. The VE\u2019s testimony constituted substantial evidence that Scott was not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b949-16\">. \"We review the [ALJ's] decision to determine if it is supported by substantial evidence and based on proper legal standards.\u201d <em>Crawford v.
