We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-15\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b394-16\">Spark Networks, Incorporated (\u201cSpark Inc.\u201d) is the parent company of Spark Networks, Limited (\u201cSpark Ltd.\u201d) (collectively \u201cSpark defendants\u201d). Spark Ltd. owns the internet domain name \u201cjdate.com,\u201d and on January 16, 2001, registered the mark \u201cJDate,\u201d namely for \u201cproviding a website for facilitating the introduction of individuals.\u201d ISystems markets its Julian date computation software through the internet using the domain name \u201cjdate.net,\u201d which it purchased on May 21, 2001. It also allows an organization called the Jewish Dating Network to use a sub-domain of its website to provide non-profit matchmaking-related services and dating resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-17\">In 2003 Spark Ltd., through counsel, requested that ISystems transfer to it the domain name \u201cjdate.net,\u201d on the ground that it was likely to cause confusion regarding Spark Ltd.\u2019s registered \u201cJDate\u201d mark and \u201cjdate.com\u201d website. ISystems refused. On May 19, 2008, Spark Ltd. submitted a complaint to the National Arbitration Forum (\u201cNAF\u201d) pursuant to the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>tion Policy (\u201cUDRP\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After considering Spark Ltd.\u2019s Complaint, ISystems\u2019 Response, and the submitted evidence, the arbitrator concluded that (1) the \u201cjdate.net\u201d domain name \u201cis identical to a registered trademark in which [Spark Ltd.] has rights\u201d; (2) \u201cthere is no evidence that [The Jewish Dating Network] business has been operating without knowledge by [ISystems]\u201d; and (3) ISystems \u201chas registered and continues to use the disputed domain name in bad faith.\u201d Pursuant to the arbitrator\u2019s order, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (\u201cICANN\u201d) transferred the \u201cjdate.net\u201d domain name from ISystems to Spark Ltd.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">On July 11, 2008, ISystems filed a complaint against the Spark defendants in federal district court. ISystems alleged that the Spark defendants\u2019 efforts resulting in the transfer of the \u201cjdate.net\u201d domain name violated RICO, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c), and the ACPA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(2)(D)(iv)-(v). The district court granted the Spark defendants\u2019 unopposed motion to dismiss in an order on June 10, 2009, which it vacated upon ISystems\u2019 motion, and re-granted again in a later order. ISystems then filed another motion to vacate the order, and requested leave to amend its Complaint, which the district court granted. Spark defendants then moved to dismiss ISystems\u2019 First Amended Complaint, which the district court granted with prejudice. The district court denied ISystems\u2019 subsequent motion to vacate the judgment and request for leave to amend the First Amended Complaint. ISystems appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">\u201cA district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss is reviewed de novo, using the same standard as the district court.\u201d <em>Davis v. Tarrant County, Tex., </em>565 F.3d 214, 217 (5th Cir.2009). All factual allegations pled in the complaint must be taken as true. <em>Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues &amp; Rights, Ltd., </em>551 U.S. 308, 127 S.Ct. 2499, 168 L.Ed.2d 179 (2007). \u201cWhere a complaint pleads facts that are \u2018merely consistent with\u2019 a defendant\u2019s liability, it \u2018stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 557, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b395-13\">1. ACPA</p>\n<p id=\"b395-14\">ISystems first claims that the Spark defendants abused the NAF procedure to obtain the \u201cjdate.net\u201d domain name, in violation of \u00a7 1114(2)(D)(iv). Section 1114(2)(D)(iv) of the ACPA provides that if a registrar transfers a domain name \u201cbased on a knowing and material misrepresentation by any other person that a domain name is identical to, confusingly similar to, or dilutive of a mark, the person making the knowing and material misrepresentation shall be liable for any dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>ages.\u201d This subsection thus \u201c \u2018protects the rights of domain name registrants against overreaching trademark owners.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sallen v. Corinthians Licenciamentos LTDA, </em>273 F.3d 14, 29 (1st Cir.2001) (quoting H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 106-464, at 117 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">ISystems\u2019 allegations that Spark Ltd. misrepresented that it had a trademark on \u201cJDate,\u201d rather than a service mark, and that it blacked out portions of the \u201cjdate.net\u201d web page images in its submissions to NAF, do not satisfy \u00a7 1114(2)(D)(iv). First, the ACPA does not distinguish between a service mark and a trademark with regard to the issue of dilution. The subsection refers generally to a dilution of a \u201cmark.\u201d The definitions section of the Lanham Act provides that \u201c[t]he term \u2018mark\u2019 includes any trademark [or] service mark.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127. Next, the blacking out of text in the attachments to Spark Ltd.\u2019s NAF complaint does not constitute a misrepresentation, as ISystems does not allege that Spark Ltd. disguised that it selected only some text from the website. ISystems was free to provide NAF a copy of the website without any blacked out text. ISystems thus fails to establish a claim under \u00a7 1114(2)(D)(iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">ISystems also brings a claim requesting \u201c[a]n order pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(2)(D)(v) establishing that Plaintiffs registration of the domain name is not unlawful.\u201d Section 1114(2)(D)(v) of the ACPA \u201cprovide[s] registrants ... with an affirmative cause of action to recover domain names lost in UDRP proceedings.\u201d <em>Sallen, </em>273 F.3d at 27. \u201cA domain name registrant whose domain name has been ... transferred under a policy ... may, upon notice to the mark owner, file a civil action to establish that the registration or use of the domain name by such registrant is not unlawful under this Act.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(2)(D)(v). ISystems alleges that its use of the domain name was not unlawful pursuant to its UDRP. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(2)(D)(ii)(II) (describing action for transferring a domain name \u201cthat is identical to, confusingly similar to, or dilutive of another\u2019s mark\u201d in the implementation of a reasonable policy by a registrar). According to the NAF Decision, the UDRP required the Spark defendants to show three elements: \u201c(1) the domain name registered by the Respondent is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which the Complainant has rights; (2) the Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the domain name; and (3) the domain name has been registered and is being used in bad faith.\u201d ISystems does not dispute the first two elements, but contends that it did not register the domain name in bad faith as it did not intend to and did not profit from any services relating to online dating, the subject of Spark Ltd.\u2019s service mark.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But, this claim alone is insufficient to establish that ISystems did not register or use the mark in bad faith. The fact that its dating service was non-profit does not eliminate the possibility that ISystems earned revenue from the site due to its similarity to \u201cjdate.com.\u201d ISystems\u2019 failure to allege any other facts showing lack of bad faith are fatal to its claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">2. RICO</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">ISystems fails to allege facts that could establish that the Spark defendants violated RICO, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c), by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>seeking and securing the transfer of the jdate.net domain name.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The purpose of RICO is \u201cto protect legitimate enterprises from the influence of organized crime.\u201d 70 A.L.R. Fed. 588, 2a. Section 1962(c) provides that:</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">it shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axy\">enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c). In other words, \u201ca person who is employed by or associated with an enterprise cannot conduct the enterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering.\u201d <em>In re Burzynski, </em>989 F.2d 738, 741 (5th Cir.1993). \u201c[T]o establish liability under \u00a7 1962(e) one must allege and prove the existence of two distinct entities: (1) a \u2018person\u2019; and (2) an \u2018enterprise\u2019 that is not simply the same \u2018person\u2019 referred to by a different name.\u201d <em>Cedric Kushner Promotions, Ltd. v. King, </em>533 U.S. 158, 161, 121 S.Ct. 2087, 150 L.Ed.2d 198 (U.S.2001) (holding employee acting within scope of duty can serve as RICO person and his employer corporation as RICO enterprise).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">ISystems fails to connect Spark Inc., the RICO \u201cperson,\u201d to a distinct RICO \u201centerprise.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> ISystems argues that Spark Ltd., Spark Inc.\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary, is a RICO \u201centerprise\u201d because under <em>Cedric Kushner Promotions, Ltd., </em>a formal separation such as incorporation is a sufficient distinction between the RICO \u201centerprise\u201d and \u201cperson.\u201d 533 U.S. at 163, 121 S.Ct. 2087. <em>Cedric Kushner Promotions, Ltd., </em>involved an employee (the RICO \u201cperson\u201d) illegally conducting the affairs of the corporation (the RICO \u201centerprise\u201d) and specifically did not address other scenarios. <em>See id. </em>(avoiding discussion of a scenario where \u201ca corporation was the \u2018person\u2019 and the corporation, together with all its employees and agents, were the \u2018enterprise\u2019\u201d and noting \u201c[i]t is less natural to speak of a corporation as \u2018employed by\u2019 or \u2018associated with\u2019 this latter oddly constructed entity\u201d). We have since held that in making out a distinction between a RICO \u201cperson\u201d and a RICO \u201centerprise,\u201d \u201c[i]t is not enough to establish that a defendant corporation through its agents committed the predicate acts in the conduct of its own business. That officers or employees of a corporation, in the course of their employment, associate to commit predicate acts does not establish an association-in-fact enterprise distinct from the corporation.\u201d <em>Whelan v. Winchester Prod. Co., </em>319 F.3d 225, 229 (5th Cir.2003). Here, ISystems pled that Spark Inc. controlled Spark Ltd. As in <em>Whelan, </em>ISystems fails to show that the alleged RICO \u201centerprise\u201d exists because it does not allege that Spark Ltd. did anything beyond carrying out the regular business of Spark Inc. \u201c[T]he distinctiveness requirement may not be avoided by alleging a RICO enterprise that consists merely of a corporation defendant associated with its own employees or agents carrying on the regular affairs of the defendants.\u201d <em>Khurana v. Innovative Health Care Sys., </em>130 F.3d 143, 155 (5th Cir.1997), <em>vacated on other grounds, Teel v. Khurana, </em>525 U.S. 979, 119 S.Ct. 442, 142 L.Ed.2d 397 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">Second, ISystems did not allege conduct that constitutes a pattern of raeke<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>teering under RICO.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To establish a pattern of racketeering activity, a plaintiff \u201cmust show that the racketeering predicates are related, and that they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.\u201d <em>H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone, Co., </em>492 U.S. 229, 239, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989). \u201cTo establish continuity, plaintiffs must prove ... either a closed period of repeated conduct, or an open-ended period of conduct that \u2018by its nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition.\u2019 \u201d <em>Word of Faith World, Outreach Ctr. Church v. Sawyer, </em>90 F.3d 118, 122 (5th Cir.1996) (internal citations omitted). \u201c[Wjhere alleged RICO predicate acts are part and parcel of a single, otherwise lawful transaction, a \u2018pattern of racketeering activity\u2019 has not been shown.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 123 (holding there was no pattern of racketeering activity where \u201c[t]he alleged acts were all part of a single, lawful endeavor \u2014 namely the production of television news reports concerning a particular subject\u201d). ISystems argues that over multiple years the Spark defendants have engaged in a continuing pattern of taking over domain names through wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343, mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, obstruction of commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951, and theft and attempted theft in violation Texas Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.01 &amp; 31.03. The alleged fraudulent misrepresentations that Spark Ltd. made to ISystems in demand letters and to NAF in its Arbitration Complaint do not threaten long-term criminal activity, however.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Rather, these incidents constituted part of a single transaction to stop alleged infringement of the \u201cJDate\u201d mark.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Additionally, to the extent that the racketeering claim is based on Spark Ltd.\u2019s demand letters, it must fail. To properly allege a claim under RICO based on fraud, ISystems must allege that it relied on the misrepresentations. <em>See Summit Properties Inc. v. Hoechst Celanese Corp., </em>214 F.3d 556, 562 (5th Cir.2000) (\u201cWhen civil RICO damages are sought for injuries resulting from fraud, a general requirement of reliance by the plaintiff is eommonsense liability limitation.\u201d). Nowhere does the First Amended Complaint allege that ISystems relied on any of the supposed misrepresentations of the Spark defendants or their counsel. Rather, ISystems\u2019 admission in the First Amended Complaint that it was aware of the claimed misrepresentations is fatal to any attempt to allege fraud or RICO.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">3. Denial of Request for Leave to Amend</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">\u201cExcept as authorized by the first sentence of Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a) for one amendment before service of a responsive pleading, a complaint may be amended only by leave of the district court, and, while such leave is to be freely given when justice so requires, the decision is left to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>the sound discretion of the district court and will only be reversed on appeal when that discretion has been abused.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Willard v. Humana Health Plan of Texas Inc., </em>336 F.3d 375, 387 (5th Cir.2003). The Spark defendants argue that ISystems never properly requested leave to amend. \u201cWe generally will not construe unelaborated, nested requests for amendment as motions to amend.\u201d <em>Cent. Laborers\u2019 Pension Fund v. Integrated Elec. Servs., </em>497 F.3d at 556. ISystems did not seek leave to amend its First Amended Complaint until it filed a motion for the district court to vacate its order granting the Spark defendants\u2019 second motion to dismiss. ISystems full request was, \u201cto the extent this Court has dismissed the case because plaintiff did not label specific facts as being cited to specific elements of the law, plaintiff can certainly do so.\u201d Fatal to this request for leave to amend is the fact that the amendments sought were clearly futile and the request was unduly delayed. Though the district court did not explain its reason for denying the request, \u201c[w]hen the reason for the denial is readily apparent [ ] a district court\u2019s failure to explain adequately the basis for its denial is unfortunate but not fatal to affirmance if the record reflects ample and obvious grounds for denying leave to amend.\u201d <em>Cent. Laborers\u2019 Pension Fund, </em>497 F.3d at 556 (quoting <em>Mayeaux v. La. Health Serv. and Indem. Co., </em>376 F.3d 420, 426 (5th Cir.2004) (internal quotation omitted)). \u201cPermissible reasons for denying a motion for leave to amend include \u2018undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, futility of amendment, etc.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id,, </em>(quoting <em>Foman v. Davis, </em>371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (U.S.1962)). As the complaint can be dismissed, for the reasons described above, regardless of ISystem\u2019s failure to connect facts to law, ISystems\u2019 proposed amendments were clearly futile. Moreover, the district court had already granted ISystems leave to amend the complaint once, and ISystems never explained why it had delayed seeking leave to amend the First Amended Complaint until the district court\u2019s grant of the second motion to dismiss. Accordingly, the district court acted within its discretion in denying ISystems leave to amend its First Amended Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b394-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5tii Cir.

We reject ISystems\u2019 argument that the court must treat the Spark defendants\u2019 motion as one for summary judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c) because Spark defendants rely on attachments to their motion to dismiss. ISystems\u2019 claims are in large part based on these documents, and \u201d[d]ocuments that a defendant attaches to a motion to dismiss are considered part of the pleadings if they are referred to in the plaintiff's complaint and are central to her claim.\u201d <em>Collins v.
