California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Hudnall has not filed a response. We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein. Counsel\u2019s brief satisfies the standards set forth in <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011), regarding Hudnall\u2019s sentencing but fails regarding the district court\u2019s compliance with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11. Nevertheless, we concur with counsel\u2019s ultimate assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. As counsel\u2019s brief was filed only shortly after <em>Flores </em>was issued, he may not have had sufficient time to become aware of those standards. Counsel should make certain that any future <em>Anders </em>brief he files fully conforms with <em>Flores.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b379-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
