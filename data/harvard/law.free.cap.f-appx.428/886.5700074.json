Smith argues that the district court erred in granting ICON\u2019S motion for summary judgment because he made out a <em>prima facie </em>case of age discrimination and because he showed that ICON\u2019S articulated reasons for discharging him were a pretext for discrimination. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, applying the same legal standards as the district court.\u201d <em>Chapman v. AI Transport, </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1023 (11th Cir.2000)(en <em>banc). </em>\u201c[S]ummary judgment is appropriate if the evidence before the court shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). In making this determination, we \u201cmake all reasonable inferences in favor of the\u201d nonmoving party. <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201c[W]e may affirm the district court on any ground that appears in the record, whether or not that ground was relied upon or even considered by the court below.\u201d <em>Rowell v. BellSouth Corp., </em>433 F.3d 794, 797-98 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">A plaintiff can establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of age discrimination by showing \u201cthat he (1) was a member of the protected age group, (2) was subject to adverse employment action, (3) was qualified to do the job, and (4) was replaced by a younger individual.\u201d <em>Benson v. Tocco, Inc., </em>113 F.3d 1203, 1207-08 (11th Cir.1997) (citation omitted). However, where the plaintiffs position was eliminated, he can prove a prima facie case</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-11\">(1) by demonstrating that he was in a protected age group and was discharged, (2) by showing that he was qualified for another position at the time of discharge, and (3) by producing circumstantial or direct evidence by which a factfinder might reasonably conclude that the employer intended to discriminate on the basis of age in reaching the decision not to place him in that other position.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b911-12\"><em>Mitchell v. Worldwide Underwriters Ins. Co., </em>967 F.2d 565, 567-68 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-13\">If a plaintiff establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination, and the defendant \u201carticulate[s] a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the\u201d discharge, the plaintiff must produce sufficient evidence, including evidence it proffered to establish its prima facie case, \u201cto permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the reasons given by the employer were not the real reasons for the\u201d discharge. <em>Chapman, </em>229 F.3d at 1024 (quotation omitted). \u201cA plaintiff is not allowed to recast an employer\u2019s proffered nondiscriminatory reasons or substitute his business judgment for that of the employer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1030. Rather, the plaintiff must show \u201csuch weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer\u2019s proffered legitimate reasons ... that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Combs v. Plantation Patterns, </em>106 F.3d 1519, 1538 (11th Cir. 1997) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-14\">Here, Smith did not establish a <em>pri,ma facie </em>case of age discrimination under <em>Benson </em>or under <em>Mitchell. </em>The record shows that Daniel Taylor, the employee Smith alleged replaced him, had distinct job duties from Smith \u2014 specifically, while Smith did have some experience working <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>with an electronic medical records (\u201cEMR\u201d) system, he provided no evidence to dispute the testimony that this experience consisted only of producing desktop shortcuts to the EMR\u2019s website, whereas Taylor\u2019s job, on the other hand, consisted of implementing the EMR, including setting up the Citrix server for the EMR. Therefore, Smith was not \u201creplaced by a younger individual.\u201d <em>Benson, </em>113 F.3d at 1208. Furthermore, Smith was not qualified for an available position at ICON when he was discharged. <em>See Mitchell, </em>967 F.2d at 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">However, assuming arguendo that Smith had established a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination, he still did not show that ICON\u2019S articulated reasons for discharging him \u2014 that he did not have the skills necessary to implement an electronic medical records system and that ICON\u2019S Board of Directors would not approve hiring an additional employee to implement that system \u2014 were pretext for age discrimination. As the record shows, Taylor did not lack the experience ICON claimed was necessary for the EMR position, the evidence supported ICON\u2019S good faith belief that Taylor was in fact more qualified for the EMR position than Smith, and Smith offered no evidence to show how the subsequent hiring of additional employees related to his own discharge. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
