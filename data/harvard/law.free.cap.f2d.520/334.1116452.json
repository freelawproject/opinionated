BROWN, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b394-21\">This case presents once again a pattern we have seen too often recently: arrest by local police, immediate notification of the IRS when drugs and a large amount of cash are found in the possession of the suspect, quick termination of the suspect\u2019s taxable year followed by a jeopardy assessment based on a totally insupportable extrapolation of taxes due from the drugs found, and seizure by the IRS of the cash and valuables then impounded at the police station. This Court has deplored these tactics in earlier opinions <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and has held that the assessment and seizure may be enjoined in the absence of a deficiency notice issued within 60 days after the quick termination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Here the District Court granted a summary judgment for the plaintiff and ordered the return of his seized property. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-22\">Acting on an informant\u2019s tip two detectives of the Metropolitan Dade County Public Safety Department arrested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Charles Kabbaby on July 13, 1973. Approximately one ounce of cocaine^ over $30,000 in cash, and assorted weapons and pieces of jewelry were found in Kabbaby\u2019s car. The IRS was immediately notified of the arrest by the police. Kabbaby\u2019s taxable year of 1973 was terminated under 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6851, the IRS calculated that he owed $66,189.00 for 1973,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and his property was seized. Plaintiff filed suit for return of his cash and other seized items on July 19, 1973. Following an emergency hearing on July 20, the District Court denied Kabbaby\u2019s injunctive relief on the basis that he failed to prove the requirements of <em>Enochs v. Williams Packing and Navigation </em>Co.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For the next 15 months Kabbaby concentrated his efforts on fighting the criminal charges against him'.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Apparently realizing that, following our 1974 opinions in <em>Willits, Clark </em>and <em>Aguilar, </em>their 1973 quick termination assessment against Kabbaby could not be sustained, the IRS abated that assessment one week after Kabbaby again filed on October 29, 1974 a motion for summary judgment and injunctive relief seeking return of his seized property. Not to be defeated by our decisions in <em>Clark-Aguilar </em>the IRS claimed in its \u201csupplemental memorandum in opposition to motion for summary judgment,\u201d filed December 9, 1974, that the seized property was actually an <em>overpayment </em>and therefore to be credited to unsatisfied tax liabilities of other years,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> namely $74,960.74 allegedly due for 1970-72.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">This Court rejects the IRS\u2019 theory that a totally invalid quick termination seizure of Kabbaby\u2019s property based on an \u201cexcessive, arbitrary, capricious\u201d assessment \u201cwithout factual foundation\u201d,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> can by any reasonable definition be considered an overpayment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In the words of the District Court, \u201cthis Court is confident that the ordinary principles of justice and due process [will] not allow the internal revenue service to obtain an advantage by reason of its initial abuse of authority . . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>Although the issue whether a notice of deficiency is necessary to sustain a quick termination and seizure is presently pending before the Supreme Court,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> until such time as that Court may decide that we were wrong in our interpretation of \u00a7 6851, we will not allow the IRS to use its spurious overpayment argument to deny the taxpayer the protection assured by <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Campbell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b394-13\">. <em>Willits v.

IRS Agent Zahurak, the same agent involved in <em>Willits, supra, </em>testified that the $66,189.00 figure was based on an estimated income of $231,600.00. This latter figure was calculated by multiplying the retail value of one ounce of cocaine, $1,200.00, by 193, the number of days from January 1, 1973 until Kabbaby\u2019s arrest July 13. Agent Zahurak admitted that he had no specific evidence that Kabbaby had been selling cocaine for 193 days and that the tax assessment was based solely on this calculation rather than on property owned or past taxes paid.
