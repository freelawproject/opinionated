For the following reasons we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-21\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b203-22\">Jasper Hogan was employed at Anderson Clayton Foods, Inc. from March 1948 to January 1984. On November 1, 1983 the trustees of Anderson\u2019s Hourly Paid Employee Pension Plan purchased five annuity insurance policies from the appellee, Southwestern Life Insurance Company, to fund Hogan\u2019s accrued retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-23\">In both February and March of 1985 Hogan requested that Southwestern allow him to cash in or receive a lump sum pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>ment on the five annuity insurance policies. In March of 1985 Southwestern denied those requests. Hogan then wrote letters to the State Board of Insurance and the Plan Administrator complaining of Southwestern\u2019s denial and of the fact that several co-employees had been allowed to cash in or receive a lump sum payment on their annuity policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">Hogan and his wife sued Southwestern claiming that Hogan was entitled to cash in or receive a lump sum payment on the policies. Specifically, they alleged violations of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001-1461 (ERISA), contending that Southwestern had denied their rights under the terms of the plan and had breached its fiduciary duties. In addition, they asserted various pendent state claims including breach of contract, violation of Tex.Ins.Code art. 21.21, violations of Tex.Bus. &amp; Com.Code ann. \u00a7 17.50 (\u201cDTPA\u201d), breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing, negligence, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Southwestern moved for summary judgment. The district court granted the motion and dismissed the entire cause with prejudice, holding that the ERISA claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations and that the state law claims were preempted by ERISA. The Hogans timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">We review a summary judgment under the same rules that prevail in the district court, that is, \u201cwhether the pleadings, discovery, and affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, such that a moving party, is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In making this assessment we examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-15\">The Hogans insist that their state law claims affect the Pension Plan in only a tenuous or remote manner and are not preempted by ERISA. Further, they claim that the district court erred in determining that their ERISA claims were barred by limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-16\">\u201cERISA applies to any \u2018employee benefit plan\u2019 if that plan is established or maintained by any employer or employee organization engaged in interstate commerce.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> According to section 514(a), the rights, regulations and remedies created by ERISA \u201csupersede any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has adopted a broad construction of section 514(a), holding that \u201cERISA\u2019s civil enforcement remedies were intended to be exclusive\u201d in order to prevent the remedies available to ERISA beneficiaries from being \u201csupplemented or supplanted by varying state laws.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-17\">Accordingly, \u201ca state law \u2018relates to\u2019 a benefit plan, \u2018in the normal sense of the phrase, if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Hogans\u2019 state law claims for breach of contract, violations of Tex.Ins.Code art. 21.21, violations of Tex.Bus. &amp; Com.Code ann. \u00a7 17.50 (\u201cDTPA\u201d), breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing, negligence, and intentional infliction of emotional distress are all based on Southwestern\u2019s refusal to make a lump sum payment of benefits under the employee pension benefit plan. These state law claims are analogous to those raised and found to have been preempted by ERISA in previous decisions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Further, none of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>claims is protected under ERISA's savings clause which exempts from preemption \"any law of any state which regulates insurance, banking, or securities.\" <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, all of the state law claims against Southwestern are preempted under ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"A8Yb\">Next, we consider whether the Hogans' ERISA claims are barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Section 413(a) provides uniform limitations for actions raising a breach of fiduciary duty <footnotemark>9</footnotemark>-six years and three years-keyed respectively to the date the cause of action arose and the date the plaintiff had actual notice. ERISA does not provide a statute of limitations for a section 502(a)(1)(B) claim to enforce plan rights.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We therefore apply the state statute of limitations most analogous to the cause of action raised.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Because the Hogans' claim involves the interpretation of the annuity contract, it is measured against the four year Texas limitations statute governing suits sounding in contract.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AeRf\">The district court determined that the Hogans had actual notice of the alleged breach when the claim for a lump sum payment under the annuity was denied in March 1985. Inasmuch as the instant suit was not filed until August 1989, the court found both ERISA claims time barred. The Hogans contend that a genuine issue of material fact exists about when they had actual knowledge. They also allege fraudulent concealment, therefore insisting that they are entitled to the six year time period provided under section 413(a). Their arguments are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"AVp1\">An ERISA cause of action accrues when a request for benefits is denied.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The summary judgment evidence clearly establishes that the requested lump sum payment was denied in March 1985. The letters of complaint to the State Board of Insurance and to the Plan Administrator further evidence that the Hogans had actual knowledge of the facts giving rise to their causes of action more than four years before they filed suit. Both ERISA claims are time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"Aumu\">Further, we are not persuaded that the Hogans are entitled to the benefits of the six year statute of limitations provided for cases of fraud or concealment. To establish fraudulent concealment a party must show that the alleged wrongdoer had both actual knowledge that a wrong had occurred and a fixed purpose to conceal the wrong from the injured party.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The summary judgment record does not raise a fact issue of fraudulent concealment. The district court was not in error for so deciding.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>Finally, Southwestern &gt; seeks an award of attorney\u2019s fees and expenses incurred on this appeal. ERISA section 502(g), applicable both to trials and appeals,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> provides that \u201cthe court in its discretion\u201d may allow reasonable fees and costs to either party.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In considering the application for fees we apply a five factor test and consider (1) the degree of bad faith or culpability of the losing party; (2) the ability of such party to satisfy an award of fees; (3) whether an award would deter other persons acting under similar circumstances; (4) the amount of benefit to the action as conferred on the members of the plan; and (5) the relative merits of the parties\u2019 positions.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Applying these factors, we conclude that Southwestern is not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees and costs on appeal. There was no showing of bad faith or culpability on the part of the Hogans and no deterrent effect would flow from such an award. Although the Hogans\u2019 cause of action failed, this does not mean that the claim was totally without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b204-8\">. <em>Hansen v.
