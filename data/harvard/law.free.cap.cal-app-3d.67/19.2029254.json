J.</author>\n<p id=\"AI\">Defendant Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc. (Merrill Lynch), a- stock brokerage firm, and its \u201caccount executive,\u201d defendant Jack Smith, had been engaging in interstate securities transactions for the account of a customer, plaintiff Edith Main. At defendant Smith\u2019s suggestion she signed a writing called a \u201cLending Agreement\u201d which permitted Merrill Lynch to make discretionary sales and purchases of securities. The writing contained the following provision: \u201cIt is agreed that any controversy between us [plaintiff and Merrill Lynch] arising out of your business or this agreement, shall be submitted to arbitration conducted under the provisions of the Constitution and Rules of the Board of Governors of the New York Stock Exchange,...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Thereafter plaintiff commenced the instant action against defendants Merrill Lynch and Smith. She alleged, among other things, that pursuant to the writing Merrill Lynch had made improvident purchases and sales for her account, resulting in losses and damages to her totaling $83,750. And she alleged that she was induced to sign the writing as a result of the \u201cfraud\u201d and \u201cundue influence\u201d of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Following service upon them of the complaint, defendants filed a petition in the superior court to compel arbitration. A hearing was held after which the court ordered that \u201cdefendants\u2019 petition to compel arbitration is denied.\u201d Defendants have appealed from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">I. The first contention of defendants is that the Federal Arbitration Act, title 9, sections 1-14, United States Code (Arbitration Act), was applicable to their petition to compel arbitration, \u201cas a matter of federal substantive law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">The Arbitration Act is similar in many respects to the provisions of California\u2019s Code of Civil Procedure, part 3, title 9, entitled \u201cArbitration\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 1280-1294.2). Each contemplates a special proceeding, affording a judicial remedy where a party to an agreement to arbitrate a dispute elects for one reason or another not to do so. Ordinarily it is an original judicial proceeding, but sometimes it will be brought by a party, as was done here, in the course of an existing action. The issue is usually whether there is a <em>valid </em>written agreement to arbitrate. If such an agreement is found to exist, arbitration will be ordered, and if the motion to compel arbitration is made in the course of an existing action the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>action will be stayed. If no valid arbitration agreement is found, the requested relief will be denied and, if a related action on the basic agreement is pending, it will proceed to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">The Arbitration Act is applicable to a \u201cwritten provision in ... a contract evidencing a transaction involving [interstate] commerce . . . .\u201d (See 9 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2.) Plaintiff appears to concede that hers was such a transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">The Arbitration Act provides for a \u201ctrial,\u201d by juiy if requested, of the issue whether a <em>valid </em>agreement to arbitrate the subject dispute is existent (see 9 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4); the issue to be resolved does not concern \u201cthe merits of the controversy as to which arbitration is sought.\u201d <em>(Aberthaw Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Centre County Hospital </em>(M.D. Pa. 1973) 366 F.Supp. 513, 515 [affd. (3d Cir. 1974) 503 F.2d 1398].)  The issue \u201c \u2018should not be determined on affidavits, but rather a full trial should be had.\u2019 \u201d <em>(A/S Custodia </em>v. <em>Lessin International, Inc. </em>(2d Cir. 1974) 503 F.2d 318, 320; <em>El Hoss Engineer. &amp; Transport Co. </em>v. <em>American Ind. Oil Co. </em>(2d Cir. 1961) 289 F.2d 346, 351 [cert.den., 368 U.S. 837 (7 L.Ed.2d 38, 82 S.Ct. 51)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">The Arbitration Act also expressly relates to petitions in \u201cany United States district court . . . .\u201d (See 9 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4.) But it has now been widely held that the act is equally applicable to such proceedings brought in state courts arising out of transactions involving interstate commerce, or admiralty.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">\u201cThe Federal Arbitration Act, declaring arbitration agreement affecting [interstate] commerce or maritime affairs to be valid, enforceable, and irrevocable, is a declaration of national law equally applicable in state or federal courts.\u201d <em>(REA Express </em>v. <em>Missouri Pacific Railroad Company </em>(Tex.Civ.App. 1969) .447 S.W.2d 721, 726; see also <em>Matter of Rederi (Dow Chem.

We are advised of no contrary authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">We find this authority compelling, and hold the Arbitration Act to be applicable to California\u2019s courts in the case of a contract evidencing a transaction involving interstate commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction. The proceedings below, as contended by defendants, were controlled by the Arbitration Act, and its authoritative interpretations.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">II. We construe defendants\u2019 next appellate contention in this manner. They appear to concede that specific allegations and proof of fraud or undue influence in the inducement of an arbitration clause (as distinguished from the inducement of the contract in which it appears) would compel a determination of the clause\u2019s invalidity. But they argue that where as in the instant case, the allegations and proof relate to the inducement of the contract in which the arbitration clause is found, federal law requires that the issue of the contract\u2019s validity be arbitrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">The leading case on the subject is undoubtedly <em>Moseley </em>v. <em>Electronic Facilities </em>(1963) 374 U.S. 167 [10 L.Ed.2d 818, 83 S.Ct. 1815]. Electronic Facilities sought a judicial decree that certain of its subcontracts with Moseley be arbitrated in accordance with provisions of the subcontracts. Moseley responded by attacking \u201cnot only the subcontracts, but also the arbitration clauses contained therein, as having been procured through fraud.\u201d The high court opined: \u201c[I]t seems clear that the issue of fraud should first be adjudicated before the rights of the parties under the subcontracts can be determined. ... If this issue is determined favorably to the petitioner [Moseley], there can be no arbitration under the subcontracts.\u201d (374 U.S., pp. 170-171 [10 L.Ed.2d, pp. 820-821].)</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Another relevant high court decision is found in <em>Prima Paint </em>v. <em>Flood &amp; Conklin </em>(1967) 388 U.S. 395 [18 L.Ed.2d 1270, 87 S.Ct. 1801]. There also, the parties\u2019 agreement contained a clause providing for arbitration of disputes. Prima Paint, in the United States District Court, sought rescission of the agreement \u201con the basis of . . . alleged fraudulent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>inducement.\u201d It alleged only that it had been \u201c \u2018fraudulently induced to accelerate the.execution and closing date of the agreement herein, No contention was made that the arbitration clause had been fraudulently induced. The <em>Prima Paint </em>court held (pp. 403-404 [18 L.Ed.2d, P. 1277]) that \u201cconsistent both with the decision in <em>Moseley </em>v. <em>Electronic Facilities [supra] </em>374 U.S. 167, 171, 172 [83 S.Ct. 1815, 1817, 1818, 10 L.Ed.2d 818] (1963), and with the statutory scheme,\u201d \u201cif the claim is fraud in the inducement of the arbitration clause itself\u2014an issue which goes to the \u2018making\u2019 of the agreement to arbitrate\u2014the federal court may proceed to adjudicate it.\u201d Concluding that the claimed fraud did not affect the arbitration clause, but instead the inducement of the contract generally, i.e., the acceleration of its \u201cexecution and closing date,\u201d the court held that issue subject to arbitration, as had been agreed by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\"><em>Moseley </em>and <em>Prima Paint </em>have been consistently followed by other federal and state courts of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\"><em>Comprehensive Merch. Cat., Inc. </em>v. <em>Madison Sales Corp. </em>(7th Cir. 1975) 521 F.2d 1210, 1213: \u201c[I]f the alleged fraud was part of a grand scheme that permeated the entire contract, including the arbitration provision, the arbitration provision should fall with the rest of the contract. (See <em>Moseley </em>v. <em>Electronic, etc., Facilities, </em>374 U.S. 167, 83 S.Ct. 1815, 10 L.Ed.2d 818; <em>Housekeeper </em>v. <em>Lourie, </em>39 A.D.2d 280, 333 N.Y.S.2d 932, <em>supra.)\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\"><em>Robert Lawrence Co. </em>v. <em>Devonshire Fabrics, Inc., supra, </em>271 F.2d 402, 411: Here the court was considering the Arbitration Act, and whether a contract was subject to arbitration thereunder. It said: \u201c[T]his is not a case . .. where the defendant denied ever agreeing to anything. Naturally such a question had first to be settled before arbitration could be directed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\"><em>Kulukundis Shipping Co. </em>v. <em>Amtorg Trading Corp. </em>(2d Cir. 1942) 126 F.2d 978, 986: \u201cThe Arbitration Act does not cover an arbitration agreement sufficiently broad to include a controversy as to the existence of the very contract which embodies the arbitration agreement. Section 2 of the Act . . . includes a \u2018provision in ... a contract evidencing a transaction ... to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction . . . .\u2019 Plainly such a provision does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>include a provision in a contract to arbitrate the issue whether the minds of the parties ever met so as to bring about the veiy contract of which that arbitration clause is a part; ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\"><em>Matter of Weinrott (Carp) </em>(1973) 32 N.Y.2d 190, 197 [344 N.Y.S.2d 848, 298 N.E.2d 42]: \u201cOf course, if the alleged fraud was part of a grand scheme that permeated the entire contract, including the arbitration provision, the arbitration provision should fall with the rest of the contract. (See <em>Moseley </em>v. <em>Electronics Facilities, </em>374 U.S. 167 [83 S.Ct. 1815, 10 L.Ed.2d 818]; <em>Housekeeper </em>v. <em>Lourie, </em>39 A.D.2d 280, <em>supra </em>[333 N.Y.S.2d 932].)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\"><em>Housekeeper </em>v. <em>Lourie </em>(1972) 39 App.Div.2d 280 [333 N.Y.S.2d 932, 937-938]: \u201c[I]t is clear that even fraud in the procurement of an arbitration contract itself, \u2018like fraud in the procurement of any contract, makes it void and unenforceable and that this question of fraud is a judicial one, which must be determined by a court. To allow this question to be decided by arbitrators would be to that extent to enforce the arbitration agreement even though steeped in the grossest kind of fraud\u2019 (Moseley v. Electronic &amp; Missile Facilities (concurring op. of Black, J.), 374 U.S. 167, 172, 83 S.Ct. 1815, 1818, 10 L.Ed.2d 818). [1] In the present case, the petitioners\u2019 allegations show fraud permeating the entire agreement of April 1, 1970. ... If the allegations of the petitioners are true, then the entire agreement, including the provisions for arbitration, should be avoided as constituting a fraudulent breach of the fiduciary relationship between an attorney and his clients.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">From all of the foregoing authority it becomes manifest that where it is alleged that fraud either induced the arbitration clause itself, or permeated the entire agreement including the arbitration clause, that issue will be determined judicially and not by arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">III. We now consider whether or not plaintiff had alleged in the superior court that the claimed \u201cfraud was part of a grand scheme that permeated the entire contract, including the arbitration provision\u201d (see <em>Comprehensive Merch. Cat., Inc. </em>v. <em>Madison Sales Corp., supra, </em>521 F.2d 1210, 1213), or that the basic contract \u201cas well as the arbitration agreement [was] fraudulent\u201d (see <em>Moseley </em>v. <em>Electronic Facilities, supra, </em>374 U.S. 167, 169 [10 L.Ed.2d 818, 820]), or that she had never \u201cagreed to anything\u201d (see <em>Robert Lawrence Co. </em>v. <em>Devonshire Fabrics, Inc., supra, </em>271 F.2d 402, 411). If such allegations are to be found, then the decision of the superior court must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Preliminarily, we comment upon the procedure followed by the parties at the superior court hearing. We observe that defendants invoked the procedures for enforcement of arbitration agreements provided for in California\u2019s Code of Civil Procedure. (\u00a7\u00a7 1281.2, 1290 et seq.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pursuant to such procedure defendants filed a petition to compel arbitration. This petition alleged, in substance, that plaintiff entered in an agreement with defendant Merrill Lynch which, inter alia, provided for the arbitration of any controversy arising out of plaintiff\u2019s business or said agreement; a controversy has arisen under said agreement; that defendants are ready and willing to submit said controversy to arbitration pursuant to the terms of said agreement; and that plaintiff refuses and still refuses to submit the controversy to arbitration. Plaintiff did not file a response to the petition and therefore is deemed to have admitted the allegations of the petition. (\u00a7 1290.) Plaintiff, however, filed a declaration in opposition to the petition to compel arbitration. That declaration substantially restated the allegations of plaintiff\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">The hearing of defendants\u2019 petition to compel arbitration was duly noticed (see \u00a7 1290.4) and the petition came on for hearing. Section 1290.2 provides that such hearing shall be held in a summary way \u201cin the manner and upon the notice provided by law for the making and hearing of motions,...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">It is apparent from the record below that the only issue tendered by the parti\u00e9s was a question of law, i.e., whether the allegations of the complaint raised the issue that fraud either induced the arbitration clause itself or permeated the entire agreement, including the arbitration clause, so as to require that the issue be determined judicially. The filing by plaintiff of a declaration did not tender an issue of fact because such a declaration was not required in view of the limited legal issue the court was called upon to determine.  In any event, the allegations of the declaration which were a reiteration of the complaint were not controverted and the truth of its allegations must be deemed admitted for the purpose of determining the legal issue before the court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b51-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>That the court below purported to determine only the legal issue above delineated is clear from its \u201cFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.\u201d The court was apparently under the impression that it was required to make findings because section 1291 appears to require that findings be made.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n                   Such findings and conclusions were not required in the instant case because the court was not called upon to determine factual issues but only a question of law. (See <em>Estate of Kearns, </em>129 Cal.App.2d 832, 835 [278 P.2d 85]; <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners, </em>98 Cal.App. 267, 268 [276 P. 1119].) In any event what the court denominated \u201cfindings of fact\u201d are not findings but conclusions of law to the effect that plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleges facts which, if true, would sustain a finding by a trier of fact that the arbitration clause was induced by fraud, undue influence and mistake. The \u201cFindings of Fact\u201d specifically state that the complaint alleges facts sufficient to raise the issues of fraud, undue influence, and mistake in the inducement of the arbitration agreement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>We advert to the allegations of the complaint. They may reasonably be summarized as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Plaintiff Edith Main was the conservator of her invalid husband\u2019s estate. Needing funds for living expenses she sold some stock through defendant Merrill Lynch. In the course of the transaction she met defendant Jack Smith, an \u201caccount executive\u201d of Merrill Lynch. Jack Smith \u201crepresented to plaintiff that defendants, and each of them, could handle the financial affairs of the conservatorship and could provide her with proper investment counsel [mc] and advice . . . .\u201d Plaintiff was impressed with \u201cdefendant Smith\u2019s sincerity and apparent expertise,...\u201d Thereupon, \u201ca most confidential relationship existed between the plaintiff and defendants and each of them. Plaintiff reposed the greatest confidence and trust in said defendants and consulted with defendants in her business affairs and believed that defendants would deal fairly and justly with plaintiff in all things. Plaintiff felt secure in seeking advice from and entrusting her business affairs to defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">During the course of this relationship \u201cdefendant Merrill Lynch, by and through defendant Smith, placed a lending agreement before plaintiff for her signature. Plaintiff was aged and unschooled in business affairs and did not know the true nature or content of the documents set before her. Although defendants knew of plaintiff\u2019s ignorance, nevertheless defendants induced plaintiff to sign the documents by misrepresenting the nature and content thereof to plaintiff. Defendants did not advise plaintiff that, by placing her signature on the document set before her and by placing the stock abovementioned in \u2018street name\u2019 with defendant, [they] could use said stocks as collateral for purchases of additional securities on margin. Further, defendants did not advise plaintiff that fine print \u2018boiler plate\u2019 provisions on the reverse side of the document purported to require submission of all controversies to arbitration. [1\u00cd]. .. Due to the confidential relationship above-mentioned, plaintiff was accustomed to signing documents at the request of defendants and had plaintiff known the true nature and content of the document set before her for her signature she would never have signed said document. . . .\u201d Plaintiff \u201cbelieved only that she was signing a document which effectuated the opening of the account with Merrill Lynch. . . . Plaintiff did not understand the intended effect of this fine print [requiring submission of all controversies to arbitration], and never agreed to submit all controversies to arbitration.\u201d It also appears that the \u201cLending Agreement\u201d was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>signed by plaintiff, during the course of a confidential, or fiduciary, or trust relationship with defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">Further observations are proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">A confidential relationship \u201cmay be said to exist whenever trust and confidence is reposed by one person in the integrity and fidelity of another.\u201d <em>(Estate of Cover </em>(1922) 188 Cal. 133, 143 [204 P. 583]; <em>O\u2019Neil </em>v. <em>Spillane </em>(1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 147, 153 [119 Cal.Rptr. 245]; <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Marco </em>(1956) 147 Cal.App.2d 357, 372 [305 P.2d 669].) And where the person in whom such confidence is reposed, by such confidence obtains any control over the affairs of the other, a trust or fiduciary relationship is created. (See Civ. Code, \u00a7 2219; <em>Vai </em>v. <em>Bank of America </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 329, 338 [15 Cal.Rptr. 71, 364 P.2d 247]; <em>Twomey </em>v. <em>Mitchum, Jones &amp; Templeton, Inc. </em>(1968) 262 Cal.App.2d 690, 708 [69 Cal.Rptr. 222]; <em>Sime </em>v.

(See <em>Wilko </em>v. <em>Swan </em>(1953) 346 U.S. 427, 438 [98 L.Ed. 168, 177, 74 S.Ct. 182]; <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Grand Trunk W. R. Co. </em>(1949) 338 U.S. 263, 266 [94 L.Ed. 55, 58, 70 S.Ct. 26].)
