J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZT\">Motion to dismiss appeal by respondents Bushnell et al.,. homeowners in a condemnation case. Appellant is the City of Los Angeles.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-13\">In June 1976, a judgment in condemnation was entered and after their motion for a new trial was denied, homeowners filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment in September 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-14\">Meantime, in June, homeowners filed a memorandum of costs and disbursements. The city moved to tax costs. Homeowners moved for an award of litigation costs under Code of Civil Procedure, section 1250.410.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>On August 13, 1976, after argument, the trial court granted, in part, homeowners\u2019 motion for award of litigation costs, and\u2014also in part-granted the city\u2019s motion to tax costs. The court allowed total costs in the amount of $75,099.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">October 7, 1976, the city filed a notice of appeal which reads as follows: \u201cPlaintiff and Cross-Defendant. . . hereby appeals .. . from the Judgment In Condemnation After Trial entered in said Superior Court on June 16, 1976, in Book 7137, Page 184, to the extent said Judgment awarded Defendants and Cross-Complainants attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount of $50,000.00 and appraiser\u2019s fees in the amount of $25,000.00 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section [1250.410].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Homeowners now move to dismiss the city\u2019s appeal on the theory that California Rules of Court, rule 3(c), provides that a notice of cross-appeal must be filed within 20 days after notice of an appeal is mailed, that the clerk notified the city of homeowners\u2019 appeal on September 15, and that therefore the city\u2019s notice of appeal was two days late.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">There is no merit to homeowner\u2019s position. Rule 3(c) has nothing to do with this case. An order determining costs is separately appealable as an order after judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 904.1, subd. (b); 6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Appeal, \u00a7 83, p. 4094; 4 Cal.Jur.3d, Appellate Review, \u00a7 56, p. 96.) The city\u2019s appeal was filed well within 60 days from August 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">Homeowners\u2019 rejoinder is that the notice of appeal, although specifying that the city appeals \u201cto the extent said Judgment awarded . . . attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount of $50,000.00 and appraiser\u2019s fees in the amount of $25,000.00,\u201d refers to the judgment entered on June 16, rather than the August 13 order after judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">The award under section 1250.410 of the Code of Civil Procedure is expressly part of \u201cthe costs allowed.\u201d Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, section 1033, the amounts were inserted \u201cin a blank left in the judgment for that purpose, ...\u201d  The rule is well-established that an incorrectly framed notice of appeal will be construed to refer to the correct appealable order assuming that the intention of the appellant is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>clear. (See Witkin, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 335, 336, pp. 4312-4315.) We have no problem ascertaining the city\u2019s intention; neither, we are sure, do homeowners.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Ashby, J., and Hastings, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
