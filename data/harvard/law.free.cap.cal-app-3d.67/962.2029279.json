The weapon was seized and Moreno was arrested. In the municipal court, where he was charged as a misdemeanant, he unsuccessfully moved under Penal Code section 1538.5 to suppress the use of the weapon as evidence. He, as permitted by Penal Code section 1538.5, subdivision (j), appealed from the order denying his motion to the appellate department of the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-10\">The issue raised on the appeal was the constitutional propriety of the police officer\u2019s detention of Moreno. The lower reviewing court thereafter, under rule 63, California Rules of Court, made the following certification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>\u201cThe Appellate Department of the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Alameda, hereby grants the People\u2019s application and certifies that transfer of this case to the Court of Appeal of the State of California for the First Appellate District is necessaiy to secure uniformity of decision regarding the continuing vitality of the standard found in <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>1 Cal.3d 423 at 427: \u2018Where the events are as consistent with innocent activity as with criminal activity, a detention based on these events is unlawful.\u2019 Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Acosta) 20 </em>Cal.App.3d 1085, 1091 (1971); <em>People </em>v. <em>Higbee, </em>37 Cal.App.3d 944, 950 (1974); <em>People </em>v. <em>Rios, </em>51 Cal.App.3d 1008, 1011 (1975) and <em>People </em>v. <em>Larkin, </em>52 Cal.App.3d 346, 349 (1975), with <em>People </em>v. <em>Lathan, </em>38 Cal.App.3d 911, 914 (1974) and <em>People </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>43 Cal.App.3d 898, 902-903 (1974).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-4\">We ordered the appeal transferred to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\"><em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 423 [82 Cal.Rptr. 484, 462 P.2d 12], dealt with the constitutional limitations on the right of a police officer to temporarily detain a person for the purpose of questioning, or other criminal investigation. The court applied the widely known applicable rule, as follows: \u201c[A] detention based on a \u2018mere hunch\u2019 is unlawful. . . even though the officer may have acted in good faith .... There must be a \u2018rational\u2019 suspicion by the peace officer that some activity out of the ordinary is or has taken place . . . some indication to connect the person under suspicion with the unusual activity. . . . [and] some suggestion that the activity is related to crime.\u201d (1 Cal.3d, p. 427.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>But the court then used the language here presented for our consideration: \u201cWhere the events are as consistent with innocent activity as with criminal activity, a detention based on those events is unlawful.\u201d (1 Cal.3d, p. 427.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">At this point we briefly consider the constitutional requirements of <em>probable cause for the warrantless arrest </em>of a person suspected of criminal activity.  Such probable cause exists when the facts apparent to the officer \u201c \u2018would lead a man of ordinary care and prudence to believe and conscientiously entertain an honest and strong suspicion that the person is guilty of a crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harris, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 384, 389; <em>People </em>v. <em>Terry </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 362, 393 [85 Cal.Rptr. 409, 466 P.2d 961] [cert, dism., 406 U.S. 912 (32 L.Ed.2d 112, 92 S.Ct. 1619)]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ingle </em>(1960) 53 Cal.2d 407, 412 [2 Cal.Rptr. 14, 348 P.2d 577] [cert, den., 364 U.S. 841 (5 L.Ed.2d 65, 81 S.Ct. 79)].) And probable cause for a warrantless arrest \u201chas also been defined as having more evidence for than, against; . ..\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ingle, supra, </em>p. 413; <em>People </em>v. <em>Moore </em>(1975) 51 Cal.App.3d 610, 616 [124 Cal.Rptr. 290] [hg. by Supreme Ct. den.; cert, den., 425 U.S. 977 (48 L.Ed.2d 801,96 S.Ct. 2179)]; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1971) 21 Cal.App.3d 308, 316 [98 Cal.Rptr. 525]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Thomas) </em>(1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 203, 208 [88 Cal.Rptr. 21].)</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">Analysis of <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Superior Court's </em>two concepts reveals opposing principles. The first permits otherwise reasonable investigative detention, upon a <em>rational suspicion of criminal activity, </em>while the second demands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>as a requisite for a police officer\u2019s detention that there be a <em>preponderant appearance of criminal activity.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\">It will be seen that the additional requirement of <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>authorizes temporary police investigative detention of a person only under circumstances that would create probable cause for the person\u2019s arrest. For by any test of law or logic, if the facts apparent to the policeman amount to a preponderant appearance of criminal activity, then surely probable cause for arrest must exist. Indeed, <em>People </em>v. <em>Ingle's </em>above-quoted definition of probable cause for an arrest, i.e., \u201chaving more evidence for than against\u201d (53 Cal.2d, p. 413) is a strikingly accurate paraphrasing of <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Superior Court's </em>added investigative detention requirement of \u201cpreponderant appearance of criminal activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Yet it is a truism of our criminal law practice \u201cthat circumstances short of probable cause to make an arrest may still justify an officer\u2019s stopping pedestrians or motorists on the streets for questioning.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mickelson, supra, </em>59 Cal.2d 448, 450.) And the justification \u201cwhich warrants an officer\u2019s detention of a person\" for investigative reasons is necessarily of a lesser standard than that required to effect an arrest.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Flores, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d 85, 91; and to the same effect see <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra, </em>392 U.S. 1, 22 [20 L.Ed.2d 889, 906-907]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris, supra, 15 </em>Cal.3d 384, 389; <em>People </em>v. <em>Junious, supra, </em>30 Cal.App.3d 432, 436; <em>People </em>v. <em>Griffith </em>(1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 948, 950 [97 Cal.Rptr. 367].)</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">We are of the opinion that <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>did not intend a drastic change in the law such as would deny a police officer\u2019s right to temporarily detain a person for investigation, unless he had information sufficient to authorize the person\u2019s arrest. Had such been the intent we may be sure that the court would in some manner have expressed its disapproval of what then, as it appears to us, was unanimous state and federal authority to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">Further, we opine that the \u201cpreponderant appearance of criminal activity\u201d criterion of <em>Irwih </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>is a dictum. The court had expressly concluded that the police officer\u2019s detention of that case rested upon a \u201cmere hunch\u201d without \u201crational suspicion\u201d and was thus, under the prevailing rule, unlawful. The case\u2019s newly announced \u201cpreponderant appearance of criminal activity\u201d test was not necessary to the decision.  The state\u2019s high court has consistently advised lower tribunals that its \u201cIncidental statements or conclusions not necessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>the decision are not to be regarded as authority\u201d <em>(Simmons </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1959) 52 Cal.2d 373, 378 [341 P.2d 13]), and that the \u201cdiscussion or determination of a point not necessary to the disposition of a question that is decisive of the appeal is generally regarded as obiter dictum\u201d <em>(Stockton Theatres, Inc. </em>v. <em>Palermo </em>(1956) 47 Cal.2d 469, 474 [304 P.2d 7]; see also <em>Kastigar </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1972) 406 U.S. 441, 454-455 [32 L.Ed.2d 212, 222-223, 92 S.Ct. 1653]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Clark </em>(1941) 18 Cal.2d 449, 461 [116 P.2d 56]; <em>County of San Diego </em>v. <em>Hammond </em>(1936) 6 Cal.2d 709, 724 [59 P.2d 478, 105 A.L.R. 1155]; <em>Hills </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1929) 207 Cal. 666, 670 [279 P. 805, 65 A.L.R. 266]).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">Moreover, we observe that the state\u2019s Supreme Court has several times recently restated the law applicable to investigative police detention. Without approval, or even mention, of <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Superior Court\u2019s </em>added concept of \u201cpreponderant appearance of criminal activity,\u201d it has reiterated the long-accepted first rule of that case in this manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Gale, supra, 9 </em>Cal.3d 788, 797-798. \u201c \u2018While a detention of a citizen by a police officer based on a \u201cmere hunch\u201d is unlawful, if there is a rational <em>suspicion </em>that some activity out of the ordinary is taking place, and some <em>suggestion </em>that the activity is related to crime, d detention is permissible.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Flores, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d 85, 91. \u201cWhere there is a rational belief of criminal activity with which the suspect is connected, a detention for reasonable investigative procedures infringes no constitutional restraint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Harris, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 384, 388-389. \u201c \u2018[A] police officer may stop and question persons on public streets . . . when the circumstances indicate to a reasonable man in a like position that such a course of action is called for in the proper discharge of the officer\u2019s duties.. .. The good faith suspicion which warrants an officer\u2019s detention of a person for investigative reasons is necessarily of a lesser standard than that required to effect an arrest. . .. Where there is a rational belief of criminal activity with which the suspect is connected, a detention for reasonable investigative procedures infringes no constitutional restraint [II] The foregoing standard for <em>detention </em>is of lesser degree than that applicable to an <em>arrest. . . . </em>[The court then found that the detention of that case had met] the requisite but lesser detention standards of \u2018good faith suspicion,\u2019 and \u2018rational belief of criminal activity\u2019 expressed by us in <em>Flores </em>[12 Cal.3d, p. 91].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b861-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>The latter language of <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>is significant. We deem the high court\u2019s reiteration of \u201cthe requisite but lesser standards [for investigative police detention] of \u2018good faith suspicion,\u2019 and \u2018rational belief of criminal activity,\u2019 \u201d unqualified by <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Superior Court\u2019s </em>inconsistent earlier dictum of \u201cpreponderant appearance of criminal activity,\u201d to be the law of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\">\u201cIt is an established rule of law that a later decision overrules prior decisions which conflict with it, whether such prior decisions are mentioned and commented upon or not.\u201d <em>(In re Lane </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 99, 105 [22 Cal.Rptr. 857, 372 P.2d 897]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Escarcega </em>(1974) 43 Cal.App.3d 391, 400 [117 Cal.Rptr. 595]; and see 6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Appeal, \u00a7 692(2), p. 4609, and the authority there collected.)</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">We observe also that decisions of the state\u2019s Court of Appeal have several times <em>expressly </em>held that <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Superior Courts </em>test of preponderant appearance of criminal activity, as justification for temporary police investigative detention, is not the law of this state. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Knutson, supra, </em>60 Cal.App.3d 856, 862; <em>People </em>v. <em>Larkin, supra, </em>52 Cal.App.3d 346, 349; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rios, supra, </em>51 Cal.App.3d 1008, 1011; <em>People </em>v. <em>Higbee, supra, </em>37 Cal.App.3d 944, 950; <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Acosta), supra, </em>20 Cal.App.3d 1085, 1088-1091.)</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">Answering the question posed by the appellate department of the superior court, we hold that the language of <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Superior </em>Court\u2014 \u201cWhere the events are as consistent with innocent activity as with criminal activity, a detention based on those events is unlawful\u201d\u2014has no \u201ccontinuing vitality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">We consider now the \u201cengrossed statement\u201d of the facts on the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">\u201cOfficer Olson, while on a routine patrol in a marked police car in Newark on Sunday, January 11, 1976, at about 7:05 PM, observed defendant\u2019s vehicle, a 1964 Chevrolet Station Wagon, traveling northbound on Willow Street at the intersection of Enterprise Drive. One and one half blocks south on Willow Street the city street ends. Beyond is a privately maintained dirt road which leads to the Newark Sportman\u2019s Club about one mile away. Surrounding the Sportman\u2019s Club are undeveloped salt flats owned by the Leslie Salt Company. The area of Enterprise Drive and Willow is commercial with no retail businesses. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>January 11, 1976, at 7:00 PM none of the businesses were open. Officer Olson has patrolled this part of Newark for four and one half years and is familiar with the prevalent criminal activity, which is theft and burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">\u201cOn January 11, 1976, Officer Olson was aware of one theft at a nearby business within the preceding year, as well as five separate instances of burglary at the Sportsman\u2019s Club within the preceding year.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">\u201cOfficer Olson testified that the only moving or inhabited vehicle he observed in the area was the one defendant was driving. Defendant was the only occupant of the vehicle. Officer Olson testified he intended to stop the defendant because it was unusual for a moving car to be in that area at that time of night. Because of the burglaries in the area, Officer Olson wanted to find out why defendant was there. Upon pulling in behind defendant\u2019s vehicle, Officer Olson observed that defendant\u2019s vehicle had no outside rear-view mirror. After' stopping defendant\u2019s vehicle, the defendant voluntarily exited and walked back toward Officer Olson\u2019s location. Officer Olson immediately requested defendant\u2019s drivers license and vehicle registration at this time and returned to his car in order to obtain the vehicle registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">\u201cOfficer Olson accompanied defendant and when the defendant opened the driver\u2019s door Officer Olson observed a two foot long wooden billy club in plain view on the floorboard in front of the drivers seat. Officer Olson retrieved the billy club and arrested defendant for section 12020 of the Penal Code of California.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">\u201cAt the conclusion of the hearing the [Municipal] Court made a finding that a car being in that particular area on a dead-end street having past burglaries and no open businesses was such a suspicious circumstance as justified the police officer in investigating.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">We opine, as apparently did the municipal court, that the facts apparent to the officer did not meet <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Superior Court\u2019s </em>test (1 Cal.3d, p. 427) of \u201cpreponderant appearance of criminal activity,\u201d but that they nevertheless engendered a \u201c \u2018rational belief [or suspicion] of criminal activity\u2019 \u201d according to <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 384, 389, <em>People </em>v. <em>Flores, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d 85, 91, and <em>People </em>v. <em>Gale, supra, </em>9 Cal.3d 788, 797-798. For the reasons we have pointed out, Moreno\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>detention was without constitutional fault, and his motion to suppress evidence, which depended upon the invalidity of that detention, was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\">The order of the municipal court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Molinari, P. J., and Sims, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied April 1, 1977, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied May 5, 1977. Bird, C. J., and Mosk, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b857-6\">This \u201crational suspicion of criminal activity\u201d test has been announced and applied in a long line of antecedent, and subsequent, state and federal authority.

It is notable that <em>People </em>v. <em>Triggs, supra, </em>and <em>Remers </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>quoted <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Superior Court's </em>\u201cpreponderant appearance of criminal activity\u201d test in the context, not of detention, but of probable cause for an arrest and search.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
