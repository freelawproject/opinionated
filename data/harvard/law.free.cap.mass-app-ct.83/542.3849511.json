We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\"><em>Background. </em>Because the mother does not challenge the judge\u2019s findings, including the ultimate finding of her parental unfitness, we provide only the necessary background. On November 14, 2008, and June 30, 2010, the Department of Children and Families (department) filed petitions alleging that Norbert and Monica were in need of care and protection. After six nonconsecutive days of trial and consideration of numerous exhibits and reports, the judge issued decrees that permanently committed the children to the custody of the department and terminated the mother\u2019s parental rights. The judge, in his findings of fact and conclusions of law, all of which were amply supported by the evidence, found that the mother suffered from chronic untreated mental health issues and lacked insight into her parenting deficiencies. During the time the children were in the mother\u2019s custody, they were frequently exposed to domestic violence. In addition, the mother often acted inappropriately. For example, on at least one occasion, the mother invited a stranger whom she met on a telephone date line into her home for a sexual encounter while the children were present. Furthermore, the mother missed numerous visits with her children when they were in the custody of the department. At one point, she did not see Norbert for eight months. She was not receptive to the services offered by the department and often refused to work with the social workers assigned to her case. The judge did not order postadoption visitation because, as he stated, \u201c[n]o evidence exists that the children enjoy visiting with the mother or receive any benefit from contact with her.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\"><em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Recusal. </em>The mother argues that the judge erred by not recusing himself from presiding over the trial on the department\u2019s care and protection petitions. Her claim is based on comments the judge made during a status hearing on September 16, 2009. At that time, the department had removed Norbert from the mother\u2019s custody, but had not initiated proceedings to remove Monica, who was four months old. The judge expressed frustration over the fact that the department was seeking to remove one child but not the other. The judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>pointedly reminded the department of its obligations and went on to voice his opinion that the department\u2019s position was \u201cbeyond comprehension.\u201d At the conclusion of the hearing, the judge filed a report under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51A (\u00a7 51A report), against the department based on the fact that \u201cthe department\u2019s clinical approach to the case is confusing.\u201d The department subsequently removed Monica from her mother\u2019s care, but she was returned soon thereafter. Within a few months, however, another \u00a7 51A report was filed and the department regained custody.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The children were never returned to the mother after that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The mother argues that it was inappropriate for the judge to preside over the trial after having initiated the filing of a \u00a7 51A report based on the department\u2019s handling of its investigation of her care of her children. However, the mother did not file a motion requesting that the judge recuse himself. The children\u2019s father, whose parental rights were terminated following a separate trial before the same judge, did file a motion seeking recusal, which was denied. The mother asserts that she joined the father\u2019s motion, but there is nothing in the record to support her claim. There is no dispute, however, that the mother failed to raise the issue at trial, and the judge, therefore, did not address the issue of recusal with respect to the mother.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>We first address the timeliness of the mother\u2019s claim. The children argue that we should not consider the issue of recusal because it was not raised in the Juvenile Court and no exceptional circumstances are present that would permit us to address it. \u201cGenerally, issues not raised by a losing party in the trial court are not addressed on appeal, absent exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>Adoption of Mary, </em>414 Mass. 705, 712 (1993). See <em>Petition of the Dept. of Soc. Servs. to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>392 Mass. 696, 697 (1984) (\u201c[a]s a general practice we do not consider issues, particularly constitutional questions, raised for the first time in this court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">There is no doubt that the mother had an affirmative obligation to seek recusal \u201cat the earliest moment after knowledge of the facts demonstrating the basis for such disqualification.\u201d <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas Super Mkts., Inc., </em>428 Mass. 543, 549 (1998), <em>S.C., </em>432 Mass. 43 (2000) (citation omitted). Here, the mother was aware of the basis of her claim almost two years before trial, and while she claims to have joined the father\u2019s motion to recuse, she has not offered any reason for her failure to raise the issue at trial. These circumstances provide support for the children\u2019s assertion that the claim is waived. See <em>Adoption of Darla, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 519, 522 (2002). However, given the serious nature of the case, coupled with the fact that due process governs these proceedings, we believe that it is appropriate to consider the issue even though the claim is untimely. See <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas Super Mkts., Inc., supra </em>at 550; <em>Matter of a Care &amp; Protection Summons, </em>437 Mass. 224, 239 (2002) (belated request for recusal \u201csuggests a tactical decision in the face of an adverse ruling\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">We have conducted a careful review of the entire record and conclude that recusal was not warranted on the basis of the judge\u2019s conduct at the status hearing. While we acknowledge that some of the judge\u2019s comments were excessively critical and inappropriate, we are not persuaded that the record discloses any bias or prejudice against the mother.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Under Canon 3(E)(1)(a) of the Code of Judicial Conduct, S.J.C. Rule 3:09, as appearing in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>440 Mass. 1319 (2003), \u201cA judge shall disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned, including but not limited to instances where ... the judge has a personal bias or prejudice <em>concerning a party </em>. . . .\u201d See <em>MacDonald </em>v. <em>MacDonald, </em>407 Mass. 196, 203 (1990). Here, it is clear that the judge\u2019s ire was directed at the department and not toward either parent. The mother has also failed to show that any alleged bias stemmed from an extrajudicial source. See <em>Matter of a Care &amp; Protection Summons, </em>437 Mass. at 239-240 (\u201c[n]ot subject to deprecatory characterizations as \u2018bias\u2019 or \u2018prejudice\u2019 are opinions held by judges as a result of what they learn in earlier proceedings\u201d). In sum, it has not been shown that the judge should have recused himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">b. <em>The judge\u2019s questioning of the witnesses. </em>We now turn to the mother\u2019s assertion that the judge impermissibly interfered with the conduct of the trial by participating \u2014 almost to the exclusion of the attorneys \u2014 in examination of the witnesses. Relying on <em>Adoption of Seth, 29 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 343, 350 (1990), the mother argues that the judge\u2019s conduct denied her the impartial justice to which she is entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">There is no question that the judge assumed an active role and extensively questioned all the witnesses including the mother. Our review of the record shows that the judge asked over 1,000 questions as compared to the approximately 725 questions asked by counsel for the department, the mother, and the children combined. The mother\u2019s attorney did not object to the judge\u2019s conduct. Because the transcript cannot disclose the tone of the judge\u2019s voice or his manner in asking questions, it is difficult for us to assess the mother\u2019s claim that the judge acted aggres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>sively toward her. Thus, we view the lack of an objection by counsel as particularly significant in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Our cases permit a judge, who in these types of cases is the fact finder, to question witnesses in order to obtain clarification or eliminate confusion. \u201cIn exercising their duty to direct and clarify the evidence, judges may not, however, weigh in, or appear to do so, on one side or the other; the judge must avoid the appearance of partisanship. . . . The rule is one of reason.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hassey, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 806, 810 (1996). In determining what is reasonable, \u201c[w]e are not unmindful of the observation of Francis Bacon on the \u2018overspeaking judge,\u2019 and we have not favored except in extenuating circumstances the takeover of questioning by a judge during the course of trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>371 Mass. 40, 45 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">While we agree with the mother that the judge\u2019s questioning went beyond clarification and delved into substantive areas that would have best been left to the attorneys to develop, a close reading of the transcript does not demonstrate that she was denied due process. The judge did not limit the mother\u2019s attorney from questioning the department\u2019s witnesses. The mother was not prevented from presenting relevant evidence. Nor did the judge solicit any inadmissible evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, although the judge\u2019s questioning went beyond what was called for in the circumstances, we conclude that his behavior, when considered in the context of the entire trial, cannot be deemed to have deprived the mother of impartial justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">In reaching our conclusion, we emphasize that we do not condone the conduct of the judge in this case. In this respect we agree with the dissent. The relevant inquiry, however, is whether the error was prejudicial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> For us, the crucial question, which the dissent acknowledges but fails to address, is whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>outcome of the trial would have been different had the judge not intervened. Because the record contains ample support for the judge\u2019s detailed (and uncontested) findings, which, in turn, unequivocally support the judge\u2019s determination that the termination of parental rights serves the best interests of the children, we conclude that the error was harmless. See <em>Adoption of Seth, 29 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 351 (if the judge was \u201coverzealous\u201d in the questioning of the psychiatrist, the error was harmless in view of the conclusion that no prejudice resulted). Given our confidence that the outcome of the proceedings in this case would not have been different, despite our criticism of the judge\u2019s conduct, we affirm the decrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">\n<em>Decrees affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b584-17\">Norbert was born in December, 2007, and was three years old at the time of trial. Monica was bom in April, 2009, and was two years old at the time of trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b585-7\">The mother does not raise any issues concerning this portion of the decrees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b586-6\">The report was filed by a department social worker who observed a strange man in the process of dressing himself when she arrived to pick up Norbert after an unsupervised visit. The mother claimed that the man was a neighbor, but did not know his name. In addition, Monica and Norbert appeared dirty and there was a lack of food in the house.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b586-7\">The record indicates that the judge addressed the father\u2019s motion for recusal on two occasions. Initially, the motion was discussed at a pretrial conference on January 25, 2010. At that time the judge stated, \u201cthe basis for recusal has to be one of two things, either the judge has obtained information about the case from outside the courtroom, meaning, like, I witnessed something on the street or a feeling on my part that I would be unable to judge fairly the case, which I don\u2019t think that either instance applies here, so the motion to recuse is denied.\u201d The judge went on to note that, as a practical matter, it was unlikely that he would be the trial judge. Nonetheless (and even though he had denied the motion), the judge reserved the right to assign the case to another judge. He then repeated the fact that he could fairly decide the case and stated, \u201cI don\u2019t want to create the impression on the record that I feel I will be unable to fairly decide this case.\u201d The issue was raised again at a hearing held on July 14, 2010, but the mother has not provided us with a transcript of that hearing. In her brief the mother claims that there was no audio recording of that hearing and therefore no transcript is available.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b587-7\">At one point in the hearing, while addressing the department\u2019s inaction concerning Monica, the judge stated: \u201c[I]f a parent cooks a baby for Thanksgiving, you don\u2019t have to wait until she puts the next baby in the oven before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>you decide to intervene.\u201d The remark was clearly unwise and, even viewed in context, raises legitimate concerns. However, to the extent that the judge\u2019s comments indicated a concern over the mother\u2019s ability to care for Monica, they were tempered by his explicit concern for the mother and the fact that there might not be a sufficient basis for the department to retain custody of Norbert. As an example, during one exchange with the department\u2019s attorney, the attorney explained that the department did not have a reason \u201cto pull the four month old [Monica].\u201d The judge responded \u201cYou don\u2019t have a reason to pull the four month old. Then give [the mother] back [Norbert] because you don\u2019t have a reason to hold [him] either.\u201d The judge went on to make the point that if the department was not concerned about Monica then \u201c[the mother was] entitled to have [Norbert] back now.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b589-8\">We are not persuaded by the mother\u2019s argument that the judge\u2019s questions caused the mother to comment upon the credibility of other witnesses. Instead, we view the questions at issue as an attempt to understand the basic facts of the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b589-9\">Like any child who is the subject of a care and protection proceeding, the children in this case are entitled to permanency. The record indicates that Norbert and Monica have resided together in a preadoptive home since May 13, 2011. It would be unfortunate, to say the least, if we were constrained to vacate the decrees as a result of judicial overreaching.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b590-6\">Hanlon, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6N\">(dissenting). I respectfully dissent. The majority opinion clearly and accurately lays out the relevant facts and case law; I have little to add to either. Nonetheless, I cannot join the majority\u2019s conclusion that this mother was not denied \u201cimpartial justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">The trial judge\u2019s frustration with the Department of Children and Families is understandable. Faced with a request to remove an eleven month old child from the mother while leaving a four month old child in her care \u2014 and no explanation for the different positions \u2014 the judge spelled out his concern to the attorneys. Receiving no adequate response, he then, pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51 A, ordered an investigation of the circumstances surrounding the mother\u2019s care of the four month old.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I have no quarrel with that, and I agree that there was no error in denying the recusal motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, given that history, it was particularly important for the judge to conduct the hearing on the termination of the mother\u2019s parental rights with some care, paying scmpulous attention to providing her with a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">This, he failed to do. As the majority points out, it is often <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>necessary for a trial judge to ask questions in order to elicit crucial information. This is particularly true in a case where the safety of children is at stake. In this case, however, the judge asked more than 1,000 questions, compared to 725 for the four attorneys combined; more importantly, his questions, particularly those posed to the mother, do not seem designed to seek information. On the contrary, they look very much like an effective cross-examination by a skillful adversary. The following exchange, from early in the trial, captures the flavor of the entire proceeding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\">The court: \u201c[Ajnswer the question.

Some of his questions during this part of the hearing seem, at least in hindsight, particularly unfair. For example, the judge asked the mother if her husband had a criminal record and, when she said, \u201cNot that I even knew of,\u201d he asked her if she had checked.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>This case is very different from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>371 Mass. 40, 44-45 (1976), on which the majority relies. In that case, \u201cit appeared] that in questioning [the witness] some 1,725 questions were asked by counsel, with an additional eighty-five being asked by the judge. Reference [was] also made to another witness of whom the judge asked some twenty-five questions, with counsel asking a total of 901.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Here, as the majority notes, the judge asked more than one-third again as many questions as all four of the attorneys combined. In addition, unlike the majority, I discern, even in a bare transcript, a tone in the judge\u2019s questioning that can be described fairly as \u201caggressive.\u201d The majority points out that there was no objection by mother\u2019s counsel. However, failure to object to the <em>judge\u2019s </em>questions, or to the manner in which he conducted the trial, cannot carry the same implication of acquiescence as a failure to object to the questions of opposing counsel. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ragonesi, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 320, 322 n.4 (1986) (\u201cIt should be apparent to anyone who reads the transcript that the judge would not have tolerated any further objection\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">These cases are among the most challenging a trial judge can hear; they often present with heartbreaking facts, prompting well-founded concerns for children\u2019s safety. \u201cA judge has the right and in some circumstances, the duty to <em>participate </em>in the examination of a witness. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Festa, </em>369 Mass. 419, 422 (1976)\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Adoption of Seth, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 343, 351 (1990). It is also true that sometimes counsel could be more effective. However, in this case, the <em>attorneys </em>were given little opportunity to participate. This judge repeatedly interrupted each examination, and frequently the questions and answers themselves, often to make, or to reinforce, a point of his own. This is unacceptable. It contributes neither to the truth-seeking process nor to the perception of fundamental fair<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>ness that is essential if litigants and the public are to have confidence in our system of justice.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Despite her considerable shortcomings, this mother was entitled to a fair trial, with representation by counsel and an opportunity to present her side of the story. On this record, I cannot say that she received one. And, under all of the circumstances, I cannot agree to uphold the termination of her parental rights simply on the ground that a fair trial might produce the same result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b590-9\">The care and protection petition that was filed was dismissed, and the child returned to the mother. Eventually, proceedings involving both children were consolidated for trial in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b590-10\">I agree with the majority, however, that the judge would have been wise to express his frustration more temperately.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b592-24\">The children's attorney interrupted once, saying that she could not hear the answer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b592-25\">In addition, the judge questioned the mother extensively \u2014 for pages of transcript \u2014 about whether she had seen signs of violence or \u201can anger management problem\u201d in her husband before he assaulted her after her second child was bom. The clear implication in the tone of the questioning was that she was either lying about the history of violence in her relationship or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>neglectful when she got married, because she had not noticed warning signs. Either, or both, of those things may be true. However, the literature on domestic violence is replete with examples of episodes of violence that first appeared only after the relationship had been established. See, e.g., Browne, When Battered Women Kill (McMillan Free Press 1987) (\u201cTypically \u2014 in 72 percent to 77 percent of the cases \u2014 violence occurs only after a couple has become seriously involved, is engaged, or is living together; rather than in the early, more casual states of dating.
