L. c. 90, \u00a7 24V2,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> nonetheless remains in force, so as to support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>conviction under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24S,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of operation of a motor vehicle not equipped with an IID. We conclude that a driver\u2019s license does not remain in force after revocation and reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\"><em>Background. </em>The defendant was convicted on August 15, 1996, of operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor. See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24. On December 9, 1999, he was convicted of operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor, second offense. As a result of his convictions, his driver\u2019s license was revoked on December 16, 1999. In May of 2007, the defendant sought to have his license reinstated. Pursuant to G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 241/2, restoration of his license (which occurred on May 24, 2007) was conditioned on the installation of a certified IID on his car.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, on November 26, 2007, the defendant\u2019s license was revoked as a result of his removal of the IID. See note 1, <em>supra. </em>Thereafter, on July 28, 2009, the defendant was stopped while driving a vehicle without an IID. Following a jury-waived trial, he was convicted on a charge of operating a motor vehicle without an IID while his license was subject to restriction requiring such a device, pursuant to G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24S.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On appeal, he contends that his conviction cannot stand, because he did not have a license at the time of his arrest and hence could not have been operating in violation of a restriction on his license.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number><em>Discussion. </em>As we have observed, the defendant\u2019s license was revoked on December 16,1999, following his second conviction of operating under the influence. When the defendant\u2019s license was reinstated, on May 24, 2007, it included a restriction requiring installation of an IID in accordance with the provisions of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 <em>241/2. </em>However, the defendant\u2019s license was thereafter again revoked following his removal of the required HD. In prosecuting him for violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24S, for operating a motor vehicle while his license to operate was subject to an IID restriction, see note 2, <em>supra, </em>the Commonwealth contends that the defendant held a license, subject to a restriction, even though his license to operate had been revoked. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">\u201cWe interpret a statute \u2018according to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language ... to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Deberry, </em>441 Mass. 211, 215 (2004), quoting from <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>286 Mass. 444, 447 (1934). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wynton W., </em>459 Mass. 745, 747 (2011). In seeking to interpret a statute, the starting point is its language. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>444 Mass. 80, 85 (2005). \u201cStatutory language should be given effect consistent with its plain meaning. Where . . . that language is clear and unambiguous, it is conclusive as to the intent of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Correction </em>v. <em>Superior Ct. Dept. of the Trial Ct. for the County of Worcester, </em>446 Mass. 123, 124 (2006).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cIf it is a criminal statute we interpret, the rule of lenity requires that the defendant be given the benefit of the ambiguity.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Deberry, </em>441 Mass. at 216. In interpreting a statute, we extend substantial deference to the interpretation given to it by the administrative body charged with its enforcement. See <em>Commerce Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>447 Mass. 478, 481 (2006). However, the principle of deference is not absolute; \u201c[a]n incorrect interpretation of a statute ... is not entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>deference.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Kszepka\u2019s Case, </em>408 Mass. 843, 847 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 24S, imposes substantial penalties on anyone who operates a motor vehicle without an IID <em>\u201cwhile </em>his license or right to operate has been restricted to operating only motor vehicles equipped with such device\u201d (emphasis added). In the present case, the defendant\u2019s license had previously been so restricted. However, at the time of his arrest he held no license at all; it had been revoked. The statute, of course, could provide that it applies to any person who operates a motor vehicle after his license has been suspended for unauthorized removal of an IID required under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 241/2, as a precondition to reinstatement of his license. Section 24S, however, contains no such language.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The Commonwealth\u2019s contention that the defendant held a license subject to an IID restriction is plainly untenable. Under that view, the defendant would have been authorized to operate a motor vehicle with a functioning IID even though his license to operate had been revoked entirely. Put another way, a license simply cannot be both restricted and revoked at the same time.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">The Commonwealth protests that its proffered construction must be upheld in order to avoid an absurd result, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rahim, </em>441 Mass. 273, 278 (2004), in that a defendant subject to an IID restriction otherwise may avoid the harsh penalties applicable under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24S, for violation of the IID restriction by the simple expedient of removing the interlock device from his car, and thereby prompting revocation of his license.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Though we acknowledge the result, we note that a similar anomaly applies to a defendant whose license is revoked after conviction of operating under the influence but who never seeks reinstatement of his license under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 241/2, and instead simply continues to operate a motor vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>without a valid license.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To the extent that the policy objective the Legislature sought to advance by the enactment of Melanie\u2019s Law would be served more effectively by imposing enhanced penalties on persons who operate a motor vehicle after suspension or revocation of their license by reason of the unauthorized removal of a required HD, the authority to modify the statute to accomplish that goal is with the Legislature rather than with us.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">\n<em>Finding set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">\n<em>Judgment shall enter for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b443-15\">General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 2472, inserted by St. 2005, c. 122, \u00a7 13, authorizes the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, after hearing, to \u201crevoke for an extended period or for life, the license of whoever removes\u201d an HD installed as a precondition to issuance of a new license (or restoration of a previously suspended license) after suspension of a license following a second conviction of operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated. Under the regulations promulgated by the Registrar, an HD-restricted operator who improperly removes the HD from his vehicle shall have his license to operate \u201cimmediately returned to a suspended or revoked status.\u201d 540 Code Mass.
