L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 148 et seq. (Wage Act), by terminating the plaintiff\u2019s employment in retaliation for her speaking out to senior management about the employer\u2019s failure to pay timely the sums due under her employment contract. In addition to the Wage Act claim, the plaintiff also sought compensatory relief, on common-law liability theories, and declaratory relief (see G. L. c. 231 A), from a written noncompete agreement that she had signed, at the behest of the employer, as a condition of employment. Contesting the legal viability of the complaint, the defendants jointly filed a Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974), motion. A judge of the Superior Court allowed the motion and dismissed the complaint in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">On appeal from the dismissal of her complaint by the judge, the plaintiff argues that her complaint alleges plausible entitlements to relief against PerkettPR, Inc. (PPR), and Christine Perkett, PPR\u2019s president (collectively, the defendants).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude, for the reasons set forth herein, that the motion to dismiss was improvidently allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-10\">A rule 12(b)(6) motion may be allowed only when the complaint\u2019s factual allegations (and reasonable inferences therefrom), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>accepted as true, do not plausibly suggest an entitlement to relief. See <em>Iannacchino </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>451 Mass. 623, 635-636 (2008); <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Herb Chambers I-95, Inc., </em>458 Mass. 674, 676 (2011). \u201cFactual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level. . . [based] on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact).\u201d <em>Iannacchino </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., supra </em>at 636, quoting from <em>Bell Atl. Corp. </em>v. <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007). Assertions set out in a motion to dismiss are not part of the rule 12(b)(6) review equation. <em>Eigerman </em>v. <em>Putnam Invs., Inc., </em>450 Mass. 281, 285 n.6 (2007). <em>Romano </em>v. <em>Sacknoff, </em>4 Mass. App. Ct. 862, 863 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">We conclude, for the reasons set forth herein, that the complaint plausibly suggested an entitlement to remedial relief for violation of \u00a7 148A of the Wage Act, and declaratory relief as to a written noncompete agreement, which allegedly was unreasonably burdensome as to restrain unduly her right to secure gainful employment in her field of expertise (public relations). Claims for tortious interference and misrepresentation also were plausibly stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">A. <em>Background. </em>1. <em>Complaint. </em>The complaint alleges the following: PPR, a private corporation doing business in this Commonwealth, hired the plaintiff, Heather Fraelick, as a full-time senior account executive, on written terms and conditions, which PPR had offered and which Fraelick, in turn, accepted in June, 2007. PPR holds itself out as a \u201cvirtual\u201d public relations firm, since it neither owns nor rents commercial space, a business model that PPR purportedly promotes as a benefit to its clients insofar as lower overhead costs are said to yield lower client fees. PPR required Fraelick to work at home as well as pay a wide variety of business-related overhead costs out of her own pocket before being reimbursed by PPR.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">Specifically, memorialized by a written offer letter, PPR promised Fraelick an annual base salary of $60,000, plus other compensation and the benefit of the company\u2019s \u201cpaid expenses program.\u201d The agreed-to offer letter (or \u201ccontract\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> such as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>is alleged) expressly stated the employment was \u201con an at-will basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">The company\u2019s paid expenses program called for PPR to reimburse fully an eligible employee, like Fraelick, for the business overhead costs incurred by her in performing her job, including but not limited to: telephone service fees,* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> laptop computer, basic office supplies, postage fees, and expenses associated with business travel undertaken on behalf of PPR.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Based on its written offer, Fraelick believed the expense program was a component of her agreed-to compensation package.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">In December, 2009, PPR ceased to hold to its side of the bargain, by failing to compensate or reimburse Fraelick for costs that she had incurred in the course of her employment. On a number of occasions, throughout 2010, Fraelick took up this compensation issue with PPR\u2019s president, Christine Perkett, who at all times acknowledged the debt owed and unequivocally promised to pay all outstanding expenses as soon as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">Allegedly, in November, 2010, PPR paid Fraelick for some portion of the business expenses she had incurred some twelve months prior (in December, 2009). However, as late as December 31, 2010, PPR had not repaid Fraelick for overhead expenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>that she paid, on behalf of PPR, throughout calendar year 2010, in the regular course of performing her job and attending to PPR client matters. This was of considerable concern to Fraelick, and particularly so in January, 2011, when a PPR client asked that she attend an upcoming meeting or event in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">On February 3, 2011, Fraelick, once again, raised the matter of her unpaid expenses, directly with Perkett. The matter was weighing on Fraelick, both financially and otherwise. Some portion of her costs allegedly extended as far back as 2009. Fraelick expressed concerns that, due to financial hardship, she was then presently unable to travel to Georgia, or meet with other out-of-town clients, until PPR paid her what was due and owing.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Two days later, on February 5, PPR delivered a check to Fraelick for the monies owed \u2014 some $3,000, more or less \u2014 and, on February 8, PPR fired Fraelick, citing her \u201cunwillingness\u201d to continue paying for the firm\u2019s business expenses associated with her traveling to meet with PPR\u2019s clients, without receiving timely reimbursement. Contemporaneously with the termination of Fraelick\u2019s employment, PPR and Perkett directed a letter to Fraelick advising of the latter\u2019s \u201ccontinuing\u201d contractual obligations under the noncompetition agreement, including its unqualified ban on soliciting (or attempting to solicit) PPR\u2019s existing or prospective clients, for a period of one year from her separation from the company. PPR has clients nationwide and it seeks out business opportunities world-wide. Fraelick took seriously the implied threat of PPR to seek enforcement of its noncompete agreement, and the prospect of substantial costs in defending against such a claim. Fraelick claims to have suffered damages, including loss of future wages and benefits, and compensable emotional harm. This account is, essentially, the sum and substance of the factual allegations contained in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, allegations we accept as true and from which we draw every reasonable inference in her favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">2. <em>Motion to dismiss. </em>The plaintiff caused each defendant to be duly served and commenced an action in the Superior Court. Pursuant to rule 12(b)(6), the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing (among other contentions) that the plaintiff\u2019s allegations \u201cdo not rise to colorable claims on any of this scat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>tershot eight (8) count complaint.\u201d After a hearing, the judge allowed the defendants\u2019 motion, ruling: \u201c[1] business expenses are not covered under the Massachusetts Wage Act\u201d and [2] \u201cplaintiff\u2019s claims fail to satisfy pleading standards set out under <em>Iannacchino </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>451 Mass. 623 (2008).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">B. <em>The Wage Act. </em>It is common ground that the Wage Act, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 148 et seq., lies at the heart of this case. It is useful to identify provisions of this long-standing statutory scheme, arguably implicated here, so as to frame the plaintiff\u2019s factual statement, in light of the well-settled public policies advanced by this comprehensive law.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">1. <em>Payment of wages. </em>Section 148 of the Wage Act (\u00a7 148) commands \u201c[ejvery\u201d employer to pay an employee \u201cthe wages earned\u201d by the employee at regular intervals and within a set number of days after \u201cthe termination of the pay period during which the wages were earned.\u201d \u00a7 148, first par., as amended through St. 1992, c. 133, \u00a7 502. See <em>Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Assn. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>435 Mass. 718, 720 (2002), citing <em>American Mut. Liab. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Labor &amp; Indus., </em>340 Mass. 144, 147 (1959). The Wage Act does not define \u201cwages\u201d other than to provide they \u201cshall include any holiday or vacation payments due an employee under an oral or written agreement.\u201d \u00a7 148, first par., inserted by St. 1966, c. 319.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nor is \u201cearn\u201d defined, but it is commonly understood to mean \u201c[t]o acquire by labor, service, or performance.\u201d <em>Awuah </em>v. <em>Coverall N. America, Inc., </em>460 Mass. 484, 492 (2011), quoting from Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 584 (9th ed. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">For purposes of construing the Wage Act, when an employee has \u201ccompleted the labor, service, or performance required of him [or her],\u201d it necessarily follows that he or she has \u201cearned\u201d his or her due \u201cwage.\u201d <em>Awuah </em>v. <em>Coverall N. America, Inc., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">2. <em>No exemption by means of a special contract. </em>Section 148 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>of the Wage Act further provides, in relevant part: \u201cNo person shall by a special contract with an employee or by any other means exempt himself from this section.\u201d \u00a7 148, sixth par., as appearing in St. 1956, c. 259. The legislative intent, again, is to prevent the unlawful detention of wages, including, as alleged here, by agreement between the employer and employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">3. <em>Antiretaliation. </em>Section 148A of the Wage Act (\u00a7 148A), in no uncertain terms, commands that an employer shall not \u201cpenalize[]\u201d an employee, in any way, due to or as a result of \u201cany action\u201d by the employee \u201cto seek his or her rights\u201d under the Wage Act. This is, in effect, a stiff antiretaliation law, which is strictly applied for the protection of employees who suffer adverse employment consequences for engaging in protected activity. \u201cA complaint made to an employer (or a manager of the employer) by an employee who reasonably believes that the wages he or she has been paid violate such laws readily qualifies as such [a protected] action.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Winter Place LLC, </em>447 Mass. 363, 367 (2006).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">4. <em>Private right of action. </em>\u201cThe basic purpose of the [Wage A]ct is \u2018to prevent the unreasonable detention of wages.\u2019 \u201d <em>Weems </em>v. <em>Citigroup Inc., </em>453 Mass. 147, 150 (2009), quoting from <em>Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Assn. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>435 Mass. at 720. An aggrieved employee has a private cause of action to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>recover \u201cwages\u201d wrongfully withheld or detained by the employer. G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 148 &amp; 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Of clear import here, \u00a7 148 provides that the \u201cpresident and treasurer of a corporation and any officers or agents having the management of such corporation shall be deemed to be the employers of the employees of the corporation within the meaning of this section. . . . Whoever violates this section shall be punished ....\u201d\u00a7 148, sixth par. \u00a7 148, ninth par., as appearing in St. 1998, c. 236, \u00a7 10. Here, at all events, Perkett had served as PPR\u2019s president, and thus, under the Wage Act, she is deemed, for purposes of this litigation, an \u201cemployer\u201d of PPR\u2019s employees. See <em>Wiedmann </em>v. <em>The Bradford Group, Inc., </em>444 Mass. 698, 711 (2005) (under Wage Act\u2019s plain language, \u201cindividuals may be held liable\u201d). And, in 1999, prior to the commencement of the present action, the Legislature created a private right of action for employees aggrieved by an employer\u2019s violation of \u00a7 148A, the antiretaliation law. See \u00a7 150 of the Wage Act (\u00a7 150), second par., as amended by St. 1999, c. 127, \u00a7 145. See also <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Winter Place LLC, </em>447 Mass. at 368 n.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">After filing a written complaint with the Attorney General,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> an employee may bring an action against her employer \u201cfor injunctive relief, for any damages incurred, and for any lost wages and other benefits. An employee so aggrieved who prevails in such an action shall be awarded treble damages . . . and shall also be awarded the costs of the litigation and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d \u00a7 150, second par., as amended by St. 2008, c. 80, \u00a7 5. See <em>Awuah </em>v. <em>Coverall N. America, Inc., </em>460 Mass. at 490 n.15. The plaintiff alleges she received written authorization from the Attorney General prior to the time she commenced the underlying action in Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">C. <em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Section 148A retaliation claim. </em>Without any explanation, the motion judge ruled, as matter of law, that \u201cbusiness expenses\u201d are not covered by the Wage Act, in ordering the dismissal of the plaintiff\u2019s statutory claims. In effect, the judge\u2019s ruling implicitly failed to acknowledge the somewhat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>intricate \u00a7 148 claim that underlies this action. The judge\u2019s ruling cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Section 148A of the Wage Act commands, \u201cNo employee shall be penalized by an employer in any way as a result of any action on the part of an employee to seek his or her rights under the wages and hours provisions of this chapter.\u201d \u00a7 148A, first par., inserted by St. 1977, c. 590. Section 148A provides that an employer \u201cwho discharges or in any other manner discriminates against any employee because such employee has made a complaint to the attorney general <em>or any other person </em>. . . shall have violated [\u00a7 148A] and shall be punished\u201d (emphasis added). \u00a7 148A, second par., as appearing in St. 1999, c. 127, \u00a7 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">The legislative policy advanced by \u00a7 148A is clear: \u201cto encourage enforcement of the wage laws by protecting employees who complain about violations of the same.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Winter Place LLC, </em>447 Mass. at 368. In order to maintain an actionable claim under \u00a7 148A, a plaintiff is not obliged to successfully prove her right to seek recovery of the untimely paid \u201cwages\u201d in question. It is enough that a plaintiff, as here, reasonably believed the remuneration in question fell within the scope of the Wage Act. <em>Id. </em>at 367. See <em>id. </em>at 364 n.4, quoting from <em>Abramian </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, </em>432 Mass. 107, 121 (2000) (viability of retaliation claim \u201cdoes not depend on the success of the underlying . . . claim, so long as the plaintiff can prove that [she] \u2018reasonably and in good faith believed the [employer] was engaged in wrongful [conduct under the Wage Act]\u2019 and that the \u2018[employer\u2019s] desire to retaliate against [her] was a determinative factor in its decision to terminate [her] employment\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">In the instant matter, the complaint alleges the existence of an expense reimbursement arrangement in which the employee is reimbursed for business expenses incurred on behalf of the employer. In the ordinary course, the violation of a standard expense reimbursement arrangement would not constitute a violation of the Wage Act because the reimbursement is not compensation \u201cearned\u201d by \u201clabor, service or performance.\u201d <em>Massachusetts State Police Commissioned Officers Assn. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>462 Mass. 219, 226 (2012), quoting from <em>Awuah </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>v. <em>Coverall N. America, Inc., </em>460 Mass. at 492. However, this complaint alleges that the employer engaged in a pattern of nonpayment, coupled with continued demands that the employee advance expense monies in ever-increasing amounts, and fired her when she refused to advance any more money for the employer\u2019s benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">The Wage Act prohibits an employer from exempting itself from the timely and complete payment of wages by \u201cspecial contract ... or by <em>any other means.\u201d </em>\u00a7 148, sixth par. This provision is strictly enforced. In <em>Awuah, supra, </em>the employer unlawfully classified workers as independent contractors. The Supreme Judicial Court determined that the employer\u2019s policy of treating employee\u2019s wages as \u201cinterest-free advances\u201d constituted an impermissible \u201cspecial contract\u201d under \u00a7 148, and that the \u201cchargebacks\u201d \u2014 amounts employees were required to repay when customers failed to pay the employer \u2014 constituted improper deductions that were not valid setoffs under \u00a7 150. <em>Id. </em>at 490, 492-493. The requirement that employees maintain liability insurance, for the employer\u2019s benefit, also was determined to be a \u201c \u2018special contract\u2019 that [had] the effect of exempting the employer from the obligations to pay earned wages in full.\u201d The court observed, \u201cAn employer\u2019s insurance costs, when borne by an employee, reduce wages just as effectively as if the employer had obtained the policy and deducted funds from the wages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 497 n.22. See <em>ibid., </em>quoting from 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.35 (2010) (\u201c \u2018wages\u2019 cannot be considered to have been paid . . . unless they are paid finally and unconditionally or \u2018free and clear,\u2019 [and not] \u2018kick[ed]-back\u2019... to another person for the employer\u2019s benefit\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">In <em>Camara </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>458 Mass. 756 (2011), the employer maintained a written policy permitting it to make deductions from the wages of truckers involved in accidents, based on the employer\u2019s \u201cunilateral assessment of liability [and the] amount of damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 763. The Supreme Judicial Court likewise found a violation of the Wage Act\u2019s prohibitions against special contracts and all but \u201cvalid set-off[s],\u201d holding that no such unilateral deduction could take place without an adjudication of fault that is procedurally fair. <em>Id. </em>at 763-764. To be sure, these cases involved impermissible \u201cspecial contracts]\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>rather than employer conduct in violation of an otherwise valid written agreement, as is alleged here. However, as noted above, \u00a7 148 prohibits not just \u201cspecial contracts],\u201d but also wage reductions achieved by \u201cany other means,\u201d and all but \u201cvalid set-off[s].\u201d The relevant precedent makes it clear that an employer may not reduce wages by, or condition the full and timely payment of wages on, payments by an employee to or on behalf of the employer. Wages must be paid both in a timely manner and in full. The arrangement alleged here falls short on both fronts.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Fairly read, the complaint alleges that the otherwise permissible expense reimbursement arrangement designed to benefit employees was abandoned and replaced with a policy and practice which required the employee, under penalty of discharge, to advance, indefinitely, expenses for the employer\u2019s benefit. Viewed in the light of <em>Camara </em>and <em>Awuah, supra, </em>this was a sufficient allegation of \u201creasonable belief\u201d under <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Winter Place LLC, </em>447 Mass. at 367, to withstand a rule 12(b)(6) motion on the retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">2. <em>Tortious interference claim against the individual defendant. A </em>showing of actual malice is required in a tortious interference claim against a corporate principal. See <em>Weber </em>v. <em>Community Teamwork, Inc., </em>434 Mass. 761, 785-786 (2001); <em>Sklar </em>v. <em>Beth Israel Deaconess Med. Center, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 550, 554 (2003). Proof that a corporate officer retaliated against an employee for raising a wage claim is sufficient to permit (but not compel) the inference that the plaintiff met the \u201cheightened burden\u201d of proving actual malice, see <em>Blackstone </em>v. <em>Cashman, </em>448 Mass. 255, 261 n.10 (2007), that is, a \u201cspiteful, malignant purpose, unrelated to the legitimate corporate interest.\u201d <em>Weber </em>v. <em>Community Teamwork, Inc., supra </em>at 782. See, e.g., in the context of discrimination cases, <em>id. </em>at 782-783 (if discriminatory animus is determinative cause of termination, fact finder may take that into account in determining whether corporate officer acted with actual malice). Here, the tortious interference claim, like the retaliation claim itself, requires an assessment of state of mind, and should be evaluated on the basis of a factual record.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">3. <em>Misrepresentation. </em>The gravamen of the complaint is that the plaintiff believed Perkett\u2019s assurances that she would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>paid in accordance with the contract, and forbore other employment opportunities in reliance on those allegedly false assurances. Perkett\u2019s alleged promise to uphold her written contractual obligations and make payment is not indefinite as matter of law; nor is reliance on a promise to honor a contractual obligation unreasonable as matter of law. See <em>Starr </em>v. <em>Fordham, </em>420 Mass. 178, 188 (1995) (no clear error in judge\u2019s finding that partner reasonably relied on founding partner\u2019s representations regarding manner of calculating allocation of firm\u2019s profits where oral representation was not \u201cclearly at variance\u201d with written agreement). See also <em>Hurwitz </em>v. <em>Bocian, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 365, 373 (1996) (in absence of written contract, evidence was sufficient on claim of deceit to support judgment for executive who relied on oral promises of company\u2019s sole shareholder to give her half of equity in company). Contrast <em>Masingill </em>v. <em>EMC Corp., </em>449 Mass. 532, 541 (2007) (reliance on prior oral representations that contradict terms of subsequently executed written contract is unreasonable as matter of law). Whether the plaintiff did actually rely on those promises, and whether her reliance ultimately was reasonable, are of course fact questions that may not be resolved on a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">4. <em>Declaratory relief concerning nonsolicitation agreement. </em>The plaintiff sought a declaration that the noncompete provision in her contract was unenforceable, as too broad. Her complaint was sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss. See, e.g., <em>Novelty Bias Binding Co. </em>v. <em>Shevrin, </em>342 Mass. 714, 716 (1961) (non-compete covenant may be enforced \u201cprovided it is necessary for the protection of the employer, is reasonably limited in time and space, and is consonant with the public interest[;] [wjhat is reasonable depends on the facts in each case\u201d). Although the one-year term of the provision has long since expired, if the provision is determined to be unenforceable, it would still be open to the plaintiff to prove her damages. See, e.g., <em>All Stainless, Inc. </em>v. <em>Colby, </em>364 Mass. 773, 781 (1974) (where, on appeal, since-expired noncompete agreement was determined to be valid in part, case was remanded for trial on damages).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">D. <em>Conclusion. </em>So much of the judgment as dismisses counts 2, 4, 5, and 8 of the complaint is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b741-11\">The complaint was in eight counts: violation of the Wage Act, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148 (count 1); retaliation under the Wage Act, \u00a7 148A (count 2); breach of contract (count 3); misrepresentation (count 4); tortious interference with contractual relations against the individual defendant (count 5); tortious interference with advantageous relations (count 6); unjust enrichment (count 7); and declaratory relief as to the nonsolicitation agreement (count 8). The plaintiff abandoned her argument as to count 3 before the hearing on the motion to dismiss. She has appealed from only the dismissal of counts 2, 4, 5, and 8, and, accordingly, we consider only those claims. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Winter Place LLC, </em>447 Mass. 363, 364 nn.4 &amp; 5 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b742-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel identifies PPR\u2019s offer letter as the \u201ccontract\u201d between the parties, given its acceptance by the plaintiff. The plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>counsel quotes extensively from the contract and substantially relies on its written terms in stating the claims for relief, but ultimately did not attach the \u201ccontract\u201d to the pleading. The defendants did so, appending a copy of the offer letter to their rule 12(b)(6) motion. The record, as it presently stands, does not indicate that the plaintiff sought to strike the offer letter. Rather, she, too, relied on it in her opposition to the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-10\">The parties\u2019 appellate briefs refer to the offer letter. Conversion of the defendants\u2019 rule 12(b)(6) motion to one for summary judgment was not required here because, as is apparent, the plaintiff \u201chad notice of [the extrinsic] documento and relied on [it] in framing the complaint.\u201d <em>Golchin </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>460 Mass. 222, 224 (2011), quoting from <em>Marram </em>v. <em>Kobrick Offshore Fund, Ltd., </em>442 Mass. 43, 45 n.4 (2004), and citing Smith &amp; Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7 12.15, at 216 (2d ed. 2006). See <em>Beddall </em>v. <em>State St. Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>137 F.3d 12, 16-17 (1st Cir. 1998). The judge was right not to convert the defendants\u2019 motion to one for summary judgment. We refer to the contract and apply the rule 12(b)(6) standard of review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b743-11\">PPR agreed to reimburse one hundred percent of an employee\u2019s main business line and fifty percent of an employee\u2019s monthly cellular telephone charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b743-12\">Certain of the overhead expenses listed in the offer letter were monthly expenses for which, inferably, Fraelick could expect to receive regular, recurring payments.
