Freddo (father) appeals from a summary judgment entered against him in connection with his complaint for modification seeking the termination of his child support obligation on the ground that the parties\u2019 children had reached the age of majority under Florida law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Applying the jurisdictional mandates of G. L. c. 209D, \u00a7 6-613 (\u00a7 6-613), a judge of the Probate and Family Court assumed authority, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>matter of law, to modify the duration of the father\u2019s support obligation articulated in the foreign judgment and to provide continued support under the \u201cposteighteen\u201d provisions of G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> *As we conclude that duration is a nonmodifiable aspect of the child support order here at issue, we reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The father and Mary Ellen Freddo (mother) were married on July 4,1981. The marriage produced four children; as here relevant, the two youngest were bom on August 3, 1990, and September 8, 1992. The parties were divorced on January 12, 1995, by a \u201cFinal Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage\u201d (Florida judgment) entered by the Circuit Court of the Thirteenth Judicial Circuit in and for Hillsborough County, Florida, Family Law Division (Florida Circuit Court). The Florida judgment included a provision for child support, which was to terminate entirely, inter alla, \u201cupon the minor children reaching the age of majority.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On January 31, 1997, a judge of the Florida Circuit Court modified the Florida judgment, increasing the amount of the father\u2019s child support obligation. Since January 31, 1997, however, the Florida judgment has not been modified by any court, despite the extensive litigation between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">It is undisputed that the mother, the father, and the children at issue now reside in Massachusetts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Relevant to this appeal, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>father filed a complaint for modification in the Probate and Family Court on August 23, 2011, requesting that the child support provision of the Florida judgment, as modified on January 31, 1997, be terminated pursuant to Florida law. Under the law of that State, support obligations terminate on a child\u2019s eighteenth birthday, subject to certain exceptions not here applicable.* ****<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The mother moved to dismiss the father\u2019s complaint for modification, and the father moved for summary judgment. On October 31,2011, the probate judge found the father\u2019s request to terminate his child support obligation groundless, ruling that the court\u2019s authority to enter support orders extended to the parties\u2019 two youngest children pursuant to the posteighteen provisions of G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Standard of review. </em>The gravamen of the father\u2019s appeal concerns whether the judge correctly interpreted \u00a7 6-613, a provision of the Commonwealth\u2019s codification of the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA), to provide him with the authority to modify the Florida judgment and extend the duration of the father\u2019s child support obligation beyond that permitted under Florida law. See generally UIFSA 9 (Part IB) U.L.A. 295 (Master ed. 2005). \u201cThis is a question of statutory interpretation, and therefore one that we review de nova.\u201d <em>Rosnov </em>v. <em>Molloy, </em>460 Mass. 474, 476 (2011). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cintolo, </em>415 Mass. 358, 359 (1993) (\u201cStatutory interpretation is a pure question of law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">2. <em>Choice of law. </em>As stated above, the father contends that the judge lacked authority to extend his child support obligation because its duration is fixed by Florida law, regardless of the differing duration permitted by Massachusetts law. Under Florida law, child support obligations generally terminate when the child reaches the age of eighteen.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 61.14(9), 743.07(2) (2012). See <em>Wattenbarger </em>v. <em>Wattenbarger, </em>767 So. 2d 1172, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>1172-1773 (Fla. 2000); <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Bonsall, </em>875 So. 2d 705, 707-708 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2004). In contrast, Massachusetts law provides support beyond age eighteen for any child (1) \u201cwho has attained age eighteen but who has not attained age twenty-one and who is domiciled in the home of a parent, and is principally dependent upon said parent for maintenance,\u201d or (2) \u201cwho has attained age twenty-one but who has not attained age twenty-three, if such child is domiciled in the home of a parent, and is principally dependent upon said parent for maintenance due to the enrollment of such child in an educational program . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28. At the time the father filed his complaint for modification, the parties\u2019 two youngest children were eighteen and twenty-one years of age.* *****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> By virtue of age and circumstance, therefore, the children were outside the scope of the provisions entitling them to continued support under Florida law, notwithstanding that they may otherwise have been well within the purview of Massachusetts law.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The probate judge determined, and the father agrees, that \u00a7 6-613 applies in this case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Section 6-613, inserted by St. 1998, c. 64, \u00a7 281, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">\u201c(a) If all of the parties who are individuals reside in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>commonwealth and the child does not reside in the issuing state, a tribunal of the commonwealth shall have jurisdiction to enforce and modify the issuing state\u2019s child support order in a proceeding to register such order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\">\u201c(6) A tribunal of the commonwealth exercising jurisdiction under this section shall apply the provisions of this article and articles 1 and 2, and the procedural and substantive law of the commonwealth to the proceeding for enforcement or modification.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Here, the mother, the father, and the children at issue are residents of Massachusetts, in satisfaction of \u00a7 6-613(a). However, that \u00a7 6-613 (a) may apply to a matter does not necessarily end the analysis and confer upon the courts of this Commonwealth the unrestricted authority to apply Massachusetts procedural and substantive law in every modification proceeding, as the probate judge appears to have concluded. That interpretation oversimplifies the choice of law doctrine, and undercuts another operative provision of the statute, G. L. c. 209D, \u00a7 6-611 (\u00a7 6-611).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Section 6-611, as amended through St. 1998, c. 64, \u00a7 278, states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-8\"><em>\u201c(a) </em>After a child support order issued in another state has been registered in the commonwealth, the responding tribunal of the commonwealth may modify that order only if section 6-613 does not apply and after notice and hearing it finds that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-9\">\u201c(1) the following requirements are met:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-10\">\u201c(i) the child, the individual obligee, and the obligor do not reside in the issuing state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>\u201c(ii) a petitioner who is a nonresident of the commonwealth seeks modification; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-5\">\u201c(iii) the respondent is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of the commonwealth;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-6\">\u201c(c) A tribunal of the commonwealth may not modify any aspect of a child support order that may not be modified under the law of the issuing state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">The procedural and substantive law of Massachusetts generally governs modification. However, if the parties and the children have moved from the issuing State and the party petitioning for modification does not reside in Massachusetts, see \u00a7 6-611(a)(1), or if the parties and the children all reside here, see \u00a7 6-613(a), then \u00a7 6-611(c) explicitly prohibits modification if the aspect of the child support order at issue may not be modified under the law of the issuing State.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">The question then becomes whether \u00a7 6-611(c) operates independently of \u00a7 6-611 (a), thus limiting the jurisdictional mandates of \u00a7 6-613 in this matter. In effect, the fact that the father is indeed a resident of Massachusetts \u2014 rendering \u00a7 6-611(a)(1)(ii) inapplicable \u2014 does not, in turn, render the statutory limit on judicial authority set forth in \u00a7 6-611(c) meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">To further inform our statutory construction of these sections, we consider the cognate provisions of the UIFSA, together with any accompanying commentary for insight into the legislative intent of G. L. c. 209D. See <em>Klingel </em>v. <em>Reill, </em>446 Mass. 80, 82-83 (2006). \u201cGeneral Laws c. 209D was enacted in 1995, St. 1995, c. 5, \u00a7 87, adopting the 1992 version of the [UIFSA].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 83, citing <em>Child Support Enforcement Div. of Alaska </em>v. <em>Brenckle, </em>424 Mass. 214, 217-218 (1997). As originally enacted, \u00a7 6-611 adopted language identical to \u00a7 611 of the 1992 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>UIFSA. UIFSA (1992) \u00a7 611, <em>supra </em>at 513-514. When the UIFSA was revised in 1996, the Legislature adopted the changes as provided in the UIFSA, amending the language of \u00a7 6-611 in relevant part and adding \u00a7 6-613. See St. 1998, c. 64, \u00a7\u00a7 278-281; UIFSA (1996) \u00a7\u00a7 611, 613, <em>supra </em>at 442-443, 454. In the comment to \u00a7 611 of the 1996 UIFSA, the drafters explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-5\">\u201cSubsection (b) states that if the forum has modification jurisdiction because the issuing state has lost continuing, exclusive jurisdiction, the proceedings will generally follow local law with regard to modification of child support orders. <em>However, Subsection (c) prevents the modification of any final, nonmodifiable aspect of the original order. For example, if child support was ordered through age 21 in accordance with the law of the issuing state and the law of the forum state ends the support obligation at 18, modification by the forum tribunal may not affect the duration of the support order to age 21\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Comment to UIFSA (1996) \u00a7 611, <em>supra </em>at 446. See comment to UIFSA (1992) \u00a7 611, <em>supra </em>at 516. Furthermore, following the UIFSA\u2019s 1996 revision, the drafters elaborated in the comment to \u00a7 613:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">\u201cFinally, because modification of the child support order when all parties reside in the forum is essentially an intrastate matter, Subsection (b) withdraws authority to apply most of the substantive and procedural provisions of UIFSA, i.e., those found in the Act other than in Articles 1, 2, and 6. <em>Note, however, that the provision in Section 611(c) forbidding modification of nonmodifiable aspects of the controlling order applies. For example, the duration of the support obligation remains fixed despite the subsequent residence of all parties in a new State with a different duration of child </em>support\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">Comment to UIFSA (1996) \u00a7 613, <em>supra </em>at 454.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">The father\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 6-611(c) as limiting the general authority to modify a child support order under \u00a7 6-613 is consistent with and supported by the rationale of the UIFSA, as articulated in the comments. \u201cWhen the Legislature adopted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>language of the 1992 [and 1996] version[s] of UIFSA ... it intended an interpretation of that [language] consistent with the rationale explained in the comment accompanying that language.\u201d <em>Klingel </em>v. <em>Reill, </em>446 Mass. at 84. In light of the UIFSA\u2019s statement that the duration of a support obligation constitutes a nonmodifiable aspect of an original support order even in seemingly intrastate circumstances, it thus follows that the Legislature intended \u00a7 6-611(c) to curb the court\u2019s modification jurisdiction, whether it was so exercised pursuant to \u00a7 6-611 or \u00a7 6-613.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Although this case presents an issue of first impression in Massachusetts, courts of other States have squarely addressed the intended relationship between \u00a7 611 and \u00a7 613 of the UIFSA, on the choice of substantive law applicable to modification proceedings. At least one court has done so where, as here, the parents and children now all live in the same new State. The Minnesota Court of Appeals posited \u201c[i]f a Mississippi court has issued a child-support order that has been registered for enforcement and modification in Minnesota pursuant to the [UIFSA], [as codified in Minnesota by] Minn. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 518C.101-.902, may the district court modify the duration of child-support obligation pursuant to Minnesota law?\u201d <em>Hennepin County </em>v. Hill, 777 N.W.2d 252, 254 (Minn. Ct. App. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">In <em>Hill, </em>the parents and the three children moved to Minnesota sometime following the issuance of a support order by a Mississippi court. <em>Ibid. </em>The father subsequently initiated proceedings in Minnesota to terminate his support obligation after the parties\u2019 youngest child reached the age of twenty, the age of majority in that State; in contrast, the law of the issuing State, Mississippi, provided for child support until the child reached the age of twenty-one. <em>Id. </em>at 253-254. Relying on the UIFSA\u2019s 1996 amendments and comments, as well as decisions from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>courts of other States,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the Minnesota court concluded: \u201cBecause a Mississippi court issued the original order requiring Hill to pay child support, and because Mississippi law would not allow the duration of Hill\u2019s child-support obligation to be modified given the facts of this case, Hill may not obtain modification of the duration of his child-support obligation pursuant to Minnesota law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 257. See <em>Matter of Scott, </em>160 N.H. 354, 360-361 (2010) (although otherwise modifiable pursuant to New Hampshire law, Massachusetts law governed the duration of a Massachusetts child support order, as explained in the 1996 comments to \u00a7 611 of the UIFSA and as confirmed by the unadopted 2001 comments of the same).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Thus, by the same logic, a Massachusetts court may not modify the duration of the father\u2019s child support obligation pursuant to Massachusetts law, because a Florida court issued the original order requiring the father to pay child support, and Florida law would not allow the duration of the father\u2019s child support obligation to be modified. Given the facts of this case, the youngest child reached her eighteenth birthday in September, 2010, prior to the father\u2019s filing of his complaint for modification. At that point, the father\u2019s child support obligation terminated entirely.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Based on the above, the judge erred in determining that \u00a7 6-613 compels the conclusion that Massachusetts substantive law, G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, governs the duration of the father\u2019s child support obligation. We reverse the summary judgment dated October 31, 2011, and a new judgment shall enter in favor of the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b395-15\">The mother had filed a motion to dismiss, but the judge took no action on that motion; rather, he appears to have incorporated her contentions in his ruling against the father on his motion for summary judgment, entering summary judgment in favor of the mother.

Indeed, the judge found that \u201c[the mother] stated that G.
