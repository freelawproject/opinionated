Bermudez, then seventeen years old, made to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>the police during a recorded interview at the Holyoke police station. A Superior Court judge ruled that (1) the interview amounted to custodial interrogation, necessitating a waiver of Miranda rights, and (2) the defendant\u2019s waiver of his Miranda rights was not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. We reverse, as the judge erred in ruling the interview was custodial.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>Charged with multiple firearm offenses and as an accessory before the fact,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the defendant moved to suppress his statements to detectives of the Holyoke police department because (1) an \u201cinterested adult\u201d was not present with him during the interview and (2) he did not waive his Miranda rights knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. After hearing testimony and viewing a video recording of the police interview of the defendant, the judge made factual findings and rulings that allowed the defendant\u2019s motion. The judge concluded that (1) although \u201ca close question,\u201d the interview was custodial in nature so as to require Miranda warnings, and (2) given \u201cthe defendant\u2019s young age, limited education and intellectual abilities, and indulging every reasonable presumption against waiver,\u201d the Commonwealth failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\u2019s waiver of Miranda rights was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">2. <em>Facts. </em>Mindful that assessment of witness credibility is the province of the motion judge, we accept the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact, supplementing them with uncontested testimony from the suppression hearing that the judge explicitly or implicitly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>credited. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Isaiah I., </em>448 Mass. 334, 337 (2007); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>461 Mass. 44, 48 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">On January 1, 2011, a shooting occurred at Manny\u2019s Market (market) in Holyoke during which Michael Rivera was injured. After reviewing the market\u2019s security surveillance video, the police sought to interview the defendant. They believed the defendant was the individual named Jay or JJ who was observed handling an item shortly before the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">On January 6, 2011, Holyoke police Detectives John Sevigne and James McGillicuddy went to the apartment at 470 Maple St., third floor, in Holyoke, where the defendant lived with his mother, Anne Marie Rodriguez. The defendant was not home, but the detectives spoke with Rodriguez and told her that they were investigating a shooting at the market and would like to speak with the defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rodriguez told the detectives that she would speak with her son when he returned and bring him to the police station to speak with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">When the defendant returned home, his mother drove him to the station. At approximately 4:25 p.m., the defendant and his mother arrived in the lobby of the police station and indicated that they were there at the detectives\u2019 request. They proceeded, as directed, to the criminal investigation bureau, a secure area on the second floor. There, they met Detective Sevigne in the lobby, a small waiting room with several chairs, some magazines, and a glass window.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">In a conversational tone, Sevigne told the defendant that he and McGillicuddy would like to speak with him regarding the shooting. While the defendant\u2019s mother remained in the lobby, Sevigne, McGillicuddy, and the defendant proceeded to an interview room, a small room containing a desk and four chairs that is equipped for video recording.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">The detectives advised the defendant that the interview could be recorded.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant, who is fluent in English, assented to the recording, and the interview commenced. The defendant confirmed for the officers that he was bom on April 9, 1993, making him seventeen years old, and approximately three months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>shy of his eighteenth birthday. At the beginning of the interview, Sevigne explained the defendant\u2019s Miranda rights by reading each of the rights aloud from a card and asking the defendant if he understood each of those rights.* <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Sevigne confirmed that the defendant could read and write English and asked the defendant to read the first line of the card aloud, and the remainder to himself. The defendant began reading the Miranda rights card aloud without difficulty.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">After the defendant finished reading his Miranda rights, Sevigne asked the defendant whether he understood his rights and whether he wished to have any of the rights explained to him. The defendant stated he understood the rights and did not require any explanation. The defendant then signed and dated the Miranda rights card. The defendant had some difficulty regarding how to date the card (whether with the number or the name of the month) and with the correct spelling of \u201cJanuary.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">At the time of the interview, the defendant was a ninth grade student at Dean Tech High School in Holyoke in special education classes. When he was in sixth grade, the defendant was diagnosed as having special needs, particularly in reading and writing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">The interview proceeded in a conversational and nonthreatening manner and lasted about seventy minutes. Although the defendant appeared nervous at times, he responded unhesitatingly and appropriately. He appeared sober and coherent throughout the interview and had no difficulty understanding the detectives, nor they him. The defendant was never handcuffed or restrained, and the detectives repeatedly told him that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>not a suspect in the shooting and would be allowed to return home with his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">In response to the detectives\u2019 questions, the defendant first stated that he knew nothing of the shooting. After further prodding by police to \u201ctell the truth,\u201d the defendant changed his story several times, eventually admitting that on the day of the shooting he had a firearm, that someone he knew requested it, and that he gave that person the firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">At the conclusion of the interview, the detectives prepared a typewritten copy of the defendant\u2019s statement, and the defendant read, corrected, initialled, and signed the statement. After the interview concluded, the defendant remained in the interview room for an additional thirty minutes looking at photograph arrays to determine whether he could identify the individual to whom he gave the gun. The defendant told the police that he could not identify the shooter, and left the police station with his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">3. <em>Discussion, </em>\u201cIn reviewing a ruling on a motion to suppress, we accept the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error \u2018but conduct an independent review of his ultimate findings and conclusions of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>440 Mass. 642, 646 (2004), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jimenez, </em>438 Mass. 213, 218 (2002). Where the judge\u2019s factual findings are based on a videotape of the defendant\u2019s interview, \u201cwe . . . \u2018take an independent view\u2019 of recorded confessions and make judgments with respect to their contents without deference to the fact finder, who \u2018is in no better position to evaluate the[ir] content and significance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Novo, </em>442 Mass. 262, 266 (2004), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bean, </em>435 Mass. 708, 714 n.15 (2002). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hoyt, </em>461 Mass. 143, 148-149 (2011); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>461 Mass. 336, 341 (2012). With these principles in mind, and having viewed the interrogation videotape in its entirety, we conclude that the judge erred in his application of the law to these facts and in his ultimate mling that the interrogation was custodial because \u201ca reasonable person of [the defendant\u2019s] age, experience and intelligence would find the environment. . . coercive.\u201d Viewed in their totality, and including consideration of the defendant\u2019s age, the circumstances of the defendant\u2019s interrogation were not custodial so as to trig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>ger the requirements of <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 467-479 (1966). See <em>J.D.B. </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>131 S. Ct. 2394, 2406 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">\u201cMiranda warnings are only necessary where one is the subject of \u2018custody and official interrogation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Larkin, </em>429 Mass. 426, 432 (1999), quoting from <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>496 U.S. 292, 297 (1990). Unless both are present, Miranda rights are not implicated. Whether a suspect is subject to custodial interrogation is a question of Federal constitutional law, upon which the defendant bears the burden of proof. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Larkin, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kirwan, </em>448 Mass. 304, 309 (2007). Here, there is no doubt that the defendant\u2019s interview was \u201cinterrogation.\u201d What is in dispute is whether it was \u201ccustodial.\u201d Viewed objectively and in its totality, the interrogation that occurred in this case was not custodial, and the defendant\u2019s proof does not establish otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Custody for purposes of <em>Miranda </em>attaches where there is a \u201cformal arrest\u201d or a \u201crestraint of movement akin to formal arrest.\u201d <em>California </em>v. <em>Beheler, </em>463 U.S. 1121, 1125 (1983), quoting from <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. 492, 495 (1977). <em>Stansbury </em>v. <em>California, </em>511 U.S. 318, 322 (1994). We discern no such restraint in the objective circumstances of the defendant\u2019s interrogation. The fact that the questioning occurred in a \u201csecure\u201d area within the police station did not render it custodial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sparks, </em>433 Mass. 654, 657 (2001); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>442 Mass. 485, 492-493 (2004); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>461 Mass. 765, 774-775 (2012). Nor does the giving of Miranda warnings. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trombley, </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. 183, 186 (2008). The pertinent inquiry is whether the relevant environment presented the same inherently coercive pressures as the type of police station questioning at issue in <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">In making that determination, we consider whether all the objective circumstances add up to custody rather than evaluating the circumstances one by one. See <em>J.D.B. </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2407; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sneed, </em>440 Mass. 216, 220-221 (2003). Relevant factors in assessing the objective circumstances of the interrogation include where the questioning occurred, how long it lasted, what was said, any physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>restraints on the suspect\u2019s movement, and whether he was told he would be free to leave at the conclusion of the interview. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sneed, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hilton, </em>443 Mass. 597, 609 (2005). As well, \u201ca child\u2019s age properly informs the Miranda custody analysis.\u201d <em>J.D.B. </em>v. <em>North Carolina, supra </em>at 2399. This is so because \u201c[i]n some circumstances, a child\u2019s age \u2018would have affected how a reasonable person\u2019 in the suspect\u2019s position \u2018would perceive his or her freedom to leave\u2019 . . . [such that] a reasonable child subjected to police questioning will sometimes feel pressured to submit when a reasonable adult would feel free to go.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2402-2403, quoting from <em>Stansbury </em>v. <em>California, supra </em>at 325.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cThis is not to say that a child\u2019s age will be a determinative, or even a significant, factor in every case.\u201d <em>J.D.B. </em>v. <em>North Carolina, supra </em>at 2406. It is the totality of these circumstances \u2014 the external circumstances of the interrogation itself \u2014 that are determinative. \u201cOnce the scene is set and the players\u2019 lines and actions are reconstructed, [we] apply an objective test to resolve the ultimate inquiry: was there a formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with formal arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2402, quoting from <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Keohane, </em>516 U.S. 99, 112 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Applying these factors to the facts found by the judge and the objective circumstances depicted in the interrogation videotape, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s interrogation was not custodial. Although the interrogation occurred at the police station, the defendant appeared there voluntarily, accompanied by his mother, in response to a police request. He was neither under arrest nor escorted to the station by the police. The interrogation lasted seventy minutes, and the defendant sat next to the door throughout the interview. One of the two interviewing officers left the room from time to time, and the other sat across from the defendant behind a desk next to a computer. The questioning was conversational and nonthreatening in tone, and the detectives repeatedly told the defendant, who was not handcuffed or restrained in any way, that he would be allowed to return home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>with his mother, as he ultimately was. The defendant\u2019s age, a few months shy of his eighteenth birthday, placed him on the cusp of majority, and far removed from the tender years of early adolescence. Viewing all the pertinent factors objectively, including the defendant\u2019s age at the time of the interview, we conclude that the interrogation was not custodial so as to require Miranda warnings. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trombley, </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The defendant does not argue, as he did below, that the failure to have an interested adult present required suppression of his statements. Although under the age of majority at the time, the defendant was beyond the age where Massachusetts requires consultation with an interested adult for a waiver to be effective. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dillon D., </em>448 Mass. 793, 796 (2007), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCra, </em>427 Mass. 564, 568 n.2 (1998) (\u201c[I]n order to waive their Miranda rights validly, juveniles under fourteen years old must \u2018actually consult\u2019 with an interested adult\u201d). He was even beyond the age where we would require an opportunity to consult with an interested adult. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trombley, </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. at 186.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Instead, the defendant maintains that the circumstances of the interrogation, in combination with his age and status as a special needs student, rendered the interrogation custodial because a reasonable person of his age and cognitive ability would not have believed he was free to end the interrogation and leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">While we agree that after <em>J.D.B. </em>v. <em>North Carolina, supra, </em>the defendant\u2019s age is a factor in the custody determination, we disagree that other individualized factors peculiar to the defendant, such as his status as a special needs student, bear on that determination.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>J.D.B. </em>expressly disavows such a view.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201cBy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>limiting analysis to the objective circumstances of the interrogation, and asking how a reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s position would understand his freedom to terminate questioning and leave, the objective test avoids burdening police with the task of anticipating the idiosyncrasies of every individual suspect and divining how those particular traits affect each person\u2019s subjective state of mind.\u201d <em>J.D.B. </em>v. <em>North Carolina, supra </em>at 2402. In holding that age is properly a factor in assessing whether an interrogation is \u201ccustodial,\u201d <em>J.D.B., supra, </em>did not change the custody determination into a subjective inquiry. Rather, the United States Supreme Court concluded that if known to the police, consideration of the age of a minor in the custody analysis is consistent with the objective nature of that test and \u201ca reality that courts cannot simply ignore.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2406.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Because the defendant\u2019s interrogation was not custodial, no Miranda warnings were necessary, and the judge erred by ruling otherwise. We reverse the order allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress his statements and remand to the Superior Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b89-7\">The charges include carrying a firearm without a license (G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10[a]); possession of a loaded firearm (G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10[n]); and accessory before the fact to assault and battery (G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b89-8\">Because the interrogation was not custodial, we need not address whether the judge erred in ruling that the defendant\u2019s waiver of Miranda rights was not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. The Commonwealth contends that the judge misapprehended the governing standard by improperly \u201cindulging every reasonable presumption against waiver,\u201d see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simon, </em>456 Mass. 280, 305-306 (2010) (Botsford, J., dissenting), when the judge\u2019s factual findings and the video recording demonstrate that the officers administered Miranda rights appropriately, and the defendant appeared sober and coherent, had no difficulty understanding the police, and appeared to have his self-interest in mind throughout the interview. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trombley, </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. 183,185 (2008) (judge\u2019s rationale not consistent with established principles, and in some particulars inconsistent with record and findings).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b90-10\">The police did not indicate to Rodriguez that the defendant was a suspect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b90-11\">In the video, the officers are dressed casually, in civilian clothing, and are not visibly carrying weapons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b91-8\">The defendant made no claim that the police failed properly to advise him of his Miranda rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b91-10\">After reading the first line aloud, the defendant began to read the second aloud as well. Sevigne reminded the defendant that he could read the rest of the lines to himself from that point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b91-11\">The defendant spelled the month as \u201cJaunry.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b91-12\">The record does not support the judge\u2019s factual finding that the defendant could only read at the sixth grade level. While the defendant\u2019s mother testified that the defendant was diagnosed as having special needs when he was in sixth grade, nothing in the record establishes the defendant\u2019s reading level. Nor does anything in the record establish that the defendant\u2019s special needs include any cognitive limitations or specific difficulties in reading, writing, or comprehension.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b94-6\">At the same time, the United States Supreme Court noted, \u201cconsidering age in the custody analysis in no way involves a determination of how youth \u2018subjectively affect[s] the mindset\u2019 of any particular child.\u201d <em>J.D.B. </em>v. <em>North Carolina, supra </em>at 2405.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b95-7\">In any event, the interested adult rule is inapplicable when the interrogation is not custodial, because there is no obligation to inform a juvenile of Miranda rights. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ira I., </em>439 Mass. 805, 815 n.11 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b95-8\">Of course, such individualized factors remain applicable in determining the voluntariness of a Miranda waiver, and of the statements themselves. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>420 Mass. 666, 673-674 (1995); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>St. Peter, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 517, 520-522 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b95-9\">In concluding that the interrogation was custodial because \u201ca reasonable person of [the defendant\u2019s] age, experience and intelligence would find the environment . . . coercive,\u201d the judge made no reference to the decision in <em>J.D.B. </em>v. <em>North Carolina, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
