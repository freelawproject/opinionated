As such, we are constrained to reverse a determination to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-14\"><em>Facts. </em>The defendant, Anthony Tyler, was a Maynard firefighter and an emergency medical technician. In 2006, it came to light that Tyler had, for a number of years, been sexually abusing young boys. One of Tyler\u2019s victims was the son of another Maynard firefighter; the other victim was also related to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>a Maynard firefighter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Tyler was indicted on various charges in 2006<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and again in 2007.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Tyler could have been discharged from his position on the grounds of moral turpitude, in which case he would have forfeited his pension. G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 10(1). See <em>Herrick </em>v. <em>Essex Regional Retirement Bd., </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. 645, 648-653 (2010). Instead, the town of Maynard (town) and the Maynard fire department (department) took no action. Conversely, Tyler, in 2006, following his first set of indictments, applied for retirement benefits, which were granted. Tyler later pleaded guilty to some of the various indictments, others being nol pressed, and began serving his prison sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Upon notice from the district attorney\u2019s office that Tyler\u2019s case had been resolved, see G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15(5), the Maynard retirement board (board) began an inquiry to determine whether, under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15(4), Tyler remained entitled to his pension.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After a hearing, the board voted to suspend Tyler\u2019s pension, generally concluding that \u201cthe fact that the molestations were committed on a fellow firefighter\u2019s son [constituted a] \u2018direct link\u2019 \u201d between Tyler\u2019s offenses and his position.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Tyler appealed the board\u2019s decision to the District Court. After a hearing, a District Court judge set aside the board\u2019s decision and ordered that Tyler\u2019s benefits be reinstated retroactive to the date of their termination.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The District Court judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>concluded that \u201cTyler\u2019s convictions do not constitute violations of the laws applicable to his position as a Maynard firefighter with a nexus sufficient to trigger pension forfeiture under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15(4).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The board then filed the instant certiorari petition to the Superior Court. Based on the pleadings and the administrative record, the Superior Court judge concluded that in this case, a sufficient nexus or \u201cdirect link\u201d existed between Tyler\u2019s criminal conduct and \u201cthe laws applicable to his office or position\u201d as to require forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\"><em>Law. </em>This case is controlled by G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15(4), inserted by St. 1987, c. 697, \u00a7 47, and subtitled \u201cForfeiture of pension upon misconduct.\u201d The statute states, in pertinent part, \u201cIn no event shall any member after final conviction of a criminal offense <em>involving violation of the laws applicable to his office or position, </em>be entitled to receive a retirement allowance\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">The scope of the law was enunciated in <em>Gaffney </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>423 Mass. 1, 3-5 (1996), where the court held that it was clear that the Legislature intended the forfeiture provision to apply to any criminal activity connected with the office or position of the wrongdoer. The court, however, \u201cdid not intend pension forfeiture to follow as a sequelae of any and all criminal convictions. Only those violations related to the member\u2019s official capacity were targeted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. Further, the court enunciated that the facts of each case had to be examined to determine the existence of \u201ca direct link between the criminal offense and member\u2019s office or position.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In <em>Gaffney, </em>there was such a link in that the member, the superintendent of Shrews-bury\u2019s sewer and water department, stole monies from his own department. See <em>Durkin </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., post </em>116, 118-119 (2013); <em>Flaherty </em>v. <em>Justices of the Haverhill Div. of the Disk Ct. Dept. of the Trial Ct., post </em>120, 122-123 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">Similarly, in <em>State Bd. of Retirement </em>v. <em>Bulger, </em>446 Mass. 169, 179 (2006), the court held that by committing perjury before a Federal grand jury and obstructing justice, the member had violated the tenets of his clerk-magistrate position in that telling the truth was at the heart of a clerk-magistrate\u2019s role. As the member\u2019s crimes could not be separated from the nature of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>his particular office, his pension was rightfully withheld. <em>Id. </em>at 179-180.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Conversely, in <em>Herrick </em>v. <em>Essex Regional Retirement Bd., </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. at 654-655, we held that the member, a custodian, was improperly denied his pension after he was convicted of indecent assault and battery of his daughter. We concluded, in part, that there was no direct link between his repugnant criminal actions and his job. <em>Id. </em>at 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">So too, in <em>Scully </em>v. <em>Retirement Bd. of Beverly, </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. 538 (2011), a pension was ordered reinstated. The member, a library employee, was arrested after the police discovered images of child pornography on his home computer. <em>Id. </em>at 539. We held that \u201c[wjhile we do not ignore the severity of the offenses to which [the member] pleaded guilty, . . . the facts underlying the convictions did not present \u2018the type of direct link intended by the Legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 543, quoting from <em>Herrick, supra </em>at 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>The key question thus is whether Tyler\u2019s reprehensible criminal activity violated a law applicable to his position. General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 15(4), has consistently been given a narrow interpretation. <em>Bulger, supra </em>at 174-175. Had the Legislature wished to broaden the statute\u2019s reach, it clearly could have done so. That it did not compels our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">Here, the board and the Superior Court judge determined that \u201calthough there is no evidence that the crimes took place at the fire station, or that Tyler was ever on duty when he committed the crimes, the fact that the crimes were perpetrated on a coworker\u2019s child\u201d was evidence of a \u201cdirect link.\u201d Additionally, given Tyler\u2019s position as a firefighter and his obligation to protect the public, his criminal activities \u201cviolated the fundamental tenets of his position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">These considerations, while understandable, are so broad however as to engulf nearly every public official, especially police officers and firefighters, convicted of any crime. The reach of the statute as currently written is not so broad. A direct link must be established between one\u2019s actions and his official position.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">We recognize the essential role firefighters play, extinguishing fires and protecting life and property. G. L. c. 48, \u00a7 42. Although Tyler knew his victims through his fellow firefighters, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>his offenses were nonetheless personal in nature, occurring outside the firehouse while Tyler was not on duty. Moreover, there was no evidence that Tyler used his position, uniform, or equipment for the purposes of his indecent acts, nor were the acts committed on department property.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>As there was no \u201cdirect link\u201d between Tyler\u2019s conviction and his position, the judgment of the Superior Court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b152-8\">The Maynard board of retirement, in an unchallenged finding, concluded that there was \u201cno evidence\u201d that the incidents took place on town property or that Tyler was on duty when the incidents took place.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b152-9\">Tyler was indicted on three counts of indecent assault and battery on a person over fourteen.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b152-10\">Tyler was indicted on one count of rape and one count of indecent assault and battery on a person over fourteen.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b152-11\">During the subsequent hearing, Tyler\u2019s direct superior, Fire Chief Stephen Kulik, testified that while he was aware of the criminal charges against Tyler, as well as his arrest, the department took no action to discipline him. Furthermore, Kulik had a discussion with the board about Tyler\u2019s retirement application prior to its approval.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b152-12\">The District Court judge observed that \u201c[ajlthough Tyler knew his victims through his fellow firefighters, his offenses were personal in nature.\u201d The District Court judge went on to observe that \u201c[tjhere is no evidence in the record that Tyler used a fire truck ... to entice a young person; or that while in uniform he importuned a young person to visit a past fire site in order to commit indecent acts.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b155-10\">The board also claims that Tyler violated the rules of the department, which constitutes independent grounds to deny his pension. While his convictions violated the department\u2019s rules, and could have affected his employment or civil service status, they do not affect his pension, other than to say he could have been fired for moral turpitude and lost his pension.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b155-7\">Graham, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVC\">(dissenting). On October 12, 2006, Anthony Tyler, a Maynard firefighter and emergency medical technician (EMT), was indicted on charges that, for years, he had been sexually molesting his neighbor\u2019s minor child. Tyler\u2019s neighbor was a fellow Maynard firefighter. On the same day, Tyler resigned and submitted an application for superannuation retirement. His application was accepted, and Tyler began collecting retirement benefits. On March 20, 2008, he pleaded guilty to three counts of indecent assault and battery on a person fourteen years or older; he was sentenced to three years and a day in State prison and was placed on probation for five years, probation to commence from and after the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">After Tyler began serving his sentence, a second sexual abuse victim came forward, and on July 22, 2008, Tyler pleaded guilty to indecent assault and battery on a person fourteen years or older, and was sentenced to three years and a day, from and after the sentence he was already serving.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">Following the criminal proceedings, the Maynard board of retirement (board) conducted a hearing and determined that Tyler was required to forfeit his retirement allowance pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15(A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The board\u2019s decision was reversed by a judge of the District Court. On certiorari review, a judge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>the Superior Court quashed the decision of the District Court judge and remanded the case to the board, concluding that Tyler was not entitled to receive his retirement allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The majority has concluded that, while Tyler\u2019s criminal behavior was \u201creprehensible,\u201d his behavior and convictions do not constitute violations of the laws applicable to his position as firefighter, within the purview of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15(4), and did not involve the administration of his duties and responsibilities as a firefighter and EMT.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 15(4), was enacted \u201cto broaden the range of crimes that would lead to pension forfeiture\u201d after the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s decision in <em>Collates </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>396 Mass. 684 (1986). <em>Gaffney </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>423 Mass. 1, 3 (1996). To determine whether a member\u2019s criminal conviction falls within the scope of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15(4), we must \u201cconsider what laws are applicable to the office or position.\u201d <em>State Bd. of Retirement </em>v. <em>Bulger, </em>446 Mass. 169, 175 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">While there is no statute creating the position of firefighter, G. L. c. 48, \u00a7 42, as amended by St. 1973, c. 1048, \u00a7 1, provides for the establishment of fire departments and charges the department chiefs with \u201cextinguishing fires in the town and the protection of life and property in case of fire.\u201d \u201cThere are certain forms of employment which carry a position of trust so peculiar to the office and so beyond that imposed by all public service that conduct consistent with this special trust is an obligation of the employment.\u201d <em>Perryman </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boston, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 346, 349 (1983) (specifically mating reference to cases involving police officers, judges, and teachers). Illustrative of the special trust conferred on firefighters and EMTs is G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 21, as amended through St. 2008, c. 176, \u00a7 83, which includes firefighters and EMTs as \u201cmandated reporters].\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Mandated reporters are required to file a report if they have \u201creasonable cause to believe that a child is suffering physical or emotional injury resulting from . . . abuse inflicted upon him which causes harm or substantial risk of harm to the child\u2019s health or welfare, including sexual abuse.\u201d G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51A(a), as amended through St. 2008, c. 176, \u00a7 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The majority places great significance on the fact that Tyler\u2019s criminal convictions were for conduct that did not occur within the firehouse or while he was on duty. However, the required nexus is not that the crime be committed while the member was on duty, in the workplace, or using the tools of the workplace, but only that the criminal behavior be connected with the member\u2019s position. \u201cThe nature of [the member\u2019s] particular crimes cannot be separated from the nature of his particular office when what is at stake is the integrity of [the] system.\u201d <em>State Bd. of Retirement </em>v. <em>Bulger, </em>446 Mass. at 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Here, Tyler was sentenced to prison for repeatedly sexually abusing young victims, the very type of criminal behavior he was required by law to report. His convictions are directly related to his position as a firefighter and EMT because they demonstrate a violation of the public\u2019s trust as well as a repudiation of his official duties. Clearly, this is not a case where the words of the statute are \u201cstretched to accomplish a result not expressed.\u201d <em>Collatos, supra </em>at 687. Contrast <em>Herrick </em>v. <em>Essex Regional Retirement Bd., </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. 645, 654 (2010) (criminal behavior of a custodian, convicted of indecent assault and battery of his daughter, not directly linked with his job); <em>Scully </em>v. <em>Retirement Bd. of Beverly, </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. 538, 543-545 (2011) (action of a library employee, who kept images of child pornography on his home computer, did not present the type of direct link intended by the Legislature).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">I conclude that Tyler\u2019s convictions involved violations of the laws applicable to his positions as firefighter and EMT pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15(4), and mandated the forfeiture of his retirement allowance.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b155-11\">The statute states in pertinent part: \u201cIn no event shall any member after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>final conviction of a criminal offense involving violation of the laws applicable to his office or position, be entitled to receive a retirement allowance.\u201d G.
