L. c. 149, \u00a7 148, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>as appearing in St. 1956, c. 259.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge then trebled that amount pursuant to G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 150,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and judgment entered for $35,937.81; in addition to interest and costs, the judge also awarded attorney\u2019s fees of $25,000, pursuant to \u00a7 150. Medical\u2019s contention on appeal is that commissions do not constitute \u201clost wages and other benefits\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 150 so as to trigger the mandatory treble damages provision. G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 150, as appearing in St. 2008, c. 80, \u00a7 5. As we disagree with this view of the statute, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\"><em>Background. </em>The jury could have found from the evidence that Weber was employed by Medical as a sales representative from June to November, 2008. Weber\u2019s compensation was undisputed to include a base salary of $40,000 per year, plus commissions. Medical regularly paid Weber\u2019s base salary, but paid him only a single commission in the amount of about $3,100. After being laid off in November of 2008, Weber demanded Medical pay him his unpaid commissions, but Medical refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">After judgment entered on the jury\u2019s verdict in Weber\u2019s favor, and after an opportunity for the parties to brief the issue of treble damages, the judge determined that the \u201clanguage of the Wage Act regarding commissions has a broad application and is restricted only to its requirements that commissions be \u2018definitely determined\u2019 and \u2018due and payable,\u2019 \u201d citing <em>Okerman </em>v. <em>VA </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number><em>Software Corp., </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 771, 776 (2007). Thus, he concluded that \u201cthe commissions awarded constitute wages and that the trebling of said award is mandatory under the statute, as amended in July, 2008.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>A. <em>Directed verdict </em>\u2014 <em>reopening Weber\u2019s case. </em>Medical first makes two related procedural claims. It argues that the judge improperly denied its motion for a directed verdict on Weber\u2019s \u00a7 148 claim (nonpayment of commissions) because Weber never established that he exhausted his administrative remedies by filing a complaint with the Attorney General. Next, Medical complains that, after it moved for a directed verdict against Weber, the judge sua sponte reopened Weber\u2019s case-in-chief and read in evidence a portion of the parties\u2019 joint pretrial memorandum.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Neither contention has merit, in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">\u201cNothing is more common in practice or more useful in dispatching the business of the court than for counsel to admit undisputed facts.\u201d <em>Brocklesby </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>294 Mass. 41, 43 (1936). In their joint pretrial memorandum, the parties agreed that Weber filed a nonpayment of wage complaint with the Attorney General and received a right to sue letter. A pretrial order is \u201cdesigned to define, simplify, and limit the issues to be decided, reduce error, prevent surprise, promote judicial economy, and encourage settlement,\u201d <em>Slade </em>v. <em>Slade, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 376, 378 (1997) (quotation and citation omitted), primarily through admissions or stipulations by counsel, which are binding on the parties, see <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Walton Lunch Co., </em>305 Mass. 76, 80 (1940); <em>De-Luca </em>v. <em>Cleary, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 50, 52 (1999). See also Mass.R.Civ.P. 16, 365 Mass. 762 (1974).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Medical did not seek leave to have the stipulation vacated as \u201cimprovident or not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>conducive to justice,\u201d <em>Atlantic Pipe Corp. </em>v. <em>R.J. Longo Constr. Co., </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 459, 465 (1993), and we have no occasion to disturb it.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The judge properly reasoned that it was within his discretion to read the parties\u2019 factual stipulations to the jury notwithstanding Medical\u2019s assertion that Weber still bore the burden of production, despite the agreed fact.* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The decision whether \u201cto admit additional evidence after a party has rested lies in the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Vappi &amp; Co., </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 77, 83 (1989) (while holding that no abuse of discretion occurred by denying motion to reopen, \u201cto admit additional evidence after the evidence has formally closed may be indulgently exercised to remedy an oversight discovered shortly thereafter, before parties have changed position and before the case has gone to a next phase\u201d was implicit in judge\u2019s discretion). This is precisely what occurred here when the judge cured an oversight in failing to inform the jury that the parties had stipulated to Weber\u2019s receipt of a private right to sue letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Moreover, that the judge reopened Weber\u2019s case so that the jury could receive otherwise missing evidence supporting an essential element of Weber\u2019s case is not, in and of itself, an abuse of discretion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zavala, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 770, 777-779 (2001), in which the judge, sua sponte over the defendant\u2019s objection, improperly allowed the Commonwealth to reopen the case after both sides had rested, is not helpful to Medical. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>That case is distinguishable not only because it concerns a criminal matter, but more importantly because the judge allowed the Commonwealth to reopen the case to produce new, disputed evidence as to an essential element of the crime charged, not merely to read in evidence a stipulated fact. <em>Ibid. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ierardi, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 297, 302-303 (1983) (proper to allow Commonwealth to reopen case to introduce stipulated fact). In any event, we discern neither an abuse of discretion nor prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">B. <em>Treble damages. </em>Turning to the remaining claim, Medical argues that the judge improperly trebled the jury award as the phrase \u201clost wages and other benefits\u201d in \u00a7 150 cannot reasonably be read to encompass commissions. Relying on the ordinary rules of statutory construction, Medical points to that portion of \u00a7 148, added in 1943, specifically stating that the section applies \u201cso far as apt, to the payment of commissions.\u201d See St. 1943, c. 467. Medical thus argues that the use of the word \u201ccommissions\u201d in \u00a7 148, together with its absence from \u00a7 150, reflects a legislative intention, for the purposes of \u00a7 150, to distinguish between \u201ccommissions\u201d and \u201cwages and other benefits,\u201d thereby limiting the applicability of the trebling provision in \u00a7 150 to \u201cwages and other benefits\u201d and not to \u201ccommissions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">While not all benefits fall within the term \u201cwages,\u201d commissions have been held to do so. Section 148 \u201cexpressly states that holiday and vacation pay due under an agreement, as well as commissions that are definitely determined and due and payable to the employee, are wages within the meaning of [\u00a7 148], but [\u00a7 148] does not otherwise expressly define the term \u2018wages.\u2019 \u201d <em>Weems </em>v. <em>Citigroup Inc., </em>453 Mass. 147, 151 (2009). See <em>Wiedmann </em>v. <em>The Bradford Group, Inc., </em>444 Mass. 698, 708-710 (2005) (no issue concerning award of attorney\u2019s fees, costs, and treble damages on account of unpaid commissions, but case remanded due to judge\u2019s erroneous belief that treble damages were mandatory under former version of statute); <em>Rosnov </em>v. <em>Molloy, </em>460 Mass. 474, 483 (2011) (reversing award of treble damages under \u00a7 150 as 2008 amendment imposing mandatory trebling of damages did not apply retroactively; no issue raised that \u201cwages and other benefits\u201d did not include earned commissions).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">As Medical points out, the Legislature is presumed to be aware of the provisions of related statutes, and when both the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>1993 (St. 1993, c. 110, \u00a7 182) and the 2008 (St. 2008, c. 80, \u00a7 5) amendments to \u00a7 150 were made, allowing for a private right of action and making the trebling provision mandatory, respectively, it chose to maintain, without change or limitation, the fourth paragraph of \u00a7 148, which states in relevant part: \u201ccommissions so determined and due such employees shall be subject to the provisions of section one hundred and fifty.\u201d G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148. As observed by this court in <em>Okerman, 69 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 778 n.9: \u201cNotably, the commissions amendment to the wage act was added in 1943, see St. 1943, c. 467, and a private right of action, including provision for treble damages and attorney\u2019s fees and costs, was added to the statute in 1993, see St. 1993, c. 110, \u00a7 182. Therefore, despite any original intent of the statute as a means to provide compensation to aggrieved weekly earners, one may now discern a legislative intent to apply the benefits of the statute to current-day employees as defined in the statute, including executives and professionals earning a substantial base salary plus commissions.\u201d As no significant legislative changes bearing on this interpretation have been made since that decision,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we continue to view the trebling provision of \u00a7 150 as intended to be applied to commissions \u201cdetermined and due.\u201d G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148. Given the jury\u2019s verdict, the judge was correct to treble the commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b521-7\">The statute states, in relevant part, \u201c[t]his section shall apply, so far as apt, to the payment of commissions when the amount of such commissions, less allowable or authorized deductions, has been definitely determined and has become due and payable to such employee, and commissions so determined and due such employees shall be subject to the provisions of section one hundred and fifty.\u201d G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148, fourth par.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b521-8\">The second paragraph of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 150, as appearing in St. 2008, c. 80, \u00a7 5, states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-9\">\u201cAn employee claiming to be aggrieved by a violation of [section] . . . 148 . . . may, 90 days after the filing of a complaint with the attorney general, or sooner if the attorney general assents in writing, and within 3 years after the violation, institute and prosecute in his own name and on his own behalf, or for himself and for others similarly situated, a civil action for injunctive relief, for any damages incurred, and for any lost wages and other benefits. <em>An employee so aggrieved who prevails in such an action shall be awarded treble damages, as liquidated damages, for any lost wages and other benefits and shall also be awarded the costs of the litigation and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b522-7\">The judge stated: \u201cMembers of the jury, counsel were both kind enough to remind me that I neglected to read in some agreed-upon facts. These are facts that both sides agree upon and are not in dispute, and you accept these as true for the case. It\u2019s agreed that the plaintiff . . . filed a nonpayment of wage complaint with the Attorney General of the Commonwealth regarding the commissions he alleges are owed to him by the company, and he received a \u2018private right to sue\u2019 letter from the Attorney General\u2019s office.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b522-8\">Even without express incorporation of the parties\u2019joint pretrial memorandum in the pretrial order (see Mass.R.Civ.P. 16 and Superior Court Standing Order 1-88), implicit approval appears from the fact that the pretrial memorandum was executed prior to the date of the pretrial conference, the pretrial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>memorandum was submitted to the judge on the date of the pretrial conference, and the judge set a trial date without the need for further memoranda. The judge was correct to deem the pretrial memorandum effective as a stipulation of fact that binds the stipulating parties; it serves, therefore, to establish the facts contained therein without the need for further proof. See <em>Stuart </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>412 Mass. 251, 254-255 (1992); <em>New England Legal Foundation </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>423 Mass. 602, 609 n.7 (1996); <em>Sisk </em>v. <em>Assessors of Essex, </em>426 Mass. 651, 655 n.7 (1998); <em>Reliable Sewing Mach.

I have a duty to read this into evidence. Actually, it\u2019s an agreed-upon fact in the pretrial memo. That\u2019s more the court\u2019s omission. So I\u2019m going to deny [Medical\u2019s objection and motion for directed verdict] on that ground. I will read that stipulation into evidence. That\u2019s an admission. I always address that. And I\u2019m going to reopen the case \u2014 the plaintiff\u2019s case to allow that. I should have \u2014 I always have the pretrial memo to read that in.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b525-6\">We note that <em>Okerman </em>was decided prior to the 2008 amendment to \u00a7 150, which, as discussed <em>supra, </em>made mandatory an award of treble damages. That the trebling of damages for the nonpayment of commissions was reserved to a judge\u2019s discretion under the prior version of the statute is of no moment here; an award of treble damages, whether in an exercise of discretion or mandatorily, is nevertheless punitive. See <em>Goodrow </em>v. <em>Lane Bryant, Inc., </em>432 Mass. 165, 178-179 (2000); <em>DeSantis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth Energy Sys., </em>68 Mass.
