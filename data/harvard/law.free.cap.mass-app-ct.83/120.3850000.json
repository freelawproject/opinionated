See G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 30. Flaherty was the superintendent of the highway department at the time of the theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Flaherty contends that the forfeiture of his pension resulting from his conviction, as mandated by G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15(4),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> violates the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution ban on excessive fines. Flaherty also argues that the Superior Court judge, on certiorari review, erred in ordering that he repay all pension funds that he received in excess of his actual contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">Between the date of Flaherty\u2019s voluntary retirement and the date of his larceny conviction, Flaherty had received $148,098.84 in pension benefits. Of this amount, $84,090.82 represented the amount that Flaherty had contributed into his pension account, and $64,008.02 was an overage beyond his individual contributions (i.e., the difference between $148,098.84 and $84,090.82). For the reasons that follow, we affirm the order of forfeiture and the order for repayment of the overage.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>We summarize the facts from the record. Flaherty was employed by the city of Haverhill (city) beginning in 1962 and enrolled in the city\u2019s pension system that same year. In 2004, Flaherty became the superintendent of the city\u2019s highway department. Flaherty\u2019s son was also employed by the highway department from 1992 until 2007. Between 2004 and 2006, Flaherty and his son stole several truckloads of paving materials from the highway department for use in their private paving business.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">On April 6, 2007, Flaherty voluntarily retired and began receiving pension payments effective that date. On June 29, 2007, a grand jury returned six indictments against Flaherty, approximately three months after his voluntary retirement \u2014 a time sequence indicating that Flaherty would have been aware <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>of the criminal investigation at the time of his voluntary retirement. Following a trial, Flaherty was convicted on June 2, 2009, of larceny over $250 for the theft of the paving materials.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">After an administrative hearing, the city\u2019s retirement board (retirement board) ruled on September 2, 2009, that Flaherty\u2019s larceny conviction was connected to his position as the superintendent of the highway department. This triggered the automatic forfeiture of Flaherty\u2019s pension under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15(4).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>State Bd. of Retirement </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>446 Mass. 698, 705 (2006) (pension forfeiture under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 [4], occurs by operation of law and is a mandatory consequence of conviction connected to office).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Upon review of the retirement board\u2019s decision, a District Court judge concluded that the pension forfeiture was not an excessive fine for Eighth Amendment purposes. However, the District Court judge concluded that Flaherty was entitled to keep any pension funds he received prior to the date of his conviction on June 2, 2009 \u2014 even to the extent that the payments running to that date exceeded Flaherty\u2019s actual pension contributions. On further certiorari review, a Superior Court judge affirmed the pension forfeiture but determined that Flaherty could not retain any pension funds he received in excess of his actual pension contributions, and ordered the repayment of the $64,008.02 overage.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">2. <em>The Eighth Amendment challenge. </em>Flaherty concedes that his thefts were \u201ca criminal offense involving violation of the laws applicable to his office,\u201d thereby invoking G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15(4). See <em>Gaffney </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>423 Mass. 1, 4-5 (1996) (larceny by member of funds from department that member oversaw triggered \u00a7 15 [4]); <em>State Bd. of Retirement </em>v. <em>Bulger, </em>446 Mass. 169, 179-180 (2006) (clerk-magistrate\u2019s convictions of perjury and obstruction of justice effected pension forfeiture under \u00a7 15[4]); <em>Durkin </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., ante </em>116, 118-119 (2013). However, as previously noted, Flaherty contends that pension forfeiture was not justified because it was an excessive fine for his illegal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">\u201cThe excessive fines clause [of the Eighth Amendment] \u2018limits the government\u2019s power to extract payments . . . \u201cas punishment for some offense.\u201d \u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bajakajian, </em>524 U.S. 321, 328 (1998), quoting <em>Austin </em>v. <em>United States, </em>509 U.S. 602, 609-610 (1993).\u201d <em>MacLean </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Retirement, </em>432 Mass. 339, 345 (2000). A fine is excessive for Eighth Amendment purposes \u201cif it is grossly disproportional to the gravity of [the triggering] offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 346, quoting from <em>Bajakajian, </em>524 U.S. at 334. The precise issue whether a pension forfeiture under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15(4), may be punitive and a fine so as to invoke Eighth Amendment protection has not been decided in Massachusetts case law. Rather, the courts have assumed for purpose of analysis that the Eighth Amendment may apply to pension forfeiture. See, e.g., <em>MacLean, </em>432 Mass. at 346 (assuming without deciding that a \u00a7 15 [4] forfeiture is both punitive and a fine for Eighth Amendment purposes); <em>Maher </em>v. <em>Retirement Bd. of Quincy, </em>452 Mass. 517, 522 (2008), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 1909 (2009) (same). We follow that path of analysis here and assume that the Eighth Amendment applies to a G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15(4), forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Flaherty argues that the forfeiture of what would be $940,000 in lifetime pension benefits is grossly disproportional to his single larceny conviction when compared to the value of the paving material that he stole from the highway department. The record does not contain reliable information concerning the value of the stolen paving materials. Flaherty advances an estimate of between $500 and $600. Even accepting a value of $500 to $600 for purposes of analysis, we reject Flaherty\u2019s proportionality challenge. An appellate court will \u201creview the proportionality determination made by the [trial cotut] judge de nova ... by drawing the constitutionally required comparison <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>between the magnitude of the forfeiture required by statute and the gravity of the triggering offenses.\u201d <em>Maher, </em>452 Mass. at 523. See <em>Bajakajian, </em>524 U.S. at 336-337. So viewed, the proportionality analysis under the Eighth Amendment does not turn on whether the monetary value of the pension forfeiture exceeds that of the stolen materials. \u201c[A] penalty matching or exceeding any improper gain has greater deterrent value, and may be necessary and proper to enforce the law.\u201d <em>MacLean, </em>432 Mass. at 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">In evaluating the gravity of triggering offenses, courts \u201cgouge the degree of [the member\u2019s] culpability and consider the harm caused by the underlying offenses.\u201d <em>Maher, </em>452 Mass. at 523. In this case, in assessing Flaherty\u2019s degree of culpability, we rely on factors such as \u201cthe nature and circumstances of his offenses . . . [and] the maximum penalties authorized by the Legislature.\u201d <em>Ibid. A </em>felony conviction of larceny over $250 of public property is a serious offense. See G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 30. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>404 Mass. 282, 283 n.1 (1989). The circumstances demonstrate both the gravity of Flaherty\u2019s felony offense and his high degree of culpability.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Moreover, an aggravating factor is that Flaherty used the stolen paving materials in a side business he ran, which resulted in private gain by him. As noted, Flaherty stole resources from the very highway department that he supervised. And this was no solitary lapse in judgment. To the contrary, Flaherty effected his larceny over the course of three years, with continuing, separate acts of theft. That Flaherty acted in concert with his son, who was under his official supervision, also enhances the gravity of the offense. All of these factors add to Flaherty\u2019s culpability while undermining his disproportionality argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">As the District Court judge stated, \u201cFlaherty\u2019s actions undermine the public\u2019s confidence in the integrity and honesty of all public servants. Running a criminal enterprise with his son by stealing material that he has control over as superintendent of the highway department is about as confidence shattering as can be imagined.\u201d \u201c[T]he potential harm to the public trust. . . [is] as equally important to our analysis as any potential harm . . . to the public fisc.\u201d <em>Maher, </em>452 Mass. at 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">For these reasons, we conclude that the forfeiture of Flaherty\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>pension was not excessive, was not grossly disproportional to the gravity of his crime, and does not fall within Eighth Amendment proscriptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">3. <em>Reimbursement of excess pension funds. </em>Flaherty next challenges the Superior Court judge\u2019s order that he repay the $64,008.02 he received in excess of his actual pension contributions. The crux of Flaherty\u2019s argument is that the Legislature\u2019s use of the phrase, \u201cafter final conviction,\u201d in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15(4), entitles him to retain any pension monies paid to him until his conviction became final on June 2, 2009. Flaherty\u2019s theory would entitle him to keep pension payments disbursed to him after the discovery of his thefts and during the ensuing criminal investigation and prosecution. The practical effect of Flaherty\u2019s interpretation would be to bestow upon Flaherty a windfall of $64,008.02 beyond what he paid into the pension system. Had the Legislature envisioned this type of exception in the forfeiture statute, it could have so stated in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15(4). Courts do not \u201cread into the statute a provision which the Legislature did not see fit to put there.\u201d <em>General Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>429 Mass. 798, 803 (1999), quoting from <em>King </em>v. <em>Viscoloid Co., </em>219 Mass. 420, 425 (1914).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>Based on the foregoing, we affirm the Superior Court judge\u2019s decision (1) that the forfeiture of Flaherty\u2019s pension did not violate the Eighth Amendment and (2) that Flaherty repay all pension funds received in excess of his original contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b163-7\">General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 15(4), inserted by St. 1987, c. 697, \u00a7 47, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-8\">\u201cIn no event shall any member after final conviction of a criminal offense involving violation of the laws applicable to his office or position, be entitled to receive a retirement allowance under the provisions of section one to twenty-eight, inclusive, nor shall any beneficiary be entitled to receive any benefits under such provisions on account of such member.
