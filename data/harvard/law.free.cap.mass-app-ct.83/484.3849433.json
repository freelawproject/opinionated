L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E(b)(4), and doing so in a school zone, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J. On the defendant\u2019s consolidated appeal from his convictions and from the denial of his motion for a new trial, the Commonwealth concedes that the admission of certificates of drag analysis (drug certificates) violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional confrontation rights under <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>557 U.S. 305, 310-311 (2009) <em>(Melendez-Diaz)\u25a0 </em>We reject the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that the <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, we reverse the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">Notwithstanding the reversal, we address certain issues that remain live and will affect any further proceedings. Specifically, we address three points involving the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress recorded oral communications between a confidential informant (Cl), the defendant, and a codefendant, Victor Alvarado. First, the defendant argues that the averments in State Trooper Steven M. Racki\u2019s affidavit in support of a warrant for the one-party consensual recording of conversations under <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blood, </em>400 Mass. 61 (1987) <em>(Blood </em>warrant), failed to demonstrate the required nexus with organized crime. Second, the defendant contends that the <em>Blood </em>warrant was overbroad in scope. Third, the defendant argues that because the affidavit in support of the <em>Blood </em>warrant contained certain factual discrepancies (principally relating to telephone record information), the motion judge improperly declined to hold a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>hearing under <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154 (1978) <em>(Franks </em>hearing), to test the veracity of statements in the trooper\u2019s affidavit. We affirm the denial of the motion to suppress and the denial of the motion for a <em>Franks </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">In addition, we address the defendant\u2019s contention that double jeopardy barred the trial below and, hence, the convictions from which he now appeals. For reasons that follow, we conclude that there is no such double jeopardy obstacle.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>We briefly summarize the relevant background concerning the motion to suppress and shall supplement this background as needed in our analysis of particular issues. The defendant was arrested in connection with an undercover investigation by the State police in which cocaine was bought by the CL After a series of sample controlled \u201cbuys\u201d under police direction, Alvarado indicated to the Cl that he could procure a kilogram of cocaine on short notice, and the Cl advised Alvarado that he would be in touch about a purchase. Based on the large quantity of the planned purchase, Trooper Racki filed an affidavit in support of, and procured, a <em>Blood </em>warrant authorizing the tape recording of oral communications between the consulting Cl and other persons \u2014 including, but not limited to, Alvarado \u2014 involved in the deal for the kilogram purchase.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">On the day set for the controlled buy of the kilogram of cocaine, Trooper Racki, a surveillance team, and the Cl arrived at the housing development where the transaction was to take place. The Cl, under the <em>Blood </em>warrant, was equipped with a body wire to record his conversations. A car arrived at the site. The defendant was driving, and the two passengers were Alvarado and one Reggie Bragg.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Cl entered the car. The defendant and Alvarado produced the cocaine. The Cl placed a small amount on his tongue to test the quality. The Cl indicated to the individuals in the car that the cocaine was of acceptable quality. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>The body wire recorded the entire conversation that took place in the car among the Cl, the defendant, Alvarado, and Bragg. The Cl then exited the car under the guise of obtaining $24,000 in cash to pay for the cocaine. At that point, the Cl met with Trooper Racki and confirmed to the trooper that the cocaine was in the car, commenting, \u201cThat shit\u2019s good.\u201d The body wire recorded this conversation between the Cl and Trooper Racki.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Surveillance officers then converged upon the car and arrested the defendant, Alvarado, and Bragg. Seized from the car were two bricks of a white, powdery substance that laboratory analysis confirmed was cocaine. Each brick of cocaine was covered in cellophane and wrapped with duct tape and wax \u2014 a manner of packaging that, Trooper Racki testified at trial, is characteristic of the bulk sale of cocaine at the kilogram level of weight. Also seized from the rear cargo area of the car was $29,000 in cash. Seized from the defendant\u2019s person was a ledger that contained names, notations, monetary figures, and references to cocaine in street vernacular.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">2. <em>Harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt analysis. </em>In determining whether the constitutional error in the admission of the drug certificates was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard of review is whether, \u201con the totality of the record before us, weighing the properly admitted and the improperly admitted evidence together, we are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the tainted evidence did not have an effect on the [jury] and did not contribute to the [jury\u2019s verdicts].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vasquez, </em>456 Mass. 350, 360 (2010), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tyree, </em>455 Mass. 676, 701 (2010). The Commonwealth must establish that other properly admitted evidence of guilt was so \u201coverwhelming\u201d as to \u201cnullify any effect\u201d that the improperly admitted drug certificates might have had on the jury. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vasquez, supra </em>at 362, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tyree, supra </em>at 704 n.44.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The Commonwealth cites several pieces of evidence that, it submits, rendered the admission of the drug certificates harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. These include: (1) that the Cl, an experienced cocaine user, conducted a taste test of the cocaine and confirmed, \u201cThat shit\u2019s good\u201d; (2) Trooper Holland\u2019s testimony at trial that the substance seized had the appearance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>and texture of cocaine; (3) Trooper Racki\u2019s testimony that the substance \u2014 formed as a brick and sheathed in cellophane, duct tape, and wax \u2014 was packaged in a manner consistent with the distribution of individual kilograms of cocaine; (4) that the $29,000 in cash found in the car was suggestive of the proceeds from cocaine distribution; and (5) the defendant\u2019s ledger, which, according to the testimony of the Commonwealth\u2019s expert, Sergeant Feeney, resembled the type of record frequently used by dealers to keep track of transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">We conclude that these pieces of evidence, weighed either individually or in combination, were not so powerful as to \u201cnullify any effect\u201d of the admission of the drug certificates. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vasquez, supra </em>at 362, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tyree, supra </em>at 704 n.44.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Of the foregoing evidence, the Commonwealth relies most heavily on the Cl\u2019s taste test, which identified the substance as high quality cocaine. However, this subjective taste test lacks any scientific reliability. Indeed, even a positive field test \u2014 which, in contrast, has scientific underpinnings, and which may be conducted by a police officer experienced in drug investigations \u2014 does not mean, per se, that the error in admitting a drug certificate is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fernandez, </em>458 Mass. 137, 151 n.20 (2010) (\u201cno appellate case from Massachusetts has accepted as reliable field test results, regardless of the purpose for which they are offered\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>461 Mass. 354, 358-359 (2012) (police field test not dispositive in absence of testimony on officer\u2019s expertise and type of field test kit used); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Billings, </em>461 Mass. 362, 364-365 (2012) (police field test not sufficient without testimony on officer\u2019s expertise and testimony on actual test results). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>454 Mass. 808, 831 (2009) (field tests one factor in nullifying effect of drug certificates in circumstances where testing officers had seventeen and thirteen years, respectively, of narcotics investigation experience and both were subject to cross-examination); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Casali, </em>459 Mass. 139, 147 (2011) (police field test rendered drug certificates harmless beyond reasonable doubt only in combination with defendant\u2019s own testimony that seized substances were heroin and marijuana, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>defense counsel\u2019s concession on that point, and evidence that defendant was admitted to hospital for symptoms of heroin withdrawal one day after crime). Given that a field test may not meet the constitutional harmless error standard, a fortiori, a lay taste test \u2014 even when conducted by an experienced cocaine user \u2014 does not meet the grade of proof required to render the error in admitting the drug certificates harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The remaining pieces of evidence to which the Commonwealth cites, <em>supra, </em>fare no better in proving harmless error. Trooper Holland\u2019s trial testimony regarding the appearance of the substance, while relevant in light of his experience in the field, is not the type of potent evidence required to render constitutional error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dawson, </em>399 Mass. 465, 467 (1987) (\u201cit would be a rare case in which a witness\u2019s statement that a particular substance looked like a controlled substance would alone be sufficient to support a conviction\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vasquez, </em>456 Mass. at 365 (\u201cMistaken identification of cocaine by trained and experienced law enforcement personnel is not unknown in the annals of our law\u201d). Similarly, notwithstanding that Trooper Racki\u2019s testimony on the method of packaging may have provided a circumstantial link, \u201c[i]t is unlikely that the form of packaging is necessarily proof that a substance is a particular drug.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perez, 76 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 439, 444 n.4 (2010). Finally, that a large amount of cash was found in the car, and that the defendant possessed a ledger, may be probative of drug sales, but does not prove chemical composition. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vasquez, supra </em>at 366-367 (scale, rubber bands, cash, sandwich bags, and \u201cwalkie-talkie\u201d all relevant on issue of distribution but not on issue of chemical composition).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">3. <em>Motion to suppress recordings of conversations. </em>As previously noted, a Superior Court judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress recordings of certain cellular telephone conversations between the Cl and Alvarado, as well as the face-to-face conversations between the Cl and the defendant that were recorded by the Cl\u2019s body wire. We address these points of challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">a. <em>Challenge to the organized crime predicate in the </em>Blood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number><em>warrant affidavit. </em>General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 99, the so-called wiretap statute, sets forth a complex statutory framework governing the interception of communications by law enforcement officials and provides comprehensive procedures for judicial oversight and the procurement of warrants. See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vitello, </em>367 Mass. 224 (1975). Excepted from the full panoply of \u00a7 99 procedural requirements are communications recorded by law enforcement officers with the consent of one participating party while investigating designated offenses \u201cin <em>connection with organized crime.\u201d </em>G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 B 4, 7.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thorpe, </em>384 Mass. 271, 275-281 (1981), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1147 (1982). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Penta, </em>423 Mass. 546, 550-553 (1996) (full \u00a7 99 warrant not required where one-party consent exception applies).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">However, even if a full-scale interception warrant under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99, is not required, and even if the one-party consent exception applies, a warrant may still be required to comply with art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blood, </em>400 Mass. at 70-75. As noted, Trooper Racki submitted an affidavit in support of a <em>Blood </em>warrant to record one-party consensual conversations. The defendant contends that Trooper Racki\u2019s <em>Blood </em>warrant affidavit did not demonstrate a sufficient nexus to organized crime and, therefore, fell outside the one-party consent exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">We conclude that the motion judge was correct in finding the requisite connection with organized crime. The judge aptly analogized this case to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zuluaga, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 629 (1997) <em>(Zuluaga), </em>in which this court addressed what constitutes a \u201cconnection with organized crime\u201d for purposes of triggering the one-party consent exception. <em>Id. </em>at 633. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number><em>Zuluaga </em>similarly involved the street sale of a kilogram of cocaine, prior to which police had obtained a <em>Blood </em>warrant to record conversations between the informant-purchaser and the defendant-seller. <em>Id. </em>at 631. In the challenged affidavit in <em>Zuluaga, </em>the affiant State trooper stated, \u201c[I]t is my experience that persons involved in the distribution of kilogram and multikilogram quantities of cocaine necessarily conduct their activities in concert with others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 634. This affirmation, the <em>Zuluaga </em>court reasoned, in the factual context of the case, was sufficient to demonstrate a connection to organized crime. See <em>ibid. </em>And so it is in this case, where the language in Trooper Racki\u2019s affidavit, as well as the underlying circumstances, were nearly identical to those in Zuluaga,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">b. <em>Scope of the </em>Blood <em>warrant. </em>The defendant also contends that the <em>Blood </em>warrant lacked particularity because it was not limited to a specific range of dates and times. We disagree. The warrant, issued on December 8,2005, clearly states: \u201cThe authority granted by this order and warrant shall terminate fifteen (15) days after the issuance of said warrant.\u201d Given that the date of issuance is printed conspicuously on the warrant, its time limitations are unambiguous and precise.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Further, the defendant contends that the warrant was overbroad because it permitted the recording of \u201cunknown co-conspirators. \u201d This contention is likewise unavailing. At the outset of Trooper Racki\u2019s investigation, the parties to the cocaine distribution ring were still unascertained. Under those circumstances, it was not unreasonable for the warrant to permit the recording of unknown coconspirators. \u201cCommon sense dictates that warrants for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>seizure of oral communications not be limited in such a way as to preclude all flexibility and to endanger the safety of the informant or officer on whose body the transmitter is secreted.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Penta, </em>423 Mass. at 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">4. Franks <em>hearing. </em>We are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s assertions that the recordings were subject to suppression because he was improperly denied a <em>Franks </em>hearing. See <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154 (1978). In seeking a <em>Franks </em>hearing, Alvarado (with whom the defendant joined) focused on inconsistencies between Trooper Racki\u2019s <em>Blood </em>warrant affidavit and certain telephone records, specifically with regard to the number and timing of telephone calls made between the CI and Alvarado.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">There is a two-step process by which a defendant can challenge the veracity of statements in a search warrant affidavit. See <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>438 U.S. at 155-156; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amral, </em>407 Mass. 511, 522-525 (1990). The first step involves the holding of a threshold <em>Amral </em>hearing, the purpose of which is to determine whether the defendant is constitutionally entitled to the second step, a <em>Franks </em>hearing. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amral, supra </em>at 522-523, 525. In this case, a second Superior Court judge afforded the defendant the benefit of an <em>Amral </em>hearing. However, based on the <em>Amral </em>hearing, the judge determined the defendant was not entitled to a <em>Franks </em>hearing because he did not establish the requisite \u201csubstantial preliminary showing that the affiant [Trooper Racki] made a false statement knowingly and intentionally or with reckless disregard for the truth.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Douzanis, </em>384 Mass. 434, 437 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">In reaching this conclusion, the motion judge questioned Trooper Racki with regard to each potential discrepancy in the telephone records. Trooper Racki offered his explanations and reaffirmed that the affidavit was true to the best of his knowledge. The motion judge ultimately credited Trooper Racki\u2019s testimony and attributed the discrepancies to nonmaterial, bona fide mistakes. The motion judge further found that the contested misstatements were reconcilable with the telephone records and so concluded that \u201cthere was nothing that I found that caused me any concern to cast a doubt as to the veracity of the representations made by the affiant.\u201d In sum, we see no abuse of discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>tian in the motion judge\u2019s determination that the discrepancies did not rise to the level of requiring a <em>Franks </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">5. <em>Errors in first trial. </em>The convictions now on appeal resulted from the defendant\u2019s second trial (Trial II). His first trial (Trial I) resulted in a mistrial. He argues that Trial II was barred on double jeopardy and due process grounds, due to errors in Trial I.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">a. <em>Sufficiency of evidence at first trial and double jeopardy. </em>The defendant argues that in Trial I, the trial judge should have allowed his motion for a required finding after the Commonwealth rested and, thus, double jeopardy principles barred his retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">The defendant\u2019s claim is waived. The proper way to have raised a double jeopardy claim would have been by a motion to dismiss the indictments prior to Trial II; then, if that motion were denied, to have filed a petition for relief with a single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Steward, </em>396 Mass. 76, 77 n.2 (1985); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chatfield-Taylor, 399 </em>Mass. 1, 3 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ginnetti, </em>400 Mass. 181, 182 (1987). \u201cEven though the right to be protected from double jeopardy is fundamental to our legal system, \u2018that status alone has not put beyond the pale the idea that it may be waived by failure to raise it at a lower level.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Medina, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 708, 713 n.8 (2005), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Norman, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 82, 87, <em>S.C., </em>406 Mass. 1001 (1989). \u201c[B]y failing to assert the defense of double jeopardy prior to his second trial, the defendant waived the right to do so here.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spear, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 583, 587 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">b. <em>Misjoinder of indictments for trial. </em>Trial I encompassed three indictments: (1) trafficking in cocaine, (2) such trafficking in a school zone, and (3) conspiracy. Trial II addressed only the two substantive offenses.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant argues that due process and principles of fairness barred his retrial because Trial I violated Mass.R.Crim.P. 9(e), 378 Mass. 859 (1979), which provides that indictments for substantive offenses (here, trafficking) should not be tried jointly with indictments for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>conspiracy to commit those same offenses, absent the defendant\u2019s motion for such joinder. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>389 Mass. 473, 475 n.3, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 915 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Because there was such improper joinder under rule 9(e) in Trial I \u2014 which improperly combined the substantive and conspiracy indictments \u2014 the defendant contends that \u201ca broader scope of evidence\u201d may have been permitted in Trial I than would otherwise have been admissible. The defendant cites the Reporters\u2019 commentary to rule 9(e), which notes the \u201cmuch broader scope of admissibility of evidence permitted to prove [a] conspiracy charge.\u201d Reporters\u2019 Notes to Mass.R.Crim.R 9(e), Mass. Ann. Laws, Rules of Criminal Procedure, at 1407 (LexisNexis 2012-2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">The defendant suggests that without the \u201cbroader\u201d evidence that may have been admitted in Trial I in connection with the conspiracy indictment, he might well have been acquitted on the substantive charges, in which case he could only have been tried subsequently on the conspiracy charge, rather than on the substantive charges underlying his present convictions following Trial II. There are two fundamental flaws with respect to these contentions, and the defendant\u2019s challenge to Trial II. First, as to Trial II, which is the subject of this appeal, the defendant\u2019s brief has not cited even one piece of allegedly \u201cbroader\u201d conspiracy evidence that may have been introduced in Trial I, and that was introduced again (and should have been excluded under the defendant\u2019s theory) in Trial II (without a joined conspiracy).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Second, even assuming that the improperly joined conspiracy and trafficking indictments in Trial I hypothetically led to \u201cbroader\u201d evidence in Trial I (with the potential for spillover from the conspiracy to the substantive offenses), the defendant has suffered no resulting prejudice. Even if he had been convicted in Trial I, the defendant\u2019s remedy on appeal would have been a reversal of the Trial I convictions because of the improper joinder and a remand for retrial and further proceedings. In such further proceedings, the defendant could have been retried in one proceeding on both substantive offenses of trafficking and trafficking in a school zone. That is precisely what occurred in Trial II, which is the subject of this appeal. There, only the traf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>ticking and trafficking in a school zone indictments were joined for trial, with the conspiracy indictment separated out. Thus, even under the challenge advanced, the defendant is precisely where he would have been in terms of trial processes.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">In sum, the defendant\u2019s claims concerning double jeopardy and due process violations arising out of Trial I are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">6. <em>Conclusion. </em>Due to the constitutional error in the admission of the drug certificates, the judgments must be reversed. For the reasons stated in parts 3 and 4, there was no error in the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress or in the denial of the motion for a <em>Franks </em>hearing. Finally, we conclude that Trial II was not barred by double jeopardy or principles of due process.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">\n<em>Order denying motion to suppress affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">\n<em>Order denying motion for Franks hearing affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">\n<em>Verdicts set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">\n<em>Order denying motion for new trial reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b528-8\">Specifically, the warrant authorized \u201celectronic eavesdropping and tape recording of oral and video communications occurring face-to-face and/or by telephonic communications between Tpr Racki, [CI], Victor Alvarado, Kelli Fitzpatrick and/or as yet any of the unknown co-conspirators, who join in these conversations, which conversations constitute evidence of a violation of Chapter 94C of the General Laws.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b528-9\">Bragg later signed an agreement with the district attorney\u2019s office to testify for the Commonwealth in exchange for dismissal of his charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b532-7\">General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 99 B 4, as amended through St. 1968, c. 738, \u00a7 1, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-8\">\u201c[I]t shall not constitute an interception for an investigative or law enforcement officer, as defined in this section, to record or transmit a wire or oral communication if the officer is a party to such communication or has been given prior authorization to record or transmit the communication by such a party and if recorded or transmitted in the course of an investigation of a designated offense as defined herein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">Section 99 B 7 defines \u201cdesignated offense\u201d to include, inter alla, \u201csale of a narcotic\u201d \u201cin connection with organized crime.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b533-7\">Trooper Racki states in his affidavit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-8\">\u201cIt is also my opinion, based on my training and experience, and the collective experience of the officers involved in this case, that a high degree of discipline and organization is required for individuals such as Victor [Alvarado], and as yet any unknown individuals, to obtain and distribute, on a regular basis, quantities of Cocaine, a Class B controlled substance, and to collect the requisite funds for the purchase and further distribution, and to do this surreptitiously so as not to attract the attention of Law Enforcement. ...

These other alleged errors include, but are not limited to, the following: there was error in admitting statements of a codefendant recorded on the one-party consensually monitored tapes; there was error in the jury instructions concerning joint venture as connected to the trafficking charge; the jury verdict slip did not specify whether the jury found the defendant guilty on a joint venture or principal theory of proof; the prosecutor\u2019s closing improperly criticized the defense as \u201cdesperate\u201d; and the defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel in respect to eight variously described trial acts or omissions in representation. We are not persuaded that there were such errors as the defendant argues. In any event, we need not address these additionally alleged errors and omissions, which are unlikely to occur in any retrial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nutbrown, </em>81 Mass.
