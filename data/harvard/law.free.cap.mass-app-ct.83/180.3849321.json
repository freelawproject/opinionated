G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13H. He then moved to suppress those statements as involuntary. Following an evidentiary hearing, a District Court judge allowed the motion to suppress, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>explaining his reasoning in a detailed and thoughtful opinion. The Commonwealth obtained approval to pursue an interlocutory appeal. Because we agree with the Commonwealth that the motion judge misapplied the relevant legal principles, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\"><em>Standard of review. </em>The key evidence before the judge was the video recording of the defendant\u2019s interview. That recording speaks for itself, and the essential subsidiary facts necessary to resolve the motion to suppress are thus uncontested. Although the judge relied on his observations of what that recording revealed, he made no specific findings on this, apparently cognizant that an appellate court is \u201cin the same position as [him] in viewing the [video recording].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Novo, </em>442 Mass. 262, 266 (2004) (citation omitted). The judge did make factual findings as to the background facts and what transpired outside the interview room. We accept those findings unless they are clearly erroneous (which they have not been shown to be). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>420 Mass. 646, 651 (1995). The factual statements set forth below are drawn from those findings and our own observation of the video recording. We are to \u201cmake an independent determination of the correctness of the judge\u2019s application of constitutional principles to the facts.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mercado, </em>422 Mass. 367, 369 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\"><em>Background. </em>After interviewing the defendant\u2019s stepdaughter regarding her allegations, Revere police contacted the defendant by telephone on Friday, November 12, 2010, and invited him to come speak with them about the allegations. The defendant accepted that offer, and he went to the Revere police station that afternoon. He acknowledged during his interview that he had become aware of his stepdaughter\u2019s allegations on the previous Monday, four days earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">At the police station, Detective John Cannon greeted the defendant and brought him to the office of Sergeant Steven Pisano, the supervisor of the detective bureau. There, Pisano and Cannon conducted a \u201cpreinterview\u201d that lasted four to seven minutes. During this initial meeting, which was not recorded, the detectives obtained some biographical information from the defendant, and they used this preliminary encounter to gouge his mental state. The judge found, and the defendant does not contest, that \u201cPisano did not have any difficulty communicat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>ing with the defendant,\u201d that the defendant \u201cwas not under the influence of drugs or alcohol,\u201d and that the defendant \u201cappeared to be concerned and attentive . . . [and] to understand that it was a \u2018serious situation.\u2019 \u201d Although the detectives stated that they were investigating his stepdaughter\u2019s allegations of sexual assault, they did not question the defendant about those allegations during the initial meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The defendant was then brought to a dedicated interview room that was equipped with video equipment. The entire interview, which lasted approximately forty-three minutes, was recorded (and a copy is before us). We summarize the over-all course of the interview, reserving further detail for later discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The detectives did not begin to address the substance of the stepdaughter\u2019s allegations until nine minutes into the interview, and the period before that involved mostly preliminary matters. The detectives began by going over the defendant\u2019s Miranda rights and having him sign a written waiver form. They also recounted for the record what had occurred during the preinterview. Pisano, who took the lead throughout the interview, asked the defendant some basic background questions, and he established that the defendant was not currently under the influence of any drugs or alcohol, and had never been diagnosed with any mental illnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">During the first part of the interview, Pisano also set the stage for the substantive questioning that was to follow. He went over the nature of the defendant\u2019s predicament and the choices the defendant faced, and he implored the defendant to tell the truth. Pisano finally raised the stepdaughter\u2019s specific allegations that, about two weeks earlier, the defendant, while intoxicated, touched her underneath her bra and then down the front of her pants. Pisano then turned the floor over to the defendant to respond. This was thirteen minutes into the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">After a bit of hemming and hawing, the defendant said, \u201cYes, I do believe that [my stepdaughter] is telling the truth. And I . . . may have been drinking and that\u2019s what probably caused me to touch her inappropriately. You know, I didn\u2019t mean anything by it.\u201d However, while accepting his stepdaughter\u2019s allegations as true, the defendant then began to disavow personal knowledge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>of the events, claiming that he did not remember touching his stepdaughter in the alleged manner. Pisano repeatedly pressed the defendant on this, leading the defendant eventually to state \u2014 with regard to the specific allegations that he touched his stepdaughter underneath her bra \u2014 \u201cI might have grabbed her ... I grabbed her underneath . . . I\u2019ll say that.\u201d This prompted Pisano to state, \u201cDon\u2019t say it like you\u2019re saying it for us. Did you? If you didn\u2019t do it, you didn\u2019t do it.\u201d The defendant responded, \u201cI\u2019m saying that I did, and I\u2019m saying that I need help.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">After briefly discussing the extent of the defendant\u2019s drinking problem, Pisano turned to the stepdaughter\u2019s allegation that the defendant had reached down her pants and touched her in the vaginal area. The defendant disavowed any specific memory of doing this, and Pisano spent much of the remainder of the interview trying to get the defendant to change his stated position on this. The defendant never did admit that he remembered the vaginal touching. He did acknowledge that he knew that his behavior was wrong, and he affirmatively responded to Pisano\u2019s general statement that the stepdaughter was \u201cnot lying . . . [but] telling the truth.\u201d At that point, Pisano stated his view that the defendant had just admitted to all the allegations, and the interview wound to a close.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>The judge concluded that the defendant did in fact make \u201ca knowing[,] intelligent and voluntary waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.\u201d The defendant argues, albeit in passing, that this conclusion is undercut by the fact that the four- to seven-minute preinterview was not recorded. There is no merit to this argument. The police went over the defendant\u2019s Miranda rights in detail during the taped interview, and the defendant acknowledged at that time the limited nature of the preinterview (including that the police had made no promises or threats, nor had asked him to speak to his stepdaughter\u2019s allegations). In short, there is no reason to doubt that the defendant\u2019s Miranda waiver was anything other than voluntary, knowing, and intelligent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Of course, even with a valid Miranda waiver, any subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>statements must still be given voluntarily. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Magee, </em>423 Mass. 381, 387 (1996). The Commonwealth acknowledged that the defendant has raised a sufficient question about the voluntariness of his statements that it bears the burden of proving voluntariness beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 835, 841 (2007). <em>\u201cA </em>statement is voluntary if it is the product of a \u2018rational intellect\u2019 and a \u2018free will.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Selby, </em>420 Mass. 656, 662 (1995), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>403 Mass. 575, 581 (1988). The essential question is \u201cwhether [the] defendant\u2019s will was overborne by the circumstances surrounding the giving of [his] confession.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baye, </em>462 Mass. 246, 255 (2012), quoting from <em>Dickerson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>530 U.S. 428, 434 (2000). That inquiry requires an assessment of the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Selby, supra </em>at 663. Relevant factors include \u201cpromises or other inducements, conduct of the defendant, the defendant\u2019s age, education, intelligence and emotional stability, experience with and in the criminal justice system, physical and mental condition, the initiator of the discussion of a deal or leniency (whether the defendant or the police), and the details of the interrogation, including the recitation of Miranda warnings.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mandile, </em>397 Mass. 410, 413 (1986). The cases also emphasize the over-all length of the interview. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brian, </em>445 Mass. 720, 728, cert. denied, 549 U.S. 898 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">We begin by noting the absence of so many of the factors just listed. The defendant was an adult with some college education, and there was no reason to question his mental capacity.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> From all appearances he \u201cconsistently had control over both his actions and mental faculties . . . [and] was sober, alert, oriented, and lucid\u201d for the duration of the interview. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number><em>Durand, </em>457 Mass. 574, 597 (2010).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nor was this a case where the defendant was held for a lengthy period of time under difficult physical circumstances. Indeed, the entire interview was well under an hour even if the time spent in the preinterview is added. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brian, supra </em>(statements made during police interview that lasted \u201conly\u201d two and one-half hours determined not to be involuntary).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Before turning to the particulars of the judge\u2019s reasons for concluding that the defendant\u2019s statements were involuntarily made, we highlight the over-all trajectory of the interview. The defendant had become aware of his stepdaughter\u2019s allegations four days before he freely accepted the police\u2019s invitation to come tell his side of the story. Therefore, when he stepped into the interview room, he already had had considerable time to think about how he wanted to approach his predicament. Then, when the police turned over the floor to him to respond to the allegations, a mere thirteen minutes into the interview, the defendant did not offer any reasons as to why the stepdaughter might be lying or honestly mistaken. Instead, he stated his belief that she was telling the truth. In the half-hour that followed, the defendant specifically admitted to only one incident (touching his stepdaughter\u2019s breasts). The interview eventually came to a close when the defendant indicated that he agreed with Pisano\u2019s statement \u2014 phrased in general terms \u2014 that his stepdaughter was telling the truth (essentially the same admission he had made at the outset).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>The judge highlighted that, in imploring the defendant to tell the truth, Pisano equated this with the defendant\u2019s admitting to the stepdaughter\u2019s allegations. That is to some extent true, because Pisano made it clear that he believed the stepdaughter was telling the truth. As Pisano himself put it, especially in light of the fact that the stepdaughter still loved the defendant, \u201cthere is no reason for her to say this ... if it wasn\u2019t true.\u201d From what appears before us, Pisano had every reason to believe that the stepdaughter was telling the truth. Moreover, Pisano specifically invited the defendant to convince him otherwise, immediately qualifying the just-quoted language by adding, \u201cunless you could say, hey, Sergeant, I never did any such thing, and here\u2019s why I think she said it.\u201d There was nothing unfair in Pisano\u2019s recounting his honest assessment of the stepdaughter\u2019s allegations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In this regard, we note that at no point during the interview did Pisano overstate the evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>377 Mass. 319, 328 n.8 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiGiambattista, </em>442 Mass. 423, 436 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The judge concluded that \u201cPisano played upon the defendant\u2019s emotions by suggesting that an admission would keep his family together and that to deny the accusation was in effect calling his step daughter a liar.\u201d We agree with the motion judge that, to some extent, Pisano could be said to have been seeking to play upon the defendant\u2019s emotions. Indeed, perhaps the most pointed example of this is one that the judge did not highlight: Pisano\u2019s portrayal of the defendant\u2019s conduct as a breach of the trust his stepdaughter had placed in him as a father. However, we disagree that Pisano\u2019s conduct crossed the line in this regard. Notably, none of the specific statements that Pisano made in trying to get the defendant to open up was untrue. For example, there was no falsity in Pisano\u2019s assertion that if the defendant were to deny his stepdaughter\u2019s allegations without offering an alternative explanation, this would be tantamount to calling her a liar. We see nothing untoward about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>Pisano\u2019s encouraging the defendant not to put his stepdaughter through this. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berg, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 200, 203-206 (1994) (statement ruled voluntary even where suspect knew that it would prevent his mother from being charged with crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The judge also concluded that Pisano engaged in improper \u201cminimization\u201d of the crimes.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Similarly, he concluded that Pisano suggested that if the defendant confessed to the crimes (as minimized), this would lead him to be able to get the help he needed for his alcohol problem, and that the matter could be resolved through the defendant\u2019s getting such help. Certainly, Pisano did make various statements that fairly can be portrayed as downplaying the defendant\u2019s culpability. For example, he accepted that the defendant\u2019s alcohol abuse might well be the cause of his alleged conduct, he repeatedly referred to that conduct as a \u201cmistake\u201d that the defendant may not have meant (\u201cgood people make mistakes, but they\u2019re still good people\u201d), and at one point he characterized the defendant as having been merely a \u201clittle touchy feely.\u201d In addition, Pisano unquestionably did suggest to the defendant that decision makers in the criminal justice process likely would look favorably on his confessing, that doing so might serve the interests of getting this matter behind him, and that it could hurt him if people thought he was lying. For example, in pressing the defendant to show remorse, Pisano stated, \u201c[Tjhat\u2019s what they [presumably, prosecutors, judges, or juries] want to see.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">At the same time, Pisano never led the defendant to believe that his intoxication was a legal defense. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meehan, </em>377 Mass. 552, 564-565 (1979), cert. dismissed, 445 U.S. 39 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiGiambattista, </em>442 Mass. at 436. To the contrary, Pisano stated that it was <em>not </em>a legal defense, repeatedly emphasized that the defendant would have to \u201cface\u201d the situation in any event, and noted his belief that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>was going to be charged regardless.* *****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In addition, Pisano made it clear throughout that he could not make the defendant any specific promises of leniency. For example, Pisano specifically told the defendant, \u201cI can\u2019t promise you nothing except to bring the truth forward for you and to tell them that you cooperated and you . . . tried to be very honest with us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">On the whole, Pisano\u2019s statements fell within the general rule that \u201c[a]n officer may suggest broadly that it would be \u2018better\u2019 for a suspect to tell the truth, may indicate that the person\u2019s cooperation would be brought to the attention of the public officials or others involved, or may state in general terms that cooperation has been considered favorably by the courts in the past.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meehan, supra </em>at 564 (footnotes omitted). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Johnson, 463 Mass. 95, 105 (2012) (approving officer\u2019s statement to defendant, \u201cI want to give you the opportunity today to get out in front of this\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To the extent that Pisano may have improperly minimized the significance of the defendant\u2019s acts, \u201cthe use of such tactics alone does not render statements made by the defendant involuntary. Rather, the relevant focus is on whether the defendant\u2019s will was overborne.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Durand, 457 Mass, at 596. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brian, </em>445 Mass. at 727, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scoggins, </em>439 Mass. 571, 577 (2003) (confession voluntary where \u201cminimization was not combined with any false statement concerning the evidence or the strength of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, and the detective \u2018stopped short of making an assurance\u2019 regarding the benefits of confessing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">None of this is to say that the defendant necessarily would have made precisely the same admissions had the police not used their particular interview techniques. But whether the police were able to succeed in getting a suspect to admit to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>more than he otherwise might have is not the issue. Instead, the question is whether the interview techniques were so unfair or oppressive as to deprive the suspect of his \u201crational intellect\u201d and \u201cfree will.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Selby, </em>420 Mass. at 662 (citation omitted). Viewing, as we must, the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that the Commonwealth has met its burden of demonstrating that the defendant\u2019s will was not overborne. This is especially apparent based on the defendant\u2019s readiness from the start to accept his stepdaughter\u2019s allegations as true.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">One remaining issue bears comment. In trying to get the defendant to admit specific knowledge of the alleged vaginal touching, Pisano told the defendant that he would be in the \u201csame trouble\u201d if he admitted to this allegation, that it would be \u201cthe same charge\u201d as touching her breasts, and that the touching of the two areas was \u201call the same act.\u201d Based on this, the defendant contends that Pisano provided misleading information about the specific legal consequences of admitting to the vaginal touching.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Novo, </em>442 Mass. at 268-269 (statements ruled involuntary where police misstated defendant\u2019s right to testify). We need not resolve whether Pisano went too far in downplaying the legal import of such an admission, because any misstatements by Pisano on this score were ultimately of no apparent consequence; despite Pisano\u2019s best efforts, the defendant never specifically admitted to the vaginal touching. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durand, </em>457 Mass. at 597-598.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">\n<em>Order allowing motion to suppress reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b225-8\">While making remarks during the taped interview that characterized the choices the defendant faced, Pisano indicated that he was repeating some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>things he had already gone over in the brief preinterview. The judge made no specific findings about this, but for purposes of our review, we have assumed that the detectives did in fact make similar statements during the preinterview. None of these statements would have rendered the subsequent Miranda colloquy invalid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Although the record reveals that the defendant had a serious drinking problem, he specifically stated during the interview that he had not had a drink in five days.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The judge sought to support his ruling by observing that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s emotional state changes\u201d during the interview, that \u201c[tjoward the middle of the interview, the defendant is sagging in his chair in a somewhat slumped position . . . [and that he] appears somewhat distraught thereafter.\u201d Having viewed the recorded interview several times, we discern no distinct or pronounced change in the defendant\u2019s \u201cemotional state.\u201d In any event, it is hardly surprising or telling that a father admitting that he sexually assaulted his stepdaughter would appear \u201csomewhat distraught.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b227-7\">The judge characterized the path of the interview as follows: \u201cOver the course of the interview, the defendant\u2019s response to the accusations essentially changed from agreeing that the victim must be telling the truth, but having no knowledge of the events, to the defendant agreeing that he may have done some of what the victim says but has no memory of it because of intoxication, to the defendant admitting to some of the specific accusations.\u201d While that characterization is not strictly inaccurate, it suggests that there was a more dramatic transformation in the defendant\u2019s responses than occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Of course, Pisano\u2019s personal beliefs are ultimately irrelevant in proving the defendant\u2019s guilt.
