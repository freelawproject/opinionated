(Buccaneer), commenced an action in the permit session of the Land Court, appealing the denial of its application for a special permit by the zoning board of appeals (board) of the town of Lenox (town). G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 3A, inserted by St. 2006, c. 205, \u00a7 15. The special permit application sought permission to build a retirement community of twenty-three single-family homes on vacant land in the town. In its complaint, Buccaneer alleged that the board had erred as a matter of law and abused its discretion in denying the special permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>On February 1, 2008, the attorney for the board (town counsel) filed a \u201cnotice of transfer\u201d in the permit session, requesting that the case be moved to the Housing Court pursuant to G. L. c. 185C, \u00a7 20.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Land Court docket indicates that the \u201ccase [was] disposed by transfer\u201d on February 7, 2008, apparently by action of a clerk of the Land Court. The case was entered in the Housing Court on February 15, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Buccaneer filed a motion to remand the case to the permit session of the Land Court on February 21, 2008, which was denied by a judge of the Housing Court (motion judge). Two years later, following a bench trial in the Housing Court, the board\u2019s denial of the special permit was affirmed. Buccaneer appeals from the ensuing judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>The sole issue before us is whether the Housing Court had subject matter jurisdiction over this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cSubject matter jurisdiction is jurisdiction over the nature of the case and the type of relief sought, which among the various trial courts ... is both conferred and limited by statute.\u201d <em>Middleborough </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>449 Mass. 514, 520 (2007) (quotations and citations omitted). Simply put, the question is: \u201cHas the Legislature empowered the court to hear cases of a certain genre?\u201d <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 3974 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>457 Mass. 53, 56-57 (2010), quoting from <em>Wachovia Bank, Natl. Assn. </em>v. <em>Schmidt, </em>546 U.S. 303, 316 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">We begin our inquiry with the language employed by the Legislature in G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 3A (permit session law or statute). See <em>Norfolk &amp; Dedham Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>456 Mass. 463, 468 (2010). In 2006, the permit session was created within the Land Court Department as part of a far-ranging emergency law, St. 2006, c. 205, entitled \u201cAn Act Relative to Streamlining and Expediting the Permitting Process in the Commonwealth.\u201d This separate Land Court session was established so that \u201call permit-related litigation involving large <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>projects may be heard by a designated judge on an accelerated track in order to promote speedy disposition of disputes.\u201d Scheier, At the Land Court \u2014 Innovation Is the Order of the Day, 55 Boston BJ. 23, 24 (2011). The reform legislation took effect on August 2, 2006, by emergency preamble.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">General Laws c. 185, \u00a7 3A, provides that the \u201c[pjermit session shall have original jurisdiction, concurrent with the superior court department, over civil actions in whole or in part: <em>(a) </em>based on or arising out of the appeal of any municipal, regional or state permit . . . , or the denial thereof, concerning the use or development of real property, . . . [and] arising under . . . chapters 30A, 40A to 40C inclusive ... or any local bylaw or ordinance.\u201d A case can be filed in the permit session \u201conly if the underlying project or development involves either 25 or more dwelling units or the construction or alteration of 25,000 square feet or more of gross floor area or both.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Ibid. </em>It is undisputed that the proposed project here involved the construction of more than 40,000 square feet of gross floor area. Buccaneer\u2019s case met the jurisdictional requirements for the permit session, and was approved for filing in the permit session by the recorder of the Land Court by an endorsement on Buccaneer\u2019s civil cover sheet.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">For actions not commenced in, but within the jurisdiction of, the permit session, the statute authorizes any party to file a motion with the chief justice of the trial court to transfer the action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>to the permit session. \u201cIf a party to an action commenced in or transferred to the permit session claims a valid right to a jury trial, [t]hen the action shall be transferred to the superior court for a jury trial.\u201d G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 3A, fourth par. There is no provision in the statute that allows the transfer of a pending permit session case to any other trial court department of the Commonwealth, including the Housing Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">In denying Buccaneer\u2019s request to remand the case to the Land Court, the motion judge ruled: \u201cPrior to the adoption of G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 3A (c. 205, \u00a7 15 of St. 2006) this court had subject matter jurisdiction over this residential zoning case. G. L. c. 185C, \u00a7 3; G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17. Nothing in c. 185, \u00a7 3A purports to change this court\u2019s jurisdiction. Rather, that statute adds a new forum to the existing scheme.\u201d We disagree with the motion judge\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The legislative purpose of the permit session law is readily apparent from its title<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and its text. The permit session was created by the Legislature to serve as a specialized judicial forum, bound by strict time standards, in order to promote the expeditious resolution of permit-based civil cases stemming from large development projects. Original jurisdiction of such cases is conferred only on the permit session and the Superior Court. Conspicuously absent from the permit session law\u2019s jurisdictional designation is the Housing Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">General Laws c. 185C, \u00a7 3, confers general jurisdiction on the Housing Court over G. L. c. 40A appeals, concurrently with the District Court and Superior Court, and G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, authorizes appeals of final decisions of a permitting authority to the Land Court, Superior Court, or, if the land is in Hampden Country, \u201cto the division of the housing court department for said county.\u201d In contrast, in G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 3A, the Legislature did not grant authority to the Housing Court to adjudicate the types of actions specified by the statute. The statute does not allow any necessary inference to the contrary, and \u201c[w]e will not expand or limit the meaning of a statute unless such is required by the \u2018object and plain meaning\u2019 of the statute.\u201d <em>Norfolk &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number><em>Dedham Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>456 Mass. at 468, quoting from <em>Rambert </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>389 Mass. 771, 773 (1983). See <em>Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>318 Mass. 741, 747 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The legal conclusion to be drawn from the Legislature\u2019s omission of the Housing Court from the permit session law\u2019s jurisdictional designation is clear. \u201cIf the omission was intentional, no court can supply it. If the omission was due to inadvertence, an attempt to supply it. . . would be tantamount to adding to a statute a meaning not intended by the Legislature.\u201d <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>312 Mass. 154, 161 (1942). See <em>Cranberry Realty &amp; Mort. Co. </em>v. <em>Ackerley Communications, Inc., 17 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 255, 257 (1983). When the Legislature has employed specific language in one statute but not in another, \u201cthe legislative language should not be implied where it is not present.\u201d <em>Beeler </em>v. <em>Downey, </em>387 Mass. 609, 616 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\"><em>It is </em>also readily apparent that the Legislature has covered the field of permit-based actions arising from large-scale projects with its enactment of the permit session law. \u201cIt is a general principle that, where a statute covers the whole subject to which it relates, including means for redress for wrongs arising in connection with it, other provisions of law are superseded.\u201d <em>Knowlton </em>v. <em>Swampscott, </em>280 Mass. 69, 71 (1932). That is the situation here. The more recent, specific permit session law controls over G. L. c. 185C, \u00a7 3, and G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, which relate generally to permit-based zoning appeals. See <em>Planning Bd. of Hingham </em>v. <em>Hingham Campus, LLC, </em>438 Mass. 364, 367 (2003). The Housing Court\u2019s general grant of jurisdiction under G. L. c. 185C \u201cmust be construed in light of other statutes dealing more specifically with the permitting process.\u201d <em>Bagley </em>v. <em>Illyrian Gardens, Inc., </em>401 Mass. 822, 824 (1988). By explicitly granting jurisdiction to the permit session and the Superior Court to hear permit-based civil actions involving large-scale projects, the Legislature implicitly denied such jurisdiction to the Housing Court. See <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">The fact that this case was tried in the Housing Court is of no consequence. \u201cConsent or waiver by parties cannot confer jurisdiction over a cause not vested in the court by law.\u201d <em>Maley </em>v. <em>Fairhaven, </em>280 Mass. 54, 56 (1932). See <em>McDougall </em>v. <em>Acres, </em>427 Mass. 363, 371 (1998), quoting from <em>Litton Bus. Sys., Inc. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>383 Mass. 619, 622 (1981) (\u201cit is well-settled law that \u2018[sjubject matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred by consent, conduct or waiver\u2019 \u201d). Nor is it of any relevance that the Housing Court may have been more convenient for the board, as opposed to the permit session. Venue is largely a matter of the parties\u2019 convenience; venue and subject matter jurisdiction, however, \u201care not concepts of the same order.\u201d <em>Wachovia Bank, Natl. Assn. </em>v. <em>Schmidt, </em>546 U.S. at 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The corrected judgment dated December 14, 2010, is vacated, and the matter is remanded to the Housing Court, where the order denying Buccaneer\u2019s motion to remand to the Land Court is to be reversed, and a new order is to be entered allowing such motion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b83-8\">General Laws c. 185C, \u00a7 20, as amended through St. 1992, c. 379, \u00a7 56, provides in relevant part, \u201cAny civil action within the jurisdiction of the housing court department which is pending in another [trial] court department may be transferred to the Housing Court by any party thereto.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b83-9\">Apart from the threshold jurisdictional question, Buccaneer raises other assignments of error related to the merits of the case, which we do not address.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b84-7\">The preamble provides: \u201cThe deferred operation of this act would tend to defeat its purpose, which is to forthwith expedite the permitting process in the commonwealth, therefore it is hereby declared to be an emergency law, necessary for the immediate preservation of the public convenience.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b84-8\">The statute sets out strict time standards for actions filed in the permit session. For an \u201cA\u201d case, the track designation of Buccaneer\u2019s action, a trial must commence no later than twelve months from the filing of the action. G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 3A, sixth par. Matters assigned to the \u201cF\u201d track must be tried within nine months of commencement; and \u201cX\u201d track cases must be tried within six months. <em>Ibid. </em>The Legislature also directed the Land Court to establish a procedure for mediation, subject to court rules, that promotes the \u201cexpeditious resolution\u201d of cases \u201cwithin the time periods provided in this chapter.\u201d G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 3A, ninth par.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b84-10\">A plaintiff initiating an action for review in the permit session must complete and file a specific civil cover sheet, the terms of which require the plaintiff\u2019s counsel to certify that the action satisfies \u201cthe threshold requirements for the permit session.\u201d Buccaneer filed the necessary cover sheet.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b85-8\">The title of an act is helpful in interpreting the language of a statute, though it is not conclusive. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund </em>v. <em>Safety Ins. Co., </em>439 Mass. 309, 315 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b87-7\">The case shall be adjudged in light of the town by-law as it existed in December, 2007. We see no merit in the board\u2019s suggestion that Buccaneer\u2019s notice of appeal was untimely.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
