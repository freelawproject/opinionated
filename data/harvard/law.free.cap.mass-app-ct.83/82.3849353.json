Despite the difference in the spelling of the defendant\u2019s name in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>455 Mass. 408 (2009), and <em>Bell </em>v. <em>State, </em>105 Nev. 352 (1989), there is no dispute that the defendant here is the same defendant as in those cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b124-14\">Meade, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AmO\">After a jury-waived trial, the defendant was convicted of failing to register as a sex offender in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178H(a). On appeal, he claims that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction, and that the admission in evidence of a Texas sex offender registry document violated his right to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The defendant stipulated that in 1988 he had been convicted of a 1985 attempted child sexual assault in Nevada,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and a certified record of that Nevada conviction was admitted in evidence without objection. The defendant also stipulated that at the time of his 2004 arrest in Massachusetts, he had not registered as a sex offender in the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">At trial, the defendant\u2019s former wife identified him and testified that she met him through the Internet. At the time, she was residing in Texas and he was in Nevada. The two were married in Texas in 2000 and resided there. In 2002, they moved to Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">The defendant\u2019s former wife was familiar with his signature, and she identified it on two Nevada sex offender registration forms. She also identified the defendant\u2019s signature on six separate Texas sex offender registration forms.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These forms were admitted in evidence over the defendant\u2019s objections based on relevance and the confrontation clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>The defendant claims that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. \u201cWhen analyzing whether the record evidence is sufficient to support a conviction, an appellate court is not required to \u2018ask itself whether <em>it </em>believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 (emphasis in original). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Velasquez, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 147, 152 (1999), quoting from <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-319 (1979). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hartnett, </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. 467, 475 (2008). Rather, the relevant \u2018question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>(emphasis in original). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979), quoting from <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, supra.\u201d Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Romero, </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. 791, 794 (2011), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pixley, </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. 624, 630 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">When evaluating sufficiency, the evidence must be reviewed with specific reference to the substantive elements of the offense. See <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, supra </em>at 324 n.16; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, supra </em>at 677-678. In the circumstances of this case, to establish the defendant\u2019s guilt of failure to register as a sex offender in violation of G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178H(a), the Commonwealth was required to prove that the defendant (1) had been convicted of a listed Massachusetts \u201csex offense\u201d or a \u201clike violation\u201d in another jurisdiction, in accordance with G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C; (2) was a resident of Massachusetts; (3) failed to register in Massachusetts; and (4) failed to do so knowingly. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Becker, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 81, 85-89, cert. denied, 555 U.S. 933 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">(i) <em>\u201cLike violation.\u201d </em>In this Commonwealth, a \u201csex offender\u201d includes any resident who has been convicted of a \u201csex offense,\u201d which is defined as either a violation of a Massachusetts statute enumerated in the sex offender registry law, or \u201ca like violation of the laws of another state.\u201d G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C, as appearing in St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7 2. Any sex offender moving into the Commonwealth from another State must, within two days of his arrival, register with the Sex Offender Registry Board (board). See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178E(g). The defendant claims that he is not a \u201csex offender\u201d because his Nevada conviction of attempted child sexual assault was not a \u201csex offense,\u201d as it did not constitute a \u201clike violation\u201d of one of the enumerated Massachusetts offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The defendant does not contest that the Massachusetts crime of rape of a child in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A, an offense listed in \u00a7 178C, is sufficiently similar to the Nevada crime of sexual assault against a child in violation of Nev. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 200.366 (2011),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for purposes of G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178E(g). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>Moreover, an attempt pursuant to G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 6, to commit a Massachusetts offense listed in \u00a7 178C is itself a listed offense. Here, however, the defendant claims that the inchoate crimes of attempt in each jurisdiction are not sufficiently similar to meet the \u201clike violation\u201d standard for registration purposes. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The sex offender registration statute does not define the term \u201clike violation,\u201d but the Supreme Judicial Court has endorsed this court\u2019s view of the matter. \u201cA Tike violation\u2019 is a conviction in another jurisdiction of an offense of which the elements are the same or nearly the same as an offense requiring registration in Massachusetts. The elements of the offense in another jurisdiction need not be precisely the same as the elements of a Massachusetts sex offense in order for it to constitute a Tike violation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 151564 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>456 Mass. 612, 615-616 (2010) <em>(Doe No. 151564), </em>citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Becker, supra </em>at 87. This definition was chosen because the Legislature did not intend that the crimes be identical, but only that they be \u201clike\u201d one another. <em>Doe No. 151564, supra </em>at 616.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Under Nevada law, an \u201cattempt\u201d is an \u201cact done with the intent to commit a crime, and tending but failing to accomplish it.\u201d Nev. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 193.330 (2011). The elements of an attempt in Nevada are \u201c(1) an intent to commit a crime, (2) performance of some overt act towards its commission, and (3) failure to consummate its commission.\u201d <em>Larsen </em>v. <em>State, </em>86 Nev. 451, 453 (1970). See <em>Bell </em>v. <em>State, </em>105 Nev. 352, 354 (1989) . Under Massachusetts law, \u201c[wjhoever attempts to commit a crime by doing any act toward its commission, but fails in its perpetration, or is intercepted or prevented in its perpetration,\u201d is guilty of attempting to commit a crime. G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 6. \u201cThe elements required for a finding of attempt are (1) specific intent, (2) an overt act, and (3) nonachievement of the substantive crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>455 Mass. 408, 412 (2009), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>408 Mass. 463, 470 (1990) . See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Buswell, ante </em>1, 5 (2012). As can be seen, the elements for an attempt are the same in both jurisdictions. Both require a specific intent to commit the underlying offense, an overt act towards that commission, and a failure to complete the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>An additional common denominator of an attempt is the use of a proximity approach in both jurisdictions. In the defendant\u2019s Nevada case, the Nevada Supreme Court noted that \u201cmost cases upholding attempt convictions do involve situations in which there was a physical or dangerous proximity to successfully committing the crime.\u201d <em>Bell </em>v. <em>State, </em>105 Nev. at 354. Moreover, under Nevada law, \u201cmere preparation to commit a crime is insufficient to constitute an attempt.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In Massachusetts, the same is true. \u201c[W]e look to the actions left to be taken, or the \u2018distance or gap between the defendant\u2019s actions and the (unachieved) goal of the consummated crime \u2014 the distance must be relatively short, the gap narrow, if the defendant is to be held guilty of a criminal attempt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bell, supra </em>at 415, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hamel, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 250, 258 (2001). \u201cThat an overt act although coupled with an intent to commit the crime commonly is not punishable if further acts are contemplated as needful, is expressed in the familiar role that preparation is not an attempt. But some preparations may amount to an attempt. It is a question of degree.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peaslee, </em>177 Mass. 267, 272 (1901) (Holmes, C.J.). To determine what conduct constitutes a sufficient overt act, a court is required to \u201cdetermine if the evidence of preparations taken by the defendant proceeded sufficiently close to the substantive crime to amount to an attempt. Factors to take into account in determining how proximate the overt act must be to the commission of the substantive offense are the gravity of the crime, the uncertainty of the result, and the seriousness of any threatened danger.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bell, supra </em>at 414.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Focusing on one aspect of his Nevada case, the defendant (as does the dissent) points out that under Nevada law, \u201cwhen the design of a person to commit a crime is clearly shown, slight acts done in furtherance of that crime will constitute an attempt.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number><em>Bell </em>v. <em>State, </em>105 Nev. at 354. In Nevada, as the evidence of intent is more clear, less evidence of an overt act in furtherance of that intent is required to constitute an attempt. <em>Id. </em>at 355. From this, the defendant argues that because our law is more stringent than Nevada law, a person could be convicted in Nevada of an attempt based on conduct that could lead to an acquittal in the Commonwealth. In support, the defendant relies on a sentence in <em>Doe No. 151564, </em>456 Mass. at 616, where the court stated that \u201cwe consider the Tike violation\u2019 requirement satisfied where it is shown that the proof necessary for the out-of-State conviction would also warrant a conviction of a Massachusetts offense for which registration is required.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">However, the Supreme Judicial Court did not hold that this was the <em>only </em>way the Tike violation\u2019 requirement could be satisfied. Indeed, <em>Doe No. 151564 </em>is a very different case from the instant matter. In <em>Doe No. 151564, </em>the Maine and Massachusetts statutes differed in the elements required to prove the crime at issue. At bottom, these differences were deemed inconsequential because both statutory formulations \u201cprohibit essentially the same conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 617. Here, the elements are identical, and both statutory formulations \u201cprohibit essentially the same conduct.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Where we are to focus on the essence of the crime at issue rather than require a \u201clike violation\u201d to have identical elements, it would make little sense to then insist that the Commonwealth establish that in every respect the proof required for each element of the offense in each jurisdiction must be identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Furthermore, the dissent maintains that the greater stringency with which Massachusetts defines an attempt can lead to an acquittal in the Commonwealth for behavior identical to that resulting in a Nevada conviction. <em>Post </em>at 93. This possibility is not only hypothetical, but unlikely. See <em>Bell </em>v. <em>State, </em>105 Nev. at 354. In fact, this concern is unwarranted because an analysis of the \u201cessence\u201d of the two crimes leads to the conclusion that they are the same or nearly so. Were it otherwise, to protect against the occurrence of the dissent\u2019s hypothetical, the board would have to examine the conduct underlying the out-of-State conviction. This, however, has been prohibited by the Supreme Judicial Court as \u201ccontrary to the obvious intent of the Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>to treat sex offenses in the same manner regardless of where the offenses were committed.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Doe No. 151564, supra </em>at 619. In a similar vein, it would defeat the purpose of the statute to permit a hypothetical set of circumstances to defeat the registration requirement when we are evaluating the similarity of qualifying offenses rather than quintessential types of conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">In fact, this case is a prime example of why we cannot look beyond the essence of the crimes, because for purposes of an attempt \u201c[e]very question of proximity must be determined by its own circumstances.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>170 Mass. 18, 22 (1897) (Holmes, J.). To demur, as the dissent does, because some \u201cslight acts\u201d in some narrow circumstances might be an attempt in Nevada and not here places any crime of attempt in Nevada beyond our registration law. To do so leaves meaningless the Legislature\u2019s choice of the word \u201clike\u201d over one meaning \u201cidentical,\u201d as well as the idea that we are to be evaluating the \u201cessence\u201d of the crimes for sufficient similarity, not searching for genetic clones.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">(ii) \u201cKnowingly.\u201d The defendant also claims that the Commonwealth failed to present sufficient evidence that the defendant knowingly failed to register as a sex offender. We disagree. More specifically, the defendant claims there was no evidence that the board or any government entity notified him that he had a duty to register in Massachusetts. However, neither the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>nor our case law imposes such a burden on the government when a sex offender relocates here. In fact, the Legislature has put the burden on the defendant to comply with registration requirements. G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178E(g). Cf. <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>434 Mass. 418, 428-429 (2001) (\u201cProcedural due process does not require the board to send out notices of hearings to persons before it may require those persons to cooperate in telling the board where notices should be sent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The defendant also claims that the forms he signed in Nevada and Texas were not sufficient to demonstrate that he knew he had a duty to register as a sex offender in Massachusetts. We disagree. In the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, this evidence demonstrated that the defendant was informed of his requirement to register in Nevada as a result of his conviction of attempted sexual assault, and that he did so register. The evidence also revealed that when the defendant moved to Texas, he registered there as a sex offender based on his Nevada conviction. Also, in Texas, the defendant signed the Texas sex offender registration form, which stated that he understood the requirements of Texas law, including registering in another State should he move. From this evidence, the judge was entitled to draw the permissible inference that the defendant knew he had to register in Massachusetts. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramirez, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 9, 12 (2007). The motion for a required finding of not guilty was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">b. <em>Confrontation. </em>The defendant claims that the admission in evidence of a Texas sex offender registry document violated his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We disagree. After the defendant filed his brief in this case, we held in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>81 Mass. App. Ct. 244, 245-246 (2012), that the admission in evidence of the board\u2019s records kept in the ordinary course of the board\u2019s affairs, in the absence of a witness who created them, did not violate the confrontation clause because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>the records were not testimonial. The same is true here. The Texas records were certified documents created on forms produced by the crimes record service of the Texas Department of Public Safety. The document in question states it is to be used \u201cfor sex offender registrant purposes only.\u201d As in <em>Fox, </em>we conclude that the document was created \u201cfor the administration of an entity\u2019s affairs and not for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 245, quoting from <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>557 U.S. 305, 324 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b125-9\">See <em>Bell </em>v. <em>State, </em>105 Nev. 352 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b125-10\">The indictment identifies the date of the offense of failing to register as March 25, 2004.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b125-11\">Portions of these documents were redacted at the defendant\u2019s request.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b126-8\">The current Nevada statutes cited in this opinion do not vary in material respects from those in effect in 1985 at the time of the defendant\u2019s crime of attempted child sexual assault.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The dissent claims the Nevada Supreme Court has rejected the proximity approach in <em>Bell </em>v. <em>State, </em>105 Nev. at 354-355. <em>Post </em>at 91. A closer examination of this portion of the court\u2019s opinion reveals only that it rejected Bell\u2019s <em>argument </em>based on the proximity approach, not the approach itself. Even if the dissent\u2019s reading is correct, that view boils down to the same claim that because an attempt (in some circumstances) is easier to establish in Nevada than it is in Massachusetts, the offenses are not \u201clike\u201d offenses. As explained below, we do not share that view.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b130-7\">If permitted, such an examination in this case would quite likely yield the conclusion that the actions underlying the defendant\u2019s Nevada attempt would have supported an attempt conviction under Massachusetts law as well. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Buswell, supra </em>at 5, with <em>Bell </em>v. <em>State, </em>105 Nev. at 353, 355. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Buswell, supra </em>at 6-9, distinguishing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>455 Mass. at 415-417.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b130-8\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s claim, he does not benefit from the rule of lenity where there is no ambiguity in the \u201clike violation\u201d language at issue, and no substantial question that the Nevada crime is a qualifying sex crime in the Commonwealth. See <em>Doe No. 151564, </em>456 Mass. at 618-619. Also, the defendant\u2019s claim, raised for the first time on appeal, that a novel statutory interpretation is being applied retroactively to him in violation of his State and Federal due process rights, besides being waived, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Becker, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. at 93, has no merit where our straightforward reading of the sex offender registration statute is not \u201cunexpected and indefensible by reference to the law which had been expressed prior to the conduct in issue.\u201d <em>Santiago </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>428 Mass. 39, 43 (1998), quoting from <em>Stokes </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>368 Mass. 754, 773 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Although the defendant objected at trial on confrontation grounds, the thrust of Ms argument was that the document was not relevant. He did not argue at trial that tMs document does not qualify as a business record. On appeal, he claims that it does not matter whether it is admissible as a business record. Any argument that the document does not constitute a business record is therefore waived. See Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b132-6\">Grainger, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7x\">(dissenting in part). The Commonwealth asserts, and the majority accepts, the proposition that Nevada and Massachusetts have established similar standards to prove criminal attempt, and therefore that the two States have established a \u201clike violation.\u201d It is axiomatic, however, that before one can claim the existence of an out-of-State \u201clike violation,\u201d one must first establish the existence of a violation in the Commonwealth. Where, as here, an individual can be convicted of criminal attempt in Nevada for conduct that, if charges were brought, would require acquittal in Massachusetts, there is a fundamental disparity. I therefore respectfully dissent from that portion of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Both States require the same three threshold elements for a conviction: (1) the intent to commit the crime, (2) an act performed in furtherance of the crime, and (3) a failure to consummate the crime. Compare Nev. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 193.330 (2011) with G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 6.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This, however, does not address the gravamen of the defendant\u2019s appeal, which points to the difference in proof required in the two States for the second element \u2014 the act in furtherance.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>In Nevada, \u201cwhen the design of a person to commit a crime is clearly shown, <em>slight acts </em>done in furtherance of that crime <em>will constitute an </em>attempt\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Bell </em>v. <em>State, </em>105 Nev. 352, 354 (1989). See <em>Larsen </em>v. <em>State, </em>86 Nev. 451, 454 (1970). The more clearly intent is demonstrated, the more easily a slight act will satisfy the requirement of an act in furtherance. Thus, in Nevada, an \u201cinverse relationship . . . exists between the defendant\u2019s intent to commit the crime and the performance of an overt act toward the commission of the crime.\u201d <em>Bell </em>v. <em>State, </em>105 Nev. at 355.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">While Massachusetts has adopted the so-called \u201cproximity\u201d test, Nevada has rejected its invocation. Specifically, the Nevada Supreme Court has rejected the argument made by this same defendant (in seeking to overturn the Nevada conviction) that, because actual convictions of attempt in Nevada generally have involved more acts in furtherance than those with which he was charged, Nevada has adopted a so-called \u201cproximity approach\u201d like that of Massachusetts. <em>Id. </em>at 354-355. Thus, where the defendant had stipulated to his intent to commit sexual assault upon the victim, evidence that he had done no more in Nevada than purchase Vaseline and then driven in the direction of an apartment where he believed the victim was waiting \u201csufficed for attempt liability\u201d in his out-of-State conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 355. This approach is in stark contrast to the Massachusetts requirement of a \u201cpresent opportunity\u201d to commit the crime, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>455 Mass. 408, 415 (2009), with no need for \u201cfurther acts.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peaslee, </em>177 Mass. 267, 272 (1901).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Under the standard first formulated by Chief Justice Holmes, our State requires \u201ca showing that the defendant, after preparing to commit the crime, has undertaken overt acts toward fulfilling the crime that \u2018come near enough to the accomplishment of the substantive offence to be punishable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bell, supra </em>at 412, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peaslee, supra </em>at 271. In a fact-specific inquiry, the courts in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>Massachusetts are to analyze \u201cthe distance or gap between the defendant\u2019s actions and the (unachieved) goal of the consummated crime \u2014 the distance must be relatively short, the gap narrow, if the defendant is to be held guilty of a criminal attempt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hamel, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 250, 258 (2001). The Commonwealth must prove that the defendant possessed an intent to commit the crime \u201cat a time and place where he was able to carry it out.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>408 Mass. 463, 472 (1990), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peaslee, supra </em>at 273-274. \u201cIn Massachusetts, a defendant must have the present opportunity to commit the substantive crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bell, supra </em>at 415. Simply expressed, under our cases an overt act does not suffice \u201cif further acts are contemplated as needful.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fortier, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 116, 122 (2002), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peaslee, supra </em>at 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">We are thus required to contrast the sufficiency of Nevada\u2019s \u201cslight act\u201d with our own requirement of a \u201cpresent opportunity\u201d to commit the crime with only a \u201cnarrow gap\u201d dividing the attempt from culmination, and without any need for \u201cfurther acts.\u201d This disparity is contrary to our registry law\u2019s requirement that both State statutes \u201cprohibit essentially the same conduct.\u201d <em>John Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 151564 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>456 Mass. 612, 617 (2010) <em>(Doe No. 151564).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Nevada\u2019s law of attempt, unlike our own, has been recognized by Federal courts to impose the same standard as Federal common law and the Model Penal Code. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sarbia, </em>367 F.3d 1079, 1086 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 912 (2004); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Saavedra-Velazquez, </em>578 F.3d 1103, 1107-1108 (9th Cir. 2009), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct. 1547 (2010). By contrast and with reference to our own law, we have explicitly noted that \u201c[t]he [Model Penal] Code abandons a proximity-of-conduct standard and accepts less stringent signs of personal dangerousness to ground convictions for criminal attempt. . . . The Code thus tends to broaden the base of criminal contempt, to make convictions easier to reach.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hamel, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">That which we have previously recognized is in any event <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>clear from the language of our law on attempt \u2014 the significantly greater stringency of Massachusetts law. Because our law would require acquittal in the Commonwealth for behavior identical to that resulting in a Nevada attempt conviction, it fails the test for registration recently enunciated by the Supreme Judicial Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-5\">\u201c[W]e consider the \u2018like violation\u2019 requirement satisfied where it is shown that the proof necessary for the out-of-State conviction would also warrant a conviction of a Massachusetts offense for which registration is required.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-6\"><em>Doe No. 151564, supra </em>at 616.* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Our law does not require registration as a sex offender for a standard of behavior that is not criminal in Massachusetts. Had the Legislature desired such a result, it was free to dispense with the \u201clike violation\u201d formulation and simply require registration in Massachusetts for conviction elsewhere of a sexual offense requiring registration in any other jurisdiction. At least fourteen other States have adopted this approach; Massachusetts has not.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>The majority postulates that specific conduct in a particular case might be sufficiently egregious to secure a conviction of an attempted crime in both jurisdictions. There is some logic in applying such a test \u2014 and it apparently appealed here to the trial judge \u2014 but it has been rejected by our case law, and for good reason. The Supreme Judicial Court has specifically declined an approach that would entail a long-distance posttrial review of evidence admitted in another jurisdiction, and explicitly has limited the permissible inquiry to a comparison of the elements of each State\u2019s crime. \u201c[T]he [Sex Offender Registry Board] may not consider the facts underlying a conviction in making\u201d the \u201cdetermin[ation] whether the offense constitutes a \u2018like violation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Doe No. 151564, supra </em>at 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Because our task is to analyze legal requirements rather than speculate on the likelihood of conviction in any particular case that a prosecutor might elect to bring, we must restrict our comparison to respective standards of proof. A hypothetical outcome is thus irrelevant to our proper inquiry, and is also an exercise in circular reasoning: the estimate of a high conviction rate supports the conclusion that the offenses have similar standards of proof, which in turn bolsters the estimate of a high conviction rate. The issue is not whether conviction in a Massachusetts prosecution is likely, but whether the Nevada standard would allow conviction in the Commonwealth. As <em>Doe No. 151564 </em>recognizes, and regardless of our ability to fashion theories to support a goal* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of affirming a conviction of failure to register, no prosecutor, and most certainly no defendant, would characterize the difference between acquittal and conviction as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>anything less than dispositive in analyzing a \u201clike violation.\u201d No reading of G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C, can support the conclusion that the Legislature created a registration requirement applying only to certain behavior practiced out of State, but not within our borders.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">In this case the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty was error, and the judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b132-8\">Specifically, Nevada defines an attempt as \u201c[a]n act done with the intent to commit a crime, and tending but failing to accomplish it.\u201d Nev. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 193.330 (2011). In the Massachusetts enunciation of the crime, \u201c[w]hoever attempts to commit a crime by doing any act toward its commission, but fails in its perpetration, or is intercepted or prevented in its perpetration,\u201d is guilty of attempt. G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 6. In Massachusetts, unlike Nevada, the element of intent is stated explicitly only in decisional law. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>34 Mass.

But there is no escaping that <em>Doe No. 151564 </em>links the significance of an out-of-State conviction to the standard of criminality in the Commonwealth. In <em>Doe No. 151564 </em>the Massachusetts statute prohibited more, not less, conduct than that of the State (Maine) in which a conviction was obtained. The holding is therefore expressed in that context.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b135-12\">See, e.g., Ark.
