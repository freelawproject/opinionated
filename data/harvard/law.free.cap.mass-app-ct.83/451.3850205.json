L. c. 123A (statute) cannot be based, as a general rule, on the likelihood of noncontact sexual offenses alone. See <em>id. </em>at 588. But the court further stated that such noncontact offenses may be committed in a menacing manner that satisfies the statutory requirements if they will \u201cobjectively put [a] victim in fear of bodily harm by reason of . . . a contact sex crime.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Mindful of the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s admonition that we must undertake a \u201cfact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>specific\u201d inquiry, we further define here what it means to be an SDP who is a \u201cmenace to the health and safety of others\u201d pursuant to G. L. c. 123A. <em>Id. </em>at 588-589. More particularly, we consider whether the defendant\u2019s \u201cpredicted sexual offenses will instill in his victims a reasonable apprehension of being subjected to a contact sex crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 588. We conclude that his predicted sexual offenses and associated conduct \u2014 which do not involve contact sex crimes, but are much like his past crimes that involved stalking-like behavior and breaking and entering into another person\u2019s home for the purpose of voyeurism or exhibitionism \u2014 will instill such apprehension. We therefore conclude that the defendant\u2019s commitment as an SDP satisfies the requirements of the statute and substantive due process. We affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\"><em>Legal background. </em>Pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, the Commonwealth may petition to commit an individual to the treatment center for sexually dangerous persons (treatment center) for an indefinite period of time, subject to periodic review, upon a showing that he is an SDP. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Bruno, 432 Mass. 489, 494-497 &amp; n.7 (2000). Such a showing requires that the Commonwealth prove three things beyond a reasonable doubt: \u201c(1) the defendant has been convicted of a \u2018[sjexual offense,\u2019 as defined in G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1; (2) he suffers from a \u2018[mjental abnormality\u2019 or \u2018[personality disorder,\u2019[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] *111 as those terms are defined in \u00a7 1; and (3) as a result of such mental abnormality or personality disorder, the defendant is \u2018likely to engage in sexual offenses if not confined to a secure facility.\u2019 G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1 (definition of \u2018[sjexually dangerous person\u2019).\u201d <em>Suave, supra </em>at 584 n.3. A mental abnormality is defined by the statute as \u201ca congenital or acquired condition of a person that affects the emotional or volitional capacity of the person in a manner that predisposes that person to the commission of criminal acts to a degree that makes the person a menace to the health and safety of other persons.\u201d G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1, as amended through St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>The first element is not in dispute here, as the defendant\u2019s prior sexual offenses are well established. The defendant also does not contest that he suffers from exhibitionism and voyeurism as set out in the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed. 2000), which satisfies the medical element of the mental abnormality requirement. He also does not contest the third element, at least to the extent that he is likely to engage in noncontact sexual offenses in the future.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He contends, however, that because he is not likely to commit contact sexual offenses, he cannot be considered a menace to the safety of others and therefore does not satisfy the remainder of the statutory requirements, or, if he does, the statute is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The Supreme Judicial Court addressed the statutory issue in <em>Suave. </em>In that case, the defendant was convicted numerous times of open and gross lewdness or indecent exposure, with an otherwise \u201cunremarkable\u201d criminal history, and the judge found him \u201clikely to commit only a \u2018hands-off, noncontact sex[ual] offense[] involving exposing himself and masturbating in front of unsuspecting strangers.\u2019 \u201d <em>Suave, supra </em>at 586. The court focused on the definition of \u201cmental abnormality,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> parsing it into \u201cmedical and legal aspects.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 587. The medical portion was satisfied because Suave \u201c suffer [ed] from a mental disorder, exhibitionism, which predisposes him to commit criminal sexual acts, namely, open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The legal aspect hinged on \u201cwhether the defendant\u2019s disorder makes him \u2018a menace to the health and safety of other persons.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from the definition of \u201cmental abnormality\u201d in G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1. The court further construed \u201cmenace\u201d with reference to the common-law threatened battery type of assault, holding as follows: \u201cThe term \u2018menace,\u2019 as it is used in the definition of \u2018[m]entai abnormality\u2019 in G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1 . . . connotes a person whose conduct will objectively put his victim in fear of bodily harm by reason of a battery and, specifically, a contact sex crime. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>other words, the Commonwealth must show the defendant\u2019s predicted sexual offenses will instill in his victims a reasonable apprehension of being subjected to a contact sex crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The <em>Suave </em>court went on, however, to state that it did \u201cnot suggest that all sex offenders who have committed only non-contact sexual offenses and who are likely to commit only non-contact sexual offenses in the future are not menaces to the health and safety of other persons. Each case is fact specific.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 588-589. In particular, the court emphasized that the judge found no evidence that Suave \u201chad ever stalked, lured, approached, confined, or touched a victim, that there was no reason to believe he would target children, and that there was no reason to believe the defendant\u2019s future sexual offenses would escalate into contact offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 588. We must apply these principles to the facts of this case, to which we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\"><em>Facts. </em>We summarize the detailed findings of the trial judge after a jury-waived trial, supplemented by uncontested details from the record.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the time of trial, the defendant was forty years old, and his criminal record included at least four separate incidents resulting in convictions of sexual offenses, as well as various crimes apart from those incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">The first sexual offense, in 1996, was open and gross lewdness. On this occasion, a police officer found the defendant masturbating in the backyard of someone else\u2019s house; he did not stop masturbating when the officer arrived, but did not resist when he was arrested. A seventeen year old who lived in the house reported to police that she was \u201cvery frightened\u201d because the defendant had been watching her for some time through the window of her house and had written her letters without her mother\u2019s knowledge. While charges from this incident were pending, the defendant \u201ccaused a third party to put a box with his photo taped on it on the victim\u2019s doorstep, resulting in a further charge of intimidation of a witness.\u201d He received a six-month suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>In 1999, the defendant was charged with, and subsequently convicted of, lewd and lascivious behavior, as well as assault and battery on a police officer. He knocked on a woman\u2019s window, said something, and began exposing himself. A police officer found him with his pants down to his knees and his penis in his hand, and chased him as he tried to flee. The defendant tried to punch the officer multiple times before being subdued. He served one year in the house of correction on these charges.* *<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">In 2005, the defendant made obscene telephone calls to multiple individuals. In particular, he repeatedly called a counsellor at a women\u2019s center and left sexually graphic messages.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Among other things, he stated that he was masturbating; the judge found that the reported \u201caccompanying slapping sounds lent credibility to that assertion.\u201d The defendant received concurrent three-month sentences on the obscene call charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The governing incident for the SDP petition underlying this appeal occurred in 2007, and included charges of accosting and annoying a member of the opposite sex, assault and battery, and breaking and entering in the daytime with intent to commit a felony, thereby putting a person therein in fear.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant and his family rented an apartment on the third floor of a house where the victim, an adult woman, lived in the second-floor apartment. Her mother, who owned the home, lived on the first floor. The victim was at home, showering, while her six month old baby and two toddlers slept. She had a baby monitor with her in the bathroom, and her apartment door was closed but not locked, because she expected two older children to come home around that time. The defendant entered the victim\u2019s apartment, took the baby out of the crib, and put her on the floor, causing the baby to cry loudly. When the victim opened the shower door, she found the defendant standing in her bathroom. She screamed; the defendant laughed, said, \u201cWhat?\u201d and fled. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>defendant was convicted of all the charged offenses and sentenced to two years in the house of correction on the assault and battery conviction, plus five years\u2019 probation on the remaining charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The judge credited the Commonwealth\u2019s expert testimony and concluded that the defendant \u201csuffers from a mental abnormality that manifests itself, among other ways, in voyeuristic and exhibitionistic behavior.\u201d The judge based this conclusion on the accepted medical definitions of voyeurism and exhibitionism, as well as the facts of the defendant\u2019s past crimes described above. The judge also found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was likely to reoffend, citing the expert testimony and the defendant\u2019s denial of his past offenses, limited cognitive abilities, limited participation in sex offender treatment, and past violations of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The judge further found: \u201cAlthough [the defendant\u2019s] criminal record includes some assaultive behavior, his sexual offenses to date have all been non-contact offenses, all involving adult women roughly his own age.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The judge found that the latest offense was an \u201c \u2018escalation,\u2019 in that for the first time on record, [the defendant] entered a home, and then a bathroom, to gratify his voyeuristic impulses,\u201d but stated that the incident \u201cmay not be useful\u201d in predicting future behavior because the breaking and entering was to another apartment in the three-family home in which the defendant lived,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and his immediately preceding offenses, the obscene telephone calls in 2005, \u201carguably represented a \u2018de-escalation,\u2019 \u201d because they involved \u201cneither physical presence on the property of a victim nor exposure of [his] genitals.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The judge therefore stated that \u201cthe evidence does not permit a reasonable inference as to whether the shower incident is a precursor or an outlier.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>concerned by the act of putting the baby on the floor (which was the basis of the assault and battery charge), he believed it indicated only \u201csimple dangerousness\u201d rather than sexual dangerousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Based on these considerations, the judge found: \u201cThe overwhelming weight of the evidence is that future sexual misconduct by [the defendant], if it occurs, will involve conduct much like that in the past \u2014 voyeurism, exhibitionism \u2014 in short, non-contact offenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">As <em>Suave </em>had not been decided at the time, the judge then applied our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 471 (2009), <em>S.C., </em>455 Mass. 1022 (2010), and concluded that the defendant \u201cis likely to engage in sexual offenses to a degree that makes him a menace to the health and safety of other persons if not confined to a secure facility.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The judge then discussed and rejected the defendant\u2019s due process argument, and ordered him committed as an SDP.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\"><em>Statutory applicability. </em>The defendant claims that, on the facts found by the trial judge, he was legally entitled to dismissal of the SDP petition. He asserts that <em>Suave </em>requires a finding of a likelihood to commit contact sexual offenses, and the judge\u2019s finding to the contrary means the Commonwealth failed to satisfy its burden. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">As discussed above, <em>Suave </em>does not necessarily require an SDP to be likely to commit a contact sexual offense; the court explicitly declined to hold that those \u201cwho are likely to commit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>only noncontact sexual offenses in the future are not menaces to the health and safety of other persons.\u201d <em>Suave, </em>460 Mass. at 589. On the contrary, <em>Suave </em>concludes that sexual assaults, in the sense of threatened batteries, are sufficiently menacing to bring predicted noncontact offenses within the statute\u2019s ambit. See <em>id. </em>at 587-588. Although provoking \u201cgeneralized fear\u201d or \u201cshock or alarm,\u201d such as may have been anticipated in Suave\u2019s case, is insufficient to make an offender a menace, the Commonwealth meets its burden by showing that a defendant\u2019s likely sexual offenses and associated conduct will \u201cobjectively put his victim in fear of bodily harm by reason of . . . a contact sex crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 588. The Commonwealth does not need to demonstrate that the defendant is likely to engage in contact sexual offenses. It is enough that a victim would objectively fear such an offense from the defendant\u2019s likely sexual offenses and associated conduct. The menace involved in a threatened battery type of assault is sufficient. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Although the judge did not have the benefit of <em>Suave, </em>his findings of fact nonetheless support his conclusion that the defendant is a menace. This case is distinct from <em>Suave, </em>where \u201cthe judge found no evidence that the defendant had ever stalked, lured, approached, confined, or touched a victim\u201d or targeted children. <em>Ibid. </em>Here, in his 1996 offense, the defendant repeatedly targeted a seventeen year old for his sexual attentions and subsequent intimidation. In his 1999 offense, the defendant used force against a police officer in conjunction with his exhibitionistic act. Most menacingly, in the governing offense, the defendant entered the victim\u2019s apartment and approached her in her bathroom while she was showering, thereby putting her in fear, and the judge found that this represented an escalation in his criminal behavior.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> A woman who emerges from the shower, finding a man standing in her bathroom and her crying baby removed from her crib, will objectively and reasonably fear that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>a contact sex crime is imminent. In light of the judge\u2019s finding that the defendant was likely to act on his voyeuristic impulses and exhibitionistic compulsions and to engage in \u201cconduct much like that in the past,\u201d the judge was justified in concluding that the defendant was \u201ca menace to the health and safety of other[s].\u201d The specific facts of this case therefore permit the defendant\u2019s adjudication as an SDP even though he is predicted to commit only menacing noncontact sexual offenses. See and compare <em>id. </em>at 588-589.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\"><em>Due process. </em>In light of our conclusion that the statute permits the defendant\u2019s commitment, we must address the question, not previously decided, \u201cwhether the statute, if construed to permit such a result, would pass constitutional muster.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>455 Mass. at 1024. Compare <em>Suave, supra </em>at 589 (\u201cBecause of the result we reach, we do not need to decide the constitutional question\u201d). The defendant argues that committing him is inconsistent with the substantive due process protections of the Federal Constitution and the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Substantive due process precludes the government from \u201cengaging in conduct that shocks the conscience or interferes with rights implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>432 Mass. at 503, quoting from <em>Aime </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>414 Mass. 667, 673 (1993) (quotations and citations omitted). \u201cAlthough freedom from physical restraint \u2018has always been at the core of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause . . . ,\u2019 that liberty interest is not absolute.\u201d <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Hendricks, </em>521 U.S. 346, 356 (1997) <em>(Hendricks), </em>quoting from <em>Foucha </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>504 U.S. 71, 80 (1992). Indeed, the United States Supreme Court has consistently upheld against substantive due process challenge statutes providing for the \u201cforcible civil detainment of people who are unable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>control their behavior and who thereby pose a danger to the public health and safety,\u201d provided \u201cthe confinement takes place pursuant to proper procedures and evidentiary standards.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">There is no argument in the instant case that the procedures or evidentiary standards are not proper. An individual whom the Commonwealth seeks to commit as an SDP has a right, first, to a probable cause hearing at which he may have the assistance of counsel, present evidence, and cross-examine witnesses. G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12(c), <em>(d). </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bruno, supra </em>at 503-504. If the judge finds that the Commonwealth has established probable cause to believe the person is an SDP, he is committed to the treatment center for a strictly limited time during which he is examined by two qualified examiners and, if he wishes, another examiner of his choosing. G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 13(a), (d). See, e.g., <em>Gangi </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>462 Mass. 158, 160-163 (2012). Again, he \u201cshall be entitled to counsel and, if indigent, the court shall appoint an attorney.\u201d G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 13(c), inserted by St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7 8. Unless at least one of the qualified examiners concludes that the individual is an SDP, the Commonwealth\u2019s petition must be dismissed. <em>Johnstone, petitioner, </em>453 Mass. 544, 553 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">If the Commonwealth satisfies these requirements, the individual has a right to a jury trial. G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14(a). \u201cCertain rights ordinarily afforded criminal defendants have been extended to those civilly charged with being sexually dangerous persons, e.g., the right to counsel, the right to have counsel appointed if the defendant is indigent, the right to call expert witnesses (and, if indigent, the right to have the Commonwealth pay for them), the right to have process issue to secure the attendance of witnesses, the right to a unanimous jury verdict, [and] the requirement that the case be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. See G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14(b) &amp; <em>(d).\u201d Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dresser, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 454, 458 (2008). All these rights and the effective assistance of counsel must be afforded before commitment can occur. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferreira, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 109, 114-115 (2006). After an individual is committed, he has the right every twelve months to petition for examination and discharge pursuant to G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>c. 123A, \u00a7 9, upon which he is given substantially the same rights, and the Commonwealth bears the burden of demonstrating his continued sexual dangerousness beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Wyatt, petitioner, </em>428 Mass. 347, 360 (1998), citing <em>Andrews, petitioner, </em>368 Mass. 468, 489-490 (1975). See <em>Miller, petitioner, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 625, 626, 636 (2008); <em>LeSage, petitioner, </em>76 Mass. App. Ct. 566, 574 (2010). These \u201csignificant procedural protections\u201d form an important part of the statutory scheme. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>441 Mass. 157, 165 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">We turn now to the substantive standards for civil commitment. In <em>Hendricks, </em>the Court rejected a substantive due process challenge to a statute that contains many elements in common with our SDP statute. That statute, like ours, required findings of prior sexual offenses, future sexual dangerousness, and a link between those findings and \u201cthe existence of a \u2018mental abnormality\u2019 or \u2018personality disorder\u2019 that makes it difficult, if not impossible, for the person to control his dangerous behavior.\u201d <em>Hendricks, </em>521 U.S. at 358. See <em>Dutil, petitioner, </em>437 Mass. 9, 16 (2002) (\u201cOur decisions . . . have. . . required that the Commonwealth demonstrate present dangerousness . . . and the link of this dangerousness to a mental condition\u201d). Because the Kansas statute, like ours, required a \u201clack of volitional control, coupled with a prediction of future dangerousness,\u201d it sufficiently distinguished sexual predators subject to civil commitment from \u201cother dangerous persons who are perhaps more properly dealt with exclusively through criminal proceedings.\u201d <em>Hendricks, supra </em>at 360. See <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Crane, </em>534 U.S. 407, 409-413 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">However, unlike the Kansas statute upheld in <em>Hendricks, </em>and others addressed in the case law, our statute does not limit itself to \u201cpast sexually <em>violent </em>behavior and ... a likelihood of such conduct in the future\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Hendricks, supra </em>at 357. As explained above, our statute is drafted and interpreted to encompass a wider range of likely sexual offenses and associated conduct.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In order to adjudicate a defendant an SDP, a finding is required that the defendant is likely to engage in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>future sexual offenses and associated conduct that would instill in a victim an objectively reasonable apprehension of a contact sexual offense. <em>Suave, supra </em>at 588. However, a finding that the defendant is likely to actually engage in a contact sexual offense is not required. <em>Ibid. </em>The question then becomes whether civil confinement for such an offender violates substantive due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">We conclude that the significant procedural and substantive requirements discussed above render the civil commitment of such a menacing sexual offender consistent with our concept of ordered liberty. Here, the defendant has been convicted of a number of prior sexual offenses. As established pursuant to the required procedures and evidentiary standards, he has a mental abnormality that renders him unable to control his behavior. Furthermore, his likely sexual offenses and associated conduct present a significant danger to public health and safety, as they not only expose victims to noncontact sexual offenses, but \u201cinstill in . . . victims a reasonable apprehension of being subjected to a contact sex crime.\u201d <em>Suave, </em>460 Mass. at 588. Confinement of such an offender \u201cuntil his mental abnormality no longer causes him to be a threat to others,\u201d with such confinement being \u201csubject to periodic review of the patient\u2019s suitability for release,\u201d is constitutionally permissible. <em>Hendricks, supra </em>at 363-364 (quotation omitted). The application of the statute to commit the defendant to the treatment center as an SDP in the circumstances of this case therefore comports with due process. See <em>id. </em>at 357; <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Crane, supra </em>at 409-410.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The facts found by the judge permit and support his determination that the defendant is an SDP pursuant to the statute. Application of the statute to reach such a determination on the particular facts of this case does not offend substantive due process. We therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b494-6\">In the instant case, the judge found that the defendant has a mental abnormality, a point upon which all the Commonwealth\u2019s experts agreed. The Commonwealth\u2019s experts <em>differed </em>in their opinions as to whether the defendant has a personality disorder, and the judge made no explicit finding on this aspect of the second element.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The defendant\u2019s score on the \u201cStatic 99\u201d test, designed to predict recidivism, ranged from 8 to 10, thereby placing him in a high risk category.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b495-7\">In <em>Suave, </em>the trial judge found that the defendant suffered from a \u201cmental abnormality,\u201d but not a \u201cpersonality disorder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 584-585.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b496-8\">In particular, we note that the defendant accepts the description of his criminal history in the report of one of the Commonwealth\u2019s experts who relied upon and quoted from contemporaneous police reports, which were also exhibits at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Additionally, in 2001, a woman saw the defendant staring into the window of her house, specifically the window of her five year old son\u2019s bedroom. This incident resulted in a conviction of disorderly conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b497-10\">In these messages, \u201c[a]mong other things, [the defendant] described [the counsellor\u2019s] breasts, and his desire to place his penis between them. He suggested that he wished her to \u2018suck on his . . . cock.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b497-11\">These offenses occurred while the defendant was on probation for the obscene telephone call convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b498-7\">We note that when the 1996 incident occurred involving the seventeen year old girl, the defendant would have been about twenty-six years old.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b498-8\">We note that in 1998, the defendant had been charged with breaking and entering in the nighttime with intent to commit a felony, although not in conjunction with a sexual offense. The court filed the charge upon the defendant\u2019s guilty plea. Prior to that, in 1989, he had been charged with four counts of the same offense, which resulted in one charge placed on file and the remainder nol pressed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b498-9\">He was, however, apparently masturbating while making these calls.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b498-10\">We understand the trial judge\u2019s conclusion here to mean that the evidence does not permit a reasonable inference whether the shower incident supports a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>prediction that the defendant is likely to engage in contact sexual offenses. We discern this from the context of this part of his decision, which was addressed to the issue whether the escalation represented by the shower incident was a precursor to contact offenses. We do not interpret the judge\u2019s conclusion to mean that the evidence does not permit a reasonable inference whether the defendant would take advantage of another opportunity to enter a person\u2019s home to satisfy his voyeuristic and exhibitionistic impulses and compulsions. Rather, as the judge noted, \u201cwhether [the defendant] acted with premeditation, or simply opportunistically upon hearing [his victim] in the shower, he acted on voyeuristic impulses. Moreover, his exhibitionistic compulsions appear to negate any typical voyeuristic reticence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b499-10\">In <em>Grant, </em>this court held that \u201cthe Legislature clearly intended sexually dangerous persons to include those who commit noncontact offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 478. <em>Suave, </em>as explained above, has effectively overruled the broader holding in <em>Grant </em>and limited the type of noncontact offenses that can be considered menacing under the statute. See <em>Suave, </em>460 Mass. at 588-589.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Moreover, the judge could have found that the assault and battery on the baby, though not conducted with a sexual intent regarding the infant, was a part of the defendant\u2019s scheme to lure the victim out of the shower for a sexual purpose. See generally G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1, as amended through St. 2004, c. 66, \u00a7 6 (defining \u201c[sjexual offense\u201d to include \u201cany other offense, the facts of which, under the totality of the circumstances, manifest a sexual motivation\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b501-7\">We apply the same analysis to both Federal and State due process provisions in this context. See <em>Dutil, petitioner, </em>437 Mass. 9, 10 n.2 (2002) (\u201cWe have not differentiated the substantive due process standard of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights from that of the Federal Constitution in cases involving substantive due process challenges to G. L. c. 123A\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>454 Mass. 267, 276 n.9 (2009) (Ireland, J., concurring) (same). Cf. <em>Kenniston </em>v. <em>Department of Youth Servs., </em>453 Mass. 179, 183-184 &amp; n.7 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b503-7\">The statutory definition of sexual offense includes some crimes that may not involve violence, such as \u201copen and gross lewdness and lascivious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>behavior,\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, and \u201caccosting or annoying persons of the opposite sex and lewd, wanton and lascivious speech or behavior,\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53. G.
