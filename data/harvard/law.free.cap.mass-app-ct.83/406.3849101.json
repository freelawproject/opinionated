On the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to establish constructive possession. None of the other issues raised by the defendant in her cross appeal warrants disturbing the jury verdicts and finding. We therefore reverse the judge\u2019s order and reinstate the jury verdicts, the subsequent offender finding, and the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">1. <em>Background. </em>On February 1, 2008, the defendant was indicted for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, second or subsequent offense, in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A(c) and <em>(d), </em>and for doing so in a school zone, in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J. She made a motion to suppress evidence, not currently before this court, which was denied. After obtaining new counsel, she moved to dismiss the indictment based on purportedly prejudicial evidence presented to the grand jury, and moved to suppress evidence for violation of the search warrant particularity requirement. Both motions were denied. After the jury returned guilty verdicts,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the defendant renewed her motion for a required finding of not guilty pursuant to Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>R.Crim.P. 25(b)(2), 378 Mass. 896 (1979), and the trial judge allowed the motion and ordered the entry of not guilty findings, relying chiefly on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boria, </em>440 Mass. 416 (2003) <em>(Boria), </em>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 222 (1993) <em>(Brown). </em>The Commonwealth appealed pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 25(c)(1), and the defendant cross-appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">We summarize the evidence at trial in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Escalera, </em>462 Mass. 636, 649 (2012), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979). On December 11, 2007, at approximately 10:00 p.m., officers from the Brockton police department and the State police executed a search warrant for an apartment on the third floor of 109 Green Street in Brockton. The officers knocked and announced themselves, and after five or ten seconds State Trooper Erik Telford forced the door open with a battering ram. Inside, the officers found the defendant on the living room couch and her codefendant, David Nelson,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> also near the couch. The defendant was wearing only a T-shirt and underwear at the time; Nelson did not have a shirt on. The defendant requested clothing, and an officer brought her clothing from the bedroom. Both defendants were secured outside the apartment during the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The apartment was very small, consisting of a living room with a closet and kitchenette, a small hallway, one small bedroom, and a bathroom. The living room was approximately eight feet by twelve feet. In the living room were a couch, a coffee table about three feet long, a chair, an end table, and a television. The bedroom was smaller than the living room and contained a bed, a dresser, and plastic shelving. The apartment was cluttered, with trash and clothing, and in disarray.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">Brockton police Detective Robert Diliddo found and seized two cellular telephones (phones) and a digital scale on the coffee table.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The scale is small and resembles a compact disc (CD) when closed, as it was when Diliddo found it. One of the phones contained a photograph of Nelson. Subsequently, Brock-ton police Lieutenant (then Sergeant) Kevin O\u2019Connell dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>covered on the coffee table seven individually wrapped pieces of what he believed to be \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine. This substance later tested positive for cocaine and weighed approximately 3.3 grams. There was testimony that the smaller pieces of crack cocaine would sell for twenty dollars, and the largest for as much as fifty or eighty dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Officers also seized $110 in cash, in smaller denomination bills, from the bedroom; a box of Glad-brand plastic bags from the end table in the living room; and a BB gun from the living room closet. Telford observed women\u2019s clothing, women\u2019s perfume, and women\u2019s lotions in the bedroom, but did not observe any men\u2019s clothing there. At booking, both the defendant and Nelson gave 109 Green Street, apartment 3, as their address.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Brockton police Detective Thomas Keating testified as an expert for the Commonwealth, over the defendant\u2019s objection. He testified that crack cocaine is frequently packaged in sandwich bags. Keating also testified that money found along with crack cocaine is indicative of drug distribution and may be the proceeds from drug sales. He found the discovery of a scale significant, stating, \u201cI never saw an addict buy crack cocaine and weigh it unless they\u2019re buying it to sell it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Neither codefendant testified. The defendant\u2019s counsel argued chiefly that the drugs were not hers; Nelson\u2019s defense was personal use.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">2. <em>Commonwealth\u2019s appeal, </em>a. <em>Standard of review. </em>The defendant asserts that we should defer to the trial judge\u2019s ruling and review the trial judge\u2019s allowance of the rule 25(b)(2) motion for abuse of discretion, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>399 Mass. 191, 192 (1987), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woodward, 427 </em>Mass. 659, 668 (1998). She misunderstands the context of <em>Cobb </em>and <em>Woodward.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\"><em>A </em>rule 25(b)(2) motion may seek any or all of three forms of relief: a new trial, a finding of not guilty, or a reduction of the verdict to a lesser included offense. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keough, </em>385 Mass. 314, 317-318 (1982).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The standard for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>new trial is akin to that under Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(b), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001). \u201cA judge has similar broad discretion to grant a new trial in the interests of justice under both rules.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pring-Wilson, </em>448 Mass. 718, 732 n.14 (2007). Likewise, a judge asked to reduce a verdict has the discretion to consider the weight of the evidence to reach the result the judge believes most consonant with justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Almeida, </em>452 Mass. 601, 613-614 (2008), and cases cited. Both of these forms of relief are discretionary, and we would review for abuse of discretion, with particular deference to the trial judge\u2019s familiarity with the proceedings and credibility judgments. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Preston, </em>393 Mass. 318, 324 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cornish, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 173, <em>177 </em>(1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peppicelli, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. 87, 93 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">However, a motion seeking a finding of not guilty due to insufficient evidence stands on different footing. The sufficiency of the evidence is a question of law because the judge must take the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth rather than weighing it independently. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 317, 321-324 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 194, 197-198 (2007). See also Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 36.21 (3d ed. 2007). Therefore, \u201cthe judge does not properly exercise discretion concerning the weight or integrity of the evidence, but instead must assess the legal sufficiency of the evidence by the standard set out in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. [at] 677.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doucette, </em>408 Mass. 454, 456 (1990). We thus determine the legal question of sufficiency without deference to the trial judge\u2019s ruling. See <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">b. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>As the cocaine was not found on the defendant\u2019s person, she was tried on a theory of constructive possession.* **<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Commonwealth therefore was required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>prove the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the cocaine, and her ability and intent to exercise dominion and control over it. See <em>Boria, </em>440 Mass at 418; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>452 Mass. 142, 146 (2008). \u201cProof of possession of a controlled substance may be established by circumstantial evidence, and the inferences that can be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brzezinski, </em>405 Mass. 401, 409 (1989), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>La-Perle, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 424, 426 (1985). However, mere presence in proximity to contraband, or even \u201c[l]iving in a place where drugs are in plain view and being sold,\u201d is insufficient to establish constructive possession. <em>Boria, </em>440 Mass. at 418. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Charlton, </em>81 Mass. App. Ct. 294, 300 (2012) (\u201cThat a defendant provides as [her] address the place where contraband is found does not alone provide an ability and intent to control the contraband\u201d). Rather, \u201c[o]ther incriminating evidence\u201d is necessary to \u201ctip the scale in favor of sufficiency.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brzezinski, supra </em>at 410, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Albano, </em>373 Mass. 132, 134 (1977). A \u201cparticular link\u201d of the defendant to the contraband, or at least to the area where the contraband is found, must be established. <em>Boria, </em>440 Mass. at 420. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rarick, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 912, 913 (1986) (drugs and paraphernalia found in bedroom with defendant\u2019s belongings); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 502, 505-506 (1998) (defendant\u2019s clothes and documents found in bedroom with contraband).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">In this case, the jury could reasonably infer the defendant\u2019s awareness of the cocaine and ability and intent to exercise dominion and control over it. In the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence supported an inference of the defendant\u2019s awareness of the cocaine. The cocaine was found on a table right in front of her. Although the table was cluttered, the cocaine was not concealed. See <em>Boria, </em>440 Mass. at 417, 421 (presence where contraband was found permitted reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>able inference of awareness even where drugs were hidden); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montalvo, </em>76 Mass. App. Ct. 319, 323-326 (2010). The apartment was also very small. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>407 Mass. 647, 651-652 (1990) (drugs and paraphernalia in plain view in one-room cottage). Contrast <em>Boria, </em>440 Mass. at 420 n.5 (no evidence of size or layout of apartment). As explained more fully below, the defendant was also a resident and not merely present in the apartment. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Charlton, </em>81 Mass. App. Ct. at 302-303, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Handy, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 776, 781 n.5 (1991) (\u201cA defendant\u2019s \u2018residential status at a premises is a relevant inculpatory factor to be considered . . . , since it indicates \u201cmore than mere presence\u201d \u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The more difficult issue, then, is whether there was sufficient evidence of the defendant\u2019s ability and intent to exercise dominion and control over the cocaine. As stated earlier, the cocaine was located on the table in front of her when officers entered the apartment. We also consider it significant that the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, is sufficient to establish that the defendant was the primary occupant of the apartment. See <em>Brown, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. at 225, 227 (\u201cthere was obviously sufficient evidence\u201d to convict codefendant of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute because \u201c[t]he apartment was [codefendant\u2019s] place; it was full of his personal papers,\u201d and he was \u201cthe person who controlled the apartment\u201d). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Charlton, supra </em>at 303. The defendant here gave the apartment as her address at booking. See <em>id. </em>at 302-303. She was there at a late hour of the night in a state of undress. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriquez, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 944, 945-946 (1983). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arias, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 613, 615, 619 (1990), <em>S.C., </em>410 Mass. 1005 (1991). The sole bedroom contained only women\u2019s items, and the police retrieved clothing for her from it, giving rise to a reasonable inference that it was hers. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rarick, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. at 913; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. at 505-506.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Finally, there was no evidence establishing that another person in the apartment, rather than the defendant, was the person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>controlling the apartment or the contraband and its proceeds.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In contrast, in <em>Boria </em>and especially in <em>Brown, </em>the evidence strongly pointed to other codefendants as responsible for the drugs.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <em>Brown, </em>one codefendant was the primary occupant and another was found with cash and cocaine on her person, apparently attempting to dispose of other drugs. <em>Brown, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. at 225. In <em>Boria, </em>one of the codefendants had over $1,200 in cash on him. <em>Boria, </em>440 Mass. at 417 n.3.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The only cash found here was the $110 located in the bedroom belonging to the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rarick, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. at 913. Although this is not an unusually large amount of cash, the jury could have inferred that it constituted the proceeds of drug sales, in light of the expert testimony as well as other evidence concerning the value of the seized drugs. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arias, 29 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 619 n.10. In sum, the evidence here sufficed to establish knowledge as well as ability and intent to exercise dominion and control over the cocaine. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alcantara, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 591, 596-597 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">As for intent to distribute, there was sufficient evidence based on the quantity of the cocaine; the expert testimony regarding the differences between distributors and users of cocaine; and the presence of plastic bags, a cellular phone, a BB gun, and most particularly, a digital scale. We therefore reverse the order entering findings of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>3. <em>Defendant\u2019s cross appeal. </em>The defendant raises several issues that she urges are grounds to reverse her convictions if the evidence was sufficient to sustain them. We take them in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">a. <em>Motion to dismiss. </em>The defendant moved to dismiss the indictment on the basis that improper evidence was presented to the grand jury. See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Dell, </em>392 Mass. 445 (1984). Specifically, Diliddo testified at the grand jury that the police were investigating drug sales at 109 Green Street, apartment 3, and that Telford had a confidential informant who knew that the defendant and Nelson were selling drugs at that apartment. The defendant contends that this information constituted prior bad acts and that it was irrelevant because she was not charged with distribution of drugs, only possession with intent to distribute. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vinnie, </em>428 Mass. 161, 174-175, cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1007 (1998). However, this limited testimony was probative of the defendant\u2019s intent to distribute, and the defendant has not shown that it was either false or misleading. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brien, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 914, 914 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>82 Mass. App. Ct. 293, 299 (2012). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Helfant, </em>398 Mass. 214, 224-225 (1986). Seeking an indictment for possession with intent to distribute rather than distribution was within \u201cthe discretion of the prosecuting authority to decide what charge the government will bring.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 919, 919 (2002). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>410 Mass. 498, 500-501 (1991). The motion to dismiss was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">b. <em>Motion to suppress. </em>The defendant argues that her motion to suppress based on the warrant particularity requirement should have been allowed. See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Balicki, </em>436 Mass. 1, 7-8 (2002); G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 2. When he applied for the search warrant, Diliddo believed that there were three apartments at 109 Green Street, and therefore sought and secured a warrant for \u201c109 Green St, Brockton Ma, third floor apartment.\u201d In fact, there were nine apartments in that building, three on each floor. The warrant could therefore have been read as permitting a search of any of three apartments.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>However, Diliddo\u2019s affidavit supporting the warrant included information by an informant that the third-floor apartment was accessed via the side door adjacent to the fire escape, and was at the top of the stairs, \u201cright in front of you with a yellow sign on the front door that reads something to the effect of \u2018Private/ Keep Out.\u2019 \u201d The officers executing the warrant found the defendant\u2019s apartment as described, and entered and searched the correct apartment. The case is analogous to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Todisco, </em>363 Mass. 445 (1973), where a warrant could have referred to any of three apartments in a building, but the affidavit sufficiently identified the apartment to be searched. <em>Id. </em>at 448-450. There, as here, the affiant was involved in the execution of the warrant and located the defendant\u2019s apartment and no other. See <em>id. </em>at 449. Under the circumstances, we discern no error in the denial of the motion to suppress. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Toledo, </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 688, 696-697 (2006).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">c. <em>\u201cKnock and announce\u201d rule. </em>After Telford testified at trial that he had waited five or ten seconds between announcing his presence and forcing the door open, the defendant made an objection based on the \u201cknock and announce\u201d rule, and now argues that suppression of the fruits of the search was warranted on this basis. See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>452 Mass. 573, 574-575 (2008). The defendant did not file a timely motion to suppress, and indeed never filed a motion to suppress on this basis. See Mass.R.Crim.P. 13(a), (d), as appearing in 442 Mass. 1517 (2004). She requested no specific relief from the trial judge.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Even treating the objection as a motion to suppress, it was within the judge\u2019s discretion to decline to entertain it in the middle of trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pope, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 505, 507 (1983). See also Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 24.23, at 359. Moreover, we have upheld a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>five-second delay for a narcotics search warrant where the police have information that occupants may have guns. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 130, 132-135 &amp; n.8 (2008). Here, an informant had told Telford that, within a day prior to the search, Nelson had loaded a firearm and threatened to make someone \u201cdisappear,\u201d and probation records indicated that Nelson had been convicted of two prior weapons offenses.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In light of this information and prior controlled purchases indicating drug distribution, \u201cit was reasonable for the police to fear a threat to their safety within five seconds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">d. <em>Expert testimony. </em>Finally, the defendant argues that the trial judge erred in permitting Keating to testify beyond his expertise and vouch for his own credibility. The defendant filed a motion in limine to prevent Keating from testifying \u201cthat a theoretical drug \u2018buyer\u2019 would not purchase multiple bags of cocaine and instead purchase said substances in bulk,\u201d relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Little, </em>453 Mass. 766 (2009), which criticized an \u201cimprecise economic argument\u201d made by Keating as \u201clikely beyond his expertise as a narcotics investigator.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 771. The trial judge allowed the motion to the extent that Keating\u2019s testimony related to the behavior of hypothetical buyers rather than his own experiences and observations, but indicated she could not completely address the issue in the abstract. However, although the defendant objected to Keating\u2019s qualification as an expert (which she does not contest on appeal), she did not object to any of the specific statements that she now challenges, and so we review Keating\u2019s testimony for error creating a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>id. </em>at 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Keating testified that crack addicts usually do not keep money on their persons because they would spend it on more cocaine, and so the recovery of money suggests that it could be the proceeds from drug sales. He also testified that addicts would likely have drug paraphernalia around because they would consume the cocaine as soon as they got it, and he had never seen an addict weigh crack cocaine unless they were going to sell part of it. These statements were not objected to, and are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>not obviously beyond Keating\u2019s experience and expertise.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>id. </em>at 770-771. To the extent Keating made \u201ceconomic\u201d arguments of the type at issue in <em>Little, </em>they were largely elicited in response to defense counsel\u2019s questions about the behavior of a hypothetical crack addict and were not objected to.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeCastro, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 937, 938 (1987). This evidence was also primarily relevant to the question of intent to distribute, whereas the defendant\u2019s defense was lack of possession. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Springer, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 469, 480 (2000). There was no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice from this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Finally, the defendant calls attention to a portion of Keating\u2019s testimony where he described how prosecutors seek his opinion whether he would be prepared to take the stand to testify whether the drugs were for distribution or personal use, and that he would give them his opinion. Keating stated that if he opines that personal use is more likely, the prosecutor typically does not proceed with charges based on intent to distribute. He further indicated that he has only testified that a situation is not indicative of distribution five to ten times out of hundreds of times testifying as an expert in court. The defendant asserts that by this testimony, Keating was improperly vouching for his own credibility. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burgess, </em>450 Mass. 422, 436 (2008), quoting from <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>385 Mass. 91, 105 (1982). Although generally not an appropriate line of inquiry, in this instant case it was a fair response to Nelson\u2019s pointed attack on Keating\u2019s credibility as \u201cthe ultimate hired gun\u201d trying to help out his colleagues, which Nelson\u2019s counsel made during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>his opening and reinforced during his cross-examination. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortega, </em>441 Mass. 170, 180 n.17 (2004); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 505, 509 (2009). In his opening, for example, defense counsel for Nelson stated that Keating has a \u201cpercentage . . . that . . . [Dustin] Pedroia and the Red Sox would die for. Almost a thousand percent saying things are consistent with distribution.\u201d The defendant did not object to Nelson\u2019s cross-examination, which elicited the same information. We discern no abuse of discretion under these circumstances in admitting this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>There was sufficient evidence to support the defendant\u2019s convictions, and no error requiring reversal of the judgments. The order allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdicts and finding is reversed. The jury verdicts, the judge\u2019s subsequent offender finding, and the judgments shall be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b449-11\">The defendant was also convicted at a bench trial on the subsequent offense portion of the indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Nelson\u2019s case is not currently before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b450-9\">Diliddo noted that phones have evidentiary value because drug dealers often use them to communicate with their customers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b451-10\">However, there was no evidence that paperwork bearing the defendant\u2019s name was seized, or that she had a key to the apartment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b451-11\">Rule 25(b)(2) states in part: \u201cIf a verdict of guilty is returned, the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>may on motion set aside the verdict and order a new trial, or order the entry of a finding of not guilty, or order the entry of a finding of guilty of any offense included in the offense charged in the indictment or complaint.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b452-10\">The jury were also instructed on joint venture, and they returned general guilty verdicts. The defendant asserts that the conviction can only stand if the evidence was sufficient to convict her both as a principal and as a joint venturer. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pimentel, </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. <em>777, </em>779 (2009), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>420 Mass. 810, 818-819 (1995). However, the trial judge carefully instructed in accordance with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zanetti, </em>454 Mass. 449, 466-468 (2009), that the jury had to find the defendant\u2019s knowing participation in the offense, alone or with others, with the requisite intent, in order to convict. See <em>id. </em>at 468. We therefore need not \u201cexamine the sufficiency of the evidence separately as to principal and joint venture liability.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The line of cases to the contrary is no longer good law after <em>Zanetti. </em>See <em>id. </em>at 467-468.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Nelson, of course, was present in the apartment and found, like the defendant, near the drugs in the small apartment. His connections to the apartment, however, were less extensive. The fact that no men\u2019s clothing was observed there suggests that he was not the primary occupant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Of course, possession may be joint, and the Commonwealth need not exclude the possibility that others may also be in possession of the contraband. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanez, </em>410 Mass. 290, 306 (1991); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 554, 557 (1991); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 235, 240-241 (1997). But in <em>Boria </em>and <em>Brown, </em>the presence of other culpable individuals, combined with the lack of evidence showing the defendants\u2019 connection to the drugs, made it unreasonable to impute possession to those defendants. <em>Boria, </em>440 Mass. at 225-227. <em>Brown, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. at 419-421. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, supra </em>at 558; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 619, 621-622 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b455-8\">See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 619, 621-622 (1993) (strong evidence tied codefendant, but not defendant, to front bedroom where drugs were found); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. at 506-507 (evidence indicated someone else occupied second bedroom where shotgun was found).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b457-6\">UnIike some of the cases cited by the defendant, the warrant adequately specified the items to be seized, and was merely ambiguous as to the place to be searched. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Forish, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 554, 557-561 (2004). Once the correct apartment was determined, the scope of the search was appropriately confined, and there was no prejudice to the defendant. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Valerio, </em>449 Mass. 562, 566-572 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b457-7\">The defendant requested an opportunity to be heard further. The judge stated that the defendant could raise the issue again outside the hearing of the jury, but she never did.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b458-7\">The officers did not find a firearm in the apartment, but did find a loaded BB gun.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The defendant did object to the following testimony by Keating, which she did not reference in her brief: \u201cFor example, like I said, an 8-ball is 3.5 grams. You can purchase that for $150. If you buy a twenty, it\u2019s only $20 and there\u2019s only .2 grams. So you almost have to buy seventeen to eighteen twenties to equal an 8-ball. So you almost have to spend almost double the money if you\u2019re buying twenties and forties than if you would just [buy] the 8-ball.\u201d This testimony is partly cumulative of other statements by Keating and other witnesses. The defendant explored the issue on cross-examination and impeached Keating with a prior occasion on which he had received a discount when making an undercover purchase of multiple smaller bags of crack cocaine. We discern no abuse of discretion in overruling the objection, and no prejudice to the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grissett, </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 454, 457-458 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b459-7\">The one exception was struck on Nelson\u2019s motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
