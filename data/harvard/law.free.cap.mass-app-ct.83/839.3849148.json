Sharis (Alice),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on the grounds of lack of testamentary capacity and Spinelli\u2019s undue influence. We discern no error in the judge\u2019s conclusions that Spinelli was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>a fiduciary, and that the will was the product of undue influence. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>Born in 1916, Alice came to the United States from Turkey when she was twelve years old, and completed the seventh grade. She had three daughters, Virginia, Louise, and Florence, with her first husband, whom she divorced in 1959. She had sixteen surviving grandchildren and several great-grandchildren. The decedent married her second husband, Peter, in 1961. Peter, who predeceased Alice by thirteen months, suffered from Alzheimer\u2019s disease in the last years of his life and lived in a nursing home during the last six months of his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Spinelli is one of Alice\u2019s grandchildren. After separating from his wife in November, 2003, he asked Alice and Peter if he could move into their home. He remained there through Peter\u2019s illness and death and the death of Alice on February 13, 2010. He made no monetary contributions to the upkeep or mnning of the home, but he did drive Alice to medical appointments and other destinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">The judge found that Spinelli gained nearly complete control of Alice and Peter\u2019s checking account between 2006 and 2008. Spinelli signed Peter\u2019s name to 119 checks between March 4, 2006, and February 4, 2008.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Alice complained to one of her daughters and a granddaughter that she did not know where her money or checks were. On June 30, 2007, Alice signed a durable power of attorney, prepared by Spinelli, that took effect immediately and gave Spinelli broad powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">Spinelli did not inform other family members of the power of attorney, or that he was signing checks on his grandparents\u2019 accounts. In February or March of 2008, Spinelli contacted an attorney, had an initial meeting, and inquired whether the at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>tomey could draft a will for his grandmother.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The attorney, a corporate lawyer who had been in practice approximately four years at that time, did not meet with Alice in person, and could not remember what she told him regarding the disposition of the assets of her estate. He called her at Spinelli\u2019s urging, had a short intake telephone conversation with her, and then assigned the actual drafting of the will to an associate in his office. The associate who actually drafted the will communicated by electronic mail (e-mail) only with Spinelli. There is no evidence that the associate communicated directly with Alice. Once the will was drafted and sent to Alice, the attorney conducted a brief, two-minute telephone conversation with her. No attorney reviewed the terms of the will in person with Alice, nor did an attorney attend the execution of the will. There is no evidence that either the attorney or the associate inquired, or that Alice explained, why she would favor Spinelli over her daughters and other grandchildren.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">On July 23, 2008, Spinelli took Alice to the nursing home where her husband was a patient. She executed her will there, with nursing home staff as witnesses. Spinelli was nearby when the will was executed but was not in the room. The employees who witnessed the will did not observe any behavior that caused them to question whether Alice executed the will of her own free will.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">The will provides that all of the Alice\u2019s assets be distributed to her husband, Peter, should he survive her. If not, the house and all of the assets and property contained therein were to go to Spinelli, along with all her stocks and securities. Her savings and checking accounts were distributed equally to her three daughters. The residuary was distributed equally among her three daughters and Spinelli.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">Following the execution of the will, in September of 2008, Spinelli opened a checking account in his name in trust for Peter and Alice. Between September, 2008, and the date Alice died in February of 2010, the judge found, and Spinelli does not dispute, that he transferred $71,450 from the checking account to the trust account, and that substantial sums were then expended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>from the trust account. The judge found these transfers had the effect of disrupting Alice\u2019s bequest of her checking and savings accounts to her daughters. The judge found that Spinelli, who testified at trial, was not credible on key issues, including his control over bank accounts, his control over Alice\u2019s finances, and the circumstances under which he obtained the power of attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>One of the decedent\u2019s daughters, Florence, brought this action contesting the will on grounds of lack of testamentary capacity and undue influence. Spinelli argues that the facts found by the judge do not support the inference that Spinelli unduly influenced his grandmother. We review the judge\u2019s findings for clear error, <em>Goodman </em>v. <em>Atwood, </em>78 Mass. App. Ct. 655, 658 (2011), giving considerable respect to the judge\u2019s assessment of the testimony. <em>Matter of the Estate of Moretti, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 642, 651 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">\u201cAny species of coercion, whether physical, mental or moral, which subverts the sound judgment and genuine desire of the individual, is enough to constitute undue influence.\u201d <em>Neill </em>v. <em>Brackett, </em>234 Mass. 367, 369 (1920). A claim of undue influence is comprised of four elements: \u201c(1) an unnatural disposition has been made (2) by a person susceptible to undue influence to the advantage of someone (3) with an opportunity to exercise undue influence and (4) who in fact has used that opportunity to procure the contested disposition through improper means.\u201d <em>O\u2019Rourke </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>446 Mass. 814, 828 (2006) (citations omitted). <em>Hemon </em>v. <em>Hemon, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 492, 497 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">While the burden of proof ordinarily rests with the party contesting the will, a \u201cfiduciary who benefits in a transaction with the person for whom he is a fiduciary bears the burden of establishing that the transaction did not violate his obligations.\u201d <em>Cleary </em>v. <em>Cleary, 427 </em>Mass. 286, 295 (1998). Spinelli does not contest the finding that he had a fiduciary relationship with Alice. Spinelli was the decedent\u2019s fiduciary under a broad durable power of attorney; he had near complete control of Alice\u2019s finances, and played an instrumental role in arranging for the will to be drafted and executed. It was therefore his burden to prove that the will was not the product of his undue influence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>See <em>Matter of the Estate of Moretti, </em>supra; <em>Germain </em>v. <em>Girard, </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. 409, 413-414 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">a. <em>Independent counsel. </em>Spinelli contends that Alice had the advice of independent legal counsel and this fact alone militates against the undue influence as a matter of law. The rationale for shifting the burden to a fiduciary who benefits from a transaction with his principal is that \u201c[t]he fiduciary can take precautions to ensure that proof exists that the transaction was fair and that his principal was fully informed, and he is in the best position after the transaction to explain and justify it.\u201d <em>Matter of the Estate of Moretti, supra </em>at 653, quoting <em>Cleary </em>v. <em>Cleary, supra </em>at 293. See <em>Germain </em>v. <em>Girard, supra </em>at 412-413. \u201c[T]he burden to prove the transaction was fair \u2018is generally met if the fiduciary shows that the principal made the request with full knowledge and intent ... or with the advice of independent legal counsel.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rempelakis </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 557, 569 (2006) (citation omitted). One of the functions of independent counsel is to provide documentation that the making and execution of a will is voluntary and knowing, thus lending transparency and credibility to the bequest.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">The judge\u2019s finding that Alice lacked the advice of independent counsel is supported by the record. Spinelli selected the attorney, communicated with the drafting attorney by e-mail, filled in certain terms, and transported Alice to her husband\u2019s nursing home for the execution of her will. Strikingly, Alice never met the attorney in person and communicated with him briefly only twice by telephone. There is no evidence that the associate who drafted the will ever spoke with Alice; she communicated by e-mail with Spinelli. No attorney reviewed the terms of the will with Alice. Only Spinelli did so. Significantly, the decedent had no prior wills and there was no evidence that she was familiar with wills or their terminology. The attorney could not recall the specifics of his conversation with Alice or any specific advice he offered her with respect to the dispositions in her will. There was testimony at trial that Alice claimed to have no will. On this record, the judge\u2019s finding that the decedent lacked the benefit of independent advice of counsel was not clearly erroneous. See <em>Bessom </em>v. <em>Bayrd, </em>282 Mass. 58 (1933); <em>Doggett </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>299 Mass. 383 (1938). Compare <em>Foley </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>v. <em>Philbrook, </em>300 Mass. 418, 423 (1938) (will prepared by \u201ca lawyer of high standing at the bar from instructions given him by the deceased, personally\u201d); <em>O\u2019Rourke </em>v. <em>Hunter, supra </em>at 826 (attorney reviewed various options available to testator regarding disposition of home); <em>Rostanzo </em>v. <em>Rostanzo, </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 588, 605 (2009) (attorney rendered \u201cprofessional and sound advice regarding the disposition of [the testator\u2019s] assets upon his death\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">b. <em>Secrecy. </em>There was an aura of secrecy surrounding the estate planning, as no one in the family, other than Spinelli, was aware that Alice had executed a will before her death.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge was not required to credit Spinelli\u2019s testimony that Alice requested that he keep the existence of the will confidential; in view of the judge\u2019s credibility findings it is clear that he did not do so. Although the judge found that the witnesses to the will did not observe any signs of duress or undue influence, the will was neither read in front of them nor was there any discussion of its terms during the execution. Compare <em>Rempelakis </em>v. <em>Russell, supra </em>at 560-564. Spinelli alone was in a position to ensure that there was proof that Alice was fully informed and independently made the bequests at issue. See <em>Matter of the Estate of Moretti, supra </em>at 652-653. There was no error in the judge\u2019s finding that he failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">c. <em>Susceptibility. </em>Although Spinelli suggests that Alice was not susceptible to undue influence, her advanced age, lack of familiarity with wills, and seventh grade education, coupled with Spinelli\u2019s nearly complete control of her finances, among other factors, permit the inference that she was susceptible to his influence. See generally <em>Doggett </em>v. <em>Morse, supra </em>at 386-390; <em>Baxter </em>v. <em>Grasso, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 692, 697 (2001); <em>Matter of the Estate of Moretti, supra </em>at 651-653. Spinelli clearly had the opportunity to exercise influence to his benefit. Notwithstanding that Spinelli lived with Alice during the last eight years of her life, the judge was not compelled to conclude that the dispositions made in Alice\u2019s will were natural. The judge did not credit evidence of a particularly close relationship between them. To the contrary, he found that Alice questioned why Spinelli needed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>to live with her and why he had stayed so long. Instead, the judge credited testimony of the relationship the decedent enjoyed with her children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, particularly her granddaughter and her great-granddaughter.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">d. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>Spinelli argues that there was no evidence of self-dealing while Alice was alive, and that the judge\u2019s conclusion was against the weight of the evidence. The weight of the evidence was for the trial judge. We find the facts enumerated above to be sufficient in and of themselves to support the conclusion that Spinelli did not meet his burden to prove that the will was executed without undue influence. \u201cThe conduct of a trusted advisor prior to the making of a will in which he is named as beneficiary may be such as to amount to undue influence voiding the will, without proof of specific acts of the advisor at the time the will was made.\u201d <em>Doggett </em>v. <em>Morse, supra </em>at 389-390.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">In addition, the judge found that Spinelli\u2019s transfer of funds from the checking accounts into the trust account \u201cdisrupt[ed] Alice\u2019s bequest of her \u2018checking and savings accounts\u2019 to her daughters.\u201d Spinelli was unable adequately to explain where the money in the trust account went. Spinelli\u2019s failure to account fully for these funds was a proper matter of consideration for the judge, whose credibility findings we do not disturb. <em>Erb </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 120, 124 (1982). <em>Edinburg </em>v. <em>Edinburg, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 199, 203 (1986), quoting from <em>New England Canteen Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ashley, </em>372 Mass. 671, 675 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">It is true that there is no direct evidence that Spinelli unduly influenced the decedent. This is neither surprising nor telling. \u201cIn many instances a finding of undue influence rests largely on circumstantial evidence, since direct evidence of such influence is often difficult to establish.\u201d <em>Maimonides Sch. </em>v. <em>Coles, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 240, 256 (2008), quoting <em>Miles </em>v. <em>Caples, </em>362 Mass. 107, 112 (1972). Nor is there evidence that he emptied the trust account for his personal benefit. However, by depleting the checking account bequeathed to others, Spinelli preserved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>those assets bequeathed to him. \u201cThe nature of fraud and undue influence is such that they often work in veiled and secret ways. The power of a strong will over . . . one weakened by disease, over-indulgence or age may be manifest although not shown by gross or palpable instrumentalities. . . . When the donor is enfeebled by age or disease, although not reaching to unsoundness of mind, and the relation between the parties is fiduciary or intimate, the transaction ordinarily is subject to careful scrutiny.\u201d <em>Neill </em>v. <em>Brackett, </em>234 Mass. at 369. Neither direct evidence nor evidence of appropriation of assets for personal use before death was required to support an inference of undue influence. <em>Id. </em>at 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>In sum, the judge\u2019s ruling that the decedent\u2019s will was the result of undue influence by Spinelli was not clear error. The judge permissibly found that Spinelli failed to meet his burden of proving that Alice, with full knowledge and intent, favored him over her children and other grandchildren without his undue influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b881-15\">We refer to Alice Sharis and her husband, Peter, by their first names in order to avoid confusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b882-9\">Because of the result we reach on the claim of undue influence, we need not address whether the decedent possessed testamentary capacity at the time she executed her will.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b882-10\">He did not have the authority to sign Peter\u2019s name, nor did he have signature authority in his own name. Spinelli does not challenge these findings. Spinelli\u2019s name first appears on the February 4, 2008, statement. The judge considered his testimony regarding the signing of checks in Peter\u2019s name to be \u201cevasive and duplicitous.\u201d The judge did not find, however, any evidence of misappropriation of funds from this account.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b883-8\">The attorney who prepared the will is different from counsel on the appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b886-7\">Likewise, Spinelli did not tell his family about the power of attorney or the creation of the trust account.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b887-8\">The granddaughter shared most holidays with her grandmother, tended her garden, and provided other services to her grandmother.
