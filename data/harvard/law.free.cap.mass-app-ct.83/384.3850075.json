We affirm the breaking into a depository and possession of burglarious tools convictions and reverse the malicious destruction of property conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">1. <em>Background. </em>The jury heard the following evidence. At 3:00 a.m. on October 26, 2010, the Boston police department received a call for a bank alarm tripped at the ATM in the vestibule of the Meetinghouse Hill Bank in the Dorchester section of Loston. When Officers Omar Cepeda and Eddy Pena arrived, they looked through the glass window of the bank and saw that the cover of the ATM was lifted. A man on a bicycle, later identified as Matthew Pickett, immediately approached them and pointed to the defendant \u201cmaybe 25 to 50 feet away\u201d walking up the sidewalk carrying a large bag. When the officers approached the defendant on foot, he began to ran; the officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>then chased and caught him. After securing the defendant in the police cruiser, Officer Cepeda opened the defendant\u2019s duffle bag and saw several tools, including a yellow metal grinder that was still \u201cextremely hot\u201d to the touch.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Cepeda then entered the bank vestibule and noticed \u201csmoke on the air\u201d and the \u201csmell of the bum.\u201d He also observed that the cover on the ATM was up and that the door hinge was partially ground. Meanwhile, Cepeda\u2019s partner, Officer Pena, spoke further with Pickett.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">2. <em>Breaking into a </em>depository.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant argues that the trial judge should have allowed his motion for a required finding of not guilty on the charge of breaking into a depository because, he alleges, the Commonwealth failed to prove that the ATM was a functioning depository. For support, he relies on an unpublished Michigan case to argue that specific evidence was required to demonstrate how an ATM functions in order to establish that the item was, in fact, a depository.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">\u201cIn reviewing the denial of the defendant\u2019s motions for required findings of not guilty, the \u2018question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 (emphasis in original). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Salemme, </em>395 Mass. 594, 595 (1985), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cordle, </em>404 Mass. 733, 738 (1989). Here, the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence included three bank surveillance videos<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and corroborating testimony from the two arresting officers. In addition, the president of the bank identified the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>video exhibits as surveillance tapes recorded in the area where the ATM was located. Finally, Officer Cepeda referred to the machine as \u201cthe ATM\u201d and added that he was familiar with the bank because he used it for his personal banking. \u201cI noticed the ATM which [was] located through a glass, so you can actually see from the street, the cover of the ATM was lifted up.\u201d The abbreviation \u201cATM\u201d is a commonly used term for a machine that conducts banking transactions, including dispensing cash.* *****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Furr, </em>454 Mass. 101, 102 (2009). \u201cDepository\u201d has been defined as \u201c[a] place where one leaves money or valuables for safekeeping.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 505 (9th ed. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">After hearing all the evidence, a rational jury could have found that the machine, located in the bank vestibule and targeted by the defendant, was an ATM, that the ATM in question was a depository within the meaning of the statute, and that it was a place where something of value was left. Evaluating this evidence in combination with the defendant\u2019s possession of a recently used metal grinding tool, damage to the ATM door hinge, and smoke still lingering in the bank vestibule along with the odor of burnt metal, we are satisfied that the Commonwealth met its burden to prove the charge of breaking into a depository.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">3. <em>Malicious destruction of </em>property.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant next <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>argues that the Commonwealth failed to prove malicious destruction of property over $250 because there was insufficient evidence to show malice and no evidence as to the actual cost of the damage done to the ATM machine. The Commonwealth responds that malice was proved by the \u201cdegree of force employed by the defendant as he pried open the ATM,\u201d and also that the jury could infer from the photographs in evidence that the damage to the ATM was in excess of $250.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">To prove malicious destruction of property, the defendant\u2019s actions must be both \u201cwilful\u201d and \u201cmalicious.\u201d G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 127. \u201cIn addition to the intent to inflict injury to property, the crime requires a state of mind infused with cruelty, hostility or revenge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Redmond, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 4 (2001). <em>Redmond </em>controls here; in that case, the defendant was arrested while apparently in the process of stealing computer equipment. In pursuit of that goal, he had ripped a security alarm from the wall, broken a window, and forcibly opened the front door of the office: \u201cthe lock was damaged, the door frame was gouged, and wood chips were on the floor. Inside the office, a second door, leading into a computer room, appeared kicked in and bore other indicia of a forcible entry, with gouge marks on the frame, a bent deadbolt lock, and more wood chips on the floor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. This court concluded that \u201c[ajlthough clearly intended, such property damage was nothing more than \u2018the adventitious by-product of a wholly discrete criminal enterprise\u2019 (the theft of the computers) and was not \u2018gratuitous, excessive violence purposefully designed to intimidate and overpower,\u2019 ... or destructive activities that were by design and hostile to the owner of the property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wynn, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 452, 456 (1997). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morris M., </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. 688 (2007) (destruction of property caused by driving a Jeep across the driving range of a golf course and smashing the car into a pole was not malicious because the juvenile was driving the vehicle in order to escape another who apparently intended to harm him). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>82 Mass. App. Ct. 227, 233 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">In the case before us, it is clear that the damage was done in an effort to steal from the ATM and not with \u201ca state of mind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>infused with cruelty, hostility or revenge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Redmond, supra </em>at 4. Even viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence was not sufficient to establish the necessary element of malice.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">4. <em>Hearsay statements. </em>The defendant also argues that his right to confrontation was violated when verbal and nonverbal hearsay statements were admitted through the testimony of Officers Cepeda and Pena rather than by calling Pickett as a trial witness. The Commonwealth responds that testimony regarding Pickett\u2019s pointing was appropriately admitted because it demonstrated the officers\u2019 states of mind at the time of pursuit and arrest of the defendant; Pickett\u2019s later oral statements to Pena were admissible, the Commonwealth maintains, under the doctrine of verbal completeness.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">a. <em>Pointing gesture. </em>Officer Cepeda testified, over objection, that when he and Officer Pena pulled up to the bank, a man unknown to him (later identified as Pickett) pointed to the other side of the street. When Cepeda looked in that direction, he saw \u201ca male carrying a large bag [running] away from us.\u201d Cepeda identified the male as the defendant. The defendant argues that Cepeda\u2019s description of the act of pointing was inadmissible hearsay, offered to prove that the defendant was the person who had broken into the ATM. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">\u201c[T]he hearsay rule forbids only the testimonial use of reported statements. It does not preclude the use of such statements for other valid purposes such as . . . the state of police knowledge which impelled the approach to the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaVelle, </em>414 Mass. 146, 155 (1993), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>361 Mass. 644, 659 (1972). \u201cThis evidence was admitted as background for the \u2018state of police knowledge\u2019 and not for its truth. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosario, </em>430 Mass. 505, 508-510 (1999).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Faust, </em>81 Mass. App. Ct. 498, 503 (2012). In <em>Rosario, </em>the court noted that it had \u201cexplained that \u2018an arresting or investigating officer should not be put in the false position of seeming just to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>have happened upon the scene; he should be allowed some explanation of his presence and conduct. \u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>[412 Mass. 375, 393 (1992)], quoting McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 249, at 734 (E. Cleary 3d ed. 1984). . . . [Because] [testimony of this kind carries a high probability of misuse, . . . [the court has] therefore permitted this evidence only through the testimony of a police officer who must testify only on the basis of his own knowledge. . . . Second, the testimony must be limited to the facts required to establish the officer\u2019s state of knowledge. Disclosure of the substance of the conversation ordinarily is not required .... Third, the police action or state of police knowledge must be relevant to an issue in the case.\u201d <em>Rosario, supra. </em>See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 801(c) (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">In this case, Cepeda\u2019s description of the pointing gesture meets every prong of that test. Cepeda observed the gesture itself; there was no conversation at all, and the gesture was relevant to explain why the police officers went after the defendant, instead of stopping to speak to Pickett. In addition, evidence of the pointing clearly was cumulative of the evidence in the video that was admitted without objection. We also reject the defendant\u2019s argument that testimony about the pointing gesture violated his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation, as the gesture was not offered for the purpose of proving that the defendant had committed the crime. Finally, even if the gesture was admitted in error, it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, as it duplicated other, overwhelming evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galicia, </em>447 Mass. 737, 748 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">b. <em>Officer Pena\u2019s testimony about Pickett\u2019s statement. </em>The defendant called Pena as a witness and elicited testimony that, during their conversation after the defendant\u2019s arrest, Pickett identified himself and gave Pena his telephone number. The prosecutor was then permitted, on cross-examination, and over the defendant\u2019s objections, to question Pena as to Pickett\u2019s other statements during this same conversation. Pena testified that Pickett told him that he \u201csaw [the defendant] inside of the bank ... in front of the, ah, ATM with the, ah, a tool in his hand. . . . [W]hen we arrived, Mr. Pickett was on scene. He was telling us which way [the defendant] had gone.\u201d This testimony was admitted in error. Asking the officer if he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>obtained Pickett\u2019s name and telephone number did not open the door to admitting everything Pickett said to the police officer. The questions asked by the defense properly laid a foundation both for an argument that the police investigation and subsequent prosecution were flawed, because Pickett was not called as a witness, and for the defendant\u2019s later request for a missing witness instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The Commonwealth argues that the testimony was admissible under the doctrine of verbal completeness. \u201cUnder the doctrine of verbal completeness, \u2018[w]hen a party introduces a portion of a statement or writing in evidence,\u2019 a judge has the discretion to \u2018allow[] admission of other relevant portions of the same statement or writing which serve to \u201cclarify the context\u201d of the admitted portion.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carmona, </em>428 Mass. 268, 272 (1998), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robles, </em>423 Mass. 62, 69 (1996).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Aviles, </em>461 Mass. 60, 75 (2011). However, the court in <em>Aviles </em>emphasized that \u201c[t]he doctrine of verbal completeness does not open the door for everything in a statement or document. ... To be admitted, \u2018the additional portions of the statement must be . . . necessary to the understanding of the admitted statement.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eugene, </em>438 Mass. 343, 350-351 (2003).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Aviles, supra </em>at 75. See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 106 (2012). Here, the testimony elicited by the prosecutor on cross-examination cannot reasonably be said to have been necessary to understanding the testimony that the officer had obtained the witness\u2019s name and telephone number. On the other hand, the testimony added nothing to the Commonwealth\u2019s case. It was clearly cumulative and, given the overwhelming nature of the evidence, harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galicia, </em>447 Mass. at 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">5. <em>Jury instructions. </em>We address briefly the defendant\u2019s claims of error in the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury. First, he argues that the trial judge abused his discretion by not giving a \u201cmissing witness\u201d instruction. \u201c[Wjhether to give a missing witness instruction is a decision that must be made on a case-by-case basis, in the discretion of the trial judge\u201d and overturned \u201conly if it was \u2018manifestly unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ivy, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 851, 860 (2002), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>v. <em>Thomas, </em>429 Mass. 146, 151 (1999). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>450 Mass. 894, 901 (2008). (\u201cThere was no evidence that [the witness] was physically available to the Commonwealth, that it knew of his whereabouts, or that it deliberately was concealing his whereabouts\u201d). In addition, as noted, the evidence against the defendant was strong and Pickett\u2019s testimony likely would have been cumulative of the video evidence and the officers\u2019 testimony. There was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Second, the defendant challenges the judge\u2019s failure to give a <em>Bowden </em>instruction on the inadequacies of the police investigation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bowden, </em>379 Mass. 472, 485-486 (1980). \u201cAs [the court has] stated on many occasions, \u2018a judge is not required to instruct on the claimed inadequacy of a police investigation. <em>\u201cBowden </em>simply holds that a judge may not remove the issue from the jury\u2019s consideration.\u201d \u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boateng, </em>438 Mass. 498, 507 (2003), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>432 Mass. 578, 590 (2000). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Avila, </em>454 Mass. [at] 767 . . . ; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>439 Mass. 678, 687 (2003).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lao, </em>460 Mass. 12, 23 (2011).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Finally, the defendant argues that the judge erroneously failed to reinstruct on reasonable doubt in response to a jury question, \u201c[C]an you provide a criteria for guilty or not guilty?\u201d Over objection, the judge asked the jury for further clarification.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Defense counsel asked that the <em>Webster </em>charge on reasonable doubt, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>5 Cush. 295, 320 (1850), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>be given a second time and the judge refused, noting that, in his experience, when a jury wanted further instruction on reasonable doubt, they usually made that clear. We see no error. The judge properly instructed the jury on reasonable doubt in his final charge to the jury, and the defendant did not object. \u201c \u2018The proper response to a jury question must remain within the discretion of the trial judge, who has observed the evidence and the jury firsthand and can tailor supplemental instructions accordingly.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Waite, </em>422 Mass. 792, 807 n.11 (1996). The judge\u2019s discretion to formulate a response is broad. <em>Id.\u201d Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monteagudo, </em>427 Mass. 484, 488 (1998). In addition, a judge \u201crisks much mischief by going beyond the facial content of a deliberating jury\u2019s question in an effort to provide assistance on a subject that he or she infers is \u2018really\u2019 troubling them.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 586, 593 (2003). See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 1111 (2012). We see no error and certainly no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">For the foregoing reasons, on the charges of breaking into a depository in the nighttime with intent to commit a felony and possession of burglarious tools, the judgments are affirmed. On the charge of malicious destruction of property, the judgment is reversed, the finding is set aside, and judgment shall enter for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b427-10\">The defendant was acquitted of resisting arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b428-8\">The duffle bag also contained a flashlight, \u201ccrowbars, wedges, and shilfulls (phonetic), that look like a screwdriver kind of thing,\u201d gloves, and a ski mask.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b428-9\">Pickett was not called as a witness at trial, and the Commonwealth\u2019s pretrial motion in limine requesting the admission of Pickett\u2019s statements to the officer was denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b428-10\">\u201cWhoever, in the night time,. . . attempts to or does break, bum, blow up or otherwise injures or destroys a safe, vault or other depository of money, bonds or other valuables in any building . . . with intent to commit a larceny . . . whether he succeeds or fails in the perpetration of such larceny . . . shall be punished . . . .\u201d G.

The second video shows a view of the street in front of the bank. Pickett bicycles past the bank and then stops in front of what appears to be the location of the ATM. The defendant is then shown leaving the bank with the black duffle bag and turning down a side street; a few seconds later, the police arrive and Pickett points toward the direction the defendant had walked. The third video is a view of the back parking lot behind the bank. The defendant is shown walking down the side street holding the black duffle bag.
