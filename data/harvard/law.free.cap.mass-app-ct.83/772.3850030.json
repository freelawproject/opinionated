See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blais, </em>428 Mass. 294, 298-299 (1998). In this case, we must decide whether compul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>sion, in a constitutional sense, is involved when such a person agrees to perform field sobriety tests, and then in attempting to perform a test makes statements about the difficulty of completing it or the inability to perform it. For the reasons which follow, we conclude that statements of a person\u2019s difficulty or inability to perform a field sobriety test like those involved in this case are not the product of compulsion within the meaning of art. 12 and thus are available for use against the individual at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">The defendant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, second or subsequent offense, and found responsible for a marked lanes violation as a result of an incident which occurred on May 23, 2010, in Wakefield. See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(1)(a)(1); G. L. c. 89, \u00a7 4B. The sole issue raised on appeal is the judge\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s pretrial motion in limine to exclude certain testimony by the investigating police officer about statements made by the defendant while he was attempting to perform the tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\"><em>Factual background. </em>The motion in limine is not included in the record. The motion was heard prior to the trial on the basis of argument by counsel. However, there is no dispute as to the essential facts, which we draw from the transcripts of the pretrial and trial proceedings viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. At approximately 1:30 a.m. on May 23, 2010, Wakefield police Officer Kelly Tobyne observed the defendant\u2019s black sport utility vehicle traveling on the wrong side of Nahant Street as it came around a turn. She activated her cruiser\u2019s blue lights. The defendant did not stop. She then activated her siren and pursued the defendant\u2019s vehicle for about three-tenths mile onto Broadway, where she observed it pull into a driveway on Lake Street. Officer Tobyne observed the defendant, Richard G. Brown, get out of his vehicle. He remarked, \u201cCan\u2019t you guys just let me go home?\u201d The defendant stated that he had only consumed a couple of beers. Officer Tobyne noted that the defendant\u2019s speech was slurred, his eyes were glassy, and there was an odor of an alcoholic beverage. Officer Tobyne ordered him to get back into his vehicle. By this time, Officer Erickson arrived at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">The defendant was asked to step out of his vehicle and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>perform some field sobriety tests.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Officer Tobyne first explained and demonstrated how to perform the nine-step, heel to toe walk and turn test. The defendant did not complete the nine steps, did not touch heel to toe, extended his arms for balance as he walked, and appeared unsteady. The defendant asked how he had done. Officer Tobyne did not reply, but instead explained and demonstrated the next test, the one-legged stand, which requires one leg to be raised for a specified number of seconds. On the first attempt the defendant raised his leg, but immediately put it down. On his second attempt, the defendant lost his balance and stated, \u201cI can\u2019t do this.\u201d The defendant was then arrested and transported to the Wakefield police station where he was booked.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Standard of review. </em>After denying the defendant\u2019s pretrial motion in limine, the judge added, \u201cI\u2019ll note your objection.\u201d When the evidence was offered at trial, the defendant did not renew his objection. The Commonwealth maintains that we should treat the issue as a claim of unpreserved error. In such a case, the standard of review is whether there was a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. The general rule is that the denial of a motion in limine does not, without more, preserve the issue for purposes of appellate review. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whelton, </em>428 Mass. 24, 25 (1998); Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 103(a)(3) (2013). There is no need to object at trial, however, when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>pretrial motion is based on constitutional grounds. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whelton, supra </em>at 26. Here, the defendant\u2019s claim was based entirely on art. 12. In view of the result we reach, it is unnecessary to decide the point. We will assume that the issue was preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">2. <em>The constitutional framework. </em>Article 12 prohibits the use in a criminal proceeding of evidence that is (1) the product of governmental compulsion<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) testimonial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>459 Mass. 165, 169 (2011).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brennan, </em>386 Mass. 772, 783 (1982) (privilege against self-incrimination expressed in art. 12 does not extend to noncommunicative evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">a. <em>Governmental compulsion. </em>In cases involving the refusal to perform a test, the element of governmental compulsion is required whether the police inform the defendant that he may take the test, request that he take the test, or command him to take the test. As the Supreme Judicial Court observed in <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>412 Mass. 1201, 1211 (1992), in reviewing proposed legislation, \u201c[tjhere is compulsion, therefore, on the accused to choose between two alternatives, both of which are capable of producing evidence against him. The proposed statute, therefore, uses the threat of adverse testimonial evidence as a coercive tool to compel submission to a breathalyzer test. The accused is thus placed in a \u2018Catch-22\u2019 situation: take the test and perhaps produce potentially incriminating real evidence; refuse and have adverse testimonial evidence used against him at trial.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The basis for the Massachusetts rule that a refusal to perform a test offered by the police is compelled testimony is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>\u201c[t]he choice either to produce incriminating evidence or be punished with an inference of guilt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bly, </em>448 Mass. 473, 497 (2007). See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fish, </em>321 Or. 48, 58 (1995) (\u201cThus, when an individual is given a \u2018choice\u2019 between various courses of conduct, the determination of whether the \u2018choice\u2019 constitutes compulsion depends on the nature of the options. Where every \u2018choice\u2019 is a course of conduct that the state could not compel an individual to take, mandating by law that an individual make a \u2018choice\u2019 among them constitutes compulsion\u201d).* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">b. <em>Testimonial evidence. </em>Tests of physical coordination, such as walking a straight line, raising one leg for a specified number of seconds, and touching one\u2019s nose with one\u2019s index finger, are not testimonial because they do not \u201creveal[] the subject\u2019s knowledge or thoughts concerning some fact.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brennan, </em>386 Mass. 772, 778 (1982). The responses of a person impaired by alcohol to such tests are incriminating \u201cnot because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>the tests [reveal the] defendant\u2019s thoughts, but because [the defendant\u2019s] body\u2019s responses [differ] from those of a sober person.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Hager, </em>69 N.Y.2d 141, 142 (1987). In <em>Vanhouton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>424 Mass. 327, 332 n.9, cert. denied, 522 U.S. 834 (1997), the court explained that if, during \u201ca roadside traffic stop for suspected drunk driving where the motorist is not in custody,\u201d he performs field sobriety tests such as reciting the alphabet, counting backwards, and reciting the date of a particular birthday, there is no violation of art. 12 because even if the suspect\u2019s responses are testimonial, they are not the product of governmental compulsion. See <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Muniz, </em>496 U.S. 582, 585-586, 602-604 (1990) (defendant was in custody, but observations of his slurred speech and lack of muscular coordination during field sobriety tests were not testimonial).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Refusal evidence, however, stands on a different footing. As we have already noted, \u201c [o]rdinarily, a prosecutor wants to admit evidence that the defendant refused to take a field sobriety test so that the jury may infer that it is the equivalent of his statement, T have had so much to drink that I know or at least suspect that I am unable to pass the test.\u2019 <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>[412 Mass.] at 1209.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGrail, </em>419 Mass. 774, 778 (1995). \u201c[T]he admissibility of such a refusal would place a defendant in a coercive \u2018Catch-22\u2019 situation: Take the test and \u2018furnish\u2019 incriminating real evidence against oneself, or refuse and produce adverse testimonial evidence of consciousness of guilt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>459 Mass. at 170, quoting from <em>Opinion of the Justices, supra </em>at 1211. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conkey, </em>430 Mass. 139, 142 (1999) (\u201cevidence admitted to show consciousness of guilt is always testimonial because it tends to demonstrate that the defendant knew he was guilty\u201d). \u201c[I]f refusal evidence has relevance to any issue essential to the prosecution\u2019s case, it is because it is reflective of the knowledge, understanding, and thought process of the accused.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, supra </em>at 1211. For this reason, evidence of the refusal to perform field sobriety tests when directed or requested by the police to do so violates the privilege against self-incrimination safeguarded by art. 12. <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Contrast <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Laughlin, </em>446 Mass. 188, 205-206 (2006) (evidence that the defendant initially consented to a police request to search his apartment and test a red stain on a closet door but later changed his mind and removed the stain was admissible because it was necessary to explain the loss of evidence and to put the defendant\u2019s destruction of the evidence in context).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">We have previously held that once a person gives consent to take a test, his physical actions in performing the test are not testimonial and may be the subject of testimony at trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curley, </em>78 Mass. App. Ct. 163, 168 (2010) (observations of the defendant\u2019s \u201cattempts\u201d to take the breathalyzer test not tantamount to evidence of his refusal to take the test). The basis for distinguishing between the defendant\u2019s refusal to take a test and volunteered statements made while attempting to perform the test does not turn on the distinction between testimonial and physical evidence (statements are clearly testimonial), but instead on the presence or absence of governmental compulsion. Once the defendant agrees to take the test and attempts it,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> his expressions of difficulty or inability to perform or to complete it, such as \u201cI can\u2019t do this,\u201d \u201cI give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>up,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ve had too much to drink,\u201d are not the products of compulsion and thus are admissible. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sands, </em>424 Mass. 184, 189 (1997) (\u201cFurther, the defendant\u2019s claim that his voluntary admission violates art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights is without record support. There was no evidence that the defendant did not voluntarily furnish the communication that he was over the legal limit of intoxication, and there was no \u2018Catch-22\u2019 situation compelling him to furnish evidence. The defendant merely had to say, \u2018No\u2019 to withhold consent to taking the breathalyzer test, but instead, he blurted-out that he was intoxicated beyond the legal limit\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Even if the defendant agrees to perform field sobriety tests and attempts one or more of the tests administered by the officer, any subsequent refusal is similarly inadmissible as compelled testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grenier, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 58, 60-61 (1998). By contrast, in this case the defendant did not refuse to perform field sobriety tests; instead, he attempted unsuccessfully to do so. In such circumstances, the defendant\u2019s comment (\u201cI can\u2019t do this\u201d), while testimonial, was not the result of governmental compulsion and thus is admissible in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b816-6\">Field sobriety tests \u201care based upon the relationship between intoxication and the loss of coordination which intoxication produces. They do not compel the subject to reveal his knowledge or thoughts. They only force him to exhibit his physical coordination, or lack thereof, for observation by a police officer.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Brennan, 386 Mass. 772, 779 (1982). \u201cA lay juror understands that intoxication leads to diminished balance, coordination, and mental acuity from common experience and knowledge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sands, </em>424 Mass. 184, 188 (1997). A test like the horizontal gaze nystagmus (HGN) test is different because the underlying principle is grounded in science, not common experience. <em>Ibid, </em>(results of an HGN field sobriety test are not admissible without testimony from a qualified expert).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">The testimony of a police officer about the results of ordinary field sobriety tests like those involved in this case, see <em>infra, </em>is lay witness testimony, not expert witness testimony. See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 701 (2013). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sands, supra; State </em>v. <em>Meador, </em>674 So. 2d 826, 831 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1996); <em>Crampton </em>v. <em>State, </em>71 Md. App. 375, 388 (Ct. Spec. App. 1987). See generally <em>United States </em>v. <em>Horn, </em>185 F. Supp. 2d 530, 535-546 (D. Md. 2002) (comprehensive discussion of the history of field sobriety tests, and why the results, though relevant and admissible as circumstantial evidence of impairment, are not scientific evidence).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b817-7\">\u201cEvidence discovered and seized by private parties is admissible without regard to the methods used, unless State officials have instigated or participated in the search.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leone, </em>386 Mass. 329, 333 (1982). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arruda, Ti </em>Mass. App. Ct. 901, 904 (2008) (\u201cThe State action requirement of art. 12 is well established. It is governmental, not private, compulsion that is prohibited\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b817-8\">The one circumstance in which an individual may be compelled to provide testimonial evidence is when he or she has received a grant of transactional immunity. See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Colleton, </em>387 Mass. 790, 801 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b817-9\">The existence of compulsion does not turn on the form of words used by the police. \u201cIn instances of a false alibi, fleeing the vicinity of the crime, or making false exculpatory statements, for example, compulsion is absent, and art. 12 does not bar the admission of such evidence. If, however, . . . the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>defendant\u2019s conduct is testimonial and if the police, by their request, force the defendant to choose between two potentially inculpatory alternatives, the defendant\u2019s refusal to comply with that request may not be introduced against him over objection without violating art. 12.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conkey, </em>430 Mass. 139, 143 (1999) (footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b818-10\">The existence of compulsion due to the choice a motorist has whether to perform field sobriety tests is separate and apart from the issue of custody for purposes of the Miranda doctrine. The stop and brief detention of a motorist who is suspected of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol is not custody and thus there is no need to advise such a person of his Miranda rights before police questioning. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>D\u2019Agostino, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 206, 208, <em>S.C., </em>421 Mass. 281 (1995). Such a person may be asked to perform field sobriety tests without first waiving his Miranda rights. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wholley, </em>429 Mass. 1010, 1010-1011 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-11\">A field sobriety test does represent a seizure of the individual within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blais, </em>428 Mass. at 297. So long as the officer has reasonable grounds to believe the suspect is under the influence of alcohol, such a warrantless seizure is authorized. See <em>id. </em>at 298. Because field sobriety tests involve the production of real or physical evidence, the suspect, in turn, has no right to refuse to perform such tests. <em>Id. </em>at 299-301 &amp; n.3. However, the obligation to perform field sobriety tests does not imply that the police can force the suspect to comply. \u201cWhether and what steps may be taken to compel compliance will depend on the circumstances. . . . The very nature of the tests involved here [field sobriety] makes the use of force to compel their performance obviously inappropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b819-6\">See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGrail, </em>419 Mass. at 776, 779-780 (defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>ant\u2019s roadside statement that \u201c[he was] not going to do any tests\u201d was a protected refusal); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grenier, </em>45 Mass.
