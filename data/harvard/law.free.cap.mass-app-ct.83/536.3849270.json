L. c. 265, \u00a7 23; indecent assault and battery, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13H; and four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>counts of rape, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 <em>22(b). </em>On appeal, the defendant argues that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions, that he was prejudiced by errors in the Commonwealth\u2019s closing argument and in the jury instructions, and that a violation of the first complaint doctrine created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\"><em>Background. </em>We briefly summarize the evidence at trial, reserving certain details for later discussion. The defendant\u2019s convictions relate to a series of offenses committed against a teenage victim over the span of approximately one year, from early 2003 to early 2004. The victim, a child of Hmong refugees from Laos, testified that at the time of the assaults she practiced a religion called Houplle. Pursuant to the tenets of Houplle, the victim believed that the spirits of her ancestors watched over her and possessed great influence over her life. The victim\u2019s testimony indicated that the defendant was aware of her religious beliefs, and that he preyed on those beliefs by telling her that if she did not submit to his sexual demands her ancestors would hurt her and her family.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She testified that she believed him, at least in part due to his claim (corroborated by other students at the victim\u2019s high school) that he was the leader of a \u201csecret organization\u201d that \u201conly Asians and Native Americans could join,\u201d whose purpose was to \u201chelp people who were in need.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">According to the victim, the defendant presented the assaults to the victim as either \u201ctests\u201d to see if she could join the organization or \u201cpenalties\u201d for her misbehavior, and told her that her ancestors would hurt her if she refused to comply or if she told anyone about the organization. As a result, the victim testified, she was afraid to resist the defendant\u2019s repeated sexual assaults or to tell anyone what was happening. Eventually the victim confided in a cousin, who convinced her that the defendant could not actually communicate with her ancestors and prevailed upon her to report him to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\"><em>Sufficiency. </em>The defendant argues that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions of rape of a child and forcible rape. We address each in turn, considering \u201cwhether, viewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>the evidence in a light most favorable to the Commonwealth, <em>\u2018any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen (No. 1), </em>456 Mass. 94, 120 (2010), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The rape of a child conviction was based on evidence that the defendant \u201ctest[ed the victim\u2019s] purity\u201d by digitally penetrating her. The defendant contends that the victim\u2019s testimony about her age at the time of this incident was too equivocal to permit a jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that she had not yet turned sixteen. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertion, the victim did not testify to \u201cboth ages [fifteen and sixteen] almost equally.\u201d Instead, she testified that although it was \u201cpossible\u201d she had been sixteen, her best recollection was that the incident occurred before her sixteenth birthday. Such \u201c[e]xpressions of uncertainty\u201d in a victim\u2019s testimony, \u201clike expressions of certainty, go to the weight of the evidence and are for the jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 215, 220 (2003). Any uncertainty in the victim\u2019s testimony did not render the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence legally insufficient. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clary, </em>388 Mass. 583, 589 (1983). Furthermore, the defendant had ample opportunity to exploit any inconsistencies in the victim\u2019s testimony on cross-examination. No \u201cleap of conjecture\u201d was required for the jury to credit the victim\u2019s direct testimony that the penetration occurred when she was fifteen. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Merry, </em>453 Mass. 653, 663 (2009), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chongarlides, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 709, 712 (2004). See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>376 Mass. 402, 410-411 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Plouffe, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 543, 544-545 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The defendant also argues that there was insufficient evidence of force to sustain the four rape convictions. At trial, the Commonwealth relied on the theory that the defendant used constructive force to coerce the victim into submitting.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caracciola, </em>409 Mass. 648, 652 (1991). Viewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence was sufficient. The jury rationally could have concluded that the defendant told the victim, and the victim believed, that if she did not submit to the defendant\u2019s \u201ctests\u201d and \u201cpenalties\u201d her \u201cancestors and the spirits . . . [wjould come and hurt [her].\u201d As a result, the victim was afraid to resist or to tell anyone what was happening. \u201cThose threats and the circumstances created by [the defendant\u2019s] conduct and his words are sufficient to constitute the force contemplated by the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 652-653.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">While it is true that a typical constructive force case involves threats of a more direct and immediate nature than the defendant\u2019s threat to impel the victim\u2019s ancestors to hurt her, in our view this distinction is not determinative. What matters is that the-defendant\u2019s \u201ccourse of conduct . . . was designed to instill fear in order to achieve his goal.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>76 Mass. App. Ct. 411, 418 n.11 (2010), citing <em>Caracciola, supra </em>at 652-653 &amp; n.7. Where, as here, an adult in a position of authority preys upon the vulnerability of a much younger victim and coerces her into submitting to his sexual advances out of fear for her safety should she refuse, a jury rationally may conclude that \u201cthe victim\u2019s ability to resist the rape was overborne or negated\u201d by the defendant\u2019s conduct, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 245, 255 (2008), and that the rape was therefore \u201caccomplished <em>by force </em>and against the victim\u2019s will,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Caracciola, supra </em>at 651.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frank, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 19, 24-25 (2001); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wallace, supra </em>at 418.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number><em>Closing argument. </em>The prosecutor made two statements in his closing argument that the defendant contends were unsupported by the evidence: that the defendant \u201csent [two other students] to get [the victim],\u201d and that the victim \u201cwas afraid for her life.\u201d As to the first, the evidence showed that the victim was invited to join the defendant\u2019s \u201csecret organization\u201d by another student who claimed to be a member of that organization, and who subsequently brought the victim to meet the defendant and the student\u2019s sister, who lived in the defendant\u2019s house. Because the defendant claimed to be the leader of the organization, it was a reasonable inference that the organization\u2019s members acted at his direction in matters relating to the organization.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">With regard to the second statement, the victim testified that she believed her ancestors had \u201ccontrol over [her],\u201d that they physically could hurt her and her family, and that she was afraid as a result of the defendant\u2019s threats. The prosecutor\u2019s statement that she was afraid \u201cfor her life\u201d was at worst \u201cmerely \u2018excusable hyperbole\u2019 and is not grounds for reversal.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>463 Mass. 402, 416 (2012), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>455 Mass. 503, 515 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\"><em>Other issues. </em>The defendant\u2019s remaining arguments require little discussion. There was no error in the judge\u2019s instruction to the jury on consent and constructive force, which tracked the model instruction on rape nearly verbatim and was a correct statement of the law of this Commonwealth. Any suggestion by the defendant that the law thus explicated was created after the rapes occurred is meritless; the law regarding constructive force long has been established. See <em>Caracciola, </em>409 Mass. at 651-652.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Nor is there merit in the defendant\u2019s contention that he was prejudiced by a violation of the first complaint doctrine. Much of the testimony now complained of was elicited by the defendant himself on cross-examination. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>82 Mass. App. Ct. 427, 439-440 (2012). As for the testimony by a police officer that she met with the victim and drove with her to various locations in Lowell and Tewksbury, some of that testimony may well have been excluded had the defendant lodged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>an objection.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, the officer\u2019s testimony contained none of the substance of any complaints made by the victim. The defendant is unable to articulate how the fact that police spent time with the victim bolstered her credibility in any appreciable way. There was no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roby, </em>462 Mass. 398, 409 (2012); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flint, </em>81 Mass. App. Ct. 794, 804 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b579-8\">When asked for clarification of the type of harm she feared from her ancestors, the victim testified, \u201cPhysically they can hurt me, they can hurt my family.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b580-7\">There also was evidence of actual force. For example, the victim testified that she began to cry loudly when the defendant was sodomizing her in the woods (evidence indicative of lack of consent), and that while he then stopped doing so, he proceeded to yell at her. At a minimum, the presence of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>evidence reinforces the evidence of constructive force. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>76 Mass. App. Ct. 411, 418 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b581-8\">The docket indicates that the defendant was about forty-seven years old at the time of the first incident. Although his specific age was not entered in evidence, the jury had the opportunity to observe him. The defendant contests any characterization of himself as an authority figure in the victim\u2019s life, but the evidence that he portrayed himself as the leader of the \u201csecret organization\u201d into which he purported to induct the victim was uncontroverted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b581-9\">The cases upon which the defendant relies are readily distinguishable; in neither did the defendant obtain a victim\u2019s submission by intentionally putting the victim in fear of the consequences of resistance. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goldenberg, </em>338 Mass. 377, 384, cert. denied, 359 U.S. 1001 (1959); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Feijoo, </em>419 Mass. 486, 491-492 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b582-8\">Whether one girl or two brought the victim to the defendant\u2019s home is immaterial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b583-6\">The officer was not an appropriate first complaint witness, and the integrity of the police investigation was not at issue. At oral argument, the Commonwealth was unable to explain what purpose the officer\u2019s testimony served.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
