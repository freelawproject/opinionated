He was paroled three times, and each time he was returned to the prison for violation of his parole conditions. About one-half year after his last imprisonment for violation of parole, the plaintiff filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus and a motion for bail in the superior court. Following the superior court\u2019s denial of the motion for bail, the plaintiff filed a motion for bail in the supreme court. Soon after that filing, the superior court denied the plaintiff\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-13\">The grant or refusal of bail is discretionary with the trial court <em>(State v. Booton, </em>114 N.H. 152, 317 A.2d 18 (1974); <em>State v. Hutton, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>107 N.H. 426, 428, 223 A.2d 416, 417 (1966). <em>See also Moses v. Helgemoe, </em>115 N.H. 672, 348 A.2d 354 (1975)), and the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion will be overturned by this court only on evidence of a compelling nature. <em>State v. Booton supra. </em>The record in this court discloses no evidence compelling a finding of abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-3\">The order is</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">\n<em>Plaintiff\u2019s motion denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
