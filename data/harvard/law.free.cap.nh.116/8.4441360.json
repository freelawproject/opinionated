After a hearing, the Trial Court <em>(Cann, </em>J.) made certain findings and ruled that the conveyance did not violate the provisions of RSA 545:4 or RSA 545:7 and dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 bill. Plaintiffs\u2019 exceptions were reserved and transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-12\">The plaintiffs maintain on appeal that the trial court erred as a matter of law in failing to find and rule that this conveyance did constitute a fraudulent conveyance within the provisions of RSA ch. 545. In a supplemental brief, defendants\u2019 counsel brought to the attention of this court that defendant Bernard Estey had died previous to the date of the arguments on appeal and filed a copy of a certificate attesting to the death of Bernard on August 10, 1974. Counsel then argued that this rendered the present appeal moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-13\">Plaintiffs\u2019 became creditors of Bernard Estey within the terms of RSA 545:9 on January 4, 1969, when their property on which Bernard was working was damaged by fire allegedly caused by his negligence. The conveyance in question was made on June 6, 1969, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>when Bernard conveyed to his wife his interest in their property held in joint tenancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-3\">If this court should uphold plaintiffs\u2019 contention that this conveyance was fraudulent as a matter of law under RSA ch. 545, plaintiffs would be entitled to have it set aside to enable them to levy on Bernard\u2019s interest in the property as it stood before the conveyance. <em>Janson v. Schier, </em>112 N.H. 329, 331, 296 A.2d <em>12, 14(1972); Ricker v. Mathews, </em>94 N.H. 313, 318, 53 A.2d 196, 199-200 (1947). During the joint lives of the defendants Bernard\u2019s share was subject to attachment by the plaintiffs. 4A R. Powell, Real Property \u00a7 618 (1974). The interest attached is similar to a life estate with a contingent remainder in fee depending upon which joint tenant survived. <em>United States v. Mosolowitz, </em>269 F. Supp. 12, 15 (D. Conn. 1967); <em>Zeigler v. Bonnell, </em>52 Cal. App. 2d 217, 220, 126 P.2d 118, 119 (1942). However, to obtain this interest plaintiffs would have had to obtain a judgment, levy thereon and sell Bernard\u2019s interest during his lifetime. 4A R. Powell, Real Property \u00a7 618 (1974). There is no record that this happened in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">As there was no evidence that Marie was subject to any claim by the plaintiffs, she became at Bernard\u2019s death the sole owner in fee of the property free and clear of any interest of the plaintiffs therein. <em>Zeigler v. Bonnell, </em>52 Cal. App. 2d 217, 126 P.2d 118 (1942); <em>Hughes v. Fairfield Lumber &amp; Supply Co., </em>143 Conn. 427, 430, 123 A.2d 195, 197 (1956);East. <em>Shore v.
