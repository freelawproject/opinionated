RSA 259:1 XXXV (Supp. 1975) defines \u201cway\u201d as \u201cany public highway, street, avenue, road, alley, park or parkway ... or any public or private parking lot which is maintained primarily for the benefit of paying customers.\u201d The complaint charged that the defendant had operated his vehicle \u201con a private driveway op\u00e9n to the public at the time, to wit, Anchorage Motel Driveway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-12\">At trial the arresting officers testified that they stopped the defendant in the motel driveway. The defendant moved for dismissal at the close of the prosecution\u2019s case on the ground that the \u2022 motel driveway was not a way within the meaning of the statute. \u00a1The court denied this motion and permitted the prosecution to reopen its case. The arresting officers testified that prior to stopping the defendant in the motel driveway they had observed him operating the vehicle in the motel parking lot. The court permitted the prosecution to amend its complaint to charge operation in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>the parking lot, and found that no prejudice to the defendant resulted from the amendment. The amendment removed the issue of defendant\u2019s operation on the driveway from the case, and it is unnecessary to decide that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The defendant excepted to the granting of the prosecution\u2019s motions to reopen its case and to amend its complaint. The critical issue is whether these rulings deprived the defendant of a fair opportunity to prepare his defense and to meet the case against him. Goldstein, <em>The State and the Accused: Balance of Advantage in Criminal Procedure, </em>69 Yale L.J. 1149, 1173-80 (1960). It appears that the defendant\u2019s driving on the parking lot was closely connected in time and place to his driving on the driveway. The prosecution presented its additional testimony and amended the complaint before the defense began. The defendant did not request a continuance and has not shown that the additional evidence or the amendment of the complaint was prejudicial or constituted an abuse of discretion. The trial court did not err in granting the prosecution\u2019s motion to amend the complaint <em>(State v. Green, </em>105 N.H. 260, 197 A.2d 204 (1964); <em>Commonwealth v. Jervis, </em>335 N.E.2d 356 (Mass. 1975); RSA 601:8; Annot., 14 A.L.R.3d 1335 (1967)) or in granting its motion to reopen its case. <em>State v. Petkus, </em>110 N.H. 394, 269 A.2d 123 (1970);Stated. <em>Comparone, </em>110 N.H. 398, 269 A.2d 131 (1970). The findings and rulings of the district court were supported by the evidence and were legally correct. <em>State v. Rosier, </em>105 N.H. 6, 191 A.2d 526 (1963); E. Fisher and R. Reeder, Vehicle Traffic Law 96 <em>et seq. </em>(1974). Accordingly the order is</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">\n<em>Defendant\u2019s exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b345-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
