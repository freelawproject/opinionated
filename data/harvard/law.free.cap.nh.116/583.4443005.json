The sole issue he raises before us is whether the statute violates the second amendment to the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">Transferred by <em>Perkins, </em>J.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">The second amendment to the Federal Constitution reads as follows: \u201cA well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d New Hampshire has no constitutional provision granting a right to bear arms. <em>See </em>N.H. Const, pt. I, art. 24. Pertinent provisions of RSA 159:4 (Supp. 1975) provide that \u201cNo person shall carry a loaded pistol or revolver... without a license therefor as hereinafter provided.\u201d The relevant provisions of RSA 159:6 (Supp. 1975) state that a nonresident (which the defendant was at the time) may procure a license from the \u201cdirector of state police, or some person designated by him, upon application... if it appears that the applicant has . .. any proper purpose ....\u201d There follow procedural provisions not involved here.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">It is too well established to require elaboration that a State statute reasonably regulating the right to bear arms does not violate the second amendment to the United States Constitution which is not a grant of a right, but \u201ca limitation only upon the power of Congress and the National Government. ...\u201d <em>Presser v. Illinois, </em>116 U.S. 252, 265 (1886); <em>see United States v. Miller, </em>307 U.S. 174, 178 (1939); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>497 F.2d 548, 550 (4th Cir. 1974); <em>Commonwealth v.
