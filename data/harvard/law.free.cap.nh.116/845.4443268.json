Woodbridge and Thomas F. Fanelli for appointment as coexecutors and cotrustees of the estate of Louise W. Quirin and ordered New Hampshire counsel to prepare a list of three well qualified New Hampshire residents from which the court could select the coexecutors and cotrustees. The plaintiffs appeal these decisions. RSA 567-AT (Supp. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-10\">RSA 553:5 provides that \u201c[n]o person not an inhabitant of this state shall be so appointed by reason of a right to such trust, unless other circumstances, in the opinion of the judge, render the same proper.\u201d A person not a resident of this State cannot claim appointment as a matter of right <em>(Crosby v. Charlestown, </em>78 N.H. 39, 95 A. 1043 (1915)) but he is not disqualified simply because he is a nonresident. <em>Pickering v. Pendexter, </em>46 N.H. 69 (1865). The probate court must find that the nonresident is suitable and that \u201cother circumstances\u201d within the meaning of the statute render the appointment proper. 1 W. Treat, New Hampshire Practice \u2014 Probate Law \u00a7 182 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-11\">In determining whether a person is suitable to be an executor or trustee, the court should \u201cinquire carefully as to his character, integrity, soundness of judgment and general capacity ....\u201d J. Lombard, Probate &amp; Practice \u00a7 574 (20 Massachusetts Practice 1962). Also, certain conflicts of interest might render a person unsuitable. 1 W. Treat, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 176. The evidence reveals that Mr. Woodbridge is a retired banking executive with substantial experience in managing finances, which is important in the administration of large estates. <em>See </em>1 G. Newhall, Settlement of Es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>lates and Fiduciary Law in Massachusetts \u00a7 46 (1958). He has been a financial advisor and intimate friend of the family for over forty years. Mr. Fanelli is a licensed member of the New York State bar and specializes in trust and estate matters. He is also a longtime personal friend of the family and has served as legal advisor for over twenty years. The plaintiffs presently manage the shares of stock that constitute a substantial portion of the estate\u2019s one million dollars worth of assets. Because they are personally acquainted with the family and its financial status, the plaintiffs may be able to perform the responsibilities of fiduciaries better than strangers could. 2 A. Casner, Estate Planning 1161 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">Perhaps the most convincing evidence of their suitability is the fact that they presently serve as nonresident coexecutors and co-trustees under the will of John H. Quirin, the spouse of the deceased in this case. They have served in these capacities for three years. The testatrix specifically nominated the plaintiffs in her will. Although her choice is not necessarily controlling, it is entitled to great weight, and the court\u2019s objection to suitability must be strong to justify refusing the appointment. I G. Newhall, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 46 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">On the question of what \u201cother circumstances\u201d justify the appointment of a nonresident personal representative, we held in <em>Pickering v. Pendexter, </em>46 N.H. 69 (1865), that a nonresident sister of the deceased could be appointed instead of a resident brother because his interests were \u201cclearly opposed to that of the persons for whom he would act.\u201d 1 W. Treat, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 182. The relevant evidence in this case establishes that no family members live in New' Hampshire. The stock, which constitutes the majority of the estate\u2019s assets, is located in New York \u2014 the State in which the plaintiffs reside. The majority of the beneficiaries have consented in writing to the appointment of the plaintiffs. As present co-executors and cotrustees of John Quirin\u2019s estate in New Hampshire for the last three years, the plaintiffs have had an opportunity to familiarize themselves with the law and procedure relevant to the administration of estates in this State. It does not appear that any New Hampshire resident has such an intimate familiarity with both the family\u2019s fortune and the personal lives of the family members as do the plaintiffs. Under these facts, we hold that \u201cother circumstances\u201d within the meaning of RSA 553:5 exist and are sufficient to justify the appointment of the plaintiffs in accordance with the wishes of both the deceased and the beneficiaries. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>Model Probate Code \u00a7 96, Comment (1946); <em>see Opinion of the Justices, </em>109 N.H. 335, 335-36, 251 A.2d 330 (1969).
