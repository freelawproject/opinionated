Hough, a resident of Waterbury, Vermont. Plaintiff obtained personal service in New Hampshire on defendant Broderick and seeks to maintain an attachment by trustee process on defendant Hough\u2019s liability insurance company in New Hampshire. Plaintiff seeks to maintain quasi in rem jurisdiction over defendant Hough to the extent of his liability insurance coverage. Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss was denied by <em>Batchelder, </em>J., and his exception was reserved and transferred by <em>Johnson, </em>J.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-13\">In <em>Camire v. Scieszka, </em>No. 7030 decided today, we determined that we would apply the standards governing assumption of in personam jurisdiction to our exercise of quasi in rem jurisdiction sought by attachment by trustee process of a defendant\u2019s liability insurance policy in this State. The present case differs from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number><em>Camire </em>case in two respects; one, the plaintiff has obtained personal jurisdiction by service in New Hampshire on a Massachusetts defendant; two, the accident occurred in Vermont, the resident State of the defendant over whom plaintiff seeks to have us exercise quasi in rem jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">Tested by the formula established in the <em>Camire </em>case we find no justification for the exercise of quasi in rem jurisdiction in this case. Our interest in the case is limited to the plaintiff\u2019s residence and does not arise beyond this minimal contact by reason of the fortuitous circumstance of personal service in New Hampshire of the Massachusetts defendant. There is a strong potential of dual trials since Vermont is the only forum for litigation between the two defendants. Finally the accident happened in the State of the defendant Hough\u2019s residence and we are unable to discern any basis here to require him to defend himself in another jurisdiction. <em>Leeper v.
