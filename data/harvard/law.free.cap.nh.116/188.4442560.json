RSA 552:7 (Laws 1959, 114:9). The appeal gave as reasons therefor that the testator \u201cdid not possess the requisite testamentary capacity\u201d and that the will \u201cwas procured under undue influence\u201d. RSA 567:2 repealed, Laws 1975, 395:12. The appeal was duly entered in the superior court in August 1974, and the defendant executor thereupon \u201canswered\u201d with a general denial, and on September 9, 1974, sought a bill of particulars by \u201cmotion for specifications\u201d, alleging plaintiffs\u2019 failure to state \u201cthe facts, reasons and/or basis\u201d upon which they based their said appeal; and that this information was required in order that the defendant might proceed with discovery. No objection having been filed <em>(See </em>Superior Court Rule 55, RSA 491: App. R. 55 (Supp. 1975)), on February 11, 1975, the Trial Court <em>(Bois, </em>J.) granted the motion and ordered specifications to be filed within 30 days. The plaintiffs thereafter \u201canswered\u201d the motion by specifying that the decedent lacked testamentary capacity by reason of senility when the will was executed, and that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>was under the supervision and control of Kelly Dahood.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">On March 10, 1975, the defendant executor renewed his motion to dismiss, for failure to \u201cspecify in each instance the facts, reasons and/or basis\u201d for plaintiffs\u2019 claim. Under date of March 13, 1975, the plaintiffs objected to the defendant executor\u2019s motion, stating that plaintiffs\u2019 allegations were based on evidence relating to events over a period of years and praying that the defendant be instructed to pursue its pretrial discovery in a \u201cmore befitting\u201d manner. Under date of July 14, 1975, the Trial Court <em>(Mullavey, </em>J.) ordered \u201ccomplete and detailed specifications to be filed within 7 days\u201d otherwise the case to be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Under date of July 18, 1975, the plaintiffs filed a sixteen paragraph \u201canswer\u201d to the most recent, motion, specifying in greater detail matters upon which they relied, and alleging that they had not \u201cas yet had an opportunity for pretrial discovery\u201d and therefore reserved the right to add to or modify their specifications to reflect information obtained through pretrial discovery. Under date of July 25, 1975, the defendant again moved to dismiss. Finally on September 10, 1075 after hearing, the Trial Court <em>(Perkins, </em>J.) denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, subject to exception, and reserved and transferred the questions raised thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Thus it appears that by repeated motions, objections, and answers, and interlocutory transfer to this court, the disposition of this probate appeal has been delayed for well over a year with little if any perceptible progress. Modern principles of pleading recognize that the function of bills of particulars has been largely superseded by pretrial conferences and other methods of pretrial discovery. <em>See Hub Bel Air Inc. v. Hirsch, </em>203 Md. 637, 102 A.2d 550 (1954); 61 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Pleading </em>\u00a7 295, at 704 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">The federal courts in the interest of simplified and precise pleading have since 1946 dispensed with bills of particulars, formerly provided for by Rule 12 (e), after recognizing that they were \u201cfrequently useless [and], sometimes placed a premium upon strategic maneuvering of counsel rather than upon the merits of the issues involved\u201d. 2A J. Moore, Federal Practice para. 12.17 [1], at 2362 (1975). <em>See also </em>Recommendations of the Advisory Committee, at 2A J. Moore, Federal Practice para. 12.01 [20] (1975). As long ago as 1942, the District Court for the District of New Hampshire held: \u201cMatters of evidence which a party will presumably introduce in establishing his case should not be required by a motion for a bill of particulars\u201d. <em>Holland v. Gurnsey, </em>3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>j.R.D. 239, 240 (D.N.H. 1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The appeals statute, RSA 567:2 (repealed, Laws 1975, 395:12), required that the appealing party set forth \u201chis interest therein and the reasons of his appeal\u201d. The reasons presented by the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal were cogently stated, and required no amplification to be understood. <em>Mercer v. Merchants Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>108 N.H. 199, 202, 230 A.2d 745, 747 (1967). The statutes and the rules of [he superior court afford ample means for discovery of pertinent evidence in advance of trial by deposition, interrogatories and pretrial hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">- The order of September 10, 1975, denying the defendant\u2019s mojtion to dismiss was amply justified, and the appeal is remanded to ithe superior court for trial on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">\n<em>Defendant\u2019s exception overruled; remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b210-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
