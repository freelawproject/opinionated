Plaintiff\u2019s exception to the trial court\u2019s granting of defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss both actions for failure to state a cause of action was reserved and transferred by <em>Mullavey, </em>J.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-13\">On December 31, 1975, the defendant, Ronald B. McCabe, was involved in an automobile accident in Dover, New Hampshire, with another motor vehicle in which Lynne M. Phipps, mother of the minor plaintiff, was a passenger. The plaintiffs allege that as a result of this accident, Mrs. Phipps suffered severe dizziness and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>fainting spells. One such spell occurred five days later at her piother\u2019s home in Somersworth, New Hampshire, as she was carrying her son down a flight of stairs. The infant fell to the ground, suffering personal injuries. The plaintiff father has incurred medical expenses for his son\u2019s treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss both cases was properly \u00bfranted because no cause of action was stated against the defendant. The rule in this State, as in a majority of jurisdictions in this country, has long been as stated in Restatement (Second) of Torts 281, Comment <em>c </em>(1965): \u201cIn order for the ... [defendant] to be egligent with respect to the ... [plaintiff], his conduct must reate a recognizable risk of harm to the ... [plaintiff] individully, or to a class of persons \u2014 as, for example, all persons within a given area of danger \u2014 of which the ... [plaintiff] is a member. If the ... [defendant\u2019s] conduct creates such a recognizable risk of \u00cdarm only to a particular class of persons, the fact that it in fact ruses harm to a person of a different class, to whom the... iefendant] could not reasonably have anticipated injury, does ot make the... [defendant] liable to the persons so injured.\u201d <em>Jelley v. </em>LaFlame, 108 N.H. 471, 238 A.2d 728 (1968); <em>Barber v. Pollock, </em>104 N.H. 379, 187 A.2d 788 (1963); <em>Cote v. Litawa, </em>96 k.H. 174, 71 A.2d 792 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">| We do not deem it desirable policy to extend the liability of a jiegligent automobile operator to an injury so unrelated in time, place and circumstance, nor has any case been brought to our attention in which another court has chosen to do so. As Dean Prosser rightly suggests, the limits of liability must be ascertained lpy \u201cbalancing the social interests involved in order to ascertain how far defendant\u2019s duty and plaintiff\u2019s right may justly and expediently be extended.\u201d <em>Waube v. Warrington, </em>216 Wis. 603, 613, 258 N.W. 497, 501 (1935); W. Prosser, Law of Torts \u00a7 43, at 257 (4th ed. 1971). Recovery must at some point be denied because its a llowance would place an unreasonable burden upon users of the highway. <em>Jelley v. LaFlame, </em>108 N.H. 471, 473, 238 A.2d 728, 730 (1968); <em>see Deem v. Newmarket, </em>115 N.H. 84, 333 A.2d 446 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b496-9\">Grimes, J., did not sit.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
