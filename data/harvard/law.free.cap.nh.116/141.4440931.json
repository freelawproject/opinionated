His motion to set aside the verdict was denied and the case was appealed to the supreme court. We upheld the conviction. <em>State v. Mitchell, </em>113 N.H. 542, 311 A.2d 134 (1973). Thereafter, his petition for certiorari in the United States Supreme Court was denied. 415 U.S. 958 (1974). Subsequently, he brought a petition for a writ of mandamus in the United States District Court, asking it to order this court to hold a hearing and to furnish the relief he now seeks. The district court dismissed the petition without prejudice on the ground that since the plaintiff had elected to proceed in the United States Supreme Court by certiorari (28 U.S.C. 1257), that Court and not the district court had jurisdiction of all matters of relief pertaining to the defendant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-12\">It is elementary that mandamus is an extraordinary remedy, granted only when the plaintiff has a dear and apparent right to relief. <em>Segre v. Ring, </em>103 N.H. 278, 170 A.2d 265 (1961); <em>Siegel v. State, </em>111 N.H. 395, 285 A.2d 803 (1971). That situation does not exist here. The plaintiff \u201cadmits and agrees\u201d that he was repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>sented by \u201cadequate and competent\u201d counsel, but he disagrees with certain conclusions drawn and positions taken by counsel. An examination of these and other claims made by the plaintiff convinces us that they are without merit. Since he has no clear and apparent right to relief as required by our decisions, the order is</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">\n<em>Petition denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
