The case was submitted to a Master <em>(.Leonard C. Hardwick, </em>Esq.) upon an agreed statement of facts and issues, together with certain exhibits. The master made findings and rulings in writing, and recommended a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $3500, which was approved by the trial court, subject to defendant\u2019s exceptions upon the grounds that the verdict was against the law and evidence. The issues raised by defendant\u2019s exceptions were reserved and transferred by <em>Morris, </em>J-</p>\n<p id=\"b245-13\">The defendant\u2019s letter of May 10, 1967, stating the terms of the contract, contained the following provision: \u201cIt should be further understood that this agreement will continue from year to year with the proviso that the Association or the publisher may cancel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>or modify it.\u201d The agreed statement shows that the defendant had published the yearbook and related material before 1967, and that it published pursuant to the May 1967 letter in the years 1967 and 1968. According to the agreed facts, the plaintiff received \u201coral notice that the Eneguess Publishing Company would be publishing the Plan Book\u201d; and the 1969 book entitled 1969 Parade of Homes and Apartments was so published. It was also agreed that the \u201cplaintiff received no written notice from the defendant as to cancellation or modification of the intent of the 1967 letter\u201d, and \u201chad no specific knowledge of [the] terms or contents\u201d of a contract between the defendant and Eneguess effective September 24, 1968 \u201cand has never seen said contract\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">The master found and ruled that the contract of May 10, 1967 was never modified or cancelled, and that there was \u201cno agreement on the part of the plaintiff to substitute anyone else for the obligation of the defendant\u201d. The master also found that by letter of September 30, 1968, the plaintiff had notified the defendant that it looked to it to publish the 1969 book.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"AlU\">These findings and rulings were clearly warranted by the agreed statement of facts. The defendant argues that the plaintiff\u2019s participation in the preparation of the 1969 yearbook by Eneguess established that plaintiff had notice of cancellation; but such conduct would have been equally consistent with publication by the defendant pursuant to the May 10, 1967 contract under a subcontract with Eneguess, so far as the agreed facts disclose.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The defendant questions the ruling of the master that there could be modification or cancellation of the original contract \u201conly if such was agreed to by both parties\u201d. The oral statement found to have been made in 1968 that the 1969 book would be published by Eneguess would have been adequate notice of cancellation for the year commencing May 10, 1969, had it purported to be such a notice. However the agreed facts do not compel or suggest a finding that it was such a notice and the master found that there was no evidence of any agreement to cancel. The bare statement that Eneguess would publish the 1969 book did not imply repudiation of the defendant\u2019s obligations under the 1967 contract. <em>See Dover v. Firefighters Local 1312, </em>114 N.H. 481, 484, 322 A.2d 918, 920 (1974). Hence the ruling that there was no cancellation was warranted. 17A C.J.S. <em>Contracts </em>\u00a7 402 (1963); 2 H.
