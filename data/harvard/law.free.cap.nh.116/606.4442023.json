The question of law raised by the petition was transferred without ruling by <em>Loughlin, </em>J.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-3\">RSA 36:4 II (b) (Supp. 1975) provides as follows: \u201cThe town, by majority vote at the town meeting, may decide to elect the members of the planning board. If such a procedure is adopted at the town meeting, the planning board members shall be elected at the next regular town meeting in the following manner: ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">RSA 39:3 (Supp. 1975) provides in relevant part as follows: \u201cUpon the written application of ten or more voters or one-sixth of the voters in town, presented to the selectmen or one of them at least thirty-five days before the day prescribed for an annual or biennial meeting, the selectmen shall insert in their warrant for such meeting the petitioned article with only such minor textual changes as may be required . ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">A petition was filed with the selectmen on September 13, 1976, more than thirty-five days before the biennial meeting to be held on November 2, 1976, signed by more than the required number of voters requesting that the following article be inserted in the warrant: \u201cTo see if the Town will vote, in accordance with RSA 36:4-11 (b), to elect a 7 member Planning Board; 2 members for a 1 year term; 2 members for a 2 year term; and 2 members for a 3 year term; the 7th member to be a Selectman appointed by the Selectmen, and pass any vote relating thereto.\u201d The board of selectmen on September 13, 1976, voted not to insert the article in the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Defendants argue that under RSA 39:9, <em>Moulton v. Beals, </em>98 N.H. 461, 102 A.2d 489 (1954) and Preston <em>v. Gillam, </em>104 N.H. 279, 184 A.2d 462 (1962) establish that they have discretion whether or not to insert an article and that their decision cannot be overturned except for unreasonable neglect or refusal. However, both the above cited cases were concerned with the warning of a special town meeting and not with the insertion of an article in the warrant for an annual or biennial meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Moreover, the legislature has made changes since <em>Preston v. Gillam, </em>104 N.H. 279, 184 A.2d 462 (1962), was decided which militate against the position of the defendants. In 1971, RSA 39:3 was amended by adding the sentence: \u201cThe right to have an article inserted in the warrant conferred by this section shall not be invalidated by the provisions of RSA 32.\u201d Laws 1971, 79:1. This indicates that the legislature views the insertion of an article under RSA 39:3 (Supp. 1975) as a \u201cright\u201d. Also in 1975, the sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>tion was amended to require the article applied for to be inserted \u201cwith only such minor textual changes as may be required.\u201d Laws 1975, 160:1.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">In 1971, a new section 3-b was added which provides that: \u201cIf the board of selectmen shall refuse to insert an article in the warrant, after being petitioned to do so in accordance with the provisions of RSA 39:3, such refusal sh\u00e1ll be deemed to be a wilful neglect of duty, and subject the board to the penalty provided in RSA 587:31.\u201d RSA 39:3-b (Supp. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">We are of the opinion that these changes indicate a clear legislative intent that the selectmen have no discretion whether to insert an article in a warrant in compliance with RSA 39:3 (Supp. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">Defendants argue that the use of the words \u201cat <em>the </em>town meeting\u201d (emphasis added) in RSA 36:4 II (b) (Supp. 1975) indicates an intention that the vote to elect the members of the planning board should occur only at an annual town meeting. We cannot attach such a significance to the word \u201cthe\u201d in view of the other provisions of the statutes previously discussed. Nor are we persuaded by the argument that RSA 39:2-a (Supp. 1975) prevents the article from being placed on the ballot. That section deals only with annual meetings and does not apply to the biennial meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">We hold, therefore, that the selectmen are required to insert in the warrant for the biennial town meeting to be held November 2, 1976, the article contained in the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-11\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b628-12\">Kenison, C.J., concurred in the result.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
