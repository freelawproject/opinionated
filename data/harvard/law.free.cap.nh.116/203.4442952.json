RSA 541:6. Also a petition for a writ of certiorari asking this court to review the action of the personnel commission which upheld on appeal plaintiff\u2019s discharge by the warden on May 1, 1973, from his position of correctional officer at the State prison. The basis of plaintiff\u2019s discharge was willful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>insubordination for failure to obey a hair length regulation for correctional officers as well as for inmates.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s motion for a rehearing of the commission\u2019s decision upholding his discharge was denied on June 26, 1973. RSA 541:6 required that plaintiff\u2019s appeal to this court be filed within thirty days thereafter. Plaintiff\u2019s brief on his petition for certiorari states that a search of the law pertaining to plaintiff\u2019s right to wear his hair in accordance with his desires was made. \u201c[I]t was felt by Forrest and his counsel that the time, expense and burden on this Court in perfecting an appeal... under RSA 541:6 would not be justified and the appeal period ended.\u201d Forty-three days thereafter plaintiff\u2019s counsel read a newspaper report of the decision in <em>Dwen v. Barry, </em>336 F. Supp. 487 (E.D.N.Y. 1971), <em>rev\u2019d and remanded, </em>483 F.2d 1126 (2d Cir. 1973), <em>aff\"d without opinion, </em>508 F.2d 836 (2d Cir. 1975) pertaining to hair-grooming regulations of a county police department. Plaintiff thereupon filed the two petitions before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">We turn first to plaintiff\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari. It is clearly established that this court may issue such a writ to determine whether a tribunal has acted illegally as to matters of jurisdiction, authority .or observance of the law. RSA 490:4 (Supp. 1975); <em>State v. New Hampshire Retail Grocers Ass\u2019n Inc., </em>115 N.H. 623, 625, 348 A.2d 360, 362 (1975). It is not a method to obtain a review of facts as such. <em>Cloutier v. State Milk Control Board, </em>92 N.H. 199, 203, 28 A.2d 554, 557 (1942). Certiorari is granted sparingly and only when the substantial ends of justice require such action, and ordinarily not when other procedures are available. <em>George v. Commercial Credit Corp., </em>105 N.H. 269, 271, 197 A.2d 212, 214 (1964). It is not usually granted when a party has waived his right of appeal by not filing within the prescribed time, as was the case here. <em>Gallo v. Century Broadcasting, </em>114 N.H. 810, 812, 330 A.2d 780, 781 (1974); <em>Nashua v. Public Utilities Commission, </em>101 N.H. 503, 506-07, 148 A.2d 277, 279-80 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The uncertainty of the state of the law pertaining to plaintiff\u2019s constitutional right to wear his hair as he pleased was the motivating cause of plaintiff\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal under RSA 541:6. A probable change of that law in plaintiff\u2019s favor is what caused the filing of the two motions before us. The interference with this supposed constitutional right by the prison warden upheld by the decision of the personnel commission was the most convincing argument presented by the plaintiff in favor of his motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>However, on April 5, 1976, the case of <em>Dwen v. Barry supra </em>relied on by the plaintiff was reversed by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Kelley v. Johnson, </em>44 U.S.L.W. 4469 (U.S. April 5, 1976). Consequently, we hold that absent the only basis on which the plaintiff\u2019s petition might have been granted, his petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. There is no statutory provision allowing a late filing of an appeal under RSA ch. 541. We need not decide if this court, nevertheless, has jurisdiction to allow the late appeal requested by plaintiff\u2019s petition as we find no basis under the circumstances which would justify a late appeal. Plaintiff\u2019s petition seeking this relief is also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">\n<em>Petitions denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b225-5\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
