Wehland, Assistant State\u2019s Attorney for Howard County, </em>on the brief, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b589-9\">Morton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ALz\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">Appellant was convicted in a non-jury trial in the Circuit Court for Howard County of violating Md. Code, Art. 66V2, Sec. 72, which provides, in part, that \u201cAny person * * * who has in his possession any vehicle which he knows or has reason to believe has been stolen or unlawfully taken * * * is guilty of a felony * * He was fined $1,000 and sentenced to three years imprisonment which sentence was suspended. In this appeal it is contended that \u201cthe court erred in refusing defendant\u2019s motions for a judgment of acquittal, both at the close of the State\u2019s case and at the close of the entire case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-11\">The appellant took the stand in his own defense and also called a witness on his behalf. In doing so, he withdrew his motion for judgment of acquittal offered at the conclusion of the State\u2019s case, Md. Rule 755 b, and that issue is not properly before us. <em>Iozzi v. State, 5 </em>Md. App. 415. We cannot agree with his second contention that the denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal made at the conclusion of the entire case should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-12\">The record indicates that a 1967 Dodge Polara sedan was rented in New York from Avis Rent-A-Car Systems, Inc. by a purported Dr. John W. Best on May 23, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>1967. When the car was not returned by September 8, 1967, the matter was reported to the New York Police and Avis paid the purchase price to the manufacturer from whom the car was being leased.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">The same vehicle was driven into appellant\u2019s automobile repair shop for repairs on September 14, 1967, by a man, according to appellant, wearing an army uniform who identified himself as Sgt. Charles Whitmore, stationed at Ft. Meade, Maryland. The \u201cwork sheet\u201d and \u201cestimate\u201d produced by appellant showed that the repairs were to cost $700 and that a $100 deposit was paid. The Sergeant called appellant three days later inquiring when the repairs would be completed but, according to appellant, was never heard from thereafter. From the time the repairs were completed until March 15, 1968, when the vehicle was impounded by the Maryland State Police, the car was used once or twice a week either by appellant or his employees \u201cto keep the battery charged and keep the car limbered up\u201d, \u201cto pick up the mail\u201d or to go \u201ca mile down the road to pick up a part or something.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">When the car first arrived at appellant\u2019s garage, it had out-of-state license plates. Appellant could not remember from which state the plates were issued, but he \u201cthought it was Florida.\u201d When the out-of-state license plates expired sometime \u201cafter the first of the year\u201d, appellant had them removed and replaced them with a set of plates for another car registered in his own name. The car contained no registration card or other papers which would identify its owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">On March 15,1968, Trooper Edward Sweetman stopped a Volkswagen being driven by appellant which had no front Maryland license tag and the Dodge Polara in question being driven by a friend of appellant which was following the Volkswagen and which appeared to the officer to have faulty equipment. It appears that appellant was returning to his garage after picking up the Volkswagen from another repair shop and had asked the friend to follow him in the Dodge.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">In the process of checking the Dodge\u2019s ownership, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>trooper discovered that the tags were issued for another car owned by appellant. The trooper then attempted to ascertain the serial number, which is normally affixed to the door post, and \u201cnoticed on the left front door post, that there were two rivets there, but \u2014 and also scratch marks, and that the manufacturer\u2019s identification number had been removed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The car was impounded and later that evening the serial number was obtained from a hidden location on the vehicle by a representative of the National Auto Thief Bureau and it matched the serial number of the car \u201crented\u201d from Avis nearly ten months earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">In this setting, it is contended that the evidence was legally insufficient to sustain appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">The gravamen of Md. Code, Art. 68-V2, Sec. 72, is the possession of a vehicle which the accused \u201cknows or has reason to believe has been stolen or unlawfully taken * * Proof of knowledge by the accused that the car had been stolen or unlawfully taken is one facet of the statute and would constitute sufficient evidence to convict. Such knowledge may be proved, as any other fact, by evidence establishing that the accused has \u201cactual or direct knowledge\u201d that the car was unlawfully taken, as, for example, that he unlawfully took the car himself, or by circumstantial evidence which permits a rational inference that the accused, although he denies it, knows the car was unlawfully taken. Moreover, as this Court said in <em>Greenway v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 194, it is a well recognized rule of law that an individual \u201cwith an unlawful purpose in mind, who deliberately \u2018shuts his eyes\u2019 to avoid knowing what would otherwise be obvious to view, acts at his peril in this regard as far as the criminal law is concerned, and is treated as having \u2018knowledge of the facts as they are ultimately discovered to be\u2019. Perkins, <em>Criminal Lato </em>(1957), pp. 684-685</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">However, proof that the accused \u201cknew\u201d the car was unlawfully taken is not required to sustain a conviction under the statute for the statute contains a separate and alternative prong, namely, that the accused \u201chas reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>to believe\u201d the vehicle was stolen or unlawfully taken. Here, the evidence adduced at trial showed that appellant, who for many years was in the business of handling automobiles, was in possession of the vehicle in question for a period of approximately six months with no communication from the individual who delivered the car to the shop. Moreover, the car, which was practically new, contained no registration card or other papers which would identify its owner and the plate containing the manufacturer\u2019s identification number had been removed from its usual position on the door post. Although appellant testified that he did not know that the plate had been removed, the trial judge found, and we cannot say that he was clearly wrong, that while it was possible that appellant did not notice the absence of the serial number immediately, \u201c[i]t is incredible to me that he didn\u2019t find it out sooner or later.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Under the circumstances, we find that there was sufficient evidence presented from which the trial judge could be fairly convinced, beyond a reasonable doubt, that appellant had \u201creason to believe\u201d the vehicle in his possession had been stolen or unlawfully taken. Accordingly, we cannot say that the judgment of the lower court was clearly erroneous. Md. Rule 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.
