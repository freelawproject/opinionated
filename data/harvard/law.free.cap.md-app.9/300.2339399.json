At the conclusion of the case for the defense, the following colloquy occurred between the trial judge and Corporal Wyatt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Corporal Wyatt, just stay where you are; I want to ask you a question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIc\">CORPORAL WYATT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-8\">THE COURT: How close is your home to adjacent homes ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-9\">CORPORAL WYATT: Twenty feet, Your Hon- or.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-10\">THE COURT: Twenty feet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-11\">CORPORAL WYATT: Yes, Sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-12\">THE COURT: You mean there\u2019s one on each side of you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-13\">CORPORAL WYATT: Yes, Sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-14\">THE COURT: Were the occupants of those homes at home that afternoon, if you know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXHG\">CORPORAL WYATT: Well, directly across the street they had a housewarming. I asked them about it; it started about two in the afternoon and went on until ten o\u2019clock at night, in the evening, and they had people in the house all that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-15\">THE COURT: Can the window that was broken in your house be observed from that house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>CORPORAL WYATT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\">THE COURT: Did anyone there observe anyone around your house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">CORPORAL WYATT: The entire neighborhood was canvassed by myself, and no one had seen anything.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">Thereafter, in response to a question by appellant\u2019s trial counsel, Corporal Wyatt testified that he was unable to determine what time his home had been entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">An essential element of the crime of burglary is proof that the breaking and entering occurred in the nighttime. <em>Reagan v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 590. On the record before us there was no direct evidence concerning the time the home was entered. Nor, in our opinion, was there sufficient indirect evidence from which the trial judge could reasonably infer beyond a reasonable doubt that the crime occurred in the nighttime.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Williams and McClelland v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">The evidence presented at trial was equally conducive to a finding that the crime occurred in the daytime. Without some evidence that the house was actually observed to be intact during all of the daylight hours or that appellant was observed in the area of the victim\u2019s home after dark, the mere fact that no one in the neighborhood witnessed the breaking is not sufficient to support an inference that the crime could only have occurred at night. <em>See Stocker v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 275, 281. When the trier of facts is confronted with a situation where it cannot be determined from the evidence presented whether the breaking and entering occurred in the daytime or the nighttime, this Court has held that when all other elements of the crime are present, a conviction of daytime housebreaking, if properly charged in the indictment, is permissible as the lesser crime. <em>Gazaille v. State, 2 </em>Md. App. 462; <em>St. Clair v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 605. Accordingly, we find the judgment of conviction of burglary by the lower court to be clearly erroneous. Md. Rule 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>In announcing its verdict, the lower court stated: \u201cThe verdict is guilty under the 7th count [burglary]. The other counts all merge.\u201d Without considering the correctness of the latter statement with respect to the other counts, the statement is incorrect as to the counts of nighttime burglary and daytime burglary since guilty verdicts under those counts would not merge but would be inconsistent. The finding of guilt of nighttime burglary would necessarily compel a finding of not guilty of daytime burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and ease remanded for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b320-10\">.
