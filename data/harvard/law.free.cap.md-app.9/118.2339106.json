The State appeals from an order of the trial court granting a motion to dismiss three of the counts. She moves to dismiss the appeal and we grant the motion. <em>State v. Gregg, </em>163 Md. 353, 163 A. 119 held an appeal premature where other counts in the indictment remained open after a motion to dismiss had been granted as to some of the counts. See also <em>State v. Gibson, </em>4 Md. App. 236, 242 A. 2d 575, note 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">If we had considered the appeal on the merits we would have affirmed the action of the trial court for the reasons fully set out in <em>State v. Michael, </em>2 Md. App. 750, 237 A. 2d 782. An indictment, or count thereof, which is invalid on its face cannot be saved by the offer of testimony to support allegations not contained therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by the County Council of Baltimore County.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A4P\">\n<em>Mandate to issue forthwith.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
