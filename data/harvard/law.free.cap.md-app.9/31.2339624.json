Consecutive ten year sentences were imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">The record discloses that at approximately 6:00 p.m. on December 15, 1967, a robbery occurred at a food store in a Northwest Baltimore shopping center. Officer Richard T. Webb and Officer Charles Schubert, who were in the rear of the shopping center in their patrol car, were notified that the holdup was in progress. While Officer Schubert entered the rear of the food store, Officer Webb went through another store and emerged on the sidewalk near the front of the store being robbed. He was confronted at that time by a man who had \u201chis left hand on the front door of the Acme\u201d and who, upon seeing the officer, \u201craised his right hand and started shooting.\u201d Officer Webb, who was struck in the chin and shoulder by gunfire, positively identified appellant, both at a pre-trial lineup and on the witness stand, as his attacker.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">On September 18, 1968, the second day of appellant\u2019s trial, the State concluded its case in chief. At that time the following dialogue transpired between the trial judge and counsel for appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Now, as I understand it, Mr. Allen, you have asked for a continuance of this matter for two weeks to give you an opportunity to secure some witnesses who are supposedly in Delaware?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-10\">MR. ALLEN: Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-11\">THE COURT: Whose names and addresses you do have?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>MR. ALLEN: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-5\">THE COURT: All right. This is an extremely serious case, as you know\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">MR. ALLEN: I know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">THE COURT: \u2014and obviously, I want to be as fair to the defendant as I can.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-8\">MR. ALLEN: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-9\">THE COURT: We will grant a two-week postponement. The understanding, however, will be that the case will have to be tried\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-10\">MR. ALLEN: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-11\">THE COURT: \u2014at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-12\">MR. ALLEN: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-13\">THE COURT: And we will dispose of it promptly thereafter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-14\">MR. ALLEN: I will be able to get it done by that time, your Honor. Thank you very much.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-15\">Although a two-week postponement was granted, appellant\u2019s trial did not resume until November 15, eight weeks and two days later. Three alibi witnesses called by appellant upon resumption of the trial testified that he was in a tavern in the vicinity of the food store making a telephone call at the time of the robbery and the shooting. Appellant then took the witness stand in his own behalf and denied any complicity in the crime. The names of three additional witnesses were announced but none of the witnesses were present in court. Counsel for appellant stated that \u201ctwo of the missing witnesses are witnesses that I consider important,\u201d his explanation being that the two witnesses would further substantiate appellant\u2019s alibi. The court, noting that bench warrants had been issued for the missing witnesses, pointed out to counsel for appellant \u201cthat it is your responsibility to produce them not ours, and you have had quite some time.\u201d No formal motion for a continuance was made by appellant but the trial judge adjourned court until after the luncheon recess in order to allow appellant additional time to locate the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>Having been unable to produce the witnesses, counsel for appellant proffered the testimony of the two missing alibi witnesses and that of a police lieutenant who had interviewed the victim of the robbery. The State did not stipulate to the truth of the proffered evidence nor to the fact that the witnesses would so testify if called, but did not object to the court\u2019s consideration of it for purposes of substantiating the testimony of the three alibi witnesses who had testified earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">In this setting, appellant contends that he was \u201cdenied his constitutional rights by not having the court enforce the presence of three key witnesses.\u201d He argues that an accused is not afforded his right to \u201cprocess for his own witnesses\u201d under Art. 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, unless the \u201cattachment\u201d procedures for securing the presence of absent witnesses under Md. Code, Art. 35, \u00a7 14, are enforced by the trial judge. The statute provides in part: \u201cWhenever any witnesses shall be summoned to attend any of the courts of this State and shall, without sufficient excuse, neglect to appear, he may be attached and fined by the court.. . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">While it is true that upon a showing of proper circumstances by an accused, a trial may be delayed to allow him more time to produce the witnesses whose testimony is believed to be essential to the defense, <em>Blount v. Warden, </em>189 Md. 294, this is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court. An accused does have a right under Article 21 \u201cto have process for his own witnesses.\u201d Such right is satisfied, however, when the witnesses are summoned. The provision carries with it no guarantee of the actual attendance of witnesses at trial. <em>Edmondson v. Warden, </em>188 Md. 96; <em>Battee v. Warden, </em>191 Md. 751. Moreover, it is to be noted that the General Assembly, by its use of the word \u201cmay\u201d in the statute, made clear its intent that the exercise of the authority conferred upon the court to attach and fine a recalcitrant witness was discretionary, not mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">This is not to say that an accused\u2019s constitutional rights may never be abridged by a court\u2019s refusal to grant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>a continuance for the purpose of procuring witnesses since it is clear that an accused may be denied a fair trial, to which he is constitutionally entitled, where the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant the continuance amounts to a clear abuse of its discretion in the matter. We have consistently held, however, that in order to show an abuse of that discretion it is incumbent upon an accused who seeks such continuance to show that the testimony of the absent witness was competent and material; that the case could not be properly tried without such evidence; that he had made diligent and appropriate efforts to procure the witness; and that he had reasonable expectation of procuring the attendance of the witness in court within some reasonable time. <em>Nichols v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 644; <em>Clark v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 91. The circumstances of each particular case must be looked at to ascertain whether the lower court\u2019s action amounted to an abuse of discretion. <em>Walter v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Here the lower court had granted a continuance for eight weeks to enable appellant to produce the additional witnesses and a bench warrant had been issued for their appearance. Moreover, the appellant had made no showing that he had any reasonable expectation of securing the missing alibi witnesses within some reasonable period of time. In any event, the court had before it the proffered testimony of the absent witnesses. Under these circumstances, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to grant an additional postponement pending enforcement of the attachment procedures under Md. Code, Art. 35, \u00a7 14. Nor did such action, in our opinion, constitute an invasion of appellant\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
