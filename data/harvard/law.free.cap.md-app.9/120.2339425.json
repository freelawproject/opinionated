In this appeal he contends that his conviction should be set aside since the State failed to prove a fraudulent conversion as required by the controlling statute, Md. Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 353. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">The record shows that appellant, who had become a. State Trooper in 1956, was notified on March 15, 1968, that his services were terminated. On April 1, 1968, he voluntarily delivered to the quartermaster division of the Department various items of State property of an approximated value in excess of $500.00 which had been issued to him during his years of service as a Trooper. According to an equipment inventory card offered in evidence by the State, he failed to return a badge ($5.50), a Criminal Law Digest ($3.00), a training regulation book ($2.50), handcuffs and case ($11.40), helmet and liner ($.25), baton ($2.50), revolver and holster ($58.-89), and a reefer ($57.45) ,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition to these items which had been issued to him at the time of his appointment, some twelve years before, he failed to return an I.D. card and a gasoline credit card.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">Trooper Dattilio testified that in February 1968 he was-directed to visit appellant\u2019s home at which time he notified him that he had been suspended from duty and that \u201ca revolver, I.D. card, gasoline credit card and badge\u201d should \u201cbe turned in.\u201d According to the Trooper, appellant advised him that \u201che wasn\u2019t going to give them to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>me\u201d, stating that \u201che would return them to Headquarters when he was ready to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Trooper Grout testified that he had never \u201cofficially\u201d contacted appellant concerning the return of the equipment, although he did have a conversation with him about the middle of March 1968. When asked to relate the conversation, he replied (according to the transcript) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">\u201cQ. Where did you contact the defendant ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-7\">A. I dropped by his home on Church Street, in New Windsor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-8\">Q. And did you have a conversation with him concerning this equipment ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-9\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-10\">Q. Tell us as accurately as you can the gist of that conversation ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-11\">A. Well I was off duty and I dropped by in an act of friendship. Danny answered his door and he was studying, studying, he goes to school. And I informed him that I dropped by to let him know that the State of Maryland was seriously thinking of preferring charges against him for failing to turn in his equipment. And at that time I was on my way going past the Westminster Barrack and if he had any of it to turn in I would gladly take it along in and give it to the Sergeant Major.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-12\">Q. What response, if any, did you get from the defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-13\">A. Trooper Roderick told me that he didn\u2019t have any of this equipment, that he could give me to turn in, that it had become lost in his home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-14\">Q. Did you have any further conversation ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-15\">A. We talked. Small talk. And I told him that if I could have helped him that I would have done it at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Q. I mean did you have any further conversation relating to this matter which is the subject of this proceeding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-5\">A. No sir. He just informed me he just didn\u2019t have it. He couldn\u2019t give it to me to turn in.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Appellant then took the witness stand and testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-7\">\u201cQ. And had you or did you return certain equipment to the State Police?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-8\">A. I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-9\">Q. Do you remember the value of that ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-10\">A. Five hundred and some odd dollars worth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-11\">Q. And there was some that you did not return?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-12\">A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-13\">Q. Why didn\u2019t you return it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-14\">A. Because I could not locate it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-15\">Q. Had you made every effort to locate it ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-16\">A. I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-17\">Q. Did you have any idea what, perhaps, could have happened to it ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-18\">A. No sir, I do not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-19\">Q. Do you know where it is now ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-20\">A. No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-21\">Q. Did you have any \u2014 did you intend to deprive the State of Maryland of that property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-22\">A. No, I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-23\">Q. Did you fraudulently convert that property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-24\">A. No sir, I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-25\">Q. Did you intentionally take the property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-26\">A. No, absolutely not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-27\">Q. Would you have returned it if you could have returned it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-28\">A. Yes sir. I would have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-29\">Q. Is there any earthly reason why you would keep it for any purpose whatsoever ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>A. I can\u2019t think of any. It would be of no value to me whatsoever.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-7\">\u201cQ. And did you offer on many occasions to pay whatever it was that was due for this ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-8\">A. That is correct. In fact I offered to pay the State\u2019s Attorney prior to calling you for counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-9\">Q. And you received a letter from Magistrate Simpson over here did you not to come down to show cause why a warrant shouldn\u2019t be issued for your arrest ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-10\">A. That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-11\">Q. Did you appear?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-12\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-13\">Q. And did you again renew your offer to make the State of Maryland whole in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-14\">A. That\u2019s correct. I told Judge Simpson that I did not have the property and that I was more than willing to reimburse the State to the full value of it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-15\">On cross-examination he conceded that he had told the Magistrate and the State\u2019s Attorney that the items were kept in a box \u201cin the foyer where all the trash containers were placed\u201d and that \u201cit was a possibility\u201d that his children \u201chad thrown them out in the trash.\u201d He also stated that he looked for the items in his home, without success, but had not contacted \u201cthe people who collect trash and garbage\u201d since \u201cthe dump is burned each week.\u201d Under vigorous cross-examination he admitted that \u201che wasn\u2019t particularly happy\u201d about the circumstances surrounding the termination of his services as a Trooper, but asserted that \u201cif I had hard feelings it wouldn\u2019t be against the entire Department.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-16\">Md. Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 353, provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-17\">\u201cAny person who shall be entrusted with the possession of goods or things of value for the purpose of applying the same for the use and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>benefit of the owner or person who delivered the goods and things who shall fraudulently convert the same to his own use, shall * * * where the value of the goods or things so converted is less than one hundred dollars, be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">It is apparent that before an individual charged with violating this statute may legally be convicted, there must be proof that the goods entrusted to him were <em>fraudulently </em>converted to his own use. Otherwise stated, it must be shown, beyond a reasonable doubt, that there was a wilful, deliberate conversion of the items entrusted to the accused and that there was a purposeful refusal, accompanied by a fraudulent intent, to return them to the rightful owner. As stated in Perkins, <em>Criminal Law </em>675: \u201cThe word \u2018fraudulent\u2019 when found in the definition of a crime, signifies \u2018an intent to defraud\u2019 and whether the word or the phrase is employed in a particular instance, it is largely a matter of personal preference. The point to be emphasized is that any crime which requires fraud for its perpetration is one which includes a specific intent whether or not the word \u2018intent\u2019 is found in the definition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">With this general principle in mind, we have carefully scrutinized the record before us and it is evident that the State has failed to present evidence legally sufficient to prove that the failure of the appellant to return the items here in question to the Department of Maryland State Police was accompanied by a specific intent to fraudulently convert them to his own use as required by the statute. While it is true that proof of a fraudulent intent is seldom adduced directly and more often must be found inferentially, there must be evidentiary facts upon which a rational inference of such intent may be found, beyond a reasonable doubt. In the case at bar, the only evidence presented by the State to prove the <em>mens rea </em>of the offense charged was a failure to return the items. On the other hand, the State\u2019s own witnesses tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>tified directly that the appellant advised them that he would return the items to Headquarters rather than to the local barracks and that, finally, he was unable to return them because they had become lost. Moreover, there was uncontradicted evidence indicating that the appellant \u201con many occasions\u201d offered to reimburse the State for the monetary value of the missing items which the trial judge concluded had a depreciated value of $96.30. It is also clear that the appellant had returned the great bulk of the property issued to him which had a value in excess of $500.00. The mere failure to return the missing items will not, without more, support a finding of fraudulent conversion since \u201cthere is no presumption of law, either conclusive or disputable, that an act was done with any specific intent * * *\u201d Perkins, <em>supra, </em>674. We are of the opinion that the State failed to establish the requisite fraudulent intent contemplated by the statute and, accordingly, we feel that the lower court\u2019s judgment of conviction was clearly erroneous. <em>Pachmayr v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 270; Md. Rule 1085.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The judgment of conviction is vacated. The case is remanded for a new trial provided that the State promptly satisfies the trial court that it can produce additional probative evidence; otherwise, a judgment of acquittal shall be entered forthwith by the trial court. See <em>Gray v. State, </em>254 Md. 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and case remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b139-9\">.
