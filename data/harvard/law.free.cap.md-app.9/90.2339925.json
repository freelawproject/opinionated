He moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the statute was violative of his rights under the first amendment to the Federal Constitution and Article 40 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. The Motion was denied and he filed the instant appeal. The State moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the lower court\u2019s order denying the Motion to Dismiss the Indictment was interlocutory in nature and not immediately reviewable by this Court. We think the State\u2019s Motion is well founded, <em>Raimondi v. State, </em>8 Md.
