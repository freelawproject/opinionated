This phrase used in each of the counts sufficiently informs the defendant what portion of each policy is referred to, and its use in the exception of performance of that portion of each policy is justified in avoidance'of unnecessary prolixity. .</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The averment \u201cthat the defendant instructed the plaintiff that he, the plaintiff, need not comply with said portion of said policy known as the \u201ciron-safe clause\u2019 \u201d sufficiently informs the defendant why the requirements of said clause in each policy were not complied with, without alleging how, when, or by whom' the instruction was given. The failure to aver the subordinate facts suggested by the causes of demurrer does not prevent issue on the subject-matter averred.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">Our decision is confined to the sufficiency of the counts. The demurrer to each count is overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
