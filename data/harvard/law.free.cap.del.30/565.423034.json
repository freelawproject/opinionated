Verdict for plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-17\">Evidence was introduced by the plaintiffs to show: That a barn and other adjacent buildings and their contents situated on a farm, in New Castle county, owned by plaintiffs, were completely destroyed by fire on October 9, 1918, shortly after eight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>o\u2019clock in the evening. That the bam was located at a distance of one hundred and fifty feet from the right of way of a railroad then being operated by defendant. That shortly before eight o\u2019clock a train passed said barn and a few minutes later the bam and adjacent buildings were discovered to be on fire. That for two hours previous no one had been inside the buildings, and the only cause that could be attributed to the fire was the possibility of sparks having been emitted from the locomotive, and communicated to the barn. That locomotives of the defendant company have frequently been seen emitting large numbers of sparks in the immediate neighborhood of the plaintiffs\u2019 farm, and that other fires have occurred on said farm and adjacent properties, said fires always being first noticed shortly after the passing of trains.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-4\">It was also testified that the wind on the night in question was blowing in the direction from the railroad to the barn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-5\">The defense was that the train in question emitted no sparks as it passed plaintiff\u2019s property on October 9, 1918, said locomotive having been equipped with the latest improved spark arrester, which was examined on the morning following the fire and found to be in good condition. That the wind on the night of the fire was blowing in the direction from the barn to the right of way of the railroad.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Prayers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-7\">Direct evidence that the fire in question was caused by the defendant\u2019s locomotive is not required. It is sufficient if this be proved by circumstantial evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-8\">Proof that damage has been caused by fire from a locomotive on a railroad raises a prima facie presumption of negligence on the part of the railroad. In order to exonerate itself from liability, the defendant must show that it was not negligent. For collection of cases supporting this prayer, see <em>Note </em>XI, to case of <em>Jacob Doll &amp; Sons v. Ribetti, </em>5 <em>Neg. Comp. Cases Ann. </em>(1913) 46.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-9\">It is the duty of the railroad to use ordinary care in equipping its locomotives with the best mechanical appliances in known and practical use for preventing the escape of fire and sparks. <em>Phillips v.

Railroad Company, </em>109 <em>Va. </em>436, 63 S. <em>E. </em>998 (1909).</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Mere proof that the equipment of the engine was in good condition is not sufficient to relieve the defendant of the charge of negligence. The defendant must also prove that its equipment was properly operated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-5\">It is also the duty of the railroad to keep its locomotives in proper condition and repair and under proper management to prevent the emission of sparks and fire. <em>Phillips v. Railroad Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-6\">\u201cEvidence, though uncontradicted, that the apparatus of the locomotive was in good order, and that those in charge were competent and skillful, does not of itself prove that the fire did not originate from the locomotive; to do that the defendant ought to show that the fire could have originated in some other way.\u201d <em>Hagan v.

(6th Ed.) </em>\u00a7 674.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-8\">' \u201cIf engines in good repair and properly constructed do not ordinarily set out fires, defects in an engine, or negligence in running them, may be inferred from the frequent escape of fire therefrom. Circumstances of this kind may be considered by the jury. \u2019 \u2019 <em>Slossen v. Burlington, etc., Railroad Co. (Iowa) </em>10 <em>N.

P., W. &amp; B. R. R. Co., </em>3 <em>Houst. </em>455.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-8\">That even if the plaintiffs established the fact the fire was caused by a spark from the defendant\u2019s engine, still if they failed to show by satisfactory proof that the firing and destruction of the barn resulted from the carelessness or negligence of the defendant they could not recover in this action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-9\">That the defendant is not answerable under all circumstances or at all events, but is only answerable for their own fault, that is for want of due care, skill or diligence, in the transaction of their business and in the use of their engines in it to prevent such accidents.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-10\">That if the defendant on the occasion in question had adopted the usual precautions in supplying its engine with such spark arresters as were in general use for the escape of sparks, and employed a competent engineer to manage its engine and the engineer used reasonable care and diligence in the management of said engine then the defendant did all that either the law, or enlightened reason required of it in such case and the plaintiffs could not recover in this action. <em>Jefferis v. P. W. &amp; B. R. R. Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-11\">That the defendant had an unquestionable right to operate the railroad by engines propelled by steam generated by fire.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-12\">That if the defendant used due care and caution in the running of its engines and yet unfortunately the barn of the plaintiffs was set on fire by sparks emitted from its engine and destroyed, the plaintiffs would not be entitled to recover for the loss sustained by them because the defendant under such circumstances would be without fault. <em>Jefferis v. P., W. &amp; B. R. R. Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-13\">If the defendant had in use on its locomotive fire appliances and machinery then in general use for the prevention of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>escape of sparks and coals of fire and the plaintiffs do not show that it has been negligent in other particulars there would be no liability and the plaintiffs cannot recover in this action. 3 <em>Elliott on R. R. </em>\u00a7 1224; <em>Philadelphia &amp; R. R. Co. v. Schultz, </em>93 <em>Pa. </em>341; <em>Texas, etc., R. R. Co. v. Levi, </em>59 <em>Tex. </em>674; 13 <em>Am. &amp; Eng. R. Cas. </em>464.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-9\">A railroad company is not bound to adopt any particular kind of appliances or machinery for the prevention of fires and it cannot be held guilty of negligence for failing to adopt a different kind or pattern of appliances than that which it has adopted, if it has exercised reasonable care in the selection, and the latter is approved and in general use, and if the company has taken every precaution and secured approved machinery in general use it has done all that lies in its power to do, consistent with the operation of the road, and is therefore not liable for a purely accidental fire. <em>Louisville, etc., R. Co. v. Reese, </em>85 <em>Ala. </em>497, 5 <em>South, </em>283, 7 <em>Am. St. Rep. </em>66; <em>Jennings v. Penna. R. R. Co., 93 Pa. </em>337; <em>St. Louis, etc., Ry Co. v. Dawson, </em>77 <em>Ark. </em>434, 92 S. <em>W. </em>27; <em>St. Louis etc., R. Co. v. Hoover, </em>3 <em>Kan. App. </em>577, 43 <em>Pac. </em>854.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-12\">This action is based upon negligence and the plaintiffs in order to recover must establish such negligence by a preponderance of the evidence. Negligence is never presumed and the burden of establishing such negligence rests upon the party alleging it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-13\">Where the presumption of negligent construction or operation arises from the fact that the fire was set by defendant\u2019s locomotive, when that presumption thus arising is repelled and rebutted, by proof of proper construction and use of proper appliances and careful management and operation, the plaintiffs cannot recover without producing proof of actual negligence or want of ordinary care. <em>Osburn v.
