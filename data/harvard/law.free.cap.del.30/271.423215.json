It did not appear in either affidavit that the company had reasonable expectation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>of the return of the absent witness in time to testify at, or that the company would procure the deposition of the witness by, the next term of court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b284-6\">Mr. Ward, for plaintiff, objected to the continuance on the grounds (1) that the affidavits were not made by the proper parties; (2) that they held out no hope of an early return of the absent witness, or a return within any period of future time; (3) that a similar motion was made and granted at the last term, and that the defendant, therefore, had two months\u2019 time in which to have obtained the deposition of the witness.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-7\">Mr. Bayard, for defendant, contended (1) that the affidavits being made by defendant\u2019s \u201ccredit manager\u201d and associate counsel of the defendant, respectively, came within the spirit, if not the letter, of the rulings of the court; (2) that the absent witness is now in France, engaged in Y. M. C. A. work with the American Expeditionary Forces, that he is absent without the consent or procurement of the defendant, directly or indirectly, and that it is impossible to indicate in said affidavits the time of his return; (3) that the range and scope of the knowledge of the absent witness is so wide and extensive, and covers so many and varied subjects, that the deposition of the witness, if taken, would not adequately serve the defendant.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b284-8\">Conrad, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A9i\">delivering the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">This case, on the application of the defendant supported by the affidavit of the president of defendant company, was continued at the last term, the first trial term, because of the absence of Jared W.
