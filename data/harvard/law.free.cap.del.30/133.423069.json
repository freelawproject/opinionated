Code </em>1915, \u00a7 4788a, 29 <em>Laws of Delaware, </em>854, amending <em>Rev. Code </em>1915, \u00a7 4788. On general demurrer to the indictment.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AEb\">Demurrer overruled.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-5\">It was urged: That the unlawful, voluntary sexual intercourse between two persons of opposite sexes, only one of whom is married, as in this case, the offense of adultery is committed by the married party only and not by the unmarried. <em>State v. Chafin, </em>80 <em>Kan. </em>653, 103 <em>Pac. </em>143; <em>Com. v. Lafferty, </em>6 <em>Grat. (Va.) </em>672; <em>Miner v. State, </em>58 <em>Ill. </em>59; <em>Cook v. State, </em>11 <em>Ga. </em>54, 56 <em>Am. Dec. </em>410; <em>Helfrich v. Com., </em>33 <em>Pa. </em>68; <em>In re Cooper, </em>162 <em>Cal. </em>81, 121 <em>Pac. </em>318.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-6\">That under the facts disclosed by the indictment, the unmarried party is never deemed to have committed adultery, except the statute clearly embraces both parties, as in <em>State v. Mahan, </em>81 <em>Iowa, </em>122, 46 <em>N. W. </em>855, and <em>In re Smith, 2 Okla. </em>153, 37 <em>Pac. </em>1099.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-7\">That the statute under which the accused is indicted does not, in a case like this, expressly provide that both parties are guilty of adultery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-8\">For the state it was contended that the statute embraces the unmarried as well as the married party.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b146-9\">Rice, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A4E\">delivering the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">The indictment in this case charges the defendant Vincenzo Alamanio with adultery in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-11\">\u201cThe grand inquest for the state of Delaware, and the body of Newcastle county, on their oath and affirmation, respectively, do present that Vincenzo Alamanio, late of Wilmington hundred in the county aforesaid, on the seventeenth day of March in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and eighteen, with force and arms, at Wilmington hundred in the county aforesaid, being then and there an unmarried man, did commit adultery by then and there having carnal knowledge of the body of one Carmello Discorso, the said Carmello Discorso being then and there the wife of a man other than the said Vincenzo Alamanio, to wit, of one John Discorso, against the form of the act,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>To this indictment the defendant demurred on the ground:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-5\">\u201c That the indictment states that the defendant is an unmarried man, and the crime of adultery under the statutes of the state of Delaware cannot be committed by an unmarried person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-6\"><em>Chapter </em>264, <em>Laws of Delaware, volume </em>29, which is an amendment to <em>section 8, chapter </em>153, <em>Rev. Code </em>1915, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-7\">\u201c4788a. <em>Section </em>8a. . Adultery is the sexual intercourse of two.persons either of whom is married to a third person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-8\">\u201c4788b. <em>Section </em>8b. A person who commits adultery is guilty of a midsemeanor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">It appears from the statute that adultery is defined to be \u201cthe sexual intercourse of two persons either of whom is married to a third person,\u201d and irrespective of what the common law may be with respect to this offense, or what it may be under the statutes of other states, the court is clearly of the opinion, that under our statute if either of two persons having sexual intercourse is married to a third person, then either or both of the parties to the intercourse may lawfully be indicted charged with committing the act of adultery.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">The demurrer is overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
