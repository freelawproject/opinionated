Locker-man. Verdict guilty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-16\">It was proved by the state that L., induced by certain advertisements bjr Adams, viz. \u201cSpot cash paid for your Liberty Bonds or Payment Cards,\u201d * * * presented a Liberty Bond card to Adams, who, as a real estate agent occupied offices in Wilmington with Belascio, a licensed private detective, stating that he wished to sell the card. It belonged to L.\u2019s sister, on which there had been paid twenty-two dollars. Adams paid L. twelve dollars for the card, after requesting him to sign his sister\u2019s name on it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-18\">Adams and Belascio a few days thereafter went to the home of L. and (Belascio showing his badge) told L. and his mother that he had committed forgery and that meant five or ten years in jail. Belascio then suggested that L. go with him and Adams to a lawyer and settle the matter. L. replied that they could settle between themselves.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-19\">Adams then demanded the return of the twelve dollars, paid and twenty-five dollars for the services of Belascio, to save L. from arrest, which amounts L. paid to them; they refusing to receipt for the money, and warning L. that \u201cit will be best to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>keep this matter to 3rourself, and not say anything to anybod3^ about it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-5\">The defense was that Adams, upon presenting the card purchased from L. at the Allied Bank, in Wilmington, was informed that a duplicate card had previously been issued and that the one held by him was void; that Adams, accompanied b3^ Belascio, went to L.\u2019s home, and requested the return of the twelve dollars paid for the card and payment of twenty-five dollars to Belascio for his services in apprehending L., who it was claimed was responsible for the necessity of Belascio\u2019s services.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b349-6\">Conrad, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A2G\">charged the jury in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">In this case, Elkton Adams and Carmine Belascio, are charged with an offense commonly called extortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The word \u201cextort\u201d means to take from unlawfully\u2014 to exact something wrongfully from a party by threats, or putting in fear.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">The statute covering this offense reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-10\">\u201cWhoever, with intent thereby to extort or wrongfully gain any money or other property, shall make or cause to be made to any other person any oral statement or communication, threatening\u201d to accuse any person of a crime \u201cshall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d <em>Rev. Code </em>1915, \u00a7 4804.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">One definition of extortion is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-12\">\u201cThe obtaining of property from another with his consent, induced by a wrongful use of force, or fear, or under color of official right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-13\">Another definition is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-14\">\u201cThe taking or obtaining of anything from another by means of illegal compulsion or oppressive exaction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-15\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> It is no defense to an accusation of extortion that the charges threatened by the defendant, and by which he obtained mone3r or other valuable property, were true.

The duty is upon the state in this case to prove to your satisfaction, beyond a reasonable doubt, the guilt of these two men.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">Verdict guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">In imposing sentence upon Belascio, his license as a private detective was revoked by the court.</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
