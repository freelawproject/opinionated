After the case had been pleaded to issue and on the day preceding the trial, the defendant moved to file an affidavit, denying his signature to the bond sued on, under <em>Rev. Code </em>1915, \u00a74170. The plaintiff objected to the motion on the ground that it came too late, citing <em>Woolley on Del.

J.:</author>\n<p id=\"APD\">It is admitted that the granting of defendant\u2019s motion is within the discretion of the court, and this is entirely consistent with the statute, which says that the affidavit must be filed with the plea, \u201cor within such further time as the court shall on motion allow.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"ARP\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>In order to promote the trial of cases upon their merits the court are disposed to construe the statute liberally, and permit the filing of the affidavit after the plea is filed, unless it would place the plaintiff at a disadvantage at the trial. If it appears to the court that the plaintiff is unprepared to prove the signature because of defendant\u2019s failure to file the affidavits with his plea, and has not time before the trial to secure such evidence, the court may continue the case on plaintiff\u2019s application, and, if it is deemed proper, impose upon the defendant the costs of the term.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Motion allowed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
