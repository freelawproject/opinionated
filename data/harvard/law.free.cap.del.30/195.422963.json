D. 1917, falsely, wickedly and maliciously did compose and publish and caused and procured to be published of and concerning the said plaintiff, a certain false scandalous, malicious and defamatory libel in a certain newspaper known as \u2018The New Era,\u2019 containing, amongst other things, the false, scandalous, malicious, defamatory and libelous matter following, of and concerning the said plaintiff, that is to say: * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-6\">\u201c The farmers of the community during the late fall and early winter suffered greatly from the depredations of an organized gang of chicken thieves, and at least $1,000 worth of poultry was stolen and hauled away from here at night.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-7\">\u201cThe gang of which it has been learned beyond a shadow of doubt that Lewis was the brains, were well organized (meaning the gang of chicken thieves were well organized) and had a standing arrangement (meaning that said gang of chicken thieves had a standing arrangement) which bad been made by Lewis with Deputy Sheriff, Joshua Z. Crossland (meaning the plaintiff) to procure a team (meaning a horse and carriage from the livery stable kept by the said plaintiff in the town of Middletown) at any time with which to haul the loot away (meaning that the said plaintiff had agreed with the said Lewis and the said organized gang of chicken thieves to furnish to them the means to carry away and conceal the goods which might be at any time stolen by the said gang). * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-8\">\u201cLewis came into this community more than a year ago and would positively not work, but spent the summer in \u2018bootlegging,\u2019 and was known to have hired a team almost every evening for the purpose (meaning that he hired the team from the plaintiff for the purpose of engaging in illegal liquor selling). * * * \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-9\">By means of the committing of which said several grievances by the said defendant as aforesaid, the said plaintiff hath beenand is greatly injured, etc.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b208-10\">Rice, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"AdE\">The alleged published statement is equivocal and ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The plaintiff in his declaration avers that by publishing the alleged libelous article \u201cthe defendant caused it to be suspected and believed by his neighbors that he, the plaintiff, was guilty of the offences and misconduct hereinafter mentioned,\u201d but he does not aver the particular offence which he claims the defendant imputed to him in the publication. When the words themselves are not prima facie actionable it is necessary in the inducement to set forth extrinsic matter to show that they are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>actionable. Then having stated the extrinsic matter the plaintiff may by innuendo set forth the definite or fixed meaning which he thinks the words ought to bear.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The purpose of the innuendo is to explain the words in the alleged libel and give them their proper meaning. The innuendo cannot be used to enlarge the words beyond their natural meaning, unless there is an averment of introductory matter with which they are connected. Then equivocal or ambiguous words may have fixed to them a defamatory meaning beyond their ordinary import.'</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">We are of the opinion that the demurrer should be sustained for the reason that the plaintiff in his declaration does not allege any offence with which he claims the defendant charged him or imputed to him in the publication as alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">The demurrer is sustained.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
