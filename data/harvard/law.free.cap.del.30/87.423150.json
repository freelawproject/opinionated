This is not a case of any individual so acting as to bind himself by estoppel or otherwise from denying his signature, but is a duty imposed by the statute upon a public official. We think the intent of the statute was that a justice of the peace, when certifying under his hand and seal a transcript of his docket entries, should subscribe his name in his own handwriting. This not having been done, the certificate is fatally defective and the appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
