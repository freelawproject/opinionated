Terry against Mary J. Parsons and others trading as M. J. Parsons and Sons, to recover damages growing out of a breach of contract. Verdict for plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-12\">Testimony respecting special damages such as are indicated in the following statement of facts was introduced against objections for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-13\">The plaintiff seeks to recover damages from the defendants, for pecuniary loss he claims to have sustained in packing and marketing a peach crop, resulting from defendants\u2019 failure to deliver a quantity of carriers under the terms of an alleged contract between the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-14\">The plaintiff claims that upon the prior solicitation of William H. Parsons, representing the defendants, he did on or about the twelfth day of July, 1915, make a contract with the defendants whereby he was to purchase and the defendants were to sell and deliver to him twenty thousand carriers to be used by the plaintiff in packing his peach crop raised on his farms, in this state, one near Seaford in Sussex County and the other located near Dover in Kent County. That under the terms of the alleged contract the defendants were to deliver the carriers at Seaford, at the price of fourteen cents per carrier, those of the Sussex farm to be hauled to the farm by the defendants, for which services they were to be allowed reasonable compensation by the plaintiff, and the car-, tiers for the Kent County farm to be free on board cars at Seaford. That the quantity for each farm was to be later designated by the plaintiff but all to be delivered at Seaford between the fifteenth and twentieth of August.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-15\">That on August tenth he advised the defendants to deliver five thousand carriers at his farm in Sussex County, and ship four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>thousand to Dover on the fourteenth, four thousand on the sixteenth, four thousand on the eighteenth, the remaining three thousand to be sent as might be later directed by plaintiff. That the defendants failed to ship the carriers to Dover on or before the twentieth and by reason of defendants\u2019 failure in that respect the plaintiff in order to market his fruit found it necessary to' purchase new and second hand carriers, also baskets for packing and placing on the market his peach crop. That as a result of defendants\u2019 failure to deliver the carriers as the plaintiff claims they agreed to do, the plaintiff was five days longer than he otherwise would have been in picking and packing the peaches, some of the peaches in the meantime becoming overripe and some eventually spoiling. The plaintiff claims he sustained damages in the amount of eight thousand and seventy-two dollars for extra labor and expenses; loss on peaches spoiling by reason of not having packages to put them in; and the difference between the reduced price he did receive for fruit sent in second-hand carriers and what would have been the fair market price if they had been packed in new carriers; and the loss sustained by the deterioration of peaches as the result of delay in securing suitable substitutes for the carriers not delivered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-6\">The plaintiff further claims that the defendants knew the purpose for which he intended to use the carriers, to wit, packing and marketing the peaches grown on his farms in Kent and Sussex Counties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-7\">The defendants deny that they made a contract with the plaintiff for the sale and delivery of any certain quantity of carriers but to the contrary contend that they refused to contract for the sale of any given quantity of the carriers to the plaintiff, and only agreed to sell him so many as they were able to manufacture by the limited equipment of their factory, and this they claim they did.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-8\">The defendants further claim that the plaintiff did not suffer pecuniary loss in the amount and to the extent claimed by him, and for the peaches sold he secured full market price.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-9\">The plaintiff requested the court to charge the jury: That a promise to furnish on the one hand and a promise to pay for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>thing furnished on the other constitutes a binding contract between the parties whether written or by word of mouth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-6\">That the promise or agreement of William H. Parsons is equivalent to the promise or the agreement of the defendant firm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-7\">It being undenied that the defendants knew that the carriers were intended for the packing and. marketing of peaches in the season of 1915, that if the jury believe the agreement was made as testified to by Charles L. Terry (it being undisputed that twelve thousand carriers were not delivered to the Dover farm between August 5th and August 20th), the jury should return a verdict for the plaintiff covering the loss sustained by the plaintiff, which loss would be the decrease in the price of peaches through their being overripe; the decrease in the price of the peaches which were shipped in secondhand carriers, the decrease in the price of peaches shipped in baskets, and the value of the peaches which were wholly lost according to the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-8\">Counsel for the defendants objected to the third prayer as misleading and as in effect stating a conclusion of fact which is not admitted but is denied; and requested the court to instruct the jury that if they should believe the defendants did not contract to deliver any special number of carriers for the year 1915, their verdict should be for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-9\">It was urged for the plaintiff that the damages in this case could not be measured by the ordinary rule of the difference between the contract price and the market price of the carriers sold.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-10\">That as against a carrier for delay in delivery of perishable commodities, the damages are measured by the consequent deterioration of the articles shipped; and the failure of the carrier to take such commodities offered for shipment would render it liable for whatever loss ensued thereby.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-11\">That the delay in delivery, or ,the total failure to deliver, packages for perishable fruit will naturally and proximately result in the same damage as in the case of a carrier delaying or neglecting to transport such fruit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>That the damages which the plaintiff is entitled to recover in respect to the breach of the contract should be such as may fairly and reasonably be considered either as arising naturally\u2014 that is, according to the usual course of things, from such breach of contract itself\u2014or such as may reasonably be supposed to have been in contemplation of both parties at the time they made the contract as the probable result of a breach of it. 1 <em>Sutherland on Damages, </em>\u00a7 50; <em>Neal v.
