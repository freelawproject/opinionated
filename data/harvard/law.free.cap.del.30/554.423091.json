The plaintiff and defendant were married on the twelfth day of December, A. D. 1912, \u201cand with the exception of a separation of one year and two months, they lived and cohabited together until the thirteenth day of May, A. D. 1919.\u201d The plaintiff in her petition complains that her husband \u201cin violation of his marriage vows, did during the most of their married life indulge in such vile, abusive and inhumane treatment, humiliating her before the public, and otherwise illtreating her as to impair her health and render her life miserable.\u201d- And it is specifically averred \u201cthat the defendant has been guilty of extreme cruelty such as to endanger the health of your petitioner and to render cohabitation unsafe.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-26\">The plaintiff testified at the trial that she separated from her husband once before \u201con account of brutal treatment,\u201d but returned to him in March, 1916, after much persuasion, having been absent from him for about a year and two months. Witnesses for the plaintiff, nearby neighbors, gave testimony to the effect that the conduct and demeanor of the defendant towards his wife were unreasonable and that he was almost continually very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>abusive, cursing and swearing at her at home, in the homes of their neighbors, and publicly on the streets. The plaintiff testified that her husband \u201cgrabbed hold of me many times and said, if it was not for the law what he would do to me.\u201d Also, that on one occasion shortly before she left him, he \u201ccaught hold of me and had my arms back of me.\u201d A next-door neighbor testified that she came in and he had his wife, in the position testified to, \u201cbacked up in the corner of the room.\u201d It was testified by the plaintiff and several of her neighbors that the conduct of the defendant towards her was clearly such as to affect her health and that before separating from her husband she had become very nervous. She also testified that\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-5\">\u201cJust before I left him I said: \u2018I cannot endure your life any longer.' He said: \u2018Whenever you don\u2019t like the way I do, get the hell out. Nobody is telling you to stay here. The sooner you leave me the better I will be off, but remember,-damn you, you will never come back.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-6\">The defendant appeared and opposed the action. He denied that he ever resorted to any physical violence against his wife. He did admit swearing at her mans'- times and said that she was very extravagant; that whenever he talked to her about the use of money, \u201cshe flies up in the air.\u201d He admitted that his wife did sometimes faint when they had their disagreements and that at times he thought she would go crazy.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b567-7\">Boyce, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"Ayg\">Evidence of merely wounded mental feelings, unaccompanied with bodily injury, either actual or menaced, has not been regarded as sufficient to warrant a divorce on the ground of extreme cruelty. <em>McClenahan v. McClenahan, </em>2 <em>Boyce </em>599, 80 <em>Atl. </em>677, and <em>Elliott v. Elliott, 5 Boyce </em>406, 93 <em>Atl. </em>963. While the evidence in this case does not show acts of grievous bodily injury, it does show a reasonable and continuous apprehension of such injury and that this condition existed to such a degree as to endanger the health of the plaintiff and to render cohabitation unsafe.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">It is the opinion of the court that this case is distinguished from the cases above cited. Let a decree nisi be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
