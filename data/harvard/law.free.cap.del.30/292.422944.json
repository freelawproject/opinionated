Code </em>1915, \u00a7 3031.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Because of the broad powers and large discretion conferred by the statute the court are of the opinion that the order asked for by the plaintiff may be granted. The statute, of which the defendant is presumed to have knowledge, furnishes sufficient notice that such an order may be applied for.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
