(N. </em>S.) 1169.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-5\">(10) The general rule of law is that where property is delivered to a bailee and the latter fails to return it on demand, or if property was delivered to the bailee in good condition and was returned damaged in such a way as does not usually occur by the exercise of proper care, a prima facie case is made out against the bailee and negligence will be presumed. 34 <em>Okl. </em>5, <em>124 Pac. </em>960, 43 <em>L.

When such a contract is created, and the property is delivered to the bailee, the latter is liable for the safe-keeping of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\"><bracketnum>[2-6]</bracketnum> Negligence is the failure to use such care as a reasonably prudent and careful person would exercise under similar circumstances. Negligence is never to be presumed. It must be proved, like any other substantive fact. Ordinarily the burden of proof is upon him who alleges the negligence relied upon for a recovery. When, however, property is damaged or injured while in the exclusive custody of a bailee, his servant or agent, it is incumbent upon the bailee to satisfy the jury that the injury was not occasioned by the negligence of himself, his servant or agent. The negligence, if any there was, of the servant or agent of the bailee is imputed to the bailee.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\"><bracketnum>[7, 8]</bracketnum> A garage keeper is bound to exercise reasonable care to preserve from injury automobiles left by their owners at his garage for hire, such care as a reasonable person would exercise in respect to his own property, and he is also bound to see that the person to whom he delivers an automobile left with him for safe-keeping is the proper person to receive it.

If, on the other hand, you find that the defendant exercised due and reasonable care in keeping the automobile, your verdict should be for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Verdict for plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
