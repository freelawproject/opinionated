Any agreement to pay more than such fees would be against public policy and void. The law and rule of court, which authorize the payment of five dollars to a witness testifying in a case as an expert, does not apply to witnesses giving testimony before a justice of the peace, and any agreement to pay more than the legal fees is unenforceable in an action at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Verdict for appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
