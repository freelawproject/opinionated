Counsel for plaintiff opposed the continuance on the ground that it was the duty of the affiant to appear, and if he could not appear there should have been an examination of the witness by another physician who could have appeared and testified as to the physical condition of the witness. It was also contended that the plaintiff had witnesses in attendance from a long distance out of the state, at considerable expense. And it was insisted that if the case should be continued terms should be imposed.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b271-12\">Heisel, J:</author>\n<p id=\"Af0\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> Under the circumstances presented the court is of the opinion that a continuance should be granted. The affidavit of the physician as to the physical condition of the witness, and that he, the physician, was also too ill to appear for examination on the stand is sufficient to meet the requirements for a continuance. There is nothing out of the usual order in the application, excepting as to the number of witnesses present from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>out of the state. We will continue the case but decline to impose terms.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
