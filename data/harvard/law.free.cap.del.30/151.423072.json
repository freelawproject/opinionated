We distinguish this case from the case of <em>In re Tomer et al., </em>3 <em>Pennewill </em>31, 50 <em>Atl. </em>268, because in that case the offense charged was a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">ICillcourse was held in one thousand dollars bail for his appearance at the following November term.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
