A violation of such a statute involves no moral turpitude, and therefore is merely malum prohibitum, and not malum in se. <em>Commonwealth vs Adams, </em>114 <em>Mass. </em>323, 19 <em>Am.

Cases above cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">If the jury believe from the testimony that the defendant unintentionally, not realizing that he was doing so, exceeded the limit of speed prescribed by the statute, he ought not to be convicted of either a felony or a misdemeanor. <em>State v. Hill, </em>2 <em>Boyce </em>540, 82 <em>Atl. </em>221; <em>People v. Barnes, </em>182 <em>Mich. </em>179, 148 <em>N. W. </em>400.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">That it is incumbent upon the state to satisfy the jury that the accident was <em>caused by the excessive speed </em>of the car, and would not have happened, in the circumstances disclosed by the testimony, if the car had been operated at a speed that was not excessive or reckless. <em>People v.

To be criminal, the negligence must be gross. <em>State v. Goetz, </em>83 Conn. 437, 76 <em>Atl. </em>1000, 30 <em>L. R. A. (N. S.) </em>458; <em>People v.

R. A. </em>286; <em>State v. Thomas, 2 Boyce </em>24, 78 <em>Atl. </em>640.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">It is incumbent upon the state to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, either a specific evil intent on the part of the defendant, or else such facts and circumstances as will warrant the jury in finding the existence of an evil intent at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">That the jury may find the defendant guilty of an assault only.</p>\n<author id=\"b414-9\">Pennewill, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ag0\">charging the jury;\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">The defendant is charged in this case with the crime of manslaughter. It is alleged in the indictment that on the twenty-seventh day of August of the present year, on the Kennett Pike in Christiana hundred, in this county, he ran his automobile at a greater rate of speed than that allowed by the statute, and while so doing ran into and collided with a certain other automobile driven by one .Shannon, and by reason thereof feloniously and willfully made an assault upon one Margaret Dyer, who was riding in the car driven by the defendant, whereby she was thrown upon the ground and received injuries which resulted in her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-12\">The defendant denies that he was driving his automobile at the time of the collision at a rate of speed in excess of that permitted by the statute, or at a rate of speed, or in a manner, that was dangerous to others upon the highway, and therefore claims that he was not guilty of any negligence that caused the death of the child, Margaret Dyer. The defendant contends that the death of the child resulted from his car being struck from behind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>by another car, and that, therefore, it was by misadventure, and not from any criminal act of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">In the collision of the two cars, Margaret Dyer and all the other occupants of defendant\u2019s car were thrown out, except himself, and a young child was thrown from Shannon\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The indictment being for manslaughter, it is necessary for us to define as clearly as we can what constitutes that crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Manslaughter is termed homicide and is so called because it is the killing of a human being; but it is not malicious homicide, and is, therefore, unlike murder, which contains malice. It is the unlawful killing of another, without malice, express or implied, and is either voluntary or involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Voluntary manslaughter is where one kills another in the heat of blood, and usually occurs in fighting or under great provocation. This may be termed the common kind of manslaughter and is probably somewhat familiar to you.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">Involuntary manslaughter, which is less common and perhaps less familiar, is where a person in committing an unlawful act, not felonious or tending to great bodily harm, or in committing a lawful act without proper caution or requisite skill, unguardedly or undesignedly kills another. Manslaughter may arise, as you see, from an unlawful act, or from a lawful act done without proper caution or skill.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">So you can understand what the state means by the charge that the defendant is guilty of involuntary manslaughter because he killed Margaret Dyer in committing the unlawful act of running his car at a greater speed than the law allows, or in the performance of the lawful act of running his car within the speed limit, but without proper caution and care, and in disregard of the safety of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">Homicide by misadventure is the accidental killing of another where the slayer is doing a lawful act unaccompanied by any criminally careless or reckless conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\"><bracketnum>[4, 5]</bracketnum> It is unlawful in this state to run an automobile upon any public street or highway, where the buildings are of greater distance apart than one hundred feet, at a greater rate of speed than twenty-five miles an hour, or, as stated in the indictment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>and the statute, at a greater rate of speed than a mile in two minutes and twenty-four seconds.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Such being the law, we say to you that any one who, while driving his automobile at a higher rate of speed than the law allows, kills another by striking him with (or throwing him from) his car, is prima facie guilty of negligence; and such act will make the driver criminally liable and guilty of manslaughter, if it is clearly shown by the evidence that such unlawful speed was the cause of the death. But even though the jury should not be satisfied that the driver was running his car at a higher rate of speed than the law allows, he would, nevertheless, be guilty of manslaughter if the death was caused by gross negligence on his part, that is, by a wanton, careless and reckless disregard of the rights and safety of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">And we may. say that the law we have stated for your guidance applies, whether the person killed is thrown from, another car that was struck or from the car driven by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">And we further instruct you that if the death resulted from the unlawful rate of speed, or from the careless and reckless driving of the car, the fact that the killing was unintentional on the defendant\u2019s part does not excuse him. It makes no difference how unintentional it may have been, if the death was caused by the defendant\u2019s criminal and gross negligence. As we have already told you, involuntary manslaughter exists when a person, in committing an unlawful act, or in committing a lawful act without proper caution or skill, indesignedly kills another. That is the definition of manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\"><bracketnum>[6]</bracketnum> It is the duty of the driver of an automobile on the public highway to run not onfy at a rate of speed permissible under the law, but at such speed as an ordinarily prudent and careful man would use under' the circumstances, having regard at all times to the danger of the situation and the probability of injuring others. The statute governing the speed of automobiles provides that nothing therein contained\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-9\">\u201cshall permit any person to drive a motor vehicle at a greater speed than is reasonable, having regard to the traffic, or so as to endanger the safety of any person or injure the property of any person.\u201d 28 <em>Del. Laws, </em>43; <em>Rev. Code, </em>\u00a7 4827.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number><bracketnum>[7]</bracketnum> The defendant has asked the court to charge you that a person\u2019s own memory of what he did or did not do, is ordinarily presumed to be more trustworthy than that of a mere observer; that the actor (meaning the driver of an automobile) usually knows better than the observer what he did or did not do, and his testimony is generally entitled to greater weight on that account. We decline to so charge, but say to you that the jury must be the judges of the reliability of the witnesses and of the value and weight of their testimony, having regard, among other things, to their opportunities for seeing, knowing and remembering the things about which they testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\"><bracketnum>[8]</bracketnum> Evidence of good character of the accused is to be taken in connection with all the other evidence and given such weight, under all the facts and circumstances, as the jury think it is entitled to.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Now, gentlemen, summarizing and simplifying, as much as we can, the law already stated, we say: If you believe from the testimony that at the time of the collision of the two automobiles the defendant was driving his car in violation of the statute that governs the speed of automobiles, and that such act was the cause of the death of Margaret Dyer, your verdict should be guilty. And even if you do not believe that the defendant, at the time of the collision, was running his car in violation of said speed statute, but are satisfied that the child\u2019s death was caused by gross negligence on the part of the defendant, your verdict should be guilty. If you are not satisfied that the defendant is guilty of manslaughter, but believe that he is, under the evidence, guilty of an assault, you may find him guilty of assault only.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\"><bracketnum>[9]</bracketnum> And we further instruct you that in this, as in every criminal <em>case,- </em>the defendant is presumed to be innocent until his guilt is proved to the satisfaction of the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. In order to convict the prisoner it is incumbent upon the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt every material ingredient of the crime charged. If, therefore, after carefully considering all the evidence in the case, you should entertain a reasonable doubt of his guilt, your verdict should be not guilty. But such a doubt must not be merely a vague, speculative or possible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>doubt, but a reasonable, substantial doubt remaining in your minds after a careful consideration of all the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">It is hardly necessary to say to men of your intelligence and fairness that this is an important case, both to the defendant and the people, and that the jury should be influenced in reaching their verdict by the law and the evidence, and by nothing else. If you are satisfied from the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, of the guilt of the accused, you should not hesitate for any reason to find him guilty, but if you are not so satisfied of his guilt, it is just as important that you should render a verdict of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Verdict, not guilty.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
