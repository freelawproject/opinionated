We think judgment should be so entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">This question is treated fully in <em>Woolley on Delaware Practice Sections </em>480 <em>and </em>481. We quote one paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-8\">\u201cWhen the plaintiff is ruled to file his replications to the defendant's pleas, even though they are all memoranda, he cannot ignore them, for then judgment would be taken against him for want of a replication, but he should plead to those which for his information need not be drawn out, and order the others drawn out before he pleads.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">Let judgment in favor of defendant below for want of a plea be entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
