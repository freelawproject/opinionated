Proof of these facts by the State would constitute an ownership in William Truxton Boyce and others in the com, alleged to have been stolen, sufficient to support an indictment for larceny of the corn.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">(The court gave the usual charge on the definition of larceny; reasonable doubt; conflicting testimony; circumstantial evidence; property recently stolen found in one\u2019s possession.)</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">The jury disagreed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
