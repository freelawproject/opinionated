D. 1918, Barnes, in their room, in the presence of, and with the knowledge and acquiescence of Rothman took a \u201cshot\u2019 \u2019 of heroin in his arm by means of a hypodermic needle which also belonged to Rothman. Barnes was not a licensed physician, nor did he have the authority of a certificate of a physician for procuring the heroin from Rothman.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-9\">It was shown by expert testimony that heroin is a compound or morphine.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ASz\">When the Deputy Attorney-General rested, counsel for the accused moved for binding instructions to the jury to return a verdict of not guilty on the ground that the State had failed to show that Rothman owned the heroin used by Barnes or that he either sold or disposed of heroin to Barnes. The case was submitted to the jury without further testimony after the charge of the court.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b239-11\">Boyce, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ADx\">charged the jury in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">Whoever has heroin in his possession and permits another, not being a licensed physician, or without the authority of a certificate of a duly licensed physician, to have or use heroin, unlawfully disposes of the same within legislative intendment. If you find from the evidence that Rothman owned and had heroin in his possession in the room occupied by him and Barnes, and knowingly in his presence permitted Barnes to use it in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>arm, then Rothman disposed of the poisonous drug within the meaning of and contrary to the statute. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Verdict guilty.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
