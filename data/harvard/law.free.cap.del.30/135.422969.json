D. 1916, brought to the defendant one Morgan, of the state of Maryland, as a purchaser for the farm, and to whom, on the same day, the defendant sold the farm for fifteen thousand dollars, five hundred dollars being paid down by check and the balance was to be paid on or before July first following. And in confirmation of the sale the defendant and M. entered into written agreements in duplicate\u2014one of which was retained by the defendant and the other was delivered to M., who, on the following day, stopped payment of the said check, and testified at the trial, in answer to the question, \u201cWhy was it you did not finally comply?\u201d \u201cWell, I just thought it was a little too much, more than I was able to shoulder, and I just stopped right there.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-4\">The defendant afterwards sued M. on the said check, in the courts in Maryland, and had a recovery for the full amount thereof; and waiting until after July first sold the farm to another.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-5\">Pursuant to previous notice, Mr. Handy for plaintiff, called upon Mr. Rodney, for defendant, to produce the said agreement of sale.

The objection was sustained. M. then testified that he did not have the duplicate copy of the contract, but according to his best recollection he had given the same to Mr. Barrall, his attorney in Maryland. The plaintiff, being called, testified that he had a few days before conversed with Mr. Barrall over the telephone, in Mr. Handy\u2019s office, and learned from Mr. Barrall that he would make a search for the contract, and if he could find it he would mail it to Mr. Handy in time for use at this trial, and that neither the contract nor any communication had been received from Mr. Barrall. It was again sought to prove the contents of said agreement by M. Objection was made on the ground that reasonable diligence of search for the paper had not been shown.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b149-9\">Boyce, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"Art\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The inquiry made of Mr. Barrall, and the reply received, do not show any search made by him for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>paper in question, or that it is not in his possession.

For this purpose, we overrule the objection. The witness may answer the question.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-9\">\u201cA. I told Mr. Barrall I was calling up about the paper Mr. Handy referred to last week in his office, and he said he had made a very careful search for it, but could not find it; that he did not write Mr. Handy, because he told him that if he found it he would send it to him, and not being able to find it he did not write; but if they wanted him he would come and testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-10\">\u201cQ.

The objection is overruled. Take the answer of the witness.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-14\">\u201cA. The agreement was drawn up by me between Mr. Morgan and Mr. Cleaver, and the purchase price for the farm was $15,000. Mr. Morgan paid $500 by check upon the signing of the agreement and the balance was to be paid at a certain time\u2014I don\u2019t recall the date. It was satisfactory to both of them, and they both signed it, and Mr. White signed it as a witness to their signatures.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>The defendant admitted that he agreed to pay the plaintiff three per cent, commission on the purchase price, if he succeeded in selling the farm; but he understood the agreement between them to mean that he would pay the commission when he had received the purchase price. He also stated that he accepted Mr. Morgan as the purchaser of the farm and as financially able to comply -with the terms of the contract of sale.</p>\n<author id=\"b151-4\">Boyce, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Av\">charging the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\"><bracketnum>[4, 5]</bracketnum> This action is brought by John Heldmyer, Jr., a real estate broker, against Henry Cleaver, for the recovery of compensation for services alleged to have been rendered by the plaintiff for the defendant in the sale of a certain farm. The plaintiff demands the sum of four hundred and fifty dollars, or three per cent, of the price for which he claims he effected the sale of the farm. When one employs another to do work for him, and the employe performs the work in accordance with the terms of the employment, the employe is entitled to receive the stipulated price, if such was agreed upon by the parties; or, if no stipulated price was agreed on, then he is entitled to recover such sum as the work is reasonably worth. To entitle a real estate broker to recover compensation for the sale of real estate of another, he must have been the agent of the seller, and he must have effected the sale \u00f3r conducted the negotiations to such a stage as to complete the bargain for the sale so far as it depended upon his action or efforts to accomplish the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\"><bracketnum>[6]</bracketnum> If, in this case, the plaintiff as the agent of the defendant brought Morgan and the defendant together, and if they came to an agreement for the sal\u00e9 and purchase of the farm, the right of the plaintiff to compensation for his services, in the absence of any misrepresentations as to the ability of the purchaser to comply with the terms of sale agreed upon, became established, though the purchaser subsequently refused to comply with the terms of the sale; for when the plaintiff brought to the defendant a purchaser willing and able to purchase the farm at the price authorized and agreed upon between the seller and the purchaser, the plaintiff\u2019s work was done and he became entitled to his compensation. And the purchaser\u2019s refusal to complete the purchase, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>without the fault of the plaintiff, will not prevent the latter from recovery of his compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\"><bracketnum>[7]</bracketnum> In respect to the question of the purchaser\u2019s ability to comply with the terms of sale, and whether any misrepresentations were, in fact, made by the plaintiff, are matters for the determination of the jury under the evidence before them.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">If you should be satisfied from a preponderance of the evidence that the plaintiff did perform the services which he had agreed to do for the defendant, then your verdict should be for the plaintiff for such sum as the defendant agreed to pay; or, if there was no specific sum agreed upon between the parties, then for such amount as you may find such services were reasonably worth. <em>Tebo v. </em>Mitchell, 5 <em>Pennewill </em>356, 63 <em>Atl. </em>327.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">Verdict for plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
