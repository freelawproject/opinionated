The specific question presented by Gilmer is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-5\">Is a nolle prosequi the equivalent of a \u201cdismissal\u201d for purposes of Criminal Procedure Article Section 6-218(b)(2) which requires a trial court to give credit at sentencing for pre-trial custody on an unrelated offense that results in a \u201cdismissal or acquittal\u201d where a warrant or commitment for the convicted offense was filed during that custody?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-6\"><em>Gilmer v. State, </em>387 Md. 122, 874 A.2d 917 (2005). We hold that, under the circumstances of this case, a nolle prosequi is the equivalent of a \u201cdismissal\u201d for the purpose of Section 6-218(b)(2) of the Criminal Procedure Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">On September 1, 2002, Anthony Gilmer was in pretrial detention at the Baltimore City Detention Center on a charge of attempted murder and had been at the Center since July 2, 2001, a period of 426 days. On September 1, 2002, Gilmer had an altercation with a fellow detainee, Jonathan Blue, over whose turn it was to use the telephone during \u201cpassive recreation\u201d time in the \u201cday room,\u201d a place where detainees are permitted to engage in activities such as playing cards, watching television, and using the telephone. Gilmer and Blue were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>separated but then permitted to return to the day room, where Gilmer and Blue continued to argue, and Gilmer, thereafter, repeatedly stabbed Blue with a silver lock blade knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Gilmer was charged -with attempted first degree murder in violation of Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Section 411A (b) of Article 27,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> first-degree assault in violation of Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Section 12A-1 of Article 27,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> openly wearing and carrying a dangerous and deadly weapon with the intent of causing injury in an unlawful manner in violation of Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Section 36 of Article 27,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> reckless endangerment in violation of Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Section 12A-2 of Article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>27,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> second-degree assault in violation of Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Section 12A of Article 27,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and attempted second-degree murder in violation of Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol), Section 411A (a) of Article 27.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">On June 13, 2003, a jury found Gilmer guilty of first and second-degree assault. At sentencing the Circuit Court judge merged the second degree assault into the first degree assault and sentenced Gilmer to fifteen years incarceration. The judge, however, refused to credit the 426 days of confinement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>that Gilmer had already served on the attempted murder charges that had been nolle prossed by the State prior to sentencing. Gilmer filed an unsuccessful motion for a new trial prior to noting an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">Before the Court of Special Appeals, Gilmer contended that the Circuit Court erred in refusing to give him credit for the time he had served in detention for the attempted murder charge, pursuant to Section 6 \u2014 218(b)(2) of the Criminal Procedure Article and that it also erred in refusing to ask a voir dire question that he had proposed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Gilmer v. State, </em>161 Md.App. 21, 24, 866 A.2d 918, 920 (2005). The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the denial of the time served credit decision of the trial court and held that a nolle prosequi is not a dismissal under the plain meaning of Section 6-218(b)(2), and therefore, Section 6-218(b)(3)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> was applicable, and that, pursuant to Section 6-218(b)(3), which allows the court to exercise its discretion in determining whether to grant credit, the judge did not abuse his discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 31, 866 A.2d at 924. To hold otherwise, it noted, could potentially result in double credit received by Gilmer for time served were he later prosecuted for the attempted murder charges. <em>Id. </em>at 29, 866 A.2d. at 923.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">The construction of Sections 6-218(b)(2) and (b)(3) of the Criminal Procedure Article implicate a <em>de novo </em>review. <em>Cain v. State, </em>386 Md. 320, 327, 872 A.2d 681, 685 (2005). Our goal, when interpreting statutes, is to \u201cidentify and effectuate the legislative intent underlying the statute(s) at issue.\u201d <em>Id.; Serio v. Baltimore County, </em>384 Md. 373, 863 A.2d 952, 962 (2004), quoting <em>Drew v. First Guaranty Mortgage Corp., </em>379 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Md. 318, 327, 842 A.2d 1, 6 (2003), in turn quoting <em>Derry v. State, </em>358 Md. 325, 335, 748 A.2d 478, 483 (2000); <em>Pete v. State, </em>384 Md. 47, 57-58, 862 A.2d 419, 425 (2004); <em>Graves v. State, </em>364 Md. 329, 346, 772 A.2d 1225, 1235 (2001). The best source of legislative intent is the statute\u2019s plain language, and when the language is clear and unambiguous, our inquiry ordinarily ends there. <em>Cain, </em>386 Md. at 327, 872 A.2d at 685; <em>Serio, </em>384 Md. at 373, 863 A.2d at 962; <em>Pete, </em>384 Md. at 57-58, 862 A.2d at 425; <em>Drew, </em>379 Md. at 327, 842 A.2d at 6; <em>Beyer v. Morgan State University, </em>369 Md. 335, 349, 800 A.2d 707, 715 (2002); <em>Whack v. State, </em>338 Md. 665, 672, 659 A.2d 1347, 1350 (1995). When there is more than one reasonable interpretation of a statute, however, the statute is ambiguous. <em>Moore v. State, </em>388 Md. 446, 453, 879 A.2d 1111, 1114 (2005); <em>Melton v. State, </em>379 Md. 471, 476-77, 842 A.2d 743, 746 (2004). When the statutory language is ambiguous, we resolve that ambiguity in light of the legislative intent, considering the legislative history, case law, and statutory purpose. <em>See Moore, </em>388 Md. at 453, 879 A.2d at 1114; <em>Deville v. State, </em>383 Md. 217, 223, 858 A.2d 484, 487 (2004); <em>Melton, </em>379 Md. at 476-77, 842 A.2d at 746. \u201cWe consider not only the ordinary meaning of the words, but also how that language relates to the overall meaning, setting, and purpose of the act.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>388 Md. at 453, 879 A.2d at 1114; <em>Deville, </em>383 Md. at 223, 858 A.2d at 487. The statute\u2019s provisions must be read in \u201ca commonsensical perspective to avoid a farfetched interpretation.\u201d <em>Cain, </em>386 Md. at 328, 872 A.2d at 685, <em>Serio, </em>384 Md. at 373, 863 A.2d at 962; <em>Graves, </em>364 Md. at 346, 772 A.2d at 1235; <em>Frost v. State, </em>336 Md. 125, 137, 647 A.2d 106, 112 (1994); <em>Dickerson v. State, </em>324 Md. 163, 171, 596 A.2d 648, 652 (1991). We construe the statute as a whole so that no word, clause, sentence, or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless, or nugatory. <em>Moore, </em>388 Md. at 453, 879 A.2d at 1115; <em>Comptroller v. Phillips, </em>384 Md. 583, 865 A.2d 590 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Gilmer contends that Section 6 \u2014 218(b)(2) is ambiguous because it does not define the term \u201cdismissal.\u201d He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>contends that, based on the two purposes set forth by the Legislature in enacting Section 6-218 of the Criminal Procedure Article, namely to avoid \u201cbanked time\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and to eliminate \u201cdead time,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> it is only proper that the word \u201cdismissal\u201d in Section 6 \u2014 218(b)(2) of the Criminal Procedure Article be interpreted to include disposition of a case by nolle prosequi, even in the absence of a plea bargain relating to the charge, so that the trial judge was required to give him credit for the time he served in pre-trial detention for attempted murder. Additionally, he argues, Maryland Rule 4-247 makes clear that a nolle prosequi is a dismissal, and, the fact that a charge or charges can still be prosecuted after being nolle prossed is not dispositive because a dismissal also may permit prosecution. By enacting Section 6 \u2014 218(b)(2), Gilmer asserts that Maryland created a liberty interest<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> for him to obtain credit for his time served and that denying him credit for time served is denying a right protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">The State, conversely, contends that the Circuit Court properly exercised its discretion under Section 6 \u2014 218(b)(3) in refusing to award Gilmer credit for his time served on the nolle prossed attempted murder charge because the plain meaning of Section 6-218(b)(2) refers only to an acquittal or dismissal, whereas Section 6 \u2014 218(b)(3) refers to any case \u201cother than a case described in paragraph (2).\u201d The State argues that only a nolle prosequi entered as part of a plea agreement is the equivalent of a dismissal because the nolle prosequi then has the effect of precluding future prosecution and that to allow any nolle prosequi to constitute a dismissal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>could create a windfall of double credit for the defendant if he or she were ever convicted of the initial offense which was originally nolle prossed. The State asserts that Section 6-218(b)(2) is clear; it does not list nolle prosequi, and thus, to interpret the word \u201cdismissal\u201d to include nolle prosequi would thereby render Section 6-218(b)(3) a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">A. Section 6-218(b)(2) &amp; (3)</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">The precursor of Sections 6-218(a) and (b) was Section 638C(a) of Article 27, which was enacted by the General Assembly in 1974, and provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-7\">Any person who is convicted and sentenced shall receive credit against the term of a definite or life sentence or credit against the minimum and maximum terms of an indictment sentence for all time spent in the custody of any state, county or city jail, correctional institution, hospital, mental hospital or other agency as a result of the charge for which sentence is imposed or as a result of the conduct on which the charge is based, and the term of a definite or life sentence or the minimum and maximum terms of an indeterminate sentence shall be diminished thereby. <em>In any case where a person has been in custody due to a charge that culminated in a distnissal or acquittal, the amount of time that woidd have been credited, against a sentence for the change, had one been imposed, shall be credited against any sentence that is based, upon a charge for which a warrant or commitment was lodged during the pendency of such custody. In all other cases, the sentencing court shall have the discretion to apply credit against a sentence for time spent in custody for another charge or offense.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">1974 Md. Laws, Chap. 735, \u00a7 1 (emphasis added). The preamble for the Bill established that its purpose was \u201cfor providing that under certain circumstances persons shall receive credit against their sentences for any time spent in custody.\u201d 1974 Md. Laws, Chap. 735, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">In 1981 legislation was enacted to clarify that \u201cthe concept of giving credit against sentence for time spent in custody does not apply to a parolee who commits a subsequent offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>and is incarcerated prior to the date on which he is sentenced for the subsequent offense.\u201d 1981 Md. Laws, Chap. 721. The language added to the end of Section 638C (a) read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-4\">This section does not apply to a parolee who is returned to the custody of the Division of Correction as a result of a subsequent offense and is incarcerated prior to the date on which he is sentenced for the subsequent offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">1981 Md. Laws, Chap. 721.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">In <em>Fleeger v. State, </em>301 Md. 155, 482 A.2d 490 (1984), we recognized that one purpose for Section 638C (a) was to avoid \u201cbanked time,\u201d a \u201creserve of time established when a defendant spends time in custody that is not yet but may be credited against a valid sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 163, 482 A.2d at 494. Another purpose for enacting Section 638C(a) was to eliminate \u201cdead\u201d time, \u201ctime spent in custody that will not be credited to any valid sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 165, 482 A.2d at 495. We explained that Section 638C addressed the problem of \u201cdead\u201d time</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">by authorizing mandatory credit for any time spent in custody while awaiting trial on an offense for which the defendant is ultimately convicted. The statute also seeks to eliminate dead time that results when a defendant is in custody on one crime but is ultimately convicted of another. By enacting \u00a7 638C(a), the General Assembly sought to ensure that a defendant receive <em>as much credit as possible for time spent in custody </em>as is consistent with constitutional and practical considerations. An obvious corollary is that the General Assembly sought to minimize the amount of dead time. Simply stated, we believe that no legitimate legislative policy is advanced by maximizing dead time or by withholding credit that is due a defendant under the crediting statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 165, 482 A.2d at 495 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">In 2001, Section 638C (a) was recodified as Sections 6-218(a) and (b) of the Criminal Procedure Article, 2001 Md. Laws, Chap. 10, \u00a7 2, which now provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>(a) This section does not apply to a parolee who is returned to the custody of the Division of Correction because of a subsequent crime and is confined before being sentenced for the subsequent crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-5\">(b) (1) A defendant who is convicted and sentenced shall receive credit against and a reduction of the term of a definite or life sentence, or the minimum and maximum terms of an indeterminate sentence, for all time spent in the custody of a state correctional facility, local correctional facility, hospital, facility for persons with mental disorders, or other unit because of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-6\">(i) the charge for which the sentence is imposed; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-7\">(ii) the conduct on which the charge is based.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-8\">(2) If a defendant is in custody because of a charge that results in a dismissal or acquittal, the time that would have been credited if a sentence had been imposed shall be credited against any sentence that is based on a charge for which a warrant or commitment was filed during that custody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-9\">(8) In a case other than a case described in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the sentencing court may apply credit against a sentence for time spent in custody for another charge or crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">The issue before us is whether, like the Court of Special Appeals, we adopt a plain meaning analysis of Section 6-218(b)(2) and determine that the mandatory credit for time served does not apply because the term \u201cnolle prosequi\u201d is absent, or, whether we construe Section 6-218(b)(2) as ambiguous. The decision whether to utilize a plain meaning analysis or an analysis based upon the ambiguity of a statute is made first by looking to see whether the Legislature has provided a definition for the term in question. <em>Deville, </em>383 Md. at 229, 858 A.2d at 491 (\u201cthe legislative history of [the statute] fails to provide an actual definition.\u201d); <em>Melton, </em>379 Md. at 489, 842 A.2d at 753 (holding that the statute was ambiguous because it \u201cprovides no definition of the term \u2018violation,\u2019 and provides no specific direction as to the proper unit of prosecution.\u201d). If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>there is no definition, we then ask whether there is more than one reasonable interpretation of the statutory language. If there is, the statutory language is ambiguous. <em>Moore, </em>388 Md. at 453, 879 A.2d at 1114 (\u201cWhen there is more than one reasonable interpretation of the statute, the statute is ambiguous.\u201d); <em>Deville, </em>383 Md. at 223, 858 A.2d at 487 (\u201cA statute is ambiguous when there are two or more reasonable alternative interpretations of the statute.\u201d); <em>Melton, </em>379 Md. at 476-77, 842 A.2d at 746 (\u201cWe have said that ambiguity exists within a statute when there are \u2018two or more reasonable alternative interpretations of the statute.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Price v. State, </em>378 Md. 378, 387, 835 A.2d 1221, 1226 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">In this case, Section 6-218(b)(2) provides no definition for the term \u201cdismissal.\u201d Moreover, the term \u201cdismissal\u201d has different meanings, depending on whether the dismissal is entered with or without prejudice as explicated by the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Parks v. State, </em>41 Md.App. 381, 397 A.2d 212 (1979), <em>aff'd, </em>287 Md. 11, 410 A.2d 597 (1980):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-6\">The words \u2018with prejudice,\u2019 when used in that context, have, of course, a well-established meaning in the law. They signify that the dismissal is final, that the controversy is concluded and cannot be reopened by a new or subsequent action. A dismissal \u2018with prejudice\u2019 has been held to be as conclusive of the rights of the parties as if the action had been prosecuted to a final adjudication on the merits adverse to the complainant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-7\"><em>Parks, </em>41 Md.App. at 386, 397 A.2d at 215 (citations omitted). Later in the opinion, reflecting upon a change in the law under consideration from a dismissal with prejudice to a dismissal without prejudice, the court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-8\">[T]he General Assembly has made clear its intent that such a dismissal for failure to comply with the requirements of the Act should serve only to terminate that particular action and not to preclude another. That is what is meant by the phrase \u2018without prejudice.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 388, 397 A.2d at 217 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">The term \u201cdismissal\u201d in Section 6-218(b)(2), therefore, absent qualifying language of with or without prejudice, reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>ably can be interpreted in either of two ways: one in which the unrelated offense may not be re-prosecuted, or the other in which the unrelated offense subsequently may be prosecuted. As a result, Section 6 \u2014 218(b)(2) is ambiguous insofar as what constitutes \u201cdismissal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">B. Nolle Prosequi</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Section l-101(k) of the Criminal Procedure Article provides: \u201cNolle prosequi\u201d means a formal entry on the record by the State that declares the State\u2019s intention not to prosecute a charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">Rule 4-247 of the Maryland Rules entitled \u201cNolle Prosequi\u201d governs the disposition of charges by nolle prosequi and its effect, and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-8\">(a) Disposition by Nolle Prosequi. The State\u2019s Attorney may terminate a prosecution on a charge and dismiss the charge by entering a nolle prosequi on the record in open court. The defendant need not be present in court when the nolle prosequi is entered, but in that event the clerk shall send notice to the defendant, if the defendant\u2019s whereabouts are known, and to the defendant\u2019s attorney of record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-9\">(b) Effect of Nolle Prosequi. When a nolle prosequi has been entered on a charge, any conditions of pretrial release on that charge are terminated, and any bail posted for the defendant on that charge shall be released. The clerk shall take the action necessary to recall or revoke any outstanding warrant or detainer that could lead to the arrest or detention of the defendant because of that charge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">We had the opportunity to review the history of nolle prosequi in <em>Ward v. State, </em>290 Md. 76, 82-84, 427 A.2d 1008, 1012-14 (1981), in which Judge John C. Eldridge wrote for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-11\">Apparently the first reported case discussing the entry of a nolle prosequi in a criminal prosecution was <em>Stretton and Taylors Case, </em>1 Leon. 119, 74 Eng. Rep. 111 (K.B.1588), where the Attorney General entered a <em>\u2018non vult prosequi </em>\u2019 for purpose of preventing a private prosecution. Since that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>time, the nolle prosequi has been a means whereby the government exercises control over pending criminal cases. Thus ... a <em>\u2018Nolle prosequi </em>in criminal practice (for it pertains also to civil), is a declaration of record from the legal representative for the government, that he will no further prosecute the particular indictment or some designated part thereof.\u2019 It is \u2018an abandonment of the prosecution,\u2019 or a \u2018discontinuance of a prosecution by the authorized attorney\u2019 for the state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">It has been settled since at least the opinion of Chief Justice Hold in <em>Goddard v. Smith, </em>6 Mod. 262, 2 Salk 456 (1704), that while a nolle prosequi discharges the defendant on the charging document or count which was nolle prossed, and while it is a bar to any further prosecution under <em>that </em>charging document or count, a nolle prosequi is <em>not </em>an acquittal or pardon of the underlying offense and does not preclude a prosecution for the same offense under a different charging document or different count. More than one hundred years ago, this Court stated in <em>State v. Morgan, </em>33 Md. 44, 46 (1870):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-6\">\u2018It is well settled by the authorities that a <em>nolle prosequi </em>ordinarily does not operate as a pardon; but that the accused remains subject to be proceeded against by another indictment for the same offense.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">Later, in <em>Barrett v. State, supra, </em>155 Md. 636, 142 A. 96 [1928], the Court reiterated that when an indictment was nolle prossed or abandoned, \u2018the case was terminated ... and there can be no further prosecution under that indictment,\u2019 but that the discontinuance by the prosecuting attorney was not the equivalent of \u2018confessing a plea of not guilty.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">(citations omitted) (alterations added). Obviously the type of nolle prosequi which does not bar future prosecution under another charging document has the same effect as a dismissal without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>We also have explored circumstances within which entry of a nolle prosequi precludes future prosecution. Under circumstances where conditions have been attached to the nolle prosequi requiring actions by the defendant, and those conditions have been met, the nolle prosequi has the same effect as a dismissal with prejudice. The underlying facts in <em>State v. Morgan, </em>33 Md. 44, 46 (1870), involved the entry of a nolle prosequi by the Governor on behalf of the defendant in exchange for payment of costs accrued. 33 Md. at 45. We held that after the Governor\u2019s terms were met, and the costs were paid, the defendant was \u201cexpressly saved from all further prosecution for or on account of the same offense\u201d and the discharge by nolle prosequi was a final \u201cend and determination\u201d of the suit. <em>Id. </em>at 46. In <em>State v. Brockman, </em>277 Md. 687, 700, 357 A.2d 376, 384 (1976), we held that the State was precluded from withdrawing its plea agreement where the defendant had already substantially performed the terms of the agreement and that the defendant could elect to have the charges nolle prossed without any reprosecution. We reinforced our <em>Brockman </em>holding in <em>Fleeger, </em>where we noted that, provided the defendant complied with the terms of the plea agreement, the State could not reinstitute the original, nolle prossed charges. <em>Fleeger, </em>301 Md. at 162, 482 A.2d at 494. We held in <em>Fleeger </em>that a nolle prosequi constitutes a dismissal under Section 638C (a) when it is entered into pursuant to a plea agreement, so that the defendant was entitled to credit served for time served under the nolle prossed charges. <em>Id. </em>at 162, 482 A.2d at 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">We have also found that a nolle prosequi can function as an acquittal if jeopardy has attached. In <em>Blondes v. State, </em>273 Md. 435, 330 A.2d 169 (1975), the State entered a nolle prosequi on all charges under the indictment after it had asked for a ruling on admissibility of the chief documentary evidence against the defendant and offered other documentary evidence against the defendant and testimony of a witness in a non-jury case. <em>Id. </em>at 446, 330 A.2d at 175. In finding that jeopardy had attached at the time that the nolle prosequi was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>entered, Judge Eldridge, again writing for the Court, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-5\">One aspect of the double jeopardy prohibition which is firmly settled in this state as a common law principle, is that the entry of a <em>nolle prosequi, </em>without the defendant\u2019s consent, and after jeopardy has attached, operates as an acquittal and precludes further prosecution for the same offense</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-6\">On the other hand, where a <em>nolle prosequi </em>is entered before jeopardy attaches, the State is only precluded from prosecuting the defendant further under that indictment, but the defendant may be proceeded against for the same offense by another indictment or information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 443-44, 330 A.2d at 173 (citations omitted); <em>see also Hooper v. State, </em>293 Md. 162, 169 n. 3, 443 A.2d 86, 90 n. 3 (1982) (\u201c[I]f jeopardy had attached at the trial, the nol pros on appeal will ordinarily operate as an acquittal of the underlying charges because of double jeopardy principles.\u201d); <em>Ward, </em>290 Md. at 91, 427 A.2d at 1017 (\u201c[A] nolle prosequi, without the defendant\u2019s consent and after jeopardy attaches, \u2018amounts to an acquittal\u2019 of the underlying offense.\u201d); <em>Friend v. State, </em>175 Md. 352, 356, 2 A.2d 430 (1938) (\u201cThe <em>nolle prosequi </em>entered without the consent of the accused ... placed this defendant in double jeopardy.\u201d); <em>cf. Bynum v. State, </em>277 Md. 703, 709, 357 A.2d 339, 342 (1976) (holding that, although double jeopardy prohibited subsequent prosecution for offenses charged in counts dismissed by a nolle prosequi entered without the consent of the accused after jeopardy has attached, it had no application in the context of the same prosecution which continues on other counts).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">C. Nolle Prosequi as Dismissal</p>\n<p id=\"b806-9\">The State contends that, based on our interpretation of the word \u201cdismissal\u201d in <em>Director of Finance of Prince George\u2019s Co. v. Cole, </em>296 Md. 607, 465 A.2d 450 (1983), a nolle prosequi does not constitute a dismissal. In <em>Cole, </em>we addressed the meaning of the word \u201cdismissal\u201d in a forfeiture statute, Maryland Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>(1957, 1996 Rep.Vol.), Article 27, Section 264(e)(4),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-5\">This Section does not prohibit the trial judge after an acquittal or dismissal from ordering immediate return of all property seized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">We recognized in <em>Cole </em>that Section 264 was originally enacted in 1951 as Article 27, Section 307A, 1951 Md. Laws, Chap. 299 and was significantly amended in 1974 at which time the word \u201cdismissal\u201d was substituted for the phrase \u201cother final determination of such proceedings in favor of the person or persons so arrested,\u201d 1974 Md. Laws, Chap. 666, thereby referring to a dismissal with prejudice. We noted in <em>Cole </em>that through its amendment the Legislature explicitly eliminated \u201cother arguably favorable dispositions\u201d such as a nolle prosequi. <em>Cole, </em>296 Md. at 624, 465 A.2d at 460. There is no comparable legislative history in the case <em>sub judice </em>limiting the term \u201cdismissal\u201d to only one of a final determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">The State also underscores the reasoning underlying the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s holding that the General Assembly was aware of the existence of disposition of a case by nolle prosequi in 1974 when Section 638C(a) was enacted and, therefore, it would have included nolle prosequi in the statute had it so intended. This argument neglects the fact that the Legislature, had it wanted only dismissals with prejudice to trigger the mandatory provisions of Section 638C(a), could have done so by using the term \u201cdismissal with prejudice\u201d in 1974 when it was enacted. We know that the Legislature knew of the term dismissal with prejudice at that time because it used the term in its 1965 enactment of the Interstate Detainer Act, specifically in Article 27, Section 616A(c), which read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-8\">If action is not commenced on the matter for which request for disposition was made, within the time limitation set forth in subsection (a) and above, the court shall no longer have jurisdiction thereof, and the untried indictment shall have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>no further force or effect; and in such case the court shall enter an order dismissing the untried indictment <em>with prejudice.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">1965 Md. Laws, Chap. 628 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Furthermore, when Section 616A(c) of the Interstate Detainer Act was recodified in 1976 as Article 27, Section 616S(e), it read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-7\">If the untried indictment, information, warrant, or complaint, for which request for disposition is made, is not brought to trial within the time limitation set forth in subsection (b) of this section, the court no longer has jurisdiction, and the untried indictment, information, warrant, or complaint has no further force or effect. In that case, the court upon request of the prisoner or his counsel shall enter an order dismissing the untried indictment <em>without prejudice.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">Md.Code (1957, 1996 Rep. Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 616S(e) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Therefore, in 2001, when Section 6-218(b)(2) was recodified, the General Assembly clearly knew the distinction between with and without prejudice and could have drawn that distinction in the statutory language at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">When faced with circumstances where the Legislature was familiar with certain language and did not entertain it, we look to the purpose of the statute. <em>See State v. Thompson, </em>332 Md. 1,19, 629 A.2d 731, 740-41 (1993) (holding that, based on the statute\u2019s purpose and its legislative history, the legislature would have included specific language regarding drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>rehabilitation if it had meant to include it.). As we stated earlier, the purpose for enacting Section 6-218 was to ensure that a defendant \u201creceive as much credit as possible for time spent in custody.\u201d <em>Fleeger, </em>301 Md. at 165, 482 A.2d at 495. Viewed in this light, the term \u201cdismissal,\u201d as used in Section 6-218(b)(2), must be interpreted to include dismissal with or without prejudice, including disposition by nolle prosequi.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">The State relies on <em>Roberts v. State, </em>56 Md.App. 562, 468 A.2d 410 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>299 Md. 426, 474 A.2d 219 (1984), for its argument that a nolle prosequi, not entered into pursuant to a plea agreement, lacks the finality of a dismissal or acquittal. In <em>Roberts, </em>the defendant challenged denial of credit for time he had served on handgun charges that had been stetted during sentencing for larceny convictions, credit which he argued was owed pursuant to Section 638C(a). <em>Id. </em>at 565, 468 A.2d at 412.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Court of Special Appeals explained in <em>Roberts </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-6\">The purpose of the language in question in \u00a7 638C (a) is to give credit for time spent in custody when there is no other way to credit that time. If an accused is acquitted of a charge for which he had been incarcerated, or if such charge is dismissed, he can never be credited with the time spent in custody against his sentence for that offense because there will be no sentence. But if, while he is incarcerated under one charge, another charge is lodged against him, in the event of an acquittal under the first charge, time spent in custody thereunder can be credited against any sentence imposed on the second.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>The situation for which the statute was designed to provide relief does not exist when the first charge is merely stetted because that charge may be eventually tried and may result in conviction and sentence. In such case, the accused will then be credited with the time spent in custody as a result of that charge. If appellant\u2019s reading of the statute were correct, should the handgun charge ever be tried and result in a conviction and sentence, he would be entitled to receive credit for time in custody thereon against the sentence that was re-imposed for violation of probation. We do not believe the General Assembly intended such a result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 566-67, 468 A.2d at 412 (footnote omitted). This Court has stated many times before, however, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-6\">In Maryland, unlike some other jurisdictions, we have consistently drawn a sharp distinction between a nolle prosequi and a stet. Although a stet permits an accused to be proceeded against at a later date under the same charging document, a nolle prosequi does not. The nol pros of a charging document or of a count is \u2018a final disposition\u2019 of the charging document or count; \u2018there can be no further prosecution under\u2019 the nol prossed charging document or count; the matter is \u2018terminated\u2019 at that time; and the accused may be proceeded against for the same offense only under a new or different charging document or count.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-7\"><em>State v. Moulden, </em>292 Md. 666, 673, 441 A.2d 699, 702-03 (1982) (citations omitted). Whereas a stet is a mere suspension of the charges which can be freely brought again by the prosecution within one year, a nolle prosequi \u201cleaves the prosecution just as though no such count had ever been inserted in the indictment,\u201d <em>id., </em>and removes the accused from \u201cunder the imputation of guilt.\u201d <em>Barrett, </em>155 Md. at 638, 142 A. at 97. Accordingly, the analysis of the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Roberts </em>is not applicable in the case <em>sub judice </em>because it is clear that a nolle prosequi, unlike a stet, can act with the finality of a dismissal or acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">The State also asserts that if a nolle prosequi is included in the purview of dismissal for purposes of Section 6-218(b)(2), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>Gilmer could be awarded a potential windfall of double credit for time served on the nolle prossed charges were he prosecuted and convicted on them and again credited for the time served. Double credit, however, is not in issue because receiving credit for time served for the attempted murder can only occur once under the statute. More importantly, denying a defendant credit for time served on nolle prossed charges is not consistent with the legislative purpose for enacting Section 6-218, to ensure that \u201ca defendant receive as much credit as possible for time spent in custody.\u201d <em>Fleeger, </em>301 Md. at 165, 482 A.2d at 495. The risk of double credit can be easily avoided administratively, whereas the elimination of \u201cdead time\u201d is an essential attribute of Section 6 \u2014 218(b)(2). The State\u2019s argument about double credit is not persuasive.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Accordingly, we hold that a nolle prosequi entered outside of a plea agreement constitutes a dismissal for the purpose of receiving credit for time served under Section 6 \u2014 218(b)(2), and the Circuit Court erred in denying Gilmer credit for the time served for the nolle prossed charge.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS VACATED AS TO THE SENTENCE IMPOSED ON THE CONVICTION FOR FIRST-DEGREE ASSAULT, AND CASE REMANDED TO THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO VACATE THE SENTENCE IMPOSED BY THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY ON THE FIRST-DEGREE ASSAULT </em>\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>\n<em>CONVICTION AND REMAND THE CASE TO THAT COURT FOR RESENTENCING PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.

The Majority opinion errs when it declares ambiguous the use of \u201cdismissal\u201d in \u00a7 6-218(b)(2) based only on consideration of that word in isolation. Though it pays lip service to considering the need to \u201cconstrue the statute as a whole\u201d (Maj. op. at 663, 887 A.2d at 553), the Majority opinion thereafter confines its analysis to (b)(2) and fails to give meaningful consideration to the place \u201cdismissal\u201d occupies within the complete structure of the Legislature\u2019s scheme in the larger statutory sub-section of which (b)(2) is but a part. <em>See Johnson v. Mayor &amp; City Council, 387 </em>Md. 1, 11-12, 874 A.2d 439, 446 (2005) (\u201cthe commonsensical approach to interpreting statutes includes a review of the general statutory scheme in which the statute in question is found,\u201d citing to <em>Frost v. State, </em>336 Md. 125, 137-38, 647 A.2d 106, 112 (1994)); <em>Forbes v. Harleysville Mutual, </em>322 Md. 689, 697-99, 589 A.2d 944, 947-48 (1991) (stating that we do not read statutory language \u201cin insolation or out of context [but construe it] in light of the Legislature\u2019s general purpose and in the context of the statute as a whole.\u201d). When considered in the clear hierarchy established within the totality of \u00a7 6-218(b), the claimed ambiguity in (b)(2) disappears.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Section 6-218(b) of the Criminal Procedure Article provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-8\">\u00a7 6-218. Credit against sentence for time</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-9\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-10\">(b) (1) A defendant who is convicted and sentenced shall receive credit against and a reduction of the term of a definite or life sentence, or the minimum and maximum terms of an indeterminate sentence, for all time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>spent in the custody of a correctional facility, hospital, facility for persons with mental disorders, or other unit because of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-5\">(i) The charge for which the sentence is imposed; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-6\">(ii) The conduct on Which the charge is based.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-7\">(2) <em>If a defendant is in custody because of a charge that results in a dismissal or acquittal, </em>the time that would have been accredited if a sentence had been imposed shall be credited against any sentence that is based on a charge for which a warrant or commitment was filed during that custody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-8\">(3) <em>In a, case other than a case described in paragraph (2) of this subsection, </em>the sentencing court may apply credit against a sentence for time spent in custody for another charge or crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">It is clear to me from this language that the Legislature intended that trial judges are obliged to grant credit against time served where the relevant charge was disposed of by literal dismissal or acquittal only. In all other cases and by whatever the descriptive name given for the particular disposition, other than by dismissal or acquittal, discretion was granted to judges whether to grant such credit. The only situation in which an ambiguity in the intent of the Legislature might arise would be where a trial court labels a disposition, other than dismissal or acquittal, with a description that constitutes a novelty or gibberish not previously recognized by statute, rule, or common law. Then, and only then, would the functional equivalency type of analysis engaged in here by the Majority be merited. <em>See State v. Glass, </em>386 Md. 401, 410, <em>872 </em>A.2d 729, 734 (2005) (a court\u2019s analysis \u201cmust be undertaken from a commonsensical rather than a technical ] perspective, always seeking to avoid giving the statute a strained interpretation.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-11\">The Court of Special Appeals was correct in this case, in my view, when it said:</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>Our decision is in accord with the plain language of \u00a7 6-218(b). Subsection (b)(2) uses the terms dismissal and acquittal, not <em>nolle prosequi. </em>We are bound to give these terms their ordinarily understood meaning. <em>See Gillespie v. State, </em>370 Md. 219, 222, 804 A.2d 426 (2002). Certainly, the General Assembly could have mandated that credit be given for time served on charges that result in a <em>nolle prosequi. </em>That the legislature chose not to do so when it enacted the credit provision thirty years ago, see 1974 Maryland Laws, Ch. 735 \u00a7 1, and has taken no steps since then to mandate credit for incarceration on charges that are <em>not prossed </em>in the ordinary course (as opposed to part of a plea bargain), reflects the legislative will to limit the applicability of that subsection. Any effort on our part to overread the statute would be to venture impermissibly into territory that is under the exclusive control of the General Assembly. <em>See Price v. State, </em>378 Md. 378, 388, 835 A.2d 1221 (2003) (\u201c \u2018[w]e cannot assume authority to read into the Act what the Legislature apparently deliberately left out\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">In sum, like the stet discussed in <em>Roberts, [v. State, </em>56 Md.App. 562, 468 A.2d 410 (1983) ] a <em>nolle prosequi </em>entered before trial and not tied to a plea bargain comes within the purview, not of \u00a7 6 \u2014 218(b)(2), but of subsection (b)(3), because it is \u201ca case other than a case described in paragraph (2) of this subsection.\u201d In that instance, subsection (b)(3) gives the court discretion to \u201capply credit against a sentence for time spent in custody for another charge or crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ALj\">Here, the sentencing court exercised its discretion not to award appellant credit for the time he was incarcerated on the <em>nol prossed </em>charged. Appellant suggests no abuse of discretion in this regard, and we find none. We shall not disturb that sentencing decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\"><em>Gilmer v. State, </em>161 Md.App. 21, 31, 866 A.2d 918, 924 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">To reason as this Court\u2019s Majority does, in my view, is to render \u00a7 6-218(b)(3) surplusage. <em>See Montgomery County v. Buckman, </em>333 Md. 516, 524, 636 A.2d 448, 452 (1994) (we read the statute so that \u201cno word, phrase, clause or sentence is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>rendered surplusage or meaningless.\u201d). Section 6-218(b)(3) is intended to operate as a catchall default provision for any disposition other than a literal dismissal or acquittal. To construe, through forced elaboration, a <em>nolle prosequi </em>entered outside of a plea agreement as the functional equivalent of a \u201cdismissal\u201d under (b)(2) is to deprive (b)(3) of its intended significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">Accordingly, I would affirm the judgments of the Court of Special Appeals and the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
