Harvey, a father who reunited with four of his children, to have a Maryland court extinguish, or, in the alternative, direct the Child Support Enforcement Administration (\u201cCSEA\u201d) to forgive, child support arrearages he owes that accumulated before he obtained custody of the children. In resolving this case, we are called upon to examine whether a court may eliminate completely child support arrearages in light of the statutory prohibition on the retrospective modification of child support orders. We also must determine whether the CSEA is bound to apply the familiar \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard in deciding, pursuant to its statutory discretion, whether to forgive child support arrearages, and whether the agency\u2019s refusal to exercise that discretion in the father\u2019s favor, because of financial and administrative considerations affecting the State\u2019s child welfare program, was \u201carbitrary or capricious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">Derek T. Harvey obtained physical custody of his three youngest children, Dereka, Robin, and Derek, Jr., when they came to live with him in Baltimore City in the fall of 1996 after their mother became unable to care properly for them. Later that year, Harvey\u2019s eldest daughter, Keawoni, came to live with him due to the death of her mother and the subsequent inability of her grandparents to care for her. At the same time, Harvey also opened his household to Keawoni\u2019s half-sister, Kelly Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">Harvey\u2019s child support obligations arose from consent paternity decrees issued by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City in 1986 and 1989 establishing Harvey as the biological father of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>the pertinent children.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Prior to Harvey gaining custody of the children, Robin Laverne Marshall, the mother of Dereka, Robin, and Derek, Jr., applied for welfare assistance because she was not receiving the child support Harvey was ordered to pay. As a condition of receiving welfare assistance, Ms. Marshall was required to initiate child support proceedings and assign the children\u2019s support rights to the State.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rita Williams, the mother of Keawoni, also assigned her child support rights to the State as a condition of receiving welfare assistance. During the period the children were in the custody of their mothers, Harvey accumulated significant child support arrearages as the result of his nonpayment of the court-ordered child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Soon after the children joined his household, Harvey, on several occasions, informed officials at the Baltimore City Office of Child Support Enforcement (\u201cBCOCSE\u201d) that the children were now in his physical custody. At all times relevant to these proceedings, BCOCSE was operated by MAXIMUS, Inc. (\u201cMAXIMUS\u201d), a private corporation under contract with the CSEA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Harvey hoped that by notifying BCOCSE of this change in custody, he might persuade BCOCSE to close his child support cases and forgive his accumulated arrearages. Harvey\u2019s informal attempts, however, met with no success. After one meeting with a case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>manager in July 2000 at the offices of BCOCSE, in which Harvey once again explained the changed circumstances with regard to his children, he allegedly was informed by the case manager \u201cthat the situation would be taken care of.\u201d Despite this assurance, BCOCSE continued to enforce Harvey\u2019s child support obligations, charging him for his current support, reporting his alleged arrearages to credit reporting agencies, and intercepting several of his tax refund checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">Also in July 2000, Harvey approached the Baltimore City office of the Legal Aid Bureau, Inc. (\u201cLegal Aid\u201d) seeking assistance with regard to his attempts to reduce or eliminate his child support obligations and arrearages. In the spring of 2001, with the assistance of Legal Aid, Harvey was successful in diverting his then-ongoing child support obligation toward his arrearages. Harvey, however, continued to encounter difficulties from BCOCSE in achieving forgiveness of his arrearages.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Frustrated with BCOCSE, Harvey switched his focus to the CSEA, BCOCSE\u2019s parent agency. In a 4 June 2001 letter, Legal Aid made a formal request to the CSEA for \u201cforgiveness or abatement\u201d of Harvey\u2019s arrearages and current support obligations. The letter advised the CSEA that, as of May 2001, Harvey owed approximately $32,000 in two cases, of which all but $1600 was owed to the State. Legal Aid argued that, although the funds sought by BCOCSE would be used to reimburse the State for past welfare support of the affected children, the current and future best interests of Harvey\u2019s children would be served by allowing Harvey to apply current and future income, including $57 subtracted from his paycheck each week, to the future support and upbringing of his children now in his custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">In a 6 July 2001 letter, Teresa L. Kaiser, executive director of the CSEA, informed Legal Aid that the CSEA would consider exercising its statutory discretion to eliminate or reduce Harvey\u2019s child support arrearages owed to the State. The letter, however, stated that, in order to do so, Harvey would need to provide BCOCSE with evidence confirming the length of his physical custody of the children. In response, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Harvey provided documentation, including school records and documents relating to an investigation of Ms. Marshall for fraudulent receipt of welfare benefits, establishing that the children had lived with him since 1996. Harvey also procured and delivered to BCOCSE a court order, issued 20 November 2001 by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, granting him legal custody of the four children, and made retrospectively effective as of 1 October 1996. The order also terminated Harvey\u2019s ongoing child support obligations and eliminated any arrearages accruing after 1 October 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">In a memorandum, dated 6 March 2002, to Dwayne Brown, project director of BCOCSE, Ms. Kaiser acknowledged receipt of the 20 November 2001 court order and proposed that BCOCSE take the following actions with regards to the enforcement of the arrearages owed by Harvey:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">1. Collect $1.00 per year on the arrears of $5,421.26<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-7\">2. Suspend the interception of State and Federal Income Taxes and other enforcement measures except for the Maryland Lottery until:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-8\">a) all the children are emancipated,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-9\">b) the non-custodial parent begins to pay child support; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-10\">c) the arrears are paid completely by interceptions received through the Maryland Lottery Office;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-11\">3. Enter a narrative into the Case Action Logs stating why enforcement in this case was suspended; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-12\">4. Refund State and Federal taxes that were intercepted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Ms. Kaiser also instructed Mr. Brown in this memorandum that he would \u201cneed to write a letter to the Legal Aid Bureau, Inc. with a summary of the actions outlined above [and that he should] contact [Kaiser] to confirm these arrangements or to discuss other satisfactory arrangements.\u201d BCOCSE, however, objected to Ms. Kaiser\u2019s proposal, and neither the CSEA nor BCOCSE took any further action on Harvey\u2019s requests.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Meeting no success in his initiatives with BCOCSE or the CSEA, Harvey filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on 17 May 2002 a Motion to Set-Aside Child Support.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> By this time, Harvey had remarried, adding his new wife and her son to his household. In his motion, Harvey asked the court to set aside his child support arrearages under the authority of Md. Code (1974, 2004 Repl. Vol.),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u00a7 5-1038(b) of the Family Law Article,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which he argued permits a court to modify or set aside a child support order if the court finds that such an action is \u201cjust and proper in light of the circumstances and in the best interests of the child.\u201d Harvey also asked the court, in the alternative, to find that the CSEA declined improperly to forgive his arrearages under \u00a7 10-112, which grants discretion to the CSEA to settle past child support arrearages for less than the full amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">At a merits hearing on the motion held on 25 October 2002, Rachelle Langdon, a manager for BCOCSE, testified that, in regard to the proposal by Ms. Kaiser,</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>... I believe my supervisor, Mr. Drummond discussed this at one of our bi-weekly meetings, basically stating that we didn\u2019t agree with this proposal because: (1) our computer systems are not set up to read anything like this, which means that if you have $5,000.00 on the system, we don\u2019t really have much of a way to monitor these cases to make sure his taxes are intercepted or not you know turned into the credit agency. We have a lot of automated systems that are in place[.]</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Ms. Langdon also testified that BCOCSE did not want to take the action proposed by Ms. Kaiser because to do so \u201cwould potentially harm the numbers that show the local enforcement office\u2019s collection rate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">At the hearing, Harvey testified that he supported his children and extended household on wages of $10.96 an hour as a landscaper for the City of Baltimore. Harvey claimed that the existence of unpaid child support obligations affected adversely his credit rating, prevented him from purchasing or financing a home, and undermined his ability to pay and save for his children\u2019s education. All of these consequences of continued enforcement, Harvey argued, acted as a detriment to the best interests of his children and thus provided a justification for the complete elimination of his arrearages.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">After hearing arguments from counsel, the Circuit Court, in an order dated 8 May 2003, denied Harvey\u2019s motion to set aside child support arrearages. Harvey appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed the Circuit Court\u2019s denial of his motion. In its reported opinion, the intermediate appellate court held that, although \u00a7 5-1038(b) appeared to grant a court authority to set aside a child support order, it conflicted with and was superceded by \u00a7 12-104, which prohibited the retrospective modification of a child support order prior to the filing of a motion for modification. <em>Harvey v. Marshall, </em>158 Md.App. 355, 363, 857 A.2d 529, 534 (2004). The court also held that the CSEA did not abuse its discretion under \u00a7 10-112 by failing to act on Harvey\u2019s request to forgive his arrearages. <em>Id. </em>at 382, 857 A.2d at 545. Harvey petitioned for a writ of certiorari in this Court, which we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>granted, 384 Md. 448, 863 A.2d 997, in order to consider the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-5\">I. Did the Court of Special Appeals err in holding that the Circuit Court had no discretion to retrospectively extinguish a child support award prior to the date of the filing of a motion for modification?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-6\">II. Did the Court of Special Appeals err in holding that the CSEA did not act in an arbitrary, illegal, capricious or unreasonable manner when it refused to exercise its discretion under \u00a7 10-112 to forgive Harvey\u2019s child support arrearages?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">Harvey argues that the Circuit Court erred when it found that it did not possess discretion under \u00a7 5-1038(b) to eliminate Harvey\u2019s child support arrearages accruing prior to the filing of his motion. Sec. 5-1038, in context, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-9\">Title 5. Children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-10\">Subtitle 10. Paternity Proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-11\">Part VI. Court Order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-12\">\u00a7 5-1038. Finality; modification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-13\"><em>(a) Declaration of paternity final; modifications. </em>\u2014 (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, a declaration of paternity in an order is final.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-14\">(2)(i) A declaration of paternity may be modified or set aside:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-15\">1. in the manner and to the extent that any order or decree of an equity court is subject to the revisory power of the court under any law, rule, or established principle of practice or procedure in equity; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-16\">2. if a blood or genetic test done in accordance with \u00a7 5-1029 of this subtitle establishes the exclusion of the individual named as the father in the order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>(ii) Notwithstanding subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, a declaration of paternity may not be modified or set aside if the individual named in the order acknowledged paternity knowing he was not the father.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-5\">(b) <em>Other orders subject to modification. </em>\u2014 Except for a declaration of paternity, the court may modify or set aside any order or part of an order under this subtitle as the court considers just and proper in light of the circumstances and in the best interests of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The CSEA and BCOCSE counter that the discretion conferred upon a court by \u00a7 5-1038(b) conflicts with and is limited by the more specific pronouncements in \u00a7 12-104, which state, in context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">Title 12. Child Support.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-8\">\n<em>X X X</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-9\">Subtitle 1. General Provisions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-10\">\n<em>X X X</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-11\">\u00a7 12-104. Modification of child support award.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-12\">(a) <em>Prerequisites. </em>\u2014 The court may modify a child support award subsequent to the filing of a motion for modification and upon a showing of a material change of circumstance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-13\">(b) <em>Retroactivity of modification. </em>\u2014 The court may not retroactively modify a child support award prior to the date of the filing of a motion for modification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-14\">Harvey continues by maintaining that the Court of Special Appeals erred in concluding that, as applied to his case, the specific prohibition in \u00a7 12-104 on retrospective modification conflicts with the wide discretion contained in \u00a7 5-1038(b). He argues that, because he seeks to eliminate completely his past arrearages, he is not requesting a \u201cmodification\u201d of his obligations, but rather a \u201cset aside.\u201d Harvey\u2019s theory relies heavily on the fact that, although \u00a7 5-1038(b) permits a court to \u201cmodify or set aside any order,\u201d the language in \u00a7 12-104 only limits a court\u2019s discretion to \u201cmodify\u201d a child support award retrospectively. He posits that the absence in \u00a7 12-104 of a limitation on a court\u2019s discretional authority to \u201cset aside\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>an order is a clear and conspicuous indication that \u00a7 12-104 does not limit a court\u2019s authority, under \u00a7 5-1038(b), to eliminate completely his arrearages accruing before the filing of his motion. We do not agree with his interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Harvey\u2019s question is one of statutory interpretation and, as such, is purely a legal one. <em>Mohan v. Norris, </em>386 Md. 63, 66-67, 871 A.2d 575, 577 (2005). We therefore review the matter <em>de novo. Id.; see also Davis v. Slater, </em>383 Md. 599, 604, 861 A.2d 78, 80-81 (2004) (stating that \u201c[b]ecause our interpretation of ... provisions of the Maryland Code ... are appropriately classified as questions of law, we review the issues <em>de novo </em>to determine if the trial court was legally correct in its rulings on these matters\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">The CSEA and BCOCSE argue, as a preliminary matter, that Harvey\u2019s claim is foreclosed by claim preclusion principles because he \u201cpreviously sought relief from his responsibility to pay past due child support based on exactly the same factual circumstances that form the basis of his claims in the present proceeding; that he has had actual physical custody of his children since 1996.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Respondent\u2019s Brief at 6. The CSEA, however, ignores the fundamental purpose and nature of \u00a7 5-1038(b), which relaxes with regard to certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>orders in paternity cases the ordinary rules of finality of judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">We conclude that the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>does not bar the present case because Harvey\u2019s motion seeking to establish custody of his children did not present the same claim or cause of action as the present case. <em>See Lizzi v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., </em>384 Md. 199, 206-07, 862 A.2d 1017, 1022 (2004) (stating that <em>res judicata </em>\u201cbar[s] the same parties from litigating a second lawsuit on the same claim, or any other claim arising from the same transaction or series of transactions and that could have been \u2014 but was not \u2014 raised in the first suit\u201d (citations omitted)). On 29 March 2001, Harvey filed a motion in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City in the underlying paternity cases, setting forth the basic facts of his reunification with his children and asking for the following relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">A. That he be awarded immediate custody of the minor children ... dating back to October 1996;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-7\">B. That Defendant be awarded the permanent care and custody of the children; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-8\">C. That Defendant be awarded such other and further relief as the nature of his cause may require.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">Although Harvey experienced some resistance from the Baltimore City Department of Social Services in obtaining documents relating to his claims, Ms. Marshall, the mother of three of the children and the putative plaintiff, did not oppose the relief requested.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As indicated <em>supra, </em>the Circuit Court granted Harvey custody of all four of his biological children, effective 1 October 1996. The court also ordered that Ms. Marshall be \u201ccharged generally for the support and maintenance of [the children she had with Harvey].\u201d Finally, the court directed that Harvey\u2019s child support obligations for his children be terminated, also effective 1 October 1996 (meaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>for child support attributable to and accruing from that date forward).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The record reveals that Harvey\u2019s purpose in asking the court to award him custody of his children was to establish a foundation to pursue forgiveness of his arrearages from the CSEA under the statutory scheme in \u00a7 10-112. There is no indication that Harvey asked the court, at that time, to exercise its discretion under \u00a7 5-1038(b) to eliminate or modify his arrearages that accrued prior to 1 October 1996. Had Harvey sought retrospective modification (i.e., elimination) of his past child support obligations for the period before he gained custody, he theoretically would have encountered the same obstacle as he has in the present case \u2014 the limitations on retrospective modification contained in \u00a7 12-104. Confronted with only a request for a retrospective child custody determination, the Circuit Court awarded Harvey only that relief that was a direct consequence of a finding of retrospective custody, including a \u201ccredit\u201d or \u201coffset\u201d of child support payments that he was to have paid during that period. <em>See Child Support Enforcement Admin. v. Shehan, </em>148 Md.App. 550, 562, 813 A.2d 334, 342 (2002) (finding that, because, under \u00a7 12-204(Z )(2), \u201c[t]he custodial parent shall be presumed to spend that parent\u2019s total child support obligation directly on the child .. .,\u201d a parent that had reunited with his family and became the custodial parent was entitled to a credit of the payments made during the period since he became a custodial parent). A motion, pursuant to \u00a7 5-1038(b), seeking elimination of arrearages accruing during a non-custodial period of time is not, for <em>res judicata </em>purposes, the same claim as a motion to establish custody retrospectively, and simply was not litigated in the 2001 proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Next, we consider whether the prohibition on retrospective modification of child support orders (for non-custodial periods of time) in \u00a7 12-104 was intended as a limitation on the broad authority conferred upon a court by \u00a7 5-1038(b), and, if so, the extent of that limitation. Our starting point is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>the plain language of the two statutes. <em>See Johnson v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>387 Md. 1,11, 874 A.2d 439, 445 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Harvey observes correctly that, although \u00a7 5-1038(b) provides authority for a court to both \u201cmodify or set aside\u201d <em>any </em>order in paternity actions (other than a declaration of paternity), \u00a7 12-104 merely limits a court\u2019s discretion to \u201cmodify,\u201d retrospectively, a child support order. Harvey continues, however, that, although the statutes use similar language, there is a substantive difference between a court\u2019s authority to \u201cset aside\u201d a child support order and a court\u2019s authority to \u201cmodify\u201d retrospectively such an order. In order to grant Harvey the relief he requests, therefore, a court must be convinced that an action to eliminate retrospectively and completely child support arrearages should be classified properly as a \u201cset aside,\u201d governed by \u00a7 5-1038(b), rather than a \u201cmodification,\u201d governed by \u00a7 12-104. The CSEA responds that the Legislature\u2019s use of the term \u201cmodify\u201d in \u00a7 12-104 was intended, as a matter of both legislative intent and common sense, to include those actions covered by any definition of \u201cset aside,\u201d and thus the distinction sought by Harvey is irrelevant. Thus, proper analysis, as we perceive it, hinges on interpretation of the term \u201cmodify\u201d in \u00a7 12-104, and specifically whether the use of that term encapsulates the complete elimination of a child support arrearage \u2014 the relief that Harvey requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Although the terms \u201cmodify\u201d and \u201cset aside\u201d are not defined in either of the respective subtitles that contain the relevant statutes, these terms (or similar terms) are addressed in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary. The fifth edition of Black\u2019s Law Dictionary,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> published contemporaneously with the enactment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>of \u00a7 12-104 in 1988, defines \u201cmodify\u201d as: \u201cTo alter; to change in incidental or subordinate features; enlarge, extend; amend; limit, reduce. Such alteration or change may be characterized, in quantitative sense, as either an increase or decrease.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 905 (5th ed. 1979). Applying the appropriate senses of the word, one might conclude that the prohibition on retrospective modification of child support awards in \u00a7 12-104 would preclude the retrospective elimination of arrearages. Even if the relief Harvey requests also was defined as a \u201cset aside,\u201d such an action arguably would involve \u201cmodifying\u201d a child support order because, not only would a complete elimination of arrearages be, in relatively broad terms, an \u201calteration\u201d or \u201cchange\u201d to a child support award, but, in more specific terms, it would certainly be a \u201climitation\u201d or \u201creduction\u201d of such an order.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Harvey, however, in arguing that there is a substantive distinction between \u201cmodify\u201d and \u201cset aside,\u201d points us toward the definition of \u201cmodification.\u201d The fifth edition of Black\u2019s <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> defines \u201cmodification\u201d as \u201c[a] change; an alteration or amendment which introduces new elements into the details, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>cancels some of them, <em>but leaves the general purpose and effect of the subject-matter intact.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 905 (5th ed. 1979). Harvey asks us to compare this definition with that of \u201cset aside,\u201d which is defined by the fifth edition<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> of Black\u2019s as \u201c[t]o reverse, vacate, cancel, annul, or revoke a judgment, order, etc.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1230. Harvey proclaims that, under these definitions, the complete elimination of child support arrearages would not be a \u201cmodification,\u201d because it would not \u201cleave[] the general purpose and effect of the subject-matter [of the child support order] intact,\u201d but would instead \u201ccancel, annul, or revoke\u201d an obligation to pay child support. Harvey\u2019s interpretation, if accepted, would have the result of the relief he requests skirting the limitation on retrospective modifications in \u00a7 12-104 and placing it within the broad remedial authority of \u00a7 5-1038(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">We agree with Harvey that there is a substantive distinction, at least with regard to child support and paternity matters, between a \u201cmodification\u201d and a \u201cset aside.\u201d Despite this, we conclude that the relief Harvey seeks, in fact, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>defined more properly as an effort to \u201cmodify\u201d his child support arrearages, rather than as an action to \u201cset aside.\u201d <em>Cf. Morton County Soc. Serv. Bd. v. Hakanson, </em>660 N.W.2d 599, 601 (N.D.2003) (finding that, when a child support judgment is filed in a court solely for the purposes of enforcement of that order, that court may not forgive child support arrearages because, \u201c[i]f a court forgives past due child support obligations, it has modified a child support order\u201d); <em>Gilbertson v. Graff, </em>477 N.W.2d 771, 774 (Minn.Ct.App.1991) (finding that \u201c[fjorgiveness of unpaid child support is a retroactive modification of child support governed by [the Minnesota statute prohibiting the retroactive modification of child support orders]\u201d); <em>cf. Schulz v. Ystad, </em>155 Wis.2d 574, 456 N.W.2d 312, 320 (1990) (finding that a Wisconsin statute prohibiting the retrospective \u201crevision\u201d of child support orders \u201celiminated the long-standing power of the Wisconsin courts to modify, reduce, or forgive accumulated support arrearages\u201d). Harvey\u2019s child support obligations and arrearages arose from paternity decrees, issued by a court, that included awards for child support. In asking the court to eliminate completely his arrearages, Harvey does not do so by challenging the underlying validity of the child support awards. Harvey\u2019s motion therefore does not seek to \u201cset aside\u201d or invalidate his child support obligations, but relates rather to a modification with respect to the enforcement of those remaining, valid portions of his child support obligations as they affect his current and future ability to support his family. Had the underlying child support award been invalid, there would be clear authority for a court to \u201cset aside\u201d the award retrospectively, even in light of the statutory language in \u00a7 12-104. <em>See Walter v. Gunter, </em>367 Md. 386, 395, 788 A.2d 609, 614 (2002) (finding that a court has no discretion, under either \u00a7 12-104 or \u00a7 5-1038(b), \u201cto \u2018modify\u2019 a child support order which is based on a vacated paternity judgment because the order itself is inextricably linked to the paternity declaration, its viability ... absolutely dependent on the viability of the paternity declaration\u201d). Because Harvey\u2019s \u201cmotion to set aside\u201d instead asks for an alteration to or limitation on only that portion of the award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>that is affected by his current circumstances, it should be deemed therefore a \u201cmotion for modification.\u201d Thus, although \u00a7 5 \u2014 1038(b) seemingly would permit the retrospective modification, i.e. complete elimination, of Harvey\u2019s arrearages, its broad language, as applied in the present case, conflicts clearly with the limitation on retrospective modification in \u00a7 12-104.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">This conclusion finds support in the legislative history of \u00a7 12-104. The limitations on retrospective modification of child support awards found in \u00a7 12-104 were enacted by the General Assembly in 1988 in response to a federal stimulus to the States regarding their enforcement of child support awards. 1988 Md. Laws, Chap. 338. In her statement before the Maryland Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee on 10 March 1988, Senator Ida G. Ruben (D \u2014 Montgomery County), the sponsor of the bill that ultimately became the enacted legislation, explained the underlying issues and policy concerns regarding Maryland\u2019s child support enforcement situation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\">As it stands now, a person owing back-child support payments usually has to go back to court and promises to be more timely in the future. Then the judge usually wipes out the previous debt and allows the payor to start anew with child support payments. The result is that thousands of dollars owed to children and their families are lost forever. S.B. 691 [codified ultimately as \u00a7 12-104] would end that practice by not allowing the court to retroactively modify a standing decree for child support. Children and their families would be able to get back payments they are owed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">Ann C. Helton, then-executive director of the CSEA, appeared before the Senate Committee to emphasize that the legislation was necessary to prevent courts from forgiving accumulated arrearages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-9\">As important as collection of these overdue amounts is to families and taxpayers, in many cases judges have ordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>that these arrearages be abated in return for the obligor\u2019s promise to remain current in future support payments. Regardless of whether that promise is kept, the overdue amounts have been wiped out .... [\u00a7 12-104] simply prevents the Court from forgiving the debt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Beyond these financial implications for any State, the federal government identified the retrospective reduction and elimination of child support awards as a significant problem warranting national attention. In 1986, Congress amended Title IV of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 601 <em>et seq. </em>(2005), to require States to conform to national standards with regard to child support payments and enforcement. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-509, \u00a7 9103, 100 Stat. 1874, 1973 (1986). This legislation, codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(a)(9) (2005), provided in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">(a) ... each State must have in effect laws requiring the use of the following procedures ... to increase the effectiveness of the program which the State administers under this part [42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 651 <em>et seq.] ...</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-7\">(9) Procedures which require that any payment or installment of support under any child support order, whether ordered through the State judicial system or through the expedited processes required by paragraph (2) [concerning procedures for establishing paternity and for establishing, modifying, and enforcing support obligations], is (on and after the date it is due)'\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-8\">(A) a judgment by operation of law, with the full force, effect, and attributes of a judgment of the State, including the ability to be enforced,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-9\">(B) entitled as a judgment to full faith and credit in such State and in any other State, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-10\">(C) <em>not subject to retroactive modification by such State or by any other State;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-11\">except that such procedures may permit modification with respect to any period during which there is pending a petition for modification, but only from the date that notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>of such petition has been given, either directly or through the appropriate agent, to the obligee or (where the obligee is the petitioner) to the obligor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Legislation containing the language found in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(a)(9) originally was introduced by Senator William W. \u201cBill\u201d Bradley of New Jersey on 5 May 1986 as S. 2404, and by Representative Barbara B. Kennedy of Connecticut on 7 May 1986 as H.R. 4769. These two bids, however, died in committee. Nonetheless, the amendments codified ultimately as 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(a)(9) were placed into H.R. 5300, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, which was passed by the Congress and signed into law by the President on 21 October 1986. Pub.L. No. 99-509, \u00a7 9103, 100 Stat. 1874, 1973 (1986). The legislative history of the two predecessor bids indicates that the main concerns addressed were deficiencies and loopholes affecting the interstate enforcement of child support awards, including the effect of retrospective modification of child support orders. <em>See </em>132 Cong. Rec. 9416-17 (1986) (statement of Sen. Bradley); 132 Cong. Rec. 9958 (1986) (statement of Rep. Kennedy). In her statement in the House of Representatives on 7 May 1986, Rep. Kennedy stated that H.R. 4769 was aimed at States that allowed \u201c[child support] debt to be reduced, <em>even to the point of wiping out the entire prior obligation. </em>...\u201d 132 Cong. Rec. 9958 (emphasis added). This concern with the abidty of States to eliminate completely an obligor\u2019s arrearages was also reflected in the published \u201clegislative history\u201d of Public Law 99-509. <em>See </em>Pub. L. No. 99-509, 1986 U.S.Code Cong. <em>&amp; </em>Admin.News (100 Stat. 1874), 3607, 3917-18 (stating that Pub.L. No. 99-509 was intended to amend the current law in regard to those States and their courts' that have \u201cthe authority to reduce or nudify arrearages\u201d); <em>HHS Rules Proposed on Proscription Against Retroactive Modification of Support Arrears, </em>13 Fam. L. Rep. (BNA) 1600, 1601 (Oct. 13, 1987) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">The Maryland Legislature understood clearly that significant federal funds were in jeopardy if it did not enact legislation intended to effectuate the child support mechanisms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>located in, and defined by, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(a)(9). Regarding the federal legislation and its accompanying fiscal incentives, Sen. Ruben stated at the Committee hearings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-4\">The federal government has recognized [retroactive modification of child support awards] as a national problem and has passed legislation requiring states to conform to national standards in child support payments. S.B. 691 would bring the State of Maryland into conformity with federal law. Presently, Maryland is the <em>only </em>state not yet in compliance with federal standards. We are in danger of losing all of our child support funding and federal [Aid to Families with Dependent Children (\u201cAFDC\u201d)] payments if we do not come into compliance this session. So you can see that it is imperative that this legislation be passed.... <footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">CSEA Executive Director Helton also recognized that S.B. 691 was designed to conform Maryland law to federal mandates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">The purpose of SB 691 ... is to prohibit the court from retroactively modifying the amount of a child support order. Federal law enacted in 1986 requires all states to enact such legislation. The intent of Congress was specifically aimed at the practice of some courts to reduce or forgive arrearages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">This history indicates clearly that, in enacting \u00a7 12-104, the Maryland Legislature sought to fulfill the purpose of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(a)(9) as outlined by Congress. <em>See </em>Department of Fiscal Services, Fiscal Note Revised 1988, S.B. 691 (stating that the \u201cDepartment of Human Resources advises that this bill conforms State practice to federal requirements\u201d); <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number><em>also Langston v. Langston, </em>366 Md. 490, 514 n. 11, 784 A.2d 1086, 1099 n. 11 (2001), <em>abrogated on other grounds, Bienkowski v. Brooks, </em>386 Md. 516, 873 A.2d 1122 (2005) (concluding that \u201c[i]t appears that the General Assembly imposed limitations on the modification of child support awards in order to comply with the requirement of the [AFDC]\u201d). We therefore conclude that, in using the term \u201cmodify\u201d in \u00a7 12-104, the General Assembly intended to reflect and appropriate the language used in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(a)(9). Because of the adoption of this identical language in \u00a7 12-104, we conclude that the Legislature also intended to adopt the connotation and meaning of the term \u201cmodification\u201d as intended by Congress in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(a)(9), which included not only a reduction or alteration, but the complete elimination, of child support arrearages. 132 Cong. Rec. 9958 (1986) (statement of Rep. Kennelly); <em>see also Rutledge v. Barrett, </em>802 S.W.2d 604, 605-06 (Tenn.1991) (finding that the \u201clegislative history of [the Tennessee statute prohibiting the retroactive modification of child support orders] reflects the [Tennessee] General Assembly\u2019s clear understanding that as a result of legislative action to bring Tennessee law in line with the federal requirement [outlined in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(a)(9)], the courts of this state would lose their ability to forgive past arrearages in child support cases ... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">5.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Despite this legislative history and purpose, Harvey argues that, by defining \u201cmodify\u201d to include the retrospective elimination of arrearages, we would be ignoring our responsibility, under principles of statutory interpretation, to search for and find a harmonious interpretation between two related statutes. <em>See Pete v. State, </em>384 Md. 47, 65-66, 862 A.2d 419, 429-30 (2004) (stating that \u201cvarious consistent and related enactments, although made at different times and without reference to one another, nevertheless should be harmonized as much as possible\u201d (citations omitted)). When two statutes conflict, by their plain language, however, no harmonious interpretation is possible. In this case, there is a conflict between the statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>in that \u00a7 5-1038(b) seemingly allows a court to eliminate child support arrearages retrospectively, while, as we have concluded, \u00a7 12-104 specifically precludes that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">This conflict becomes even more apparent when we examine the logical consequences of Harvey\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 12-104. <em>State v. Glass, </em>386 Md. 401, 410, 872 A.2d 729, 734 (2005) (stating that a court\u2019s analysis \u201cmust be undertaken from a commonsensical rather than a technical ] perspective, always seeking to avoid giving the statute a strained interpretation or one that reaches an absurd result\u201d (citations omitted)); Price <em>v. State, </em>378 Md. 378, 388, 835 A.2d 1221, 1227 (2003) (stating that courts must \u201cavoid constructions that are illogical, unreasonable, or inconsistent with common sense\u201d (citations omitted)). Under Harvey\u2019s \u201charmonious interpretation,\u201d \u00a7 12-104 would not limit a court\u2019s discretion to extinguish retrospectively 100% of a parent\u2019s arrearages, because that action would be a \u201cset aside,\u201d but that same court would have no discretion to reduce that parent\u2019s arrearages by up to 99.99%, because that would be a \u201cmodification.\u201d Common sense and the legislative history of \u00a7 12-104 restrain us from agreeing with such a conclusion. <em>Cf. In re Trust of Lane, </em>323 Md. 188, 192-93, 592 A.2d 492, 494-95 (1991) (finding that \u201cif a court has the power to terminate a trust it necessarily has the power to take less drastic measures and modify that same trust\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Although we conclude that the two statutes conflict with respect to the retrospective modification of child support arrearages, we note that our interpretation of \u00a7 12-104 and \u00a7 5-1038(b) in this case harmonizes those statutes with the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Walter v. Gunter. </em>In <em>Walter, </em>we held that, when a child support order is premised on an invalid paternity declaration, \u00a7 12-104 does not limit a court\u2019s discretion to \u201cset aside\u201d that child support order. 367 Md. at 393-96, 788 A.2d at 613-15. Our holding today is consistent with <em>Walter </em>in that, by including the complete elimination of child support arrearages within the sphere of \u00a7 12-104\u2019s prohibition on retrospective modification of child support awards, \u00a7 12-104 does not interfere with a court\u2019s ability to \u201cset aside\u201d an invalid child support order, while still remaining true to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>legislative purposes espoused by both state and federal lawmakers. Pub.L. No. 99-509, 1986 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News (100 Stat. 1874) 3917-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">When a court concludes that the provisions of two statutes conflict, it then must determine which statute controls the facts before it. We turn now to the principles of statutory interpretation concerning conflicting statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">We often have stated that \u201c[wjhere there is a specific enactment and a general enactment which, in its most comprehensive sense, would include what is embraced in the former, the particular enactment must be operative, and the general enactment must be taken to affect only such cases within its general language as are not within the provisions of the particular enactment.\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of Natural Res. v. France, </em>277 Md. 432, 461-62, 357 A.2d 78, 94-95 (1976) (citations and quotations omitted); <em>see also Smack v. Dept. of Health and Mental Hygiene, </em>378 Md. 298, 306, 835 A.2d 1175, 1179 (2003) (stating that when, in the context of statutes within the same statutory scheme, \u201ctwo statutes conflict and one is general and the other specific, \u2018the statutes may be harmonized by viewing the more specific statute as an exception to the more general one\u2019 \u201d (citations omitted)). In the present case, we conclude that the prohibition on retrospective modification in \u00a7 12-104 limits a court\u2019s broad discretion, under \u00a7 5-1038(b), to \u201cmodify or set aside\u201d any order that is in the best interests of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">Sec. 5-1038(b) allows a court in a paternity action to \u201cmodify or set aside any order or part of an order under this subtitle as the court considers just and proper in light of the circumstances and in the best interests of the child.\u201d This broad authority, viewed in isolation, would appear to allow the retrospective modification of a child support order in a paternity action. That action, however, expressly is prohibited by the more specific and particular provisions of \u00a7 12-104. We therefore give effect to the specific limitations of \u00a7 12-104 as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>curb on the broad discretion conferred on the courts by \u00a7 5-1038(b). <em>Smack, </em>378 Md. at 306, 835 A.2d at 1179.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">We are convinced of the controlling applicability of \u00a7 12-104 also as a result of the relative dates of enactment of the two statutes. At the time that \u00a7 12-104 was enacted in 1988, \u00a7 5-1038(b) long had been part of the Maryland legal landscape. <em>See </em>1963 Md. Laws, Chap. 722 (enacting the standard found in \u00a7 5-1038(b)). \u201cIn attempting to harmonize [two statutes that address the same subject], we presume that, when the Legislature enacted the later of the two statutes, it was aware of the one earlier enacted.\u201d <em>Ridge Heating, Air Conditioning and Plumbing, Inc. v. Brennen, </em>366 Md. 336, 352, 783 A.2d 691, 700 (2001) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The legislative history reveals that \u00a7 12-104 was enacted as a result of financial incentives, contained in federal law, to ensure that child support orders were \u201cnot subject to retroactive modification\u201d by any State. <em>See supra, </em>Section II. A. 4. This purpose of \u00a7 12-104 corroborates the presumption that the Legislature was aware of the broad discretion in \u00a7 5-1038(b) because, had such discretion not existed, a statute limiting discretion would have been wholly unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">In light of the legislative history of \u00a7 12-104, we not only presume, but find conclusive, the Legislature\u2019s awareness of the previously enacted \u00a7 5-1038(b) when it enacted \u00a7 12-104. The legislative history reveals that, during the formal legislative process, the Legislature was informed that the proposed S.B. 691 was designed to limit the discretion delegated to courts to reduce or eliminate child support arrearages, to the detriment of obligee custodial parents, this State, and other states whose child support orders were not given full faith and credit. <em>See </em>Testimony of Senator Ida G. Ruben before the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, S.B. 691, 10 March 1988 (stating that \u201cS.B. 691 would end that practice by not allowing the court to retroactively modify a standing decree for child support\u201d). The discretion alluded to, of course, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>none other than the discretion conferred upon the courts by \u00a7 5 \u2014 1038(b).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">By examining this legislative history, we arrive at the conclusion that \u00a7 12-104 was designed to circumscribe the broad authority delegated to the courts by \u00a7 5-1038(b). Thus, the limitation on retrospective modification contained in \u00a7 12-104 precluded the Circuit Court from granting Harvey\u2019s request to eliminate completely the child support arrearages he owed.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">Harvey also contends that the Circuit Court and the Court of Special Appeals erred in finding that the CSEA\u2019s decision not to exercise its discretion under \u00a7 10-112 in his favor was not subject to judicial review and that alternatively, if it were, the CSEA\u2019s refusal to exercise that discretion to grant his request was not \u201carbitrary, illegal, capricious or unreasonable.\u201d We begin by determining whether a decision not to exercise statutory discretion under these circumstances may be subject to judicial review, and, if so, what standard of review should apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\"> Our analysis begins with the basic premise that, in order for an administrative agency\u2019s action properly to be before this Court (or any court) for judicial review, there generally must be a legislative grant of the right to seek judicial review. <em>See South Easton Neighborhood Ass\u2019n v. Easton, </em>387 Md. 468, 476 n. 3, 876 A.2d 58, 62 n. 3 (2005) (observing that the Circuit Court did not possess jurisdiction to exercise appellate review of the Easton Town Council\u2019s decision to enact an ordinance closing a street so that public property could be conveyed to a local, non-profit hospital); <em>Criminal Injuries Comp. Bd. v.

As Harvey concedes, there was no statutory right of judicial review for CSEA actions under \u00a7 10-112 at the time the relevant legal proceedings were initiated in the present case.

The APA defines a \u201ccontested case\u201d as</p>\n<p id=\"AVB\">a proceeding before an agency to determine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-4\">(i) a right, duty, statutory entitlement, or privilege of a person that is required by statute or constitution to be determined only after an opportunity for an agency hearing; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\">(ii) the grant, denial, renewal, revocation, suspension, or amendment of a license that is required by statute or constitution to be determined only after an opportunity for an agency hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Md.

We refuse to draw a substantive distinction, for the purpose of our examination of whether the present case meets the threshold for the exercise of a court\u2019s inherent power of judicial review, between agency action and agency inaction. When an agency, in the face of a formal invocation of its discretion by an affected person coming within the class of persons contemplated by the statute, fails to act on a matter committed to its discretion by that statute, there is as much aggrievement and potential for abuse or prejudice as when an agency affirmatively announces an adverse decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The inherent power of judicial review of administrative decisions, however, is extremely limited.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Numerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>cases expressly caution about the danger of exercising our inherent power of judicial review in the absence of statutory authority. <em>See Dep\u2019t of Natural Res. v.

Consistent with these limitations, our inherent power essentially traces its origins to our duty to ensure that neither the Legislature nor the Executive branch of State government deprives the Judiciary of the ability to correct decisions premised on unreasonable findings of fact or flawed conclusions of law. <em>See, e.g., Dickinson-Tidewater, Inc. v.

The CSEA accomplishes enforcement through traditional mechanisms, such as legal enforcement proceedings, as well as such unconventional methods as the interception of lottery prizes and tax refunds, and inaugurating the suspension of driving privileges by the Motor Vehicle Administration. \u00a7 10-113; \u00a7 10-113.1; \u00a7 10-119.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">The CSEA also is charged with the duty to \u201caccept assignment of right, title, or interest in child support made under Article 88A, \u00a7 50(b)(2) of the Code [and to] prosecute and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>maintain any legal or equitable action available to establish each absent parent\u2019s obligation to pay child support.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 10-108(5) \u2014 (6).

Harvey guides us toward the language of \u00a7 10-118:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-8\">Subject to any federal law or program, the Administration and local support enforcement offices shall promote and serve the best interests of the child in carrying out their child support responsibilities under this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">He claims that \u00a7 10-118 represents a clear statement of legislative purpose to which the CSEA must conform when \u201ccarrying out ... child support responsibilities,\u201d which he interprets to include the settlement of arrearages pursuant to \u00a7 10-112.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">Preliminarily, we must address whether the act of settling or forgiving arrearages, in the context of \u00a7 10-112, is a \u201cchild support responsibility].\u201d With regard to this point, the Court of Special Appeals held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-12\">In further considering Harvey\u2019s argument, we are mindful that FL section 10-112 only applies when one parent has assigned his or her rights to recover child support payments from the other parent as a condition of receiving welfare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>payments under Md. Code (1957, 2008 Repl. Vol.), Art. 88A \u00a7 50(b)(2). Thus, the Administration and local support enforcement offices are collecting money that will be returned to the state coffers. They are not collecting support from one parent that will go to the other parent to benefit a child.

Although this novel conclusion superficially appears to be supported by sound reasoning, the implications of that court\u2019s holding are inconsistent with the statutory scheme for child support enforcement. The Court of Special Appeals apparently overlooked the effect of its holding on the enforcement authority of the CSEA. If Harvey\u2019s arrearages are classified as merely a debt owed to the State, that debt would be subject only to the traditional means of enforcing judgments, rather than the more persuasive and creative enforcement mechanisms created specially for child support arrearages.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> For example, while the ability to garnish wages as the result of an ordinary judgment is limited to 25 percent of disposable wages, a garnishment or earnings withholding or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>der as the result of a child support award may be up to 65 percent of disposable wages. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673 (2005) (setting restrictions on ordinary garnishment of wages and garnishment as the result of a child or spousal support order); \u00a7 10-120 <em>et seq.; </em>Md.

VoL), \u00a7 15-601.1 of the Commercial Law Article.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Removing State-owed child support collection from the scope of a \u201cchild support responsibility]\u201d would also raise serious questions about the applicability of \u00a7 12-104 to child support orders. If State-owed child support is not entitled to its special status, but is mere debt, a court no longer would be limited by \u00a7 12-104 and would be able to modify (and eliminate) retrospectively that debt, because \u00a7 12-104, by its language, only applies to child support orders and not mere debt. State-owed child support instead would be subject to the broad discretion set forth in \u00a7 5-1038(b). This, of course, is contrary to our interpretation of \u00a7 12-104 and, as Harvey argues, is unsupported by relevant case law. <em>See </em>Petitioner\u2019s Brief at 19 (stating that the \u201cCourt of Special Appeals\u2019 conclusion provides no explanation of how Maryland law provides for the mutation from child support to mere state debt, and the case-law ... supports the opposite conclusion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Harvey argues that, because the CSEA is performing a \u201cchild support responsibilit[y]\u201d under \u00a7 10-112, it thus is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>bound by the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard found in \u00a7 10-118 in making decisions on the forgiveness of arrearages. We disagree. Our starting point in the analysis of this contention is the plain language of the statutes. <em>Johnson v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>387 Md. at 11, 874 A.2d at 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Sec. 10-112 clearly states that the CSEA may settle a child support arrearage if \u201cthe Administration considers it to be in the best interest of this State.\u201d There is no mention of the familiar \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard. We must assume this omission was not by accident. Had the Legislature wished to mandate consideration of the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d as part of the CSEA\u2019s calculus in exercising its discretion to forgive arrearages, it could have done so easily. <em>See Mohan, </em>386 Md. at 80-81, 871 A.2d at 585 (finding the absence of a limitation on the definition of \u201cprobationary status\u201d in the Law Enforcement Officer\u2019s Bill of Rights indicative of the Legislature\u2019s desire not to limit that term in the manner suggested). When the Legislature intends that other factors be considered in addition to the best interests of the State, it explicitly and expressly has included those factors in the statutory language. <em>See, e.g., </em>Md. Code (1982, 1996 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 16-202(c) of the Environment Article (stating that the Board of Public Works, in determining whether to issue a license to dredge or fill State wetlands, \u201cshall decide if issuance of the license is in the best interest of the State, taking into account the varying ecological, economic, developmental, recreational, and aesthetic values each application presents\u201d); Md. Code (1957, 2003 Repl. Vol), Art. 83B, \u00a7 5-611.1 (stating that when the Board of Public Works approves a division of recovered archaeological historic property that has been conveyed to a permittee, the arbiter of such a division must act \u201cin the best interest of the State ... giving due consideration to the fair treatment of the permittee\u201d).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We believe that, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>failing to include a consideration of the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard in \u00a7 10-112, the Legislature intended that the CSEA not be focused solely on such a standard in exercising its discretion to forgive State-owed child support arrearages.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Harvey, in a purported effort to \u201charmonize\u201d the two statutes, argues that the Legislature intended to supplement the \u201cbest interest of this State\u201d standard when it enacted \u00a7 10-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>118. Harvey argues that the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard in \u00a7 10-118 was intended to shape and define the \u201cbest interest of this State\u201d standard in \u00a7 10-112. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">He reminds us that, in interpreting two provisions of a statutory scheme, we should be mindful that, when a statute \u201cis a part of a statutory scheme, the legislative intention is not determined from that statute alone, rather it is to be discerned by considering it in light of the statutory scheme,\u201d and when \u201cin that scheme, two statutes, enacted at different times and not referring to each other ... address the same subject, they must be read together ... <em>ie., </em>interpreted with reference to one another, ... and harmonized.... \u201d <em>Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. Co. v. Ins. Comm\u2019r, </em>332 Md. 124, 132, 630 A.2d 713, 717 (1993). Harvey suggests that a harmonious reading here results in the standard in \u00a7 10-112 being eclipsed, and, in essence, replaced, by \u00a7 10-118\u2019s application of the paramount standard of the \u201cbest interests of the child.\u201d We reject such an interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">We conclude instead that the language of \u00a7 10-112 indicates that the Legislature intended a different standard, other than the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard, to govern the settlement of arrearages. Even though it may be a \u201cchild support responsibility],\u201d the Legislature made a conscious election that the forgiveness of arrearages was an action, separate and distinct from other \u201cchild support responsibilities,\u201d that, because of its unique purpose, warranted a different standard. Although the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard is generally the standard that applies in paternity or other family law matters relating to child support, there are some situations in which the Legislature has mandated, and the courts apply, a different standard or have limited, or in some way precluded, the application of the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> <em>See Langston v. Riffe, </em>359 Md. 396, 425, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>754 A.2d 389, 404 (2000) (finding that an \u201cexamination of section 5-1038 and its legislative history makes clear that the \u2018best interests of the child\u2019 standard generally has no place in a proceeding to reconsider a paternity declaration ...

Huebschman, </em>50 Md.App. 709, 710-11, 440 A.2d 1109, 1111-12 (1982) (finding that, in modifying an order for child support, a court must find a \u201cchange in the parties\u2019 circumstances\u201d before it may consider the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">In this case, the Legislature\u2019s use of the \u201cbest interest of this State\u201d standard, rather than the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard, is consistent with the notion that, because the obligation to pay child support was scrutinized at the time of imposition under the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard, any subsequent attempt to eliminate those arrearages through the exercise of an agency\u2019s discretion may be subject to a different standard that may at times be incongruent with the \u201cbest interests of the child,\u201d particularly when the State, in lieu of the delinquent, responsible parent\u2019s payment of support, has advanced public funds to support the child. Indeed, there is a remarkable distinction between the judicial determination of child support, which certainly implicates the best interests of a child, and the forgiveness of arrearages that accrued through no fault of the child and are often due to a noncustodial parent\u2019s financial problems or irresponsibility.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Although child support owed to the State is still child support (rather than mere debt owed to the State), we conclude that the \u201cbest interest of this State\u201d standard also is consistent with the fact that \u00a7 10-112 covers only child support owed to the State and thus situations in which the child, through welfare assistance, has received all of the child support to which he or she was due. Furthermore, had Harvey wished to object to or contest the amount of child support he was to pay to Ms. Marshall or Ms. Williams, he could have raised that issue at the time the order was originally established or at any point along the continuum until he did act.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">We also keep in mind that \u201ca statute should be read so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered superfluous or nugatory.\u201d <em>Glass, </em>386 Md. at 410, 872 A.2d at 734. Accepting Harvey\u2019s interpretation would do just that, render meaningless the inclusion of \u201cbest interest of this State\u201d in \u00a7 10-112. We decline to do that. Instead, we find that \u00a7 10-118 and \u00a7 10-112 are better harmonized by giving full effect to \u00a7 10-112 as introducing a different, specific standard other than the broad direction of \u00a7 10-118.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Harvey remonstrates, however, that, by enacting \u00a7 10-118, the Legislature intended the same standard to govern \u201call agency child support responsibilities conducted pursuant to the entire statutory and regulatory framework governing child support, including those that were already specified in FL \u00a7 10-112.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Brief at 27-28.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>cause \u00a7 10-118 was enacted after \u00a7 10-112, Harvey argues, \u201cthe mandate in FL \u00a7 10-118 that CSEA and local child support offices must \u2018promote and serve the best interests of the child in carrying out their child support responsibilities under this subtitle\u2019 clearly applies to the earlier enacted provision under the same subtitle, FL \u00a7 10-112.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27; 1992 Md. Laws, Chap. 561 (enactment of \u00a7 10-118). A later enacted statute, however, does not always trump an earlier-enacted statute that covers the same topic. When \u00a7 10-112 was originally enacted, it was well established that the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard governed most issues relating to children. <em>See, e.g., Orndoff v. Orndoff, </em>252 Md. 519, 522, 250 A.2d 627, 628 (1969) (stating that the \u201cbest interest of a child is the determinative factor in custody cases\u201d); <em>but see McDermott v. Dougherty, </em>385 Md. 320, 374-75, 869 A.2d 751, 783 (2005) (holding that, \u201cin private actions in which private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>third parties are attempting to gain custody of children of natural parents over the objection of the natural parents, it is necessary first to prove that the parent is unfit or that there are extraordinary circumstances posing serious detriment to the child, before the court may apply a \u201cbest interest\u201d standard\u201d). We therefore may infer that the insertion of the \u201cbest interest of this State\u201d standard into \u00a7 10-112 indicated that the Legislature intended the discretionary forgiveness of child support arrearages owed to the State not to be subject to the usual primacy of the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The legislative history of \u00a7 10-118 reveals that \u00a7 10-118 was intended to <em>\u201cmerely </em>codif[y] what should be the current practice of the Child Support Enforcement Administration and local support enforcement offices.\u201d <em>See </em>Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, Bill Analysis 1992, H.B. 769 (codified ultimately as \u00a7 10-118) (emphasis added).

When an agency engages in proper fact-finding and applies the appropriate law, our inquiry is limited solely to whether, given the relevant standard and facts, the administrative agency\u2019s decision was \u201carbitrary, illegal, capricious or unreasonable.\u201d <em>Gould, </em>273 Md. at 500-01, 331 A.2d at 65. In order to determine properly whether the CSEA\u2019s refusal to exercise its discretion under \u00a7 10-112 was \u201carbitrary, illegal, capricious or unreasonable,\u201d we must first determine the boundaries of such a standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">When an administrative action is subject to the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), the APA grants a reviewing court the power to \u201creverse or modify the decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>[of an administrative agency] if any substantial right of the petitioner may have been prejudiced because a finding, conclusion, or decision ... is arbitrary or capricious.\u201d Md.

Although we are cognizant that the particular situation presented in this case under \u00a7 10-112 was not a \u201ccontested case\u201d at the time it was considered by the agency and therefore the APA does not apply, Maryland cases suggest that \u201can administrative proceeding, even if not subject to judicial review under the APA, would be subject to judicial review, of essentially the same scope, in an action for mandamus, certiorari, injunction or declaratory judgment [under the framework of <em>Heaps, Gould, </em>and their progeny].\u201d <em>Med.

Indeed, this conclusion is confirmed by the Maryland courts\u2019 application of the \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d standard to several differing circumstances involving allegations that an administrative agency\u2019s decision was \u201carbitrary or capricious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">New Maryland cases have developed a detailed general definition of \u201carbitrary or capricious,\u201d relying instead on a case-by-case development or an application of the standard solely to the case at hand. <em>See </em>Rochvarg, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 4.38 at 128 (finding that, because of the relative ambiguity of the \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d standard, \u201c[e]ach case must be evaluated on an individual basis\u201d); <em>Maryland State Bd. of Social Work Exam\u2019rs v.

In <em>Spencer, </em>the Court considered whether the refusal of the Maryland State Board of Pharmacy to refer for hearing a pharmacist\u2019s disciplinary matter to the Maryland Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) was \u201carbitrary or capricious.\u201d 380 Md. at 527-30, 846 A.2d at 348-50.

Based on her belief that members of a Board panel that was scheduled to hear the charges against her were biased against her, Spencer sought to have the matter referred to the OAH, a decision committed exclusively to the Board\u2019s discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 521-22, 846 A.2d at 344-45.

We reversed, however, concluding that, even though Spencer\u2019s rights in fact were prejudiced by the presence of those mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>bers, the Court of Special Appeals exceeded its authority in directing the matter be referred to the OAH. <em>Id. </em>at 531-32, 846 A.2d at 350-51. We directed remand of the matter to the Board with instructions to it to cure, through any manner available to the Board, the prejudice caused by the presence of the biased Board members on the panel. <em>Id. </em>at 534, 846 A.2d at 352. In finding it \u201cclear that the Board\u2019s decision to forgo the OAH was not arbitrary or capricious,\u201d the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACx\">An agency\u2019s prerogative with respect to case referral to the OAH is similar in scope to that of the agency\u2019s prerogative in determining the severity of sanctions [citing <em>King </em>], or to that of forgoing prosecution of a particular individual. In such cases, it is most difficult to apply or even articulate a judicial standard by which the agency\u2019s discretionary decision might be deemed arbitrary or capricious, <em>cf. Heckler v.

The reviewing court, absent some showing of fraud or egregious behavior on behalf of the agency, will be hard pressed to articulate a reason why the agency acted arbitrarily or capriciously when it did not send the case to the OAH. This is true for the case before us today. Even conceding the error of the Board\u2019s failure to recuse certain members from the panel, that alone does not suffice to render arbitrary or capricious the Board\u2019s decision not to refer to the OAH.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 533, 846 A.2d at 351-52 (some citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Although some cases, such as <em>Spencer, </em>perceive that agency discretion, by its nature, may be well-insulated from judicial review, other cases have applied more particularized scrutiny to determine whether an agency action was \u201carbitrary or capricious.\u201d An agency decision, for example, may be deemed \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d if it is contrary to or inconsistent with an enabling statute\u2019s language or policy goals. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number><em>See, e.g., Hurl, </em>107 Md.App. at 306, 667 A.2d at 980 (finding an elementary school teacher\u2019s transfer not \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d in light of standards found in the enabling statute and relevant regulations); Rochvarg, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 4.38 at 129 (stating that \u201c[a]n agency decision that is contrary to the enabling statute\u2019s language or policy goals is a decision that is arbitrary or capricious\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Even if an administrative agency does not articulate policy goals within its pertinent regulations or such are not expressed in the agency\u2019s enabling statute, an agency action nonetheless may be \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d if it is irrationally inconsistent with previous agency decisions. <em>See Christopher v.

For reasons to be explained, we conclude that the CSEA\u2019s decision not to exercise its discretion to grant relief to Harvey under \u00a7 10-112 was not the result of an illegal or unreasonable (and thus \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d) delegation of authority, nor was it the product of \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d reasoning or rationales.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">At the threshold of this argument, Harvey betrays a misunderstanding of the fundamental relationship between the CSEA and BCOCSE. As stated <em>supra </em>Section IV.A., the CSEA was created in 1976 as an agency within the Department of Human Resources (\u201cDepartment\u201d) for the purpose of coordinating a statewide program covering all aspects of child support enforcement. \u00a7 10-106; \u00a7 10-108; 1976 Md. Laws, Chap. 778. In 1995, the Legislature established the Child Support Enforcement Privatization Pilot Program, which operates in Baltimore City and Queen Anne\u2019s County. 1995 Md. Laws, Chap. 491. Sec. 10-119.1(c) lays out the purpose and scope of this privatization program:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-9\">The purpose of the Pilot Program is to authorize the Secretary of the Department to enter into contracts with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>private companies to privatize all aspects of child support enforcement functions of the Department, including ... establishing support orders; ... collecting and disbursing support payments; ... reviewing and modifying child support orders; and ... enforcing support obligations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">At all times relevant to these proceedings, BCOCSE/MAXIMUS was a private agency that had contracted with the CSEA to carry out, in selected jurisdictions, its child support enforcement functions, including those outlined in \u00a7 10-119.1(c). Harvey argues that it was \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d for the CSEA to \u201cabdicate[ ] its authority entirely to the private delegate [BCOCSE] without exercising any meaningful review of the decision.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Brief at 33-34.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The record, however, reveals no such complete handover to BCOCSE on the part of the CSEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The memorandum from Ms. Kaiser to the project director of BCOCSE proposing certain actions with respect to Harvey\u2019s arrearages was simply that \u2014 a proposal. There is nothing in the record to suggest that Ms. Kaiser or anyone else at the CSEA demanded, ordered, or mandated that the specified actions be taken with regard to Harvey\u2019s account. Accepting the memorandum as a proposal inviting feedback, rather than as an order from a superior, BCOCSE thereafter provided the CSEA with its recommendations and objections, including its concerns over the \u201ccollection rate\u201d and the ability to accommodate administratively the proposed actions. It is not \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d for an agency to solicit feedback, recommendations, or objections from its private delegate (especially with respect to decisions that may affect directly the private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>delegate), so long as the agency retains the ultimate control over the exercise of its statutorily granted discretion. Although the CSEA certainly appears to have acquiesced in the recommendations and objections of BCOCSE, the ultimate discretion was exercised (or, in this case, not exercised in Harvey\u2019s favor) by the CSEA. Despite Harvey\u2019s arguments to the contrary, a total and complete abdication of discretion did not occur in this case.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Harvey argues that, even if the CSEA\u2019s acquiescence was not per se \u201carbitrary or capricious,\u201d it was unreasonable, and therefore \u201carbitrary or capricious,\u201d for the CSEA to acquiesce in the particular reasons that BCOCSE gave for objecting to the proposed forgiveness plan. In her testimony at the Circuit Court, an official from BCOCSE acknowledged that \u201cone of the reasons\u201d BCOCSE objected to the proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>forgiveness plan was \u201cthat it would potentially harm the numbers that show the local enforcement office\u2019s collection rate.\u201d Harvey argues that it was \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d for the CSEA to ratify BCOCSE\u2019s pecuniary self-interest by acquiescing in its objection to the proposed forgiveness plan based on financial considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">In order to determine whether it was \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d for the CSEA to consider the financial implications or impact on BCOCSE\u2019s \u201ccollection rate\u201d in its decision not to exercise its discretion to grant relief to Harvey under \u00a7 10-112, we must examine such a decision in light of the standard announced by the Legislature in enacting \u00a7 10-112. The question becomes whether the CSEA\u2019s consideration of the fiscal impact of the requested action was a reasonable action taken for the \u201cbest interest of this State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">We begin by examining the State\u2019s purpose, divined through the legislative history, in enacting a privatization scheme for the enforcement of child support obligations in certain jurisdictions. The privatization program in \u00a7 10-119.1 was enacted in 1995 as part of Senate Bill 754, which included larger welfare reform legislation creating a Welfare Reform Pilot Program in selected geographic portions of the State, including Baltimore City.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> 1995 Md. Laws, Chap. 491. In addition to providing incentives for individuals to reduce welfare dependency and increase self-sufficiency, such as time limits on the receipt of AFDC benefits and mandatory work requirements, the legislation also created penalties, such as the suspension of driving privileges (codified at \u00a7 10-119), for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>individuals who fall behind in their child support obligations. 1995 Md. Laws, Chap. 491; <em>see also Maryland Classified Employees Ass\u2019n v. State, </em>346 Md. 1, 5-7, 694 A.2d 937, 938-40 (1997) (describing the features and welfare reform provisions of S.B. 754). These new incentives and enforcement techniques were expected to result in significant financial savings with respect to AFDC expenditures.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> <em>See </em>1995 Md. Laws, Chap. 491, preamble of S.B. 754 (stating that the \u201cGeneral Assembly has established welfare reform ... with the intended goal of achieving a significant reduction in the number of citizens who are enrolled in the [AFDC] program\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">The welfare privatization provisions, however, did not begin as part of S.B. 754. While S.B. 754, without the privatization provisions, was being considered in the Senate, the House of Delegates was considering House Bill 1177. H.B. 1177, introduced on 20 February 1995, would have \u201cestablished] a Child Support Enforcement Privatization Pilot Program in the Department of Human Resources ... to privatize all child support enforcement functions in Baltimore City and [Queen Anne\u2019s County] by July 1, 1996.\u201d Department of Fiscal Services, Fiscal Note Revised 1995, H.B. 1177. Although H.B. 1177 was not passed by both houses of the Legislature, its provisions regarding child support privatization were incorporated into S.B. 754, which was signed into law on 25 May 1995.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> 1995 Md. Laws, Chap. 491. The legislative history of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>H.B. 1177 reveals that the Legislature harbored deep concerns over the then-current state of child support enforcement, and viewed privatization as a viable solution. For example, the Floor Report of the House Committee on Appropriations, to which H.B. 1177 was referred, describes the Committee\u2019s rationale for supporting the privatization measures in H.B. 1177:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\">... In FY 1994, DHR collected $50.6 million in child support in Baltimore City, or 11% of the total child support obligations in the City. Approximately $420 million in support orders went uncollected. DHR spends $11.1 million annually for child support enforcement annually in the City. This works out to be $4.50 in collections for every $1 spent on enforcement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\">This rate of collection is absolutely intolerable. With the majority of cases in the City also on AFDC, uncollected support orders result in additional AFDC costs for the State. A large part of the failure of child support collection is inherent in the inefficiencies of government. By contracting this service out, enforcement functions can be run in a more efficient manner. A private contractor will have more flexibility to base pay on performance and to update computer technology more rapidly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">These financial considerations are explicitly set forth in \u00a7 10-119.1. Section 10 \u2014 119.1(d) mandates that the Secretary of the Department shall \u201cadopt regulations that ... (ii) provide for the reimbursement of any private contractor; [and] (iii) prohibit the cost of transferring child support enforcement to private contractors as defined in item (ii) of this paragraph from exceeding the fiscal year 1995 administrative cost per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>child support dollar collected by the Child Support Enforcement Administration in the Pilot Program areas.... \u201d This language indicates clearly the primary concern of privatization: to save the State money by ensuring that funds paid to a private contractor are lower than the administrative cost of enforcing child support obligations through means in place prior to the initiation of the privatization program.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">The financial interests of the State are also implicated by the level of performance of its child support enforcement offices, be it private or public. Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 658a (2005), the federal government pays incentives to States based on their performance with regard to the establishment and enforcement of child support orders and the collection of past-due child support arrearages. These incentives are deposited by the State into the Child Support Reinvestment Fund, which \u201cis a special, nonlapsing fund that shall consist of all of the federal performance incentive payments received by the Department of Human Resources in a fiscal year.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 10-106.1(b), (c)(1). Although the regulations promulgated pursuant to \u00a7 10-106.1 provide that \u201cthe incentive amount that would be paid to a privatized support enforcement agency in a subdivision shall be retained by [the CSEA],\u201d COMAR 07.07.11.03, this does not diminish the consequence that a heightened collection rate affects positively the financial interests of the State by increasing the level of federal incentive payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">This concern with fiscal efficiency appears to be an integral part of Maryland\u2019s child support enforcement scheme, reflected not only in \u00a7 10-119.1, but in other statutes and case law. For example, in 1978 the responsibility for child support enforcement was transferred from the Department of Parole and Probation to the Department of Human Resources. 1978 Md. Laws, Chap. 885. The legislative history reveals that this change was made in the interest of fiscal efficiency and a more streamlined collection process. <em>See </em>Report to the House Appropriations Committee of the Maryland General Assembly on Domestic Collections in Maryland, Department of Human Resources, 20 December 1977 (stating the Department\u2019s sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>port for the proposed legislation because it \u201cbest serves all the citizens of the State by having the potential for increasing the amount of support actually collected, reducing welfare costs, and reducing the costs of administering the system\u201d); Statement of Roger P. Winter, Assistant Secretary of Human Resources, H.B. 607, 19 January 1978 (stating that the Department \u201chas the incentive to manage the Domestic Collections program well. Collection efforts on behalf of welfare clients can substantially cut the payout of welfare funds\u201d).<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Even the paternity statutes, codified at \u00a7 5-1001 <em>et seq., </em>state as their express purpose not only the promotion of \u201cthe general welfare and best interests of children born out of wedlock,\u201d but also the \u201cimposition] on the mothers and fathers of children born out of wedlock the basic obligations and responsibilities of parenthood.\u201d \u00a7 5 \u2014 1002(b); <em>see Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number><em>wealth of Virginia ex rel. Halsey v. Autry, </em>293 Md. 53, 61, 441 A.2d 1056, 1060 (1982) (finding that one of the main purposes of the paternity statutes \u201cis to shift the burden of support from the taxpayers to the parents of the illegitimate child\u201d); <em>Mayor of Rockville v. Randolph, </em>267 Md. 56, 61, 296 A.2d 574, 576 (1972) (finding that the \u201cmain purpose [of the paternity statutes] is the shifting of some of the burden of financial support of illegitimates from the taxpayer to the father\u201d (citations omitted)). Because the CSEA is not obligated, under \u00a7 10-112, to apply transcendently the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard, if at all, we conclude that it is reasonable, in light of the foregoing financial considerations, to premise the refusal to exercise discretion under \u00a7 10-112 to grant an obligor\u2019s request for relief on concerns over the potential fiscal impact to the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Harvey maintains that the CSEA\u2019s acquiescence in BCOCSE\u2019s objections to the proposed forgiveness plan based on an impact on its \u201ccollection rate\u201d represented an illegitimate,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> and thus \u201carbitrary or capricious,\u201d motivation for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>declining to exercise discretion under \u00a7 10-112. Harvey argues that because BCOCSE played a role in objecting, based on its own pecuniary interest, to the forgiveness of his arrearages, it was no different from arrangements, struck down by courts, that create private financial benefits or incentives for the decision-maker. <em>See, e.g., Ward v. Village of Monroeville, </em>409 U.S. 57, 93 S.Ct. 80, 34 L.Ed.2d 267 (1972) (finding violative of the Due Process Clause an arrangement in which a municipal mayor, who had responsibilities related to the raising of revenues, sat also as a judge in traffic citation matters). These cases and their legal reasoning, however, are not applicable to the present matter. As indicated above, the General Assembly believed that certain financial incentives were necessary to fulfill the purpose of the privatization legislation, incentives that were incorporated into private contracts between the CSEA and BCOCSE. In performing most child support responsibilities, however, BCOCSE does not exercise meaningful discretion, but merely performs ministerial acts relating to the enforcement of child support obligations. Although BCOCSE apparently was concerned with its \u201ccollection rate\u201d in regard to how it would affect its performance under its contract, such concern was congruent with the aims of the CSEA and the General Assembly, which placed such incentives into the private child support scheme. The litigants in <em>Ward </em>were entitled to an impartial judge, expected to make a decision on the merits of the case presented, without regard to the impact on the municipal coffers. In the present case, however, the CSEA was bound, by the Legislature, to exercise its discretion to forgive arrearages only when it was \u201cin the best interest of this State.\u201d \u00a7 10-112. Although BCOCSE\u2019s objections, as well as the CSEA\u2019s acquiescence in those objections, were motivated by the pecuniary aims of those entities, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>those aims were also within \u201cthe best interest of this State.\u201d Thus, by premising BCOCSE\u2019s compensation on its \u201ccollection rate,\u201d the Legislature apparently believed that such an incentive would result in a private company achieving, through more efficient means, the objective inherent in the privatization of child support enforcement: a positive financial impact on the State. In this respect, we find that the CSEA did not act unreasonably in being persuaded that allowing BCOCSE to improve its collection rate was \u201cin the best interest of this State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Harvey finally argues that it was \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d for the CSEA to premise the rejection of his request for forgiveness of arrearages on the technological shortcomings of BCOCSE being unable to factor such a result into its record-keeping system. In recommending that Harvey\u2019s request be denied, BCOCSE stated that its computer system was not capable of monitoring Harvey\u2019s child support account without triggering automatically certain enforcement provisions, such as the interception of tax refunds. Harvey claims that this is \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d because it sacrifices individualized treatment in favor of administrative efficiency. When administrative agencies are faced with a high volume of transactions and accounts, it is not \u201carbitrary or capricious,\u201d as a matter of law, for such agencies to implement an automated or computerized system that emphasizes administrative efficiency at the expense of some degree of individualized treatment. Requests that come before the CSEA and BCOCSE are given individualized treatment, subject to the administrative limitations that have been put in place. By making the all-too-common and arguably necessary decision to install computerized databases and enforcement mechanisms, the CSEA and BCOCSE have not acted in an \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d manner, but instead, like many other government agencies and private corporations, have recognized the net benefits of those systems. Nonetheless, we understand Harvey\u2019s frustration in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Harvey states in his brief: \u201cThere is nothing in the record that suggests that the current configuration of the computer system is a necessity or that the automated enforcement activities that it generates cannot be overridden in an individual case by a stroke of the keyboard, where circumstances so warrant.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Brief at 85 n. 16. Although we recognize that the CSEA\u2019s decision to decline forgiveness of Harvey\u2019s arrearages may be \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d if BCOCSE\u2019s computer system was in fact configured to administer the CSEA\u2019s proposal effectively, the burden to demonstrate such failure does not fall on the CSEA or BCOCSE. When an individual alleges that an agency\u2019s decision is \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d based on a factual issue, the burden lies on the individual to provide factual evidence to the court. In this case, Harvey presented no evidence suggesting that the automated system utilized by BCOCSE actually had the capability to implement Harvey\u2019s request effectively or that the CSEA or BCOCSE was aware of any method of overriding the noted deficiencies within the existing system.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

The 1986 and 1989 consent paternity decrees established Harvey as the biological father of only his three youngest children.

The Court of Special Appeals, in its opinion in this case, relied on this figure as the total amount of arrearage owed by Harvey. The CSEA arrived at this figure as the result of an audit of Harvey's child support case, numbered by BCOCSE as 320021417, taking into account the court order terminating the accrual of his obligations as of 1 October 1996. Correspondence from BCOCSE to Legal Aid, however, indicated that, as of the time of the proceedings in the Circuit Court, Harvey owed child support arrearages of more than $5,000 on an additional account, numbered 610021258. Based on the record, it appears that case 320021417 included arrearages owed for his children born to Ms. Marshall, with case 610021258 representing child support owed for Keawoni.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b387-8\">.

We assume that, in his 2002 motion, Harvey\u2019s statutory references were to the 1999 replacement volume of the Family Law Article, which, in regard to the statutes relevant to this matter, are identical to those in the 2004 replacement volume.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b387-10\">.

Because, at the time of the relevant 20 November 2001 court order, the CSEA had not made yet the decision not to exercise its discretion in Harvey\u2019s favor (and therefore a cause of action did not yet exist), we shall consider CSEA's argument only with respect to a court\u2019s ability to eliminate completely his arrearages under \u00a7 5-1038(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b392-10\">.

Although appellate courts frequently consult and rely on dictionary definitions in their analysis of statutory language, often without explanation for why a particular dictionary was consulted, the question as to which edition of a particular dictionary is utilized in a given situation presents a more puzzling inquiry. Sometimes it seems that random chance is determinative, based on whatever edition is on a library shelf within reach of the author at the time of composition of the opinion. Because we are attempting to ascertain the intent of the Legislature in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>choosing certain language at a point in time, resort to a dictionary, legal or otherwise, should logically include consultation of those editions (in addition to current editions) of dictionaries that were extant at the time of the pertinent legislative enactments. <em>See Rossville Vending Mach.

Harvey gives us no indication as to why he chose to rely on the fourth edition of Black's, nor does he make mention of the definition of \"modify\u201d in either edition. We note, however, that, although the definition of \"modify\u201d in the fourth edition of Black's is near identical to the definition of \"modify\u201d in the fifth edition, the eighth (and current) edition of Black\u2019s does not contain an entry or definition for \"modify,\u201d instead including only a definition for \"modification.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b396-6\">.

Because \u00a7 12-104 does not address a \"set aside,\" it may be appropriate to examine a definition of \"set aside\" from a dictionary published contemporaneously with the enactment of the language found in \u00a7 5-1038(b). As indicated <em>infra, </em>that particular language was enacted in 1963. 1963 Md. Laws, Chap. 722.

In the instant case [involving the ability of a court to set aside or modify an order dismissing a paternity action], we must construe \u00a7 (b) of the same statute, and we hold that it means what it says, <em>i.e., </em>that <em>all </em>paternity orders except declarations of paternity can be modified or set aside \"in light of the circumstances and in the best interests of the child.\u201d ... Although there is virtually no legislative history which would shed light on the construction of FL \u00a7 5-1038(b), the statute is pellucid; it was obviously intended to relax the usual rules of finality for all paternity orders except for declarations of paternity contained in a paternity order. There would be no reason for FL \u00a7 5 \u2014 1038(b) unless the statute was intended to permit a paternity court to modify or set aside any prior order where just and proper and in the best interests of the child, regardless of the usual rules of finality applicable to non-paternity cases.

While this passage is certainly applicable to the circumstances of <em>Jessica.

To accept this dicta in <em>Jessica G. </em>wholesale that the \"orders\u201d to which \u00a7 5 \u2014 1038(b) are applicable are \"all inclusive\u201d would render \u00a7 12-104 completely impotent. Harvey concedes that, at the very least, \u00a7 12-104 prohibits the retrospective modification (inserting, of course, his definition of modification) of child support orders, something that is clearly in conflict with the language of the passage in <em>Jessica G. </em>We therefore conclude that, although the language in <em>Jessica G. </em>is instructive as to the generally broad scope of \u00a7 5-1038(b), it aids <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>little ill terms of determining when that broad scope is qualified or narrowed by an exception in a competing statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b408-7\">.

Ehrlich, Jr. signed into law legislation amending \u00a7 10-112 to include the following provisions placing the exercise of discretion under \u00a7 10-112 within the ambit of the APA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">(B)(2)(i) If the Administration does not accept in full settlement of an arrearage in child support payments an amount that is less than the total arrearage under this subsection, the Administration shall notify the obligor of the decision and of the obligor's right to appeal the decision to the Office of Administrative Hearings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-9\">(ii) An appeal under this subsection shall be conducted in accordance with Title 10, Subtitle 2 of the State Government Article. 2005 Md. Laws, Chap. 595. This provision became effective on 1 October 2005.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b410-5\">. The intermediate appellate court also stated that, \"[a]lthough an agency's refusal or failure to make a decision may justify mandamus relief in some instances, ... we do not see how mandamus could be applied to this case.\u201d <em>Harvey, </em>158 Md.App. at 380, 857 A.2d at 544. We have recognized that mandamus may be an appropriate avenue of relief when a party is attempting to secure judicial review of an administrative decision where no statutory remedy provides for such review. In <em>Gould, </em>we described the nature of mandamus relief:</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">[Mjandamus, as generally used, is to compel inferior tribunals, public officials or administrative agencies to perform their function, or perform some particular duty imposed upon them which in its nature is imperative and to the performance of which duty the party applying for the writ has a clear legal right.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">273 Md. at 514, 331 A.2d at 72. Thus, it appears that the substance of a petition for mandamus involves two complimentary requirements: 1) a clear right on the part of the petitioner to the relief requested, and 2) a clear duty on the part of the administrative agency to perform the particular duty implicated. Harvey, however, has no clear right to have his child support arrearages forgiven under \u00a7 10-112. Sec. 10-112 involves the extinguishment or reduction of a legal obligation to pay child support, imposed by a court under circumstances in which Harvey had the opportunity to contest the imposition of such an obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">We also note that \u00a7 10-112 was enacted in order to allow (as opposed to mandate) the CSEA to forgive child support arrearages in its discretion. There is no duty on the part of the CSEA to reduce or eliminate child support arrearages in any case. Even if the CSEA were to concede that forgiveness in a particular case was within \u201cthe best interest of this State,\u201d such a finding does not create a legal duty to exercise that discretion in a particular way. Instead, any action taken pursuant to \u00a7 10-112 is entirely at the CSEA's discretion, and may not be compelled under a petition for mandamus relief. <em>See Bd. of Educ. v. Secy. of Personnel, </em>317 Md. 34, 46-47, 562 A.2d 700, 706 (1989) (finding that mandamus relief to compel the Secretary of Personnel to issue a declaratory ruling under the Administrative Procedure Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>would be improper because such a decision is \"clearly a matter of the agency's discretion\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b411-7\">. A worthy argument can be made (though not mounted by the CSEA in this case) that the CSEA\u2019s action (or inaction) is not of the type reviewable by the courts. The Court of Special Appeals, in considering Harvey's argument that the CSEA failed to exercise properly its discretion by failing to act. on \"his request to forgive state-owed arrears,\u201d expressed trepidation as to the ability and scope of a court\u2019s review of the type of agency conduct as occurred here, whether via a court\u2019s inherent power to review agency actions to prevent \u201carbitrary, illegal, capricious or unreasonable\u201d administrative action or by mandamus. 158 Md.App. at 380-81, 857 A.2d at 544-45. Despite these reservations, the intermediate appellate court, electing a \"belt-and-suspenders\u201d approach in its analysis, reached the merits of Harvey\u2019s argument insofar as it was argued that the CSEA's conduct was illegal or unreasonable, which the court concluded violated neither standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">A case not relied upon by either party or the Court of Special Appeals, however, hints that (he type of discretionary authority vested in the CSEA by \u00a7 10-112 may represent a potential matter of grace, the exercise or non-exercise of discretion as to which may not be reviewable properly by the courts. In <em>State Department of Assessments and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number><em>Taxation v. Clark, </em>281 Md. 385, 380 A.2d 28 (1977), this Court chose to consider whether a circuit court may exercise jurisdiction over a declaratory judgment action (which sought a declaration of unconstitutionality on equal protection and due process grounds, in the application of a statute, as well as injunctive relief) seeking review of the gratuitous reduction of a real property tax assessment by a local taxing authority. At the time of the operative facts in <em>Clark, </em>real property tax assessments were an annual ritual, with dates of finality from which a full panoply of administrative and judicial appellate rights attached for the benefit of affected property owners. Each year brought new dates of finality, triggering new appeal opportunities. The statutory scheme also provided that the local assessing authorities, by order, could decrease or abate an assessment after the date of finality in any year \"in order to correct erroneous and improper assessments and to prevent injustice....\u201d 281 Md. at 388, 380 A.2d at 31 (citing Md. Code (1957, 1975 Repl. Vol.), Art. 81, \u00a7 67). No provision for further administrative or judicial review of a decision made under Art. 81, \u00a7 67 appeared in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">The Clarks' Montgomery County property was re-assessed, following rezoning in 1971, for the 1972 tax year. They did not protest or appeal the re-assessment before the 1 January 1972 date of finality. In May 1972, a sewer moratorium was declared that prevented immediate development of the Clarks\u2019 rezoned property. In August 1972, the Clarks sought a reassessment because of the moratorium. The local assessing authority, after a hearing at which the Clarks and their counsel presented evidence and argument, granted a 25% reduction in February 1973. <em>Id. </em>at 389, 380 A.2d at 31. Unsatisfied with the amount of the reduction, the Clarks appealed to the Maryland Tax Court in April 1973, but that administrative body dismissed the appeal in August 1974. Although the Clarks noted an \"appeal\u201d of that dismissal to the Court of Appeals, we ultimately dismissed the case in August 1975. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">While the Clarks' appeal to the Tax Court was pending, they concurrently initiated an original action in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, against the local tax assessing authorities and the State Department of Assessment and Taxation, seeking a declaration that Art. 81, \u00a7 67, as applied to them, violated equal protection and due process principles to the point of being a taking, and an injunction against the levy and collection of the tax until a rehearing was held on the question of the value of their property as affected by the sewer moratorium. <em>Id. </em>at 389-90, 380 A.2d at 31-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">Of potential relevance to the present case, the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Clark, </em>over the protests of the assessing authorities that the statutory remedies in Art. 81 for contesting property assessments were exclusive, concluded that it had inherent power to consider the Clarks' declaratory judgment action. <em>Id. </em>at 390, 380 A.2d at 32. Thus, in the posture in which the case ultimately was briefed and argued before the Court of Appeals, the question was presented squarely whether the administrative agencies' decision to grant a reduction in assessment under Art. 81, \u00a7 67, after the date of finality in the relevant tax year, was reviewable by the courts at all and, if so, under what authority and according to what standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>The Court in <em>Clark </em>first attached significance in its analysis to several general considerations: (1) a declaratory judgment action may not be utilized in lieu of a special statutory remedy provided for in a specific type of case; (2) Art. 81 provided for a thorough scheme of administrative and judicial appeals from annual assessment decisions, keyed to the date of finality, but did not include decisions made pursuant to \u00a7 67 in that scheme; and (3) recognition of the importance to die Government in achieving a balanced budget through the ascertainment of a tax base, fixing a tax rate, and the accurate calculation and timely levy of taxes, all keyed necessarily to fixing a time for final establishment of assessments. <em>Id. </em>at 391-94, 380 A.2d at 32-34. Grounded on these premises, the analysis continued by focusing on ihe role Art. 81, \u00a7 67 played in the scheme. Relying on earlier cases, the Court noted that: (1) \u00a7 67 only comes into play between dates of finality; (2) no statutory authority existed conferring on a higher administrative tribunal the power to review decisions made by the local assessing authorities under \u00a7 67; (3) \u00a7 67 proceedings are not subject to judicial review under the State Administrative Procedure Act; and (4) the earlier cases characterized the authority granted under \u00a7 67 as \u201centirely discretionary\u201d and as \u201ca matter of grace.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 394-96, 380 A.2d at 34-35. One of those cases, <em>LaBelle v. State Tax Commission, </em>217 Md. 443, 142 A.2d 560 (1958), described the petitioning property owner's legitimate expectations under \u00a7 67 as \"he can only hope that the ... authorities ... will agree that his cause is just and demands relief. If they do not, the statute gives him no further remedy and the assessment that has been allowed to become final remains on the books for the year in question.\u201d 217 Md. at 451-52, 142 A.2d at 565. Given the statutory scheme for administrative and judicial review of annual assessment decisions tied to the date of finality, the Court found no infirmity in concluding that the courts lacked either statutory or inherent authority to review \u201cthe potential extraordinary relief held out by \u00a7 67,\u201d existing as it did as a purely discretionaiy \u201cmatter of grace.\u201d <em>Clark, </em>281 Md. at 402, 380 A.2d at 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">There are many similarities between \u00a7 67 in Art. 81 as considered in <em>Clark </em>and \u00a7 10-112 in the Family Law Article. Both contain loose-fitting, amorphous standards for the exercise of their respective discretion (\"correct erroneous and improper assessments and to prevent injustice\u201d versus \u201cthe best interest of this State\u201d). Neither statutory scheme of which each provision is a part authorizes expressly either further administrative review of a decision made pursuant to the statute, or judicial review. The significance of the date of finality in <em>Clark\u2019s </em>reasoning could be argued to be of like significance to that accorded the order directing the payment of child support, protected from change by \u00a7 10-112. Yet, as important to <em>Clark </em>as was the fact that Art. 81 provided a detailed and comprehensive administrative and judicial review scheme for annual final assessment, no comparable scheme exists in the Family Law Article relative to the support order upon which \u00a7 10-112 depends for efficacy. Ultimately, in the present case, we are not. compelled to resolve whether <em>Clark\u2019s </em>reasoning would operate to deny Harvey a judicial answer to his claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b415-8\">.

This situation is unlike when child support obligations are owed directly from one parent to the other. In the latter circumstances, because the formulation of child support awards are governed by the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard, the parents lack the unilateral authority to enter into a settlement regarding child support arrearages because such an agreement would generally have the effect of reducing the aggregate amount of support to the child. <em>Duvall v.

Harvey also points out that, if State-owed child support is no longer child support, but mere debt, the ability to imprison individuals for failure to pay child support would not apply to individuals whose child support has been assigned to the State. <em>See </em>Md. Const. art. 3, \u00a7 38 (providing that \"[n]o person shall be imprisoned for debt,\" but excluding from the definition of \"debt\u201d child and spousal support arrearages); <em>Walter, </em>367 Md. at 398, 788 A.2d at 616 (stating that \u201c(t]his Court historically has recognized a distinction between a standard debt and a legal duty in domestic circumstances, specifically with respect to child support, and subscribes to the theory that child support is a duty not a debt\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b419-8\">. The Legislature has enacted several other mechanisms designed to increase the State\u2019s ability to enforce the collection of child support awards, including the interception of tax refunds and lottery prizes and the suspension of driver\u2019s licenses and professional licenses. \u00a7 10-113 (income tax refunds); \u00a7 10-113.1 (lottery prizes); \u00a7 10-119 (suspension of driving privileges); \u00a7 10-119.3 (suspension or denial of occupational licenses). Enforcement of State-owed child support obligations under the mechanisms of these statutes, however, seemingly would not be impaired by any classification of State-owed child support arrearages as mere debt because each statute states explicitly that its enforcement mechanism applies when an individual is in arrears and the CSEA \"has accepted an assignment of support under Article 88A, \u00a7 50(b)(2) of the Code ....\u201d \u00a7 10-113(a)(1); \u00a7 10-113.1(a)(1); \u00a7 10-119(b)(1)(i); \u00a7 10-119.3(e)(1)(i)(2)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b420-6\">.

Other statutes that expand on a definition of a \"best interest of the State\u201d standard implicitly invoke principles of fiscal awareness. <em>See, e.g., </em>Md. Code (1973, 2005 Repl.

In some instances, the \"best interest of the State\u201d standard is invoked in declaring a public policy. <em>See, e.g., </em>Md. Code (1973, 2005 Repl.

This legislation elaborates on the otherwise amorphous \"best interest of this State\u201d standard by adding to the current language of \u00a7 10-112 the following provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-8\">(B)(1) In a case in which an assignment has been made under Article 88A, \u00a7 50(B)(2) of the Code, there is a presumption that it is in the best interest of this State for the Administration to accept ill full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>settlement of an arrearage in child support payments an amount that is less than the total arrearage if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-6\">(i) The obligor, the individual who has made an assignment under Article 88A, \u00a7 50(B)(2) of the Code, and the child who is the subject of the support order have resided together for at least the 12 months immediately preceding a request for settlement under this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-7\">(ii) The obligor has been supporting the child for at least the 12 months immediately preceding a request for settlement under this section; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-8\">(iii) The gross income of the obligor is less than 225 percent of the federal poverty level, as defined by the United States Department of Health and Human Services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">This new language enunciates clearly and specifically a non-exhaustive set of circumstances under which the Legislature intended forgiveness of child support arrearages to be \"in the best interest of this State.\u201d Harvey is, of course, free to pursue forgiveness of his arrearages under this new statutoiy scheme. We note though that, although it appears that this legislation may have been enacted, at least in part, in response to the intermediate appellate court\u2019s decision in the present case, the enacted legislation, which took effect 1 October 2005, might not apply, by its plain language, to Harvey\u2019s situation as indicated in this record. In addition to assisting low income parents to reduce the financial strains of accumulated arrearages, H.B. 1181 also \u201crewards parents who are fulfilling their parental responsibilities by living with and providing for their children.\u201d Testimony of Delegate Samuel (\"Sandy\u201d) I. Rosenberg before the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee in Support of H.B. 1181, 29 March 2005; <em>see also </em>Letter from Brian D. Shea, Executive Director of the CSEA, to Senator Brian E. Frosh, Chairman, Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, 28 March 2005 (stating the CSEA's support for the final version of H.B. 1181 because it is \"committed to adopting State policies that help to encourage family formation\u201d). This concept of \"family formation,\u201d however, apparently applies only to those circumstances where the obligor and obligee reunite. Because the record indicates that the mother of one of Harvey\u2019s pertinent children is deceased, under the language of \u00a7 10-112 as amended there may not be a presumption that forgiveness of Harvey\u2019s arrearage, with respect to that child, would be \"in the best interest of this State.\u201d Ironically, Harvey also may have precluded the application of this presumption, designed to encourage \"family formation,\u201d by remarrying.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">We also note, however, that the initial version of H.B. 1181, introduced by Del. Rosenberg, did not include any language limiting a presumption to those situations in which the child, the obligor parent, and the obligee parent reside together. In fact, the initial version of H.B. 1181 stated that, with limited exceptions,</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">... the Administration shall suspend, for a period of 3 years, the collection of an arrearage in child support payments, if the obligor provides satisfactory proof that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-12\">(i) the obligor and the child who is the subject of the support order reside together; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-13\">(ii) the obligor is supporting the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>This initial version provided that an obligor would be able to reapply every three years, indefinitely, for suspension of child support arrearages. The proposed legislation was amended, apparently in response to criticism of certain provisions of the bill by Legal Aid. Legal Aid, which represented Harvey during his interaction with the CSEA and BCOCSE, and later as co-counsel in both the Court of Special Appeals and this Court, stated in its testimony before the House Judiciary Committee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-6\">Relief from [child support arrearages owed to the State] to enable a low-income obligor to provide for his or her child is preferable to a three year moratorium on collection because it removes an economic barrier to family stability rather than simply postponing enforcement and leaving the family with the uncertainty associated with having to repay a debt that may exceed the family\u2019s resources. Therefore, Legal Aid urges the Committee to amend the legislation to establish a clear presumption in favor of abatement or set aside of state-owed arrearages for obligors who reunite with and support their children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Au0\">Testimony of the Legal Aid Bureau, Inc. regarding H.B. 1181 before the House Judiciary Committee, 23 February 2005. The House Judiciary Committee apparently responded positively to Legal Aid's advocacy by implementing the proposed amendments. In doing so, however, the Committee also added the requirement that, in order for the presumption to apply, the assignor/obligee parent must also reside with the obligor and the child(ren). This requirement reflects similar provisions in the statutes or regulations of other States allowing settlement or compromise of past arrearages. <em>See, e.g., </em>Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 33, \u00a7 4106(e) (2001) (stating that \"[ijf [child support] arrearages accrue after support rights have been assigned [to the State] and the obligor and obligee subsequently reunite, the office of child support may not take any action to collect the support arrearages [unless the combined family income exceeds certain figures]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">The most notable and conspicuous feature of the enacted legislation, from the perspective of any potential impact on the present case, is the absence of any mention of the \"best interests of the child\u201d standard or any reference to \u00a7 10-118. Although Legal Aid, in its testimony before the Committee, maintained that \u00a7 10-112 is subject to \u00a7 10-118, it made no effort to advocate for language in \u00a7 10-112 explicitly suggesting as such. Instead, by expressly qualifying the \"best interest of this State\u201d standard in \u00a7 10-112 with a presumption that involves only a small portion of those circumstances under which forgiveness would be in the \"best interests of tire child,\u201d one might conclude logically that the Legislature intended that other situations where forgiveness might be in the \"best interests of the child\" nonetheless would be subordinate to the \"best interest of this State\u201d standard. Indeed, had the Legislature believed that \u00a7 10-118 applied to \u00a7 10-112, there would be little need for the presumption now found in \u00a7 10-112.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b424-7\">. We note that \u00a7 5-1038(b), relied upon by Harvey as a statute mandating the application of the \"best interests of the child\u201d standard, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>in fact requires, by its plain language, consideration of more than just that standard. Sec. 5 \u2014 103 8(b) allows the modification or set aside of a paternity-related order \"as the court considers just and proper in light of the circumstances <em>and </em>in the best interests of the child.\u201d (Emphasis added). Although we imagine that most circumstances that would be \"just and proper\u201d would also be \"in the best interests of the child\u201d (and vice versa), it would appear that the statute contemplates the possibility of some circumstances where modification or set aside may affect a child positively, but, in light of all circumstances, would not be just and proper.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b425-7\">. We applaud Harvey\u2019s initiative and character in reuniting with and providing current support for his biological children and extended family; however, his brief and oral argument before us failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>acknowledge his longstanding, pre-existing failure to fulfill his legal obligation to pay child support. Harvey is theoretically better off financially today as a result of not fulfilling his obligation to support his children prior to 1996. Yet Harvey now beseeches, in the name of his children, to erase the result of his past shortcomings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b426-8\">. Harvey uses as an example of the pervasive nature of \u00a7 10-118 the legislative history of House Bill 403 during the 2004 General Assembly session, a bill relating to the mandatory revocation of driving privileges for individuals with child support arrearages. Although H.B. 403 and its companion, Senate Bill 217, died in committee, House Bill 605, which contained the same language as H.B. 403 and S.B. 217, was signed into law by the Governor on 26 May 2004.2004 Md. Laws, Chap. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>509. As first introduced, these bills sought to change the language of \u00a7 10 \u2014 119 by requiring the CSEA to inform the Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA) of an obligor\u2019s arrearages to a statutory scheme allowing the CSEA the discretion to take into account certain considerations, including whether the suspension is in \"the best interests of the obligor\u2019s child,\u201d when determining whether to refer an obligor to the MVA for suspension. In statements before the House Judiciary Committee, however, the executive director of the CSEA objected to the \u201cbest interests of the obligor\u2019s child\" language, stating that such language was unnecessary in light of \u00a7 10-118. <em>See </em>Statement of Brian Shea, Executive Director, CSEA, before the House Judiciary Committee, H.B. 403, 19 February 2004. The language in H.B. 605 was amended in committee to reflect this recommendation by the CSEA. 2004 Md. Laws, Chap. 509. Harvey argues that this testimony, and the subsequent. amendment to H.B. 605, demonstrate that \"the best interests of the child doctrine is present and controlling throughout the enlire child support statutory framework, even if not specifically stated in a particular provision.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Brief at 28. Although this legislative anecdote is certainly illustrative of the scope, in isolation, of \u00a7 10-118, it sheds very little light on situations, such as the present one, where a completely different standard has been enunciated by the Legislature. When a child support statute appears without qualification, we are well instructed that \u00a7 10-118 and its \"best interests of the child\" language govern such a statute. When the Legislature explicitly includes a standard that may compete with or transcend the standard found in \u00a7 10-118, however, we must not surrender automatically to the language of \u00a7 10-118, but rather must examine that language as we would any other statutory pronouncement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b428-5\">. This is not to say that the CSEA may not factor into its calculus the \"best interests of the child\u201d when exercising its discretion whether to forgive child support arrearages. We hold, rather, that that standard is neither the sole or paramount one controlling such decisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b428-6\">. Harvey also argues that the CSEA\u2019s apparent failure to consider the \"best interests of the child\" was \"arbitrary, illegal, capricious or unreasonable\u201d because it was contrary to and inconsistent with the CSEA's stated \"guiding principle,\u201d included in its mission statement, to keep the \"best interest of the child [as] our highest priority.\" Although we recognize an agency decision may be deemed \"arbitrary or capricious\u201d if it ignores the expressly stated policy goals of the agency, <em>see </em>Arnold Rochvarg, <em>Maryland Administrative Law </em>\u00a7 4.38 at 129 (2001, 2004 Supp.), we find that the CSEA was not obligated to apply, as a result of this arguably aspirational policy goal, the \"best interest of the child\u201d standard in declining to forgive Harvey\u2019s child support arrearages. In situations in which courts have determined that stated policy goals may influence a finding of \"arbitrary, illegal, capricious or unreasonable\u201d action, the stated policy goal has referred explicitly and specifically to the particular action or exercise of discretion being challenged. <em>See, e.g., Hurl, </em>107 Md.App. at 306-09, 667 A.2d at 980-82 (finding that a transfer must be within \"sound educational policy\u201d). When an administrative agency adopts, on its own, a broad or aspira<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>tional policy goal outside the formal rule-making process and does not specifically address a particular agency action, the impact of such a policy statement on our analysis of the present matter is questionable at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">Likewise, Harvey included in his Reply Brief in this Court statements by the CSEA's Executive Director regarding an arrearage forgiveness program under development that, as Harvey argues, \"clearly indicates an explicit policy understanding by CSEA that the interests of the State are aligned with the best interests of the children.\" Petitioner's Reply Brief at 16. Although the \"best interest of this State\" may at times converge with the \"best interests of the child,\u201d Harvey presents no evidence that the proposed arrearage forgiveness program ever was implemented or that the CSEA deviated from a current adopted policy in his case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b431-9\">. The irony hidden in the potential of the \"arbitrary or capricious\u201d standard to be itself at times vague or nebulous in explanation and/or application does not escape us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b432-6\">. We note that earlier editions of Black's, including those cited in <em>Maryland Administrative Law </em>and several Maryland cases, contain remarkably different definitions of both \"arbitrary\u201d and \"capricious,\u201d and contain a separate definition of \"arbitrary and capricious\" that apparently was removed beginning with the seventh edition. The sixth edition of Black\u2019s defines \"arbitrary\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-7\">In an unreasonable manner, as fixed or done capriciously or at pleasure. Without adequate determining principle; not founded in the nature of things; nonrational; not done or acting according to reason or judgment; depending on the will alone; absolutely in power; capriciously; tyrannical; despotic; ... Without fair, solid, and substantial cause; that is, without cause based upon the law, ... not governed by any fixed rules or standard. Willful and unreasoning action, without consideration and regard for facts and circumstances presented----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">Black's Law Dictionary 104-05 (6th ed. 1990). \"Capricious disregard\u201d was defined as \"[a] wilful and deliberate disregard of competent testimony and relevant evidence which one of ordinary intelligence could not possibly have avoided in reaching the result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 211. This earlier edition of Black\u2019s defines \"arbitrary and capricious\u201d as \"[cjharacterization of a decision or action taken by an administrative agency or inferior court meaning willful and unreasonable action without consideration or in disregard of facts or law or without determining principle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 105. As with the definitions of \"modification\u201d and \"set aside\u201d referenced earlier in this opinion, Black\u2019s gives no indication for why these definitions were altered, or, in this instance, completely removed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b439-6\">. Harvey characterizes his attempts to achieve forgiveness of his child support arrearages as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-7\">Mr. Harvey again requested CSEA to exercise its discretion under FL \u00a7 10-112 to abate the remaining state-owed arrearages, which the agency's Executive Director promised to do in her July 6, 2001 letter.... The Executive Director then told MAXIMUS/BCOCSE to essentially suspend collection, but then acquiesced to MAXI-MUS/BCOCSE\u2019s refusal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">Petitioner's Reply Brief at 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b440-7\">. Although Harvey explicitly states that he is not \"attacking\u201d the statutory child support privatization scheme, the amicus brief submitted in support of Harvey is not so reserved. The Public Justice Center (\"PJC\u201d) presents a critique of privatization of governmental services, both locally and nationally. What the PJC fails to realize is that this case is not about the merits of privatization. This case is about whether a decision made by an administrative agency to refuse to exercise its statutory discretion to forgive child support arrearages, based on the recommendation of a private delegate, may be characterized as \"arbitrary or capricious.\u201d There is nothing \u201carbitrary or capricious,\u201d however, about a decision, based on sound reasoning, that, for whatever reason, is not as effective as originally thought. Neither this Court, nor any court, is vested with authority to second guess the Legislature on such a record as the one in this case. If the PJC, or any interested citizen, believes that privatization is not a wise policy choice, he, she, or it may exercise the right to petition the Legislature to change the statutory law. It is not our choice to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">Nor is this the correct forum in which to air effectively grievances and complaints about MAXIMUS, the private organization operating BCOCSE at the time of the operative facts of this case. <em>See </em>Amicus Brief at 11 (highlighting a study that characterized management of BCOCSE during the tenure of MAXIMUS as \"not encouraging\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 19 (accusing MAXIMUS of mishandling child support cases in Colorado); <em>id. </em>at 20-21 (citing concerns by the CSEA in 2002 that MAXIMUS was mishandling child support cases in Maryland as illustrative generally of \"the risk of serious harm to individuals served by government programs under privatization\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b441-7\">.

H.B. 1177, as amended, received a favorable report from the Appropriations Committee and later passed the House of Delegates on 23 March 1995.

On 6 April 1995, the full Senate rejected the legislation by a vote of 23-24, and H.B. 1177 died. At this point, S.B. 754 had passed the Senate without any privatization provisions and was awaiting action in the House Appi'opriations Committee.

This same fiscal rationale also is found in the legislative histories of the enactment of several child support enforcement mechanisms, including the interception of lottery prizes, <em>see </em>Department of Fiscal Services, Fiscal Note Revised 1988, S.B. 441 (ultimately codified at \u00a7 10-113.1) (stating that the proposed legislation would result in general funds revenues increasing due to increased AFDC collections and federal incentives), earnings withholding orders, <em>see </em>Department of Fiscal Services, Fiscal Note Revised 1985, H.B. 618 (ultimately codified at \u00a7 10-120 <em>et seq.) </em>(finding that the proposed legislation would result in the receipt of \u201can estimated $462,292 in AFDC offset funds ... in FY 86\"), and the suspension of driving privileges. <em>See </em>Department of Fiscal Services, Fiscal Note Revised 1995, S.B. 754 (ultimately codified at \u00a7 10-119) (estimating that $13.6 million in AFDC-related delinquent child support payments could be collected through the suspension of driver's licenses in the first year alone, with \"[f]uture year state AFDC related child support collections ... increas[ing] by $3.4 million annually thereafter\u201d). Furthermore, this fiscal purpose also was present in legislation authorizing the interception of income tax refunds, initially only in those situations in which the obligee parent had assigned his other child support rights to the State as a condition of receiving welfare assistance. <em>See </em>Letter from Bill B. Benton, Deputy Secretary, Department of Human Resources to Hon. Tyras S.

As an example of a \"wholly illegitimate\u201d pecuniary self-interest of a private company, Harvey cites <em>Rozmus v. Rozmus, </em>257 Neb. 142, 595 N.W.2d 893 (1999). In <em>Rozmus, </em>the State contracted with a private, for-profit company, Policy Studies, Inc. (\"PSI\u201d), to represent the State in judicial and administrative hearings with regard to child support enforcement proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 895. The public defender's office, along with other public interest organizations, filed motions in court to disqualify PSI and its attorneys based on allegations that PSI was committing the unauthorized practice of law. The Nebraska trial court agreed. <em>Id. </em>at 896. Although the State did not appeal these disqualification orders, PSI did. <em>Id. </em>at 897. The Nebraska Supreme Court, however, found that PSI had no standing to appeal the disqualification orders because its client, the State, did not wish to pursue an appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 897-98. In doing so, the court commented on one aspect of PSI's \"interest\u201d in the case:</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">Although PSI may arguably have an \"interest\u201d in making more money, that interest is, at best, peripheral to the real interest at stake in a disqualification proceeding, which is the client\u2019s interest in having the attorney of his or her choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 898.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">Despite Harvey's perception of its significance, we find that this case supports, rather than refutes, the legitimacy of the financial incentives granted to a private company in performing government services. The analysis discounting PSI\u2019s pecuniary \"interest\u201d occurs in the context of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>the attorney-client relationship, reaffirming that an attorney's financial interest in his or her client's claim is secondary to the client's control over the claim.
