In evaluating the propriety of these actions, we first must determine whether the Chairman of the five member Commission, Kenneth D. Schisler, exceeded his authority when, on his initiative, he terminated Wilson without the approval, acquiescence, or delegation of authority of a majority of the full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>membership of the Commission. We also must determine whether the Circuit Court erred in concluding that, as to the initial termination or re-termination, Wilson was terminated \u201cfor cause\u201d and was thus entitled to the statutory protections of Md.Code (1993, 2004 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 11-106 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article. Finally, we must determine, assuming Wilson was discharged simply because she served at the pleasure of the appointing authority, whether the Circuit Court erred in finding that the administrative appeal process provided by statute for such a termination violated due process principles because it only provides for an appeal to the Chairman of the Commission, who, in this case, made the initial decision to terminate Wilson and participated as a member of the Commission in the re-termination action as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">On 15 April 2004, without prior notice that such an action was forthcoming, Chrys Wilson was terminated from her employment as Manager of the Office of External Relations with the Maryland Public Service Commission (\u201cPSC\u201d), a position that she held since 1996. Wilson\u2019s termination took place at the same time four other non-temporary employees of the Commission were removed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The decision to terminate Wilson was made by the Chairman of the Commission, Kenneth D. Schisler.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although Chairman Schisler, in making this personnel decision, allegedly consulted individuals outside of the PSC, he did not seek approval from the other members of the Commission, which consists of five Commissioners (including the Chairman).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>In a deposition taken by Wilson on 27 September 2004 in the present litigation, Chairman Schisler stated that, prior to Wilson\u2019s termination, he felt that she did not possess sufficient skills, judgment, or work ethic to perform in her position at the level he desired. He also stated that he suspected that, on one occasion, she may have misrepresented on her time sheet the amount of time she actually worked on a given day. The Chairman, however, claimed to have concluded ultimately, as to the time sheet incident, that there was insufficient evidence of wrongdoing and, for that reason, he neither sought nor imposed any disciplinary sanctions. Chairman Schisler denied in his deposition that he based his termination decision on any performance issues or the incident involving the time sheet. Instead, he pointed out that he did not need to give a reason for Wilson\u2019s termination because of her status as an at-will employee. Indeed, Chairman Schisler\u2019s 15 April 2004 memorandum to Wilson advising her of her termination assigned no reason for the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">At the request of the group of terminated PSC employees and a member of the Legislature, on 27 April 2004 an Assistant Attorney General of Maryland issued an advice letter analyzing the authority of the Chairman to terminate certain employees without the approval of the full Commission. This letter concluded that, under the relevant statutory scheme, the termination of an employee in the management service<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> may only be effectuated by the \u201cappointing authority,\u201d which by statute possesses the exclusive power to terminate certain at-will employees of the PSC. The Assistant Attorney General concluded that the five Commissioners, as a body, constituted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>the \u201cappointing authority\u201d of the PSC. The Chairman of the Commission, she concluded, possesses the authority to terminate a management service employee \u201conly if [that authority] has been delegated to him [or her] by the Commission as a whole.\u201d If such a delegation has not been made, the letter opined, the termination of the affected employees would be outside the Chairman\u2019s authority and therefore illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Also on 27 April 2004, Wilson apparently filed with the Commission an administrative appeal of her termination pursuant to Md.Code (1993, 2004 RepLVol.), \u00a7 11-113 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> on the grounds that her termination was illegal and unconstitutional.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Two days later, three of the Commissioners serving on the Commission at the time of the termination of Wilson signed an affidavit stating that they \u201cdid not participate in or direct the termination of [the five employees, including Wilson, terminated by Chairman Schisler on 15 April 2004],\u201d nor did they delegate to Chairman Schisler \u201cany authority to terminate the employment of the aforementioned employees.\u201d Nonetheless, on 12 May 2004, Chairman Schisler, as \u201chead of the principal unit,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> reviewed, in light of the apparent issues raised in her appeal, his decision to terminate Wilson and denied her administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>appeal. In a letter explaining his reasons for denying her appeal, the Chairman concluded that, as a management service employee, Wilson was an at-will employee, was not fired \u201cfor cause,\u201d and therefore not entitled to a statutory pretermination hearing. In regard to her First Amendment claim, Chairman Schisler found that Wilson had not presented sufficient evidence that she had been terminated as a result of her political affiliation, opinions, or beliefs. He also concluded that the position of Chairman was the \u201cappointing authority\u201d for the Commission and therefore his exercise of that authority, without approval, acquiescence, or delegation from the full Commission, was not illegal or unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Aggrieved by the outcome of the administrative appeal, on 27 May 2004 Wilson filed a ten count complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City seeking essentially declaratory and injunctive relief, including reinstatement as Manager of the Office of External Relations. The PSC (and Chairman Schisler) and Wilson filed cross-motions for summary judgment. On 19 October 2004, one day before the hearing on the motions, Wilson filed an amended complaint, adding significant additional factual allegations and causes of action, but abandoning others.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In her amended complaint and motion for summary judgment, Wilson claimed that her termination was illegal because it was accomplished by the Chairman acting alone, without the approval, acquiescence, or delegation of authority by at least a majority of the full Commission. Wilson also contended that, despite Chairman Schisler\u2019s statements to the contrary at his deposition, she was terminated \u201cfor cause\u201d and therefore unlawfully was denied the pretermination process guaranteed by \u00a7 11-106 before disciplinary sanctions relating to \u201cemployee misconduct\u201d could be imposed. Wilson also alleged that, in the alternative, she was terminated unconstitutionally because of her political beliefs, in violation of Article 40 of the Maryland Declaration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Rights.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Furthermore, Wilson maintained that, if she was discharged merely as an at-will employee, and not for cause, the PSC violated her due process rights by failing to provide an impartial agency adjudicator for her post-termination administrative appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The scheduled hearing on the summary judgment motions was held in the Circuit Court, notwithstanding the filing of the amended complaint only a day earlier. On 25 October 2004, the court entered an order containing the following determinations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-6\">(1) within the context of the definition of Appointing Authority, the full panel of [the] Public Service Commission comprises a unit of government; (2) the full panel of the Public Service Commission shall act as the Appointing Authority for the Commission unless the authority is delegated by a majority vote of the Commission; (3) the Chairman had neither been delegated the authority to act as the Appointing Authority by the majority of the Commission at the time Chrys Wilson was terminated; nor had a majority of the Commission acquiesced in the Commission\u2019s termination of Chrys Wilson; (4) in light of the foregoing, the termination of Chrys Wilson on April 29, 2004, by the Chairman of the Public Service Commission was unlawful; (5) termination of [Wilson] may only be accomplished by the delegated Appointing Authority, and in the absence of such delegation, a majority vote of the Commission as a whole; [and] (6) neither the Chairman nor any of his employees may lawfully serve as an agency adjudicator regarding his own decision to terminate [Wilson].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">The Circuit Court granted Wilson\u2019s motion for summary judgment, denied all of the Commission\u2019s pending motions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>and ordered that Wilson be reinstated immediately to her prior position with full back pay from the date of termination. The Circuit Court also directed that \u201cany further personnel actions related to Chrys Wilson ... be consistent with the Court\u2019s ruling....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">On 29 October 2004, the Commission sent a letter to Wilson stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-5\">[w]hile the Commission respectfully disagrees with the [Circuit] Court\u2019s determination and intends to note an appeal, the Commission currently is bound by the directive. Therefore, the Commission hereby reinstates Ms. Chrys Wilson to the position of the Manager of External Relations effective October 29, 2004.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">The letter continued, however, in a not so conciliatory way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AM\">Furthermore, the Commission hereby notifies Ms. Wilson that she is being terminated from her Management Service position with the Maryland Public Service Commission effective October 29, 2004. Ms. Wilson is directed not to report to work. Ms. Wilson is hereby granted administrative leave for October 29, 2004.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-7\">In accordance with \u00a7 11-118 of the [State Personnel and Pensions Article], Ms. Wilson may appeal the termination by filing a written appeal within 15 days of receipt of this decision. The appeal should be directed to the head of the principal unit and may only be based on the grounds that the action was illegal or unconstitutional.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">The letter was signed by three Commissioners, including one, Allen M. Freifeld, who was newly appointed to the Commission since Wilson\u2019s initial termination.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">On 3 November 2004, the Commission noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals regarding the Circuit Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Wilson. The Commission contemporaneously filed a motion in the Circuit Court asking it to reconsider its award of back pay and benefits. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>4 November 2004, Wilson petitioned the Circuit Court to hold the Commission in contempt of the court\u2019s 25 October 2004 order based on the re-termination. Several days later, the Circuit Court held a hearing on the pending motions. In an order dated 15 November 2004, the Circuit Court denied, without prejudice, Wilson\u2019s petition to hold the Commission in contempt. In the same order, however, the trial judge amended his 25 October 2004 order, retaining the first three determinations, but adding certain new findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-5\">... 4) the termination of Chrys Wilson on April 15, 2004, by the Chairman of the Public Service Commission was unlawful in that it was a for cause termination as a result of alleged misconduct which was conducted without the statutory protections due Ms. Wilson; 5) in light of the foregoing, the termination of Chrys Wilson on April 15, 2004, by the Chairman of the Public Service Commission was unlawful; 6) any termination of [Wilson] may only be accomplished by the delegated Appointing Authority, and in the absence of such a delegation, a majority vote of the Commission as a whole; 7) [Wilson] is entitled to an impartial, unbiased agency adjudicator in connection with any intraagency appeal of a proposed termination; 8) neither the Chairman nor any of his employees may lawfully serve as an agency adjudicator regarding his own decision to terminate [Wilson]; 9) the October 29, 2004 re-termination of [Wilson] was invalid, illegal and improper because it was tainted by the initial unlawful termination; 10) the October 29, 2004 re-termination of [Wilson] was invalid, illegal and improper because it was a for cause termination as a result of alleged misconduct carried out without the statutory protections required; 12) the October 29, 2004 re-termination of [Wilson] was invalid, illegal and improper because the Commis-. sion adopted the same unconstitutional intra-agency appellate procedure by a biased decision-maker applied in the initial termination....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">In addition to the relief afforded in the original 25 October 2004 order (la, reinstatement, back pay, and benefits), the judge ordered that Wilson be \u201cpermitted to physically return <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>to work and perforin the duties of her position as Manager of External Relations.... \u201d Furthermore, the judge ordered that, \u201cbefore the Public Service Commission makes additional efforts, if any, to terminate Ms. Wilson\u2019s employment, Ms. Wilson shall be provided a hearing and all process due according to law pursuant to her rights as an individual being terminated for cause as a result of alleged misconduct, this shall include, but not be limited to, the rights found in Section 11-106 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">In response to entry of the 15 November 2004 order, the Commission filed a second notice of appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Before the intermediate appellate court could consider either appeal,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> this Court, on its initiative, issued a writ of certiorari, 385 Md. 161, 867 A.2d 1062 (2005), in order to consider the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-5\">I. Did the Circuit Court err when, on 15 November 2004, it altered its previous order of 25 October 2004 granting summary judgment in favor of Wilson based on the intervening actions of the Commission?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-6\">II. Did the Circuit Court err in determining that the Commission as a whole is the \u201cappointing authority\u201d under Md.Code (1993, 2004 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 11-305 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article and that, as a result, a termination effectuated by the Chairman of the Commission acting alone, without the approval, acquiescence, or delegation of a majority of the full Commission, is unlawful?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\">III. Did the Circuit Court err in determining that Wilson was terminated \u201cfor cause\u201d and thus was entitled to the statutory process under Md.Code (1993, 2004 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 11-106 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>cable to the imposition of disciplinary sanctions for \u201cemployee misconduct\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-4\">IV. Did the Circuit Court err in determining that the statutory intra-agency appeals process under Md.Code (1993, 2004 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 11-305 and 11-113 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article governing the termination of certain employees violated Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights because it failed to provide an impartial adjudicator?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">V. Did the Circuit Court exceed its authority when it ordered that Wilson be allowed to \u201cphysically return to work\u201d after her termination was found to be unlawful?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">The Commission initially argues that the Circuit Court exceeded its authority by <em>sua, sponte </em>granting summary judgment in favor of Wilson in its 15 November 2004 order and vacating the Commission\u2019s 29 October 2004 re-termination of Wilson. For reasons to be explained, we conclude that the Circuit Court committed no procedural error because, despite the Commission\u2019s characterization of the action taken, the Circuit Court acted within the proper range of its revisory powers under the relevant provisions of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article of the Maryland Code and the Maryland Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">As indicated <em>supra, </em>the Circuit Court, on 25 October 2004, granted Wilson\u2019s motion for summary judgment, finding that both the 15 April 2004 termination of Wilson and the subsequent intra-agency administrative appeal process were unlawful. Based on a post-judgment motion by the Commission to reconsider the award of back pay, the Circuit Court scheduled and held a hearing on 10 November 2004. The Circuit Court also allowed Wilson, at the hearing, to be heard on her contempt motion filed a few days before. Based on what was presented to it at the 10 November hearing, including what transpired since the 20 October hearing upon which the 25 October order was based, the trial judge, on 15 November <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>2004, issued an order mirroring to some extent the language of his 25 October order, but adding several additional determinations. Most notable of the additions was the finding that both the 15 April and 29 October terminations were \u201cfor cause\u201d and thus unlawful because they were accomplished without the statutory protections due an employee that is terminated for \u201cemployee misconduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Our review of the record indicates that the 15 November order was not in fact a <em>sna sponte </em>grant of summary judgment, as the Commission contends, but rather a modification of the 25 October order granting Wilson\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Md.Code (1973, 2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 6-408 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-6\">\u00a7 6-408. Revisory power of court over judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-7\">For a period of 30 days after the entry of a judgment, or thereafter pursuant to motion filed within that period, the court has revisory power and control over the judgment. After the expiration of that period the court has revisory power and control over the judgment only in case of fraud, mistake, irregularity, or failure of an employee of the court or of the clerk\u2019s office to perform a duty required by statute or rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">Maryland Rule 2-535(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-9\">Rule 2-535. Revisory power.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-10\">(a) Generally. On motion of any party filed within 30 days after entry of judgment, the court may exercise revisory power and control over the judgment and, if the action was tried before the court, may take any action that it could have taken under Rule 2-534 [Motion to alter or amend a judgment \u2014 Court decision].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">Maryland Rule 2-534 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-12\">Rule 2-534. Motion to alter or amend a judgment\u2014 Court decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-13\">In an action decided by the court, on motion of any party filed within ten days after entry of judgment, the court may open the judgment to receive additional evidence, may amend its findings or its statement of reasons for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>decision, may set forth additional findings or reasons, may enter new findings or new reasons, may amend the judgment, or may enter a new judgment. A motion to alter or amend a judgment may be joined with a motion for new trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">In <em>Maryland Board of Nursing v. Nechay, </em>347 Md. 396, 701 A.2d 405 (1997), we examined a Circuit Court\u2019s power to revise, <em>sua sponte, </em>an order within 30 days of its entry when there existed no intervening motion between the original entry of judgment and the subsequent revision or modification of the order underlying the judgment. Noting that the Committee note to Rule 2-535(a) states that \u201c[tjhis section is intended to be as comprehensive as Code, Courts Article \u00a7 6-408,\u201d the Court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-6\">[tjhis suggests strongly that when the Court adopted [Rule 2-535(a)j, it did not intend that the rule supercede the statute or even contradict it; rather it intended that they be read together, complementing or supplementing each other. This is consistent with the teachings of our cases with respect to the power of circuit courts to revise or modify their judgments. In that regard, it is well settled in this State that, \u201cRead together, the rules, the statute and our decisions boil down to a dictate that for a period of thirty days from the entry of a law or equity judgment a circuit court shall have \u2018unrestricted discretion\u2019 to revise it.\u201d ... The exercise of the court\u2019s discretion is not triggered exclusively, our cases make clear, by a motion filed by one of the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-7\"><em>Nechay, </em>347 Md. at 408-09, 701 A.2d at 411 (citations omitted). <em>See also Renbaum v. Custom Holding, Inc., </em>386 Md. 28, 43-46, 871 A.2d 554, 563-65 (2005) (finding that, where the Circuit Court initially denied a plaintiffs petition for involuntary dissolution of a corporation, the Circuit Court did not err when, upon motion of the plaintiff pursuant to Rule 2-534, it relied on evidence of events occurring post-judgment to conclude subsequently that involuntary dissolution was proper).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>In this case, the Circuit Court was invited by the Commission\u2019s motion seeking revision, alteration, or amendment, filed within 10 days of the entry of the 25 October order, to reconsider certain aspects of that order, <em>i.e,., </em>back pay and benefits. Although expanding the array of what was reconsidered beyond the scope of that sought in the Commission\u2019s motion, the Court entered its revised order on 15 November 2004, less than 30 days after the entry of the 25 October 2004 order. Thus, even had no party invoked the court\u2019s revisory powers by motion, under \u00a7 6-408 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Rule 2-535(a), Rule 2-534, and the principles articulated in <em>Nechay </em>and <em>Renbaum, </em>we conclude that the Circuit Court did not err as a matter of procedure in revising and modifying its 25 October 2004 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The Commission next argues that the Circuit Court erred in concluding that the termination of Wilson on 15 April 2004 was illegal because: 1) the termination decision was not made by the full Commission; 2) she was not afforded the statutorily-mandated procedures for terminations resulting from \u201cemployee misconduct;\u201d and, 3) the statutory termination appeal process violated due process because it did not provide for an impartial adjudicator. We need not reach, at this point at least, the latter two issues because we conclude that Chairman Schisler acted outside of his authority when, without the approval, acquiescence, or delegation of authority from a majority of the full Commission, he alone terminated Wilson.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">The question of whether Chairman Schisler, acting alone, possessed the authority, as \u201cappointing authority,\u201d to terminate Wilson without the involvement of the full Commission is one of statutory interpretation and, as such, is purely a legal one. <em>Mohan v. Norris, </em>386 Md. 63, 66-67, 871 A.2d 575, 577 (2005). We therefore review the judgment of the Circuit Court <em>de novo. Id.; see also Davis v.

Termination of other [non-probationary] employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-8\">(a) <em>Applicability of section. </em>\u2014 This section only applies to an employee who is in a position:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-9\">(1) under a special appointment; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-10\">(2) in the management service; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-11\">(3) in the executive service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-12\">(b) <em>Employee at will. </em>\u2014 Each employee subject to this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-13\">(1) serves at the pleasure of the employee\u2019s appointing authority; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-15\">(2) may be terminated from employment for any reason, solely in the discretion of the appointing authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-17\">(c) <em>Appeal. </em>\u2014 An employee or an employee\u2019s representative may file a written appeal of an employment termination under this section as described under \u00a7 11-113 of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-18\">This statute states clearly that the termination of a management service employee may be effectuated only by the \u201cappointing authority\u201d of an agency. Wilson and the Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>sion agree that she, as a management service employee,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> was subject to the termination procedures outlined in \u00a7 11\u2014 305(b)(2) and thus only may be terminated by the \u201cappointing authority.\u201d Wilson and the Commission differ, however, in their respective views as to who or what constitutes the \u201cappointing authority\u201d in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The Commission argues that the Circuit Court erred in concluding that the \u201cappointing authority\u201d in this matter is not the Chairman but rather, as Wilson contended, the full membership of the Commission (by at least a vote of a majority of the five Commissioners). In determining who or what is the \u201cappointing authority,\u201d our starting point is the plain language of the relevant statutes. <em>See Johnson v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>387 Md. 1, 23-24, 874 A.2d 439, 453 (2005) (stating that \u201cthe best source of legislative intent is the statute\u2019s plain language and when the language is clear and unambiguous, our inquiry ordinarily ends there\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">Although \u201cappointing authority\u201d is not defined in Title 11 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article, that term is defined in \u00a7 l-101(b). Section 1 \u2014 101(b) defines \u201cappointing authority\u201d as \u201can individual or a unit of government that has the power to make appointments and terminate employment.\u201d Although this definition appears somewhat circular and redundant in its application to \u00a7 ll-305(b)(2), the Commission points to the legislative history of that definition in support of its contention that the \u201cappointing authority,\u201d with regard to the Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>sion, is the Chairman. In 1993, the definition, found prior to that time in Md.Code (1957, 1988 Repl.Vol., 1992 Cum.Supp.), Art. 64A, \u00a7 1(1), was recodified as part of the State Personnel and Pensions Article. 1993 Md. Laws, Chap. 10. The Re-visor\u2019s Note accompanying \u00a7 1 \u2014 101(b) in the 1993 edition of the State Personnel and Pensions Article states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-5\">This subsection [\u00a7 1 \u2014 101(b) ] is new language derived without substantive change from former Art. 64A, \u00a7 1(1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">The reference to an \u201cindividual\u201d and a \u201cunit of government\u201d are substituted for the former references to a \u201cperson\u201d for clarity. The term \u201cperson\u201d, as defined in subsection (h) of this section [codified in the 2004 replacement volume of the State Personnel and Pensions Article as \u00a7 1-101(i) ], expressly excludes governmental entities or units. On the other hand, a board, committee, or other governmental unit, which is thus excluded from the definition of the term \u201cperson\u201d, might well be designated by some other law as an appointing authority. Accordingly, the term \u201cunit\u201d is necessary to accommodate that situation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">The Commission seizes upon the language in the Re-visor\u2019s Note and certain case law to argue that the \u201cappointing authority\u201d is \u201can individual unless a statute expressly names the unit of government as the appointing authority instead.\u201d <em>See E. Corr. Inst. v. Howe, </em>105 Md.App. 167, 172, 658 A.2d 1182, 1184 (1995) (construing \u00a7 l-101(b) and its Revisor\u2019s Note to mean that \u201cthe term \u2018appointing authority\u2019 contemplates a person with authority to make appointments, or a unit of government that has been given that express authority by statute\u201d). Although \u00a7 1 \u2014 101(b) and <em>Howe </em>provide that an individual <em>may </em>be the \u201cappointing authority,\u201d we disagree with the Commission\u2019s interpretation that, in the absence of a statute expressly naming a governmental unit as the \u201cappointing authority,\u201d an individual <em>must </em>be the \u201cappointing authority.\u201d The language in <em>Howe </em>must be viewed in the context of the statutory scheme implicated in that case. In <em>Howe, </em>an individual was named expressly in the relevant statute as the \u201cappointing officer.\u201d 105 Md.App. at 169-70, 658 A.2d at 1183 (citing Md.Code (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol., 1994 Cum.Supp.), Art. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>27, \u00a7 684(b)(2) (designating the \u201cwarden or superintendent of each institution [as] the appointing officer for employees of that institution, and the Commissioner [as] the appointing officer for all other employees in the Department\u201d)). When there is no statute or agency regulation identifying specifically who or what is the \u201cappointing authority,\u201d however, we interpret \u00a7 1 \u2014 101(b) and its legislative history to indicate that the \u201cappointing authority\u201d may be either an individual <em>or </em>a unit of government, without presumption as to either.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Because, with regard to the Commission, there is no statute relating expressly to the \u201cappointing authority,\u201d it is therefore necessary for us to delve deeper to determine who or what is the \u201cappointing authority\u201d in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Wilson argues that, by examining other statutes that relate to the Commission, we should arrive at the conclusion that the five member Commission is the statutory \u201cappointing authority.\u201d Wilson relies specifically on \u00a7 2-108(d) of the PUC Article, which, in full context, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">Title 2. Public Service Commission and People\u2019s Counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-8\">Subtitle 1. Public Service Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-9\">\u00a7 2-108.

We agree. Language appears throughout the statute authorizing the Commission to \u201chire\u201d or \u201cappoint\u201d all types of employees of the PSC. In contrast, there is no mention in this statute, nor any other statute we could find, of language that outlines the Chairman\u2019s authority, independent of the Commission\u2019s, to \u201chire\u201d or \u201cappoint\u201d employees of the PSC. Although PUC \u00a7 2-108(d) does not discuss specifically the authority of the Commission to terminate employees, PUC \u00a7 2-108(d) states that \u201call personnel of the Commission are subject to the provisions of the State Personnel and Pensions Article.\u201d That Article governs the termination of PSC employees, specifically those employees in the executive and management services, and those who are special appointments, all of which \u201cserve[ ] at the pleasure of the employee\u2019s appointing authority\u201d and \u201cmay be terminated from employment for any reason, solely in the discretion of the appointing authority.\u201d \u00a7 11-305. Because PUC \u00a7 2-108(d) constructs a statutory scheme outlining both the Commission\u2019s explicit authority to hire and implicit authority to terminate employees of the PSC, we conclude that the Commission as a whole is the \u201cappointing authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-12\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-13\">The Commission maintains, however, that Wilson\u2019s interpretation of PUC \u00a7 2-108(d) is incorrect because it would serve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>to render other provisions of the PUC Article superfluous. <em>See Smack v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene, </em>378 Md. 298, 305, 835 A.2d 1175, 1179 (2003) (stating that \u201cstatutes are to be interpreted so that no portion is rendered superfluous or nugatory\u201d). The Commission points out that the PUC Article specifically authorizes the Commission to appoint four positions: the Executive Secretary, PUC \u00a7 2-104; the Executive Director, PUC \u00a7 2-105; the General Counsel, PUC \u00a7 2-106; and the License Hearing Officer, PUC \u00a7 10-110 (the \u201cstatutory positions\u201d). Each position serves \u201cat the pleasure of the Commission.\u201d The Commission argues that, if we adopt Wilson\u2019s interpretation of PUC \u00a7 2-108(d), \u201cthe Commission would have the authority to appoint all positions and all at-will employees would [therefore] serve at the pleasure of the entire Commission even without these four sections.\u201d Wilson\u2019s interpretation, the Commission protests, therefore renders the four provisions in PUC \u00a7 2-104, PUC \u00a7 2-105, PUC \u00a7 2-106, and PUC \u00a7 10-110 superfluous and unnecessary.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>This redundancy, if any exists, has no effect on our reasoning. Each of the four statutory provisions outlines the specific attributes and capabilities of the four statutory positions. These specific provisions represent merely the design of the Legislature to designate specific positions and how they function within the hierarchy and mission of the PSC. Section 2-108(d) of the PUC, on the other hand, is a broad statute intended to delegate sweeping authority to the Commission to effectuate the hiring of any and all positions necessary for operation of the PSC, including those positions that were not contemplated or considered by the Legislature at the time of enactment of the sections discussed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>The Commission, in arguing that the language in those provisions becomes superfluous, emphasizes that the \u201cselves at the pleasure of the Commission\u201d provision was added to PUC \u00a7 2-106, the statute governing the appointment of the General Counsel, in the same legislation that adopted the original \u00a7 2-108. 1976 Md. Laws, Chap. 756. We conclude, however, that the addition of language stating that each statutory position \u201cserves at the pleasure of the Commission\u201d was necessary to indicate that, unlike some other specifically authorized appointed positions, these positions would not have any set term, but rather would be subject to termination as the Commission saw fit.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This is evidenced by the subheading \u201cTerm\u201d in each of the respective statutes, with the exception of the License Hearing Officer, preceding the language stating that the statutory positions \u201cserve[ ] at the pleasure of the Commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Adopting the Commission\u2019s interpretation of \u201cappointing authority\u201d would create a conflict between the statutory provisions of PUC \u00a7 2 \u2014 108(d), \u00a7 11-805, and the enabling statutes for the statutory positions. Section 2 \u2014 108(d) of the PUC provides that the statutory positions of Executive Secretary, Executive Director, General Counsel, and License Hearing Officer are subject to \u00a7 11-305, which in turn states that these positions \u201cserve[ ] at the pleasure of the employee\u2019s appointing authority.\u201d Each of these pertinent statutes, however, establishes that each position serves at the pleasure of the Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>sion. If, as the Commission contends, the Chairman is the \u201cappointing authority,\u201d those statutory positions would then serve at the pleasure of both the Chairman (as the \u201cappointing authority\u201d under \u00a7 11-305) and the Commission (under the enabling provisions). Accepting the Commission\u2019s interpretation would create situations in which an individual employed in one of the special statutory positions would be subject to termination without the acquiescence or approval of the entity upon whose pleasure he or she serves. For example, were we to accept the Commission\u2019s contention that the Chairman is the \u201cappointing authority,\u201d employees within the statutory positions would be subject to termination \u201csolely in the discretion of [the Chairman]\u201d under \u00a7 11-305, even though, under the statutes creating these positions, they each \u201cserve[ ] at the pleasure of the Commission.\u201d If the full Commission is the \u201cappointing authority,\u201d as used-in \u00a7 11-305 (as referenced in PUC \u00a7 2-108(d)), there is no conflict and these interrelated statutes are harmonized.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The Commission also urges us to place weight on the fact that the Chairman of the Commission has \u201calways acted\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> as the \u201cappointing authority\u201d for the Commission. The Commission cites situations in which past Chairmen exercised, in certain actions (including termination decisions), without apparent objection or challenge, power consistent with that of the \u201cappointing authority.\u201d The Commission argues that its interpretation and implementation of this statutory scheme should be entitled to deference by reviewing courts. <em>See Bd. of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 69, 729 A.2d 376, 381 (1999) (stating that \u201can administrative agency\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts\u201d). Such deference, however, is ordinarily only shown to an agency\u2019s longstanding interpretation of a statute that it administers and that involves the special skills and expertise of that agency. <em>See id. </em>(emphasizing that this deference is only applicable when it involves the interpretation of a statute within the agency\u2019s specific area of expertise). The question of who or what is the \u201cappointing authority\u201d for a particular agency does not involve the special expertise of the Commission in utilities regulation, but rather is a State government personnel matter subject to the statutory interpretation principles that ultimately may become subject to interpretation by the courts of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">5.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Section 2-108(d)(7) of the PUC authorizes the Commission to \u201cdelegate to a commissioner or personnel the authority to perform an administrative function necessary to carry out a duty of the Commission.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> As the Assistant Attorney General discussed in her 27 April 2004 advice letter <footnotemark>18</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-7\">The exception to the above stated rule [that a termination must be done by the \u201cappointing authority\u201d] would be if the Commission had delegated authority in this area to the Chairman----It is not clear, however, whether the authori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>ty to discipline or terminate the employees in question has been delegated to the Chairman. In conclusion, if such a delegation has been made, and is broad enough to cover the employees in question, then the firing by the Chairman is within his authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The record reveals no such delegation in the present case. To the contrary, a majority of the Commissioners sitting at the time of the initial termination of Wilson stated in an affidavit that they \u201chave never delegated to Chairman Kenneth D. Schisler any authority to terminate the employment of the [terminated employees, including Wilson].\u201d Furthermore, Chairman Schisler confirmed at his deposition that a majority of the sitting Commissioners did not vote to delegate to him the authority of \u201cappointing authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Nonetheless, the Commission argues that, because the Chairperson has \u201calways acted\u201d as the \u201cappointing authority\u201d for the Commission, this \u201ccould be viewed as being indicative of the Commission\u2019s implicit delegation of authority to the Chairman.\u201d We find this argument overreaching on this record and, in any event, unavailing.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Even were we to accept the Commission\u2019s essentially unsupported allegation that the Chairman has \u201calways acted\u201d as the \u201cappointing authority,\u201d we are not prepared to recognize the Commission\u2019s \u201cimplicit delegation\u201d theory in light of the statutory analysis discussed in this opinion. That a Chairman may not have been challenged in his or her actions in this capacity in the past should not be transmuted into an ongoing delegation in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>direct contravention of the statutory scheme. Moreover, even if past Chairmen exercised authority in the capacity of \u201cappointing authority\u201d with regard to past terminations, the Commission did not allege any facts, admissible in evidence, that the Commission acquiesced in the actions of the Chairman in affecting the initial termination of Wilson. Rather, a majority of the Commissioners sitting at the time of Wilson\u2019s initial termination disavowed expressly any delegation of authority or approval of Chairman Schisler\u2019s action. That alone rebuts any argued-for inference of an ongoing implicit delegation of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Having determined that the 15 April 2004 termination of Wilson was unlawful because it was not effectuated by at least a majority of the Commissioners sitting at the time or by proper delegation of the Commission\u2019s \u201cappointing authority\u201d powers to the Chairman, we consider next whether the 29 October 2004 re-termination of Wilson was unlawful or unconstitutional. Although the re-termination was taken by a majority of the Commissioners then sitting, Wilson argues it was unlawful nonetheless because she was not afforded the pretermination statutory protections due an employee terminated \u201cfor cause.\u201d Wilson also contends that, if she were deemed terminated purely as an \u201cat-will\u201d employee (for which no cause need be offered), the statutory post-termination administrative appeal process, as applied to her situation was unconstitutional because it provided that her appeal be heard by Chairman Schisler, as the \u201chead of the principal unit,\u201d who she contends was incapable of providing an impartial agency review.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Although the Circuit Court\u2019s 25 October order did not conclude whether Wilson was fired \u201cfor cause,\u201d the 15 November order amended the prior findings, determining that not only was the original 15 April termination \u201cfor cause\u201d as a result of \u201calleged misconduct,\u201d but that the 29 October re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>termination was \u201ctainted by the initial unlawful termination.\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> For reasons we shall explain, we conclude that, on the undisputed material facts revealed by the record, the Circuit Court erred as a matter of law in resolving that the 15 April termination, and impliedly the 29 October re-termination, were <em>sub silentio </em>the result of \u201cemployee misconduct.\u201d Therefore, the re-termination by the Commission did not require it to afford Wilson the statutory pre-termination protections of \u00a7 11-106.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">As stated <em>supra, </em>Wilson\u2019s employment position with the PSC was in the management service, a classification that, among other things, provided that she was an at-will employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>who served at the pleasure of the \u201cappointing authority.\u201d \u00a7 1L-305.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Nonetheless, she claims that her termination was unlawful because it was based on Chairman Schisler\u2019s consideration, in reaching the initial termination decision, of alleged misconduct on her part. Under \u00a7 11-106, the \u201cappointing authority\u201d is restricted in its ability to take any disciplinary action, including termination, when that action is based on \u201cemployee misconduct.\u201d <em>See Danaher v. Dep\u2019t of Labor, Licensing &amp; Regulation, </em>148 Md.App. 139, 166, 811 A.2d 359, 375 (2002) (holding that \u00a7 11-106 applies to at-will employees in the management service where misconduct is the ground for disciplinary action).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">In support of her contention that she was terminated for the reason of \u201cemployee misconduct,\u201d Wilson cites several passages from the transcript of Chairman Schisler\u2019s deposition, in which he expressed his thoughts on certain performance issues and other factors that, according to Wilson, were the foundation for the Chairman\u2019s decision to terminate her. For purposes of clarity, we set forth generally the following allusions and assessments (referred to earlier and subsequently in this opinion as the \u201cperformance issues\u201d) mentioned by Chairman Schisler during his deposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-6\">1. Wilson possessed poor letter-drafting skills;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-7\">2. Wilson\u2019s writing style was sub-par;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>3. Wilson was unresponsive to utility consumers in her letters;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-5\">4. Wilson was \u201cin the office very little by [Chairman Schisler\u2019s] standards in terms of her duties as Manager of External Relations, ... away from the desk, away from the supervision responsibility quite a bit\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-6\">5. Wilson spent an inappropriate amount of time socializing in the hallways, creating a \u201cdisruptive\u201d environment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-7\">6. Wilson had \u201ca great deal of difficulty accepting any personal responsibility for things that weren\u2019t working well\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-8\">7. Wilson \u201clacked a fundamental understanding of the dispute resolution process\u201d designed to resolve disputes between consumers and utility providers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-9\">8. Wilson lacked a proper understanding of the legal requirements of her position, and thus could not be relied upon to train her employees;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-10\">9.

Wilson did not possess sound decision-making skills.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">In addition to these generalizations, Chairman Schisler alluded during his deposition to a particular incident when he suspected Wilson intentionally may have submitted an inaccurate time sheet (the \u201ctime sheet incident\u201d). The Chairman explained that, \u201c[consistent with [Wilson] being away from the office quite a bit, I began to keep closer tabs on her around the holidays of 2003, ... just to kind of be able to point out to her when I expected her to be with her [subordinates].\u201d On one particular occasion when he was away from the office and wished to contact Wilson, he asked another employee to go to Wilson\u2019s office and ask her to get in touch with him. The employee informed Chairman Schisler that, although he had gone to Wilson\u2019s office at least twice during the course of the day in question, he was unable to locate Wilson. The Chairman stated that, when Wilson turned in her time sheet for the period including the date in question, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>noticed that Wilson indicated that she worked that day. He claimed to have confronted Wilson within a few days thereafter and questioned her as to whether she in fact was at work on the day in question or had made a mistake with respect to the time sheet. Wilson, according to the Chairman, became \u201cvery defensive\u201d and denied any misrepresentation. Although the Chairman found the circumstances of this incident \u201ctroubling,\u201d he stated that he signed Wilson\u2019s time sheet and took no further action with regard to the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Although Chairman Schisler acknowledged that he informed Wilson of his various concerns at various times, he was adamant during his deposition that his decision to terminate Wilson was not based on either the performance issues or the time sheet incident. On no less than 15 instances during the deposition, he stated that the performance issues played no role in his decision to terminate Wilson. He also took some pain not to characterize Wilson\u2019s termination as a \u201cfor cause\u201d termination. Instead, Chairman Schisler pointed to Wilson\u2019s status as an at-will employee, emphasizing that no reason was necessary to be given for her termination and, in the 15 April written notice, none was given. When prodded by Wilson\u2019s counsel, he indicated, on several other occasions during the deposition, that the termination of Wilson was necessary in light of his stated, but somewhat vague, desire to build a more cohesive and productive management team at the PSC.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Although Chairman Schisler, at several points during the deposition, denied that he factored the performance issues and time sheet incident into his termination decision, Wilson points to other parts of the deposition in which, Wilson argues, he admitted otherwise.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> During his ruminations on the perform<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>anee issues, the Chairman stated that these concerns \u201cwere issues that I couldn\u2019t ignore\u201d and that could not be \u201cseparated\u201d from the termination decision. Finally, Wilson relies on the following passages, all of which occurred in the deposition subsequent to Chairman Schisler\u2019s discussion of the performance issues and the time sheet incident, in support of her contention that she was terminated for \u201cemployee misconduct\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-5\">Q [Counsel for Wilson]: What did you take into account in deciding to terminate Ms. Wilson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">A [Chairman Schisler]: I took into account all of the factors that were with respect to her performance and also the overall needs of the agency. Okay? But without respect to any particular personnel deficiency that I may have articulated, those weren\u2019t causes that were involved in the separation, but I clearly evaluated the entire landscape of what the needs of the agency were.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-8\">Q: Well let me ask you this. If Ms. Wilson had not had any of the personnel problems that we discussed and was doing a fantastic job in your view across the board, would she have been terminated?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-9\">A: I think the sort of the common sense answer to that is no. But if you\u2019re asking in a legal sort of frame work, the answer would be yes because she was not fired for cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-10\">But, I mean, if you think someone is a superb employee, irreplaceable, you generally don\u2019t make personnel changes there. But it was not a factor in the personnel decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-11\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-12\">Q: And in your mind part of the reason for [the termination of Wilson] was the performance issues we\u2019ve talked about. Fair?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>A: I would say the performance issues were \u2014 I mean, I\u2019m human. I wouldn\u2019t separate that. But I didn\u2019t do the analysis with respect to a cause for termination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">I was concerned about \u2014 was I concerned about the management of the External Relations Office? Yes. Was I concerned about Ms. Wilson\u2019s time on the job and ability to ensure others were working full days and so forth and not taking excessive breaks and those sorts of the things? Yes. Was I concerned about the quality of her writing, the quality of the decision making, all those things? Yes. Were they part of an environment, an atmosphere that caused me to spend more time on External Relations? Yes. Did I, therefore, then make the leap that I\u2019m going to see if this is cause to terminate on a cause basis, the answer is unequivocally no. So I didn\u2019t \u2014 because I recognize that Ms. Wilson was an at-will employee and didn\u2019t need to supply cause reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Although \u00a7 11-106 outlines the procedures that the \u201cappointing authority\u201d must follow before imposing a disciplinary sanction based on \u201cemployee misconduct,\u201d the term \u201cemployee misconduct\u201d is not defined in that section, nor is it defined elsewhere in the State Personnel and Pensions Article. In order to determine whether Wilson was entitled to the statutory protections in \u00a7 11-106, we must determine what types of conduct fall within the phrase \u201cemployee misconduct\u201d before deciding whether, on the state of the record in this case where summary judgment was granted, Wilson was terminated <em>sub silentio </em>as the result of \u201cemployee misconduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">In order to gain some perspective on the current State system governing employee discipline and terminations, it is necessary to understand something of its immediate predecessor statutory and regulatory scheme. Prior to 1996, the State Employee Management System, codified in the 1998 edition of the State Personnel and Pensions Article, established two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>classes of State employees: classified service and unclassified service. \u00a7 1 \u2014 101(d) (1993); \u00a7 l-101(o) (1993). The statutory scheme provided that, unless excluded by statute, all positions in the Executive branch of State government and certain clerical and administrative positions within the Judicial branch, among others, were in the classified service.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> \u00a7 1-301 (1993); \u00a7 1-302 (1993). In general, a position to which a person was appointed or a position requiring special training or qualifications was in the unclassified service. \u00a7 1-401 (1993); \u00a7 1-403 (1993). An important distinction between the two classifications was the process afforded an employee prior to termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Unclassified employees, like the current management service, were at-will employees under the prior statutory scheme. <em>See </em>Revisor\u2019s Note, \u00a7 9-101 (1993) (stating that \u201c[ujnclassified service employees serve at the pleasure of the appointing authority ... \u201d). Classified employees, however, could be removed by the \u201cappointing authority\u201d only \u201cfor cause.\u201d \u00a7 9-202 (1993). The Department of Personnel, pursuant to \u00a7 9-203 (1993), adopted regulations (since superceded) to prescribe what conduct constituted \u201cfor cause.\u201d COMAR 06.01.01.47 (1996) stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The following shall be sufficient cause of removal, though removal may be for causes other than those enumerated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\">A. That the employee is incompetent or inefficient in the performance of his duty;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-7\">B. That the employee has been wantonly careless or negligent in the performance of his duty or has used unwarrantable or excessive force in his treatment of public charges, fellow employees, or other persons;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-8\">C. That the employee has some permanent or chronic physical or mental ailment or defect that incapacitates him for the proper performance of his duties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>D. That the employee has violated any lawful regulation or order or failed to obey any lawful and reasonable direction given by his superior officer when the violation or failure to obey amounts to insubordination or serious breach of discipline which may reasonably be expected to result in a lower morale in the organization or to result in loss or injury to the State or the public;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-5\">E. That the employee has been wantonly offensive in his conduct toward fellow employees, wards of the State, or the public;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">F. That the employee has taken for personal use, a fee, gift, or other valuable thing in the course of his work or in connection with it when the fee, gift, or other valuable thing is given him by any person in the hope or expectation of receiving a favor or better treatment than that accorded other persons;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\">G. That the employee is engaged in a private business or in a trade or occupation when the duties of his position as prescribed by law or regulation require his entire time for their performance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-8\">H. That the employee has been guilty of a violation or violations of State Personnel and Pensions Article, Title 18, Subtitle 1 [Miscellaneous prohibited acts];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-9\">I. That the employee has been convicted of a criminal offense or of a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-10\">J. That the employee, through negligence or willful conduct, has caused damage to public property or waste of public supplies;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-11\">K. That the employee has been guilty of a violation or violations of the provisions of ... the Corrupt Practices Act, or using, threatening to use, or attempting to use political influence or the influence of any State employee or officer in securing promotion, transfer, leave of absence, or increased pay;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-12\">L. That the employee has willfully made a false official statement or report;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>M. That the employee has been guilty of conduct such as to bring the classified service into public disrepute;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">N. That the Secretary has investigated the employee\u2019s qualifications and background and has discovered that fraudulent or irregular information resulted in the employee\u2019s appointment....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">In 1996, the Legislature enacted the State Personnel Management System Reform Act, which effected a comprehensive restructuring of the State Personnel Management System. 1996 Md. Laws, Chap. 347. One of the primary changes made to the system was the elimination of the categories of classified/unclassified services. In their place, the Legislature created six categories: skilled service, \u00a7 6-401, professional service, \u00a7 6-402, management service, \u00a7 6-403, executive service, \u00a7 6-404, special appointees, \u00a7 6-405, and temporary employees, \u00a7 6-406. 1996 Md. Laws, Chap. 347. As with the former classified and unclassified service employees though, a significant distinction between the different services remained as to the level of protection and process afforded an employee prior to termination or other disciplinary actions for misconduct. Although employees that are special appointees or in the management and executive services are classified explicitly as at-will employees that serve at the pleasure of the \u201cappointing authority,\u201d \u00a7 11-305, skilled and professional service employees are granted certain statutory protections regarding their continued employment.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Title 11, Subtitle 1 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article contains a comprehensive administrative appeal process for disciplinary actions applicable solely to employees in the professional and skilled services. Section ll-109(c)(l) provides, as a first level of appeal, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>An employee or an employee\u2019s representative may file with the head of the principal unit a written appeal of a disciplinary action that states, to the extent possible, the issues of fact and law that the employee believes would warrant rescinding the disciplinary action.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVu\">An employee in the professional or skilled services may appeal such a decision under \u00a7 11-109, within 10 days of receiving the decision, to the Secretary of Budget and Management. \u00a7 11-110. Under \u00a7 11-110, the Secretary, within 30 days, either must mediate a settlement between the employee and employer or refer the appeal to the Maryland Office of Administrative Hearings (\u201cOAH\u201d), the State\u2019s centralized panel of neutral administrative law judges. \u00a7 11-110(b). If the matter is referred to the OAH, the OAH must hold a hearing on the matter. The hearing is governed by the procedures in the State Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> \u00a7 11\u2014 110(c)(2). The decision of the OAH is the final agency decision in such matters. \u00a7 11-110(d)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Aside from these post-disciplinary action procedures, the current statutory scheme provides for other protections or processes that must occur <em>before </em>certain disciplinary actions are taken. Section 11-106 provides that the \u201cappointing authority\u201d is restricted in its ability to take any disciplinary action, including termination, when that action is based on \u201cemployee misconduct.\u201d Although this section does not state explicitly to which classifications of employees it applies, \u00a7 11\u2014 102 states explicitly that Subtitle 11 applies to all, save temporary, employees. For purposes of our analysis then, we shall assume that \u00a7 11-106 applies to employees in the management service. <em>See Danaher v. Dep\u2019t of Labor, Licensing &amp; Regulation, </em>148 Md.App. 139, 166, 811 A.2d 359, 375 (2002) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>(holding that \u00a7 11-106 applies to at-will employees in the management service). Section 11-106, in its entirety, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai\">\u00a7 11-106. Duty of appointing authority prior to imposing sanctions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-5\">(a) <em>Procedure. </em>\u2014 Before taking any disciplinary action related to employee misconduct, an appointing authority shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-6\">(1) investigate the alleged misconduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-7\">(2) meet with the employee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-8\">(3) consider any mitigating circumstances;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-9\">(4) determine the appropriate disciplinary action, if any, to be imposed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-10\">(5) give the employee a written notice of the disciplinary action to be taken and the employee\u2019s appeal rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-11\">(b) <em>Time limit. </em>\u2014 Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, an appointing authority may impose any disciplinary action no later than 30 days after the appointing authority acquires knowledge of the misconduct for which the disciplinary action is imposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-12\">(c) <em>Suspension. </em>\u2014 (1) An appointing authority may suspend an employee without pay no later than 5 workdays following the close of the employee\u2019s next shift after the appointing authority acquires knowledge of the misconduct for which the suspension is imposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-13\">(2) Saturdays, Sundays, legal holidays, and employee leave days are excluded in calculating the 5-workday period under this subsection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-14\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-15\">Wilson claims that, because she was terminated as a result of \u201cemployee misconduct,\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> her termination was illegal be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>cause the \u201cappointing authority\u201d did not follow the pre-termination procedures outlined in \u00a7 11-106. Even were we to assume, for the sake of argument, that Chairman Schisler terminated Wilson for the reasons she assigns, the question remains whether any of the \u201cfactual\u201d bases urged rose to the level of \u201cemployee misconduct,\u201d as contemplated by \u00a7 11-106.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">In <em>Smack v. Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, </em>134 Md.App. 412, 759 A.2d 1209 (2000), <em>aff'd, </em>378 Md. 298, 835 A.2d 1175 (2003), the Court of Special Appeals held that \u00a7 11-106 did not apply to probationary employees in the State Personnel Management System. In reaching that conclusion, the intermediate appellate court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\">At oral argument, appellant [employee] asserted that, even if a probationary employee\u2019s employment could be terminated at the discretion of the employer, nevertheless, \u00a7 11-106 would be applicable in this case because [the employer] in fact treated this as a misconduct case. We disagree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>[Section \u00a7 11-106] does not define misconduct, but it is clearly a concept distinct from lack of proficiency in employment, although the two could overlap.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 419, 759 A.2d at 1213. Although the Court of Special Appeals ultimately determined that it was \u201cimmaterial\u201d whether the conduct in question could be classified as \u201cmisconduct,\u201d we agree generally with the intermediate court\u2019s analysis that there is a clear distinction between \u201cemployee performance\u201d and \u201cemployee misconduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In support of this view, we look to the regulations promulgated pursuant to Title 11 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">COMAR 17.04.05, entitled \u201cDisciplinary Actions,\u201d covers generally disciplinary actions taken against all employees, no matter in what service classification they may be categorized. Regulations within this chapter make a sharp distinction between disciplinary actions related to \u201cemployee performance,\u201d and disciplinary actions related to \u201cemployee misconduct.\u201d <em>See </em>17.04.05.01(A) (stating that disciplinary actions may be taken both as a result of \u201c[unsatisfactory performance of duties and responsibilities\u201d and \u201c[m]isconduct\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">COMAR 17.04.05 recognizes a distinction between the discipline of management service employees on one hand, and the discipline of professional and skilled service employees on the other. COMAR 17.04.05.01(H), for example, states that \u201c[a] disciplinary action against an employee under special appointment or in the management and executive services is governed by Regulations .05 and .06 of this chapter.\u201d Those two regulations, in essence, reiterate the at-will nature of management service employees and the relatively restricted, post-termination administrative appeal process available to those employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">COMAR 17.04.05.03 and 17.04.05.04, on the other hand, apply only to disciplinary actions taken against employees in the skilled or professional services. COMAR 17.04.05.03, in relevant part, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-8\">.03 Disciplinary Actions Related to Employee Performance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>B. The appointing authority may discipline an employee for reasons related to the employee\u2019s performance. These reasons include but are not limited to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-4\">(1) That the employee is incompetent or inefficient in the performance of the employee\u2019s duty;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-5\">(2) That the employee is an individual with a disability who with a reasonable accommodation cannot perform the essential functions of the position; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-6\">(3) That the employee currently is not qualified for the position.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">COMAE, 17.04.05.04, in relevant part, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-8\">.04 Disciplinary Actions Relating to Employee Misconduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-9\">B. An employee may be disciplined for engaging in any of the following actions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-10\">(1) Being negligent in the performance of duties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-11\">(2) Engaging in intentional misconduct, without justification, which injures another person, causes damage to property, or threatens the safety of the work place;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-12\">(3) Being guilty of conduct that has brought or, if publicized, would bring the State into disrepute;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-13\">(4) Being unjustifiably offensive in the employee\u2019s conduct toward fellow employees, wards of the State, or the public;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-14\">(5) Violating a provision of the State Personnel and Pensions Article, Title 2, Subtitle 3; Title 15; or \u00a7 9-607; Annotated Code of Maryland;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-15\">(6) Stealing State property with a value of $300 or less;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-16\">(7) After notification, continuing to engage in another business, trade, or occupation, which conflicts with the employee\u2019s position, or which prevents the employee from satisfactorily performing the duties of the employee\u2019s position;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-17\">(8) Engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, misrepresentation, or illegality;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>(9) Causing damage to public property or wasting public supplies through negligence, recklessness, or willful conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-5\">(10) Willfully making a false official statement or report;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-6\">(11) Knowingly assisting another in conduct that is a violation of State Personnel and Pensions Article, Annotated Code of Maryland, the regulations in this chapter, or any other lawful agency policy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-7\">(12) Violating a lawful order or failing to obey a lawful order given by a superior, or engaging in conduct, violating a lawful order, or failing to obey a lawful order which amounts to subordination;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-8\">(13) Engaging in discrimination prohibited by law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-9\">(14) Using leave contrary to law or policy; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-10\">(15) Committing another act, not previously specified, when there is a connection between the employee\u2019s activities and an identifiable detriment to the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">Although these two regulations, forming part of the related regulatory scheme implementing the State Personnel and Pensions Article, apply expressly only to those employees in the skilled and professional services and, thus, not to Wilson\u2019s position at issue in the present case, we conclude that they provide a proper perspective on the distinction between performance deficiencies and \u201cemployee misconduct.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> For example, COMAR 17.04.05.03(B) states explicitly that not being qualified or being incompetent or inefficient is a deficiency in <em>performance, </em>rather than misconduct. Each of these examples of a deficiency in performance denotes an inability to perform satisfactorily one\u2019s duties, rather than an intentional or negligent failure to fulfill one\u2019s duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">The regulations relating to \u201cemployee misconduct,\u201d on the other hand, do not implicate necessarily an employee\u2019s abilities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>or qualifications to perform in a position. Instead, each of the enumerated examples of \u201cmisconduct\u201d involves either negligence, willful disregard of one\u2019s duties, failure to comply with employer regulations, knowingly violating a statute, or the commission of a criminal act. There is an element of wrongdoing or culpable negligence that is woven throughout the examples of \u201cmisconduct,\u201d a trait not shared with the examples of performance deficiencies. <em>See </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1019 (8th ed.2004) (defining \u201cmisconduct\u201d generally as \u201c[a] dereliction of duty; unlawful or improper behavior\u201d). Although, as stated above, these regulations do not apply directly to Wilson\u2019s former position, they guide us in concluding that the performance issues mentioned by Chairman Schisler in his deposition would not qualify, as a matter of law, as \u201cemployee misconduct,\u201d even if they formed the bases for Wilson\u2019s termination, and therefore do not implicate the protections of \u00a7 11-106.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">We find further support for this characterization and analysis of \u201cemployee misconduct\u201d through examination of another Maryland statutory scheme and its related case law in which the scope of employment \u201cmisconduct\u201d has been scrutinized. Title 8 of the Labor and Employment Article, entitled \u201cUnemployment Insurance,\u201d establishes a program in which cash benefits are paid to individuals who become unemployed involuntarily, in order to \u201clighten [the] burden\u201d of the economic instability attributed to prolonged unemployment. Md.Code (1991, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 8-102 of the Labor and Employment Article (\u201cLE\u201d). This statutory scheme also provides that an otherwise eligible individual may be disqualified from receiving all or a portion of these unemployment benefits under varying enumerated circumstances. In addition to being disqualified as the result of a voluntary resignation (without good cause), an individual may be disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits if \u201cthe Secretary [of the Department of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation] finds that unemployment results from discharge or suspension as a disciplinary measure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>for behavior that the Secretary finds is <em>misconduct </em>in connection with employment....\u201d LE \u00a7 8-1003 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Section 8-1003 of the LE Article is part of a graduated disqualification scheme in which escalating periods of disqualification are imposed depending on the severity of the claimant\u2019s misconduct. Sections 8-1002 and 8-1002.1 of the LE Article, covering terminations involving \u201cgross misconduct\u201d and \u201caggravated misconduct,\u201d respectively, allow for significantly longer lengths of disqualification than would a finding of simple \u201cmisconduct\u201d under \u00a7 8-1003. Although \u201cmisconduct,\u201d as used in \u00a7 8-1003, is not defined in the statutory scheme,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> several Maryland cases have interpreted and defined the term in this statutory context. <em>See Dep\u2019t of </em>Labor, <em>Licensing &amp; Regulation v. Hider, </em>349 Md. 71, 84, 706 A.2d 1073, 1079 (1998) (holding that, in order to constitute \u201cmisconduct,\u201d a person\u2019s wrongful conduct need not be intentional); <em>Allen v. Core Target City Youth Program, </em>275 Md. 69, 87, 338 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>A.2d 237, 247-48 (1975) (commenting on the distinction between \u201cleaving work voluntarily\u201d and termination for \u201cmisconduct\u201d); <em>Johns Hopkins Univ. v. Bd. of Labor, Licensing, &amp; Regulations, </em>134 Md.App. 653, 662-63, 761 A.2d 350, 354-55 (2000) (affirming the lack of an intent requirement to find that conduct resulting from bipolar disorder was nonetheless disqualifying \u201cmisconduct\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">In <em>Hider, </em>we rejected the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s conclusion that, in order to constitute \u201cmisconduct\u201d under \u00a7 8-1003, \u201can employee\u2019s misbehavior must be intentional.\u201d 349 Md. at 84, 706 A.2d at 1079. Relying on the three-tiered system of disqualification provided for in the statute, the Court reasoned that applying an intent requirement to mere \u201cmisconduct\u201d under \u00a7 8-1003 would blur the distinctions between ordinary \u201cmisconduct\u201d and \u201cgross\u201d or \u201caggravated\u201d misconduct. <em>Id. </em>at 82-84, 706 A.2d at 1078-79. In rejecting an intent requirement, we adopted the following definition of \u201cmisconduct\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Au\">The term, \u201cmisconduct,\u201d ... means a transgression of some established rule or policy of the employer, the commission of a forbidden act, a dereliction of duty, or a course of wrongful conduct committed by an employee, within the scope of his employment relationship, during hours of employment, or on the employer\u2019s premises.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 85, 706 A.2d at 1079 (quoting <em>Rogers v. Radio Shack, </em>271 Md. 126, 132, 314 A.2d 113, 117 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">We note that, in most unemployment benefit disqualification situations discussed in the reported cases, there is present naturally a concerted attempt on the part of the employee to demonstrate that his or her behavior was not \u201cmisconduct\u201d under all or some of the statutory definitions. <em>See, e.g., Hider, </em>349 Md. at 73-74, 706 A.2d at 1074-75. In the present case, however, the employee, Wilson, urges that a court conclude that she was terminated as the result of \u201cemployee misconduct.\u201d Nonetheless, we resolve that the definition of \u201cmisconduct\u201d established in <em>Hider </em>provides a suitable and proper standard to be applied when determining whether conduct rises to the level of \u201cemployee misconduct\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>requiring the application of the pre-termination protections of \u00a7 11-106 prior to discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Applying this definition to the present case, we conclude that the performance issues identified by Chairman Schisler during his deposition, even assuming they formed all or some of the bases for his termination of Wilson, do not rise, as a matter of law, to the level of a discharge for \u201cemployee misconduct.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Ramsey v. Mississippi Employment Sec. Comm\u2019n, </em>\u2014 So.2d-, at-, 2005 WL 1530431, at *2 (Miss.Ct.App.2005) (stating that \u201c[m]ere inefficiency, unsatisfactory conduct, failure in good performance as the result of inability or incapacity, or inadvertence and ordinary negligence in isolated incidents, and good faith errors in judgment or discretion were not considered \u2018misconduct\u2019 within the meaning of the [Mississippi unemployment benefits statute]\u201d). Each of the performance issues mentioned by the Chairman involved, at worst and if true, a deficiency in judgment, skill, ability, or competence, rather than \u201cthe commission of a forbidden act, a dereliction of duty, or a course of wrongful conduct.\u201d There is no evidentiary basis in this record from which a trier of fact could conclude that Wilson\u2019s alleged performance shortcomings constituted a breach or \u201ctransgression of some established rule or policy of the employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">Nor could any of the performance issues constitute a \u201cdereliction of duty.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201cdereliction\u201d as \u201c[abandonment, especially] through neglect or moral wrong.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 475 (8th ed.2004). Similarly, Black\u2019s defines \u201cderelict\u201d as \u201c[packing a sense of duty; in breach of a legal or moral obligation <em>&lt;the managers were derelict in their duties </em>&gt;\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The common understanding of the term \u201cdereliction of duty,\u201d along with those of \u201cforbidden act\u201d and \u201ccourse of wrongful conduct,\u201d endorse our conclusion that, in order to rise to the level of \u201cemployee misconduct,\u201d the alleged conduct would need to involve some element of wrongdoing, culpable negligence, or breach of a legal or moral obligation. Although Wilson\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>perceived performance deficiencies, in Chairman Schisler\u2019s opinion, may have been disruptive to the operation of the PSC as he conceived it should take place, such conduct did not involve any element of wrongdoing or culpable negligence. The mere incompetency or inefficiency of an employee, without an element of wrongdoing, does not constitute misconduct. We hold that, when an employee in the management service, in the opinion of the \u201cappointing authority,\u201d simply does not possess the skills, abilities, or judgment necessary to fulfill satisfactorily his or her duties, those deficiencies ordinarily do not rise to the level of a finding of \u201cemployee misconduct\u201d and therefore a termination, if based expressly or implicitly on such deficiencies or related conduct, would not implicate \u00a7 11\u2014 106. We conclude that the performance issues elicited from Chairman Schisler in his deposition do not amount to \u201cemployee misconduct\u201d and, thus, a termination based on those alleged shortcomings, even assuming that is what occurred here, does not implicate \u00a7 11-106.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Wilson additionally contends that she was terminated as a result of her alleged fraudulent completion and submission of a time sheet. In our view, however, although such conduct, if assumed to be true, would constitute \u201cemployee misconduct\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 11-106, the statute is inapplicable to the present case because Wilson failed to generate a triable issue whether Chairman Schisler relied on the time sheet incident as a basis for his decision to terminate her.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">As summarized <em>supra, </em>Chairman Schisler, during his deposition, detailed an interaction with Wilson in which, it fairly may be deemed, he impliedly accused her of intentionally submitting a false time sheet. Applying the definition of \u201cmisconduct\u201d adopted earlier in this opinion, such conduct, had it been offered as the basis for the termination, clearly would constitute an allegation of \u201cemployee misconduct.\u201d The prem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>ise behind a fraudulent time sheet indicating more time worked than in actuality was performed is obviously that the employee, although required or believed to be present at the workplace and engaged in the employer\u2019s work, in essence abandoned his or her position to a level tantamount to a \u201cdereliction of duty.\u201d Furthermore, such conduct would be a \u201cforbidden act.\u201d COMAR 17.04.05.04, which outlines \u201cemployee misconduct,\u201d includes within that concept the act of \u201c[e]ngaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, misrepresentation, or illegality.\u201d A permissible inference that may be drawn from what Chairman Schisler stated at his deposition is that, at some time around the end of the 2003 holiday season, he thought that, in submitting her time sheet, Wilson may have been dishonest and misrepresented the actual amount of time that she worked. A fraudulent entry on a submitted time sheet certainly would qualify, under the examples found in this regulation, as \u201cemployee misconduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Chairman Schisler, however, claimed that, although he concluded his investigation of the time sheet incident feeling \u201ctroubled]\u201d about Wilson\u2019s culpability and credibility, he did not factor this \u201cmisconduct\u201d into his decision to terminate her. Wilson claims that, in his deposition, the Chairman admitted that the time sheet incident played a role in the termination decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">The Commission retorts that, even if Chairman Schisler considered the time sheet incident in reaching his termination decision, the pre-termination statutory protections of \u00a7 11-106 should not apply because it was not a reason expressly given for termination in the written notice (indeed, the only notice) to Wilson. The Commission asks us to subscribe to a bright-line rule in which the process guaranteed in \u00a7 11-106 is required only when \u201cemployee misconduct\u201d is the only, or perhaps the primary, express reason given for the imposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>of discipline.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> We decline the Commission\u2019s invitation and instead adhere to the plain statutory language of \u00a7 11-106.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">We begin our analysis with an examination of the role that \u00a7 11-106, as applied to management service employees, plays in the statutory scheme regarding discipline in general and temiinations specifically. As noted <em>supra, </em>before an employee is disciplined for \u201cemployee misconduct,\u201d the \u201cappointing authority,\u201d no matter in which classification or service the employee resides, must follow the statutory process outlined in \u00a7 11-106. Whether the \u201cappointing authority\u201d must follow similar procedures when imposing disciplinary sanctions as the result of \u201cemployee performance,\u201d however, depends on the classification or service of the employee in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">COMAR 17.04.05.03(C) states that, before an employee in the skilled or professional services may be disciplined for performance-related reasons, the \u201cappointing authority\u201d must comply with investigatory and notice provisions similar to those mandated by \u00a7 11-106. There are no similar pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>disciplinary provisions, in either the State Personnel and Pensions Article or the regulations promulgated pursuant to that Article, governing performance-related personnel actions with respect to management service employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Some cases have discussed the rationale and importance behind \u00a7 11-106 and its comprehensive scope. In <em>Maryland Reception, Diagnostic &amp; Classification Center v. Watson, </em>144 Md.App. 684, 691, 800 A.2d 16, 20 (2002), the Court of Special Appeals opined that the purpose of the statutory protections outlined in \u00a7 11-106 \u201ccan be discerned from an overview of the entire statutory scheme for imposing discipline on State employees: to prevent an appointing authority from imposing discipline on the basis of an unsubstantiated accusation.\u201d <em>See also W. Corr. Inst. v. Geiger, </em>371 Md. 125, 144, 807 A.2d 32, 43 (2002) (stating that \u201c[i]t is significant that one of the prerequisites for the imposition of discipline is the conduct of an investigation of the alleged misconduct\u201d). In <em>Danaher, </em>the Court of Special Appeals affirmed this protective aspect of \u00a7 11-106 in the context of a management service employee. 148 Md.App. at 166, 811 A.2d at 375. In holding that the investigation undertaken by the employer pursuant to \u00a7 11-106 was deficient, the intermediate appellate court stressed that the statute\u2019s purpose, in part, was to provide an extra layer of protection, even with respect to at-will employees, to prevent the collateral consequences that may result when an employee is found culpable for \u201cemployee misconduct.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 176-78, 811 A.2d at 381-82 (noting that, because Danaher, a 25 year veteran of state service, was found responsible for \u201cemployee misconduct\u201d and thus terminated \u201cwith prejudice,\u201d he was subject to possible disqualification from employment with the State for up to three years).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Although we too acknowledge this protective characteristic of \u00a7 11-106, we are also mindful that its less than careful application has the potential to alter fundamentally the scope of at-will employment with respect to the management service. Nonetheless, the language of \u00a7 11-106 is clear: \u201cBefore taking <em>any </em>disciplinary action related to employee mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>conduct, an appointing authority <em>shall </em>\u201d follow specific investigatory procedures. (Emphasis added). Based on this plain and unambiguous language, we conclude that, if it appears that a disciplinary action may have been based, even <em>sub silentio, </em>on alleged facts constituting \u201cemployee misconduct,\u201d the \u201cappointing authority\u201d must be held accountable to follow the procedures outlined in \u00a7 11-106.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">Section 11-106 appears to be a sharp limitation on the discretion of the \u201cappointing authority\u201d to discipline its employees. With regard to at-will employees such as those in the management service, however, the statutory scheme provides the \u201cappointing authority\u201d with certain leeway in the disciplinary process. When the \u201cappointing authority\u201d seeks to impose disciplinary sanctions on a skilled or professional service employee, the State Personnel and Pensions Article and its regulations provide that the \u201cappointing authority\u201d bears the burden of proof. \u00a7 11-109; COMAR 17.04.05.01(G). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>When the \u201cappointing authority\u201d seeks to impose disciplinary sanctions on a management service employee, however, the State Personnel and Pensions Article and its regulations provide that the <em>employee </em>bears a burden of proof. \u00a7 11-113; COMAR 17.04.05.01(E)(1). When an employee in the management service claims that his or her discipline was unlawful because the \u201cappointing authority\u201d did not follow the specific procedures in \u00a7 11-106, the employee bears the burden of demonstrating that either the \u201cappointing authority\u2019 did not follow properly the procedures in \u00a7 11-106 or that the disciplinary action was the result of some meaningful consideration by the \u201cappointing authority\u201d of uncharged \u201cemployee misconduct.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> In the absence of such a demonstration, a termination or other discipline of an at-will employee, without a reason being given and without obeisance to the statutory procedures in \u00a7 11-106, is not unlawful necessarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">In this case, we conclude that the Circuit Court erred, as a matter of law, in determining, on the pleadings and other papers before it, that Chairman Schisler, <em>sub silentio, </em>terminated Wilson for \u201cemployee misconduct\u201d regarding the time sheet incident.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The only factual bases upon which the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>judge could have relied in reaching this conclusion were contained in the deposition of Chairman Schisler. No matter how Wilson torques extracted portions of the Chairman\u2019s responses, however, she failed to point to admissible facts supporting the claim that Chairman Schisler, to any meaningful degree, took the time sheet incident into account when he decided to terminate her.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> A fair reading of the deposition, however, indicates that Chairman Schisler stated that, although he may have taken into account the performance issues relating to his opinion of Wilson\u2019s judgment, efficiency, and competency, he resolved to his satisfaction the time sheet incident without any disciplinary action, and it therefore did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>not factor into his termination decision. Wilson understandably attempts to weave a different motive out of certain general statements and responses to hypotheticals. Nonetheless, we conclude that the re-termination of Wilson by a majority of the full Commission<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> was not unlawful as a result of its failure to follow the pre-termination statutory procedures in \u00a7 11-106.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The Commission argues also that the Circuit Court erred when it found that the intra-agency post-termination adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>trative appeal process was unconstitutional as applied to Wilson\u2019s case because it did not provide for an impartial agency adjudicator. Section 11-113 provides, in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">\u00a7 11-113. Appeal to head of principal unit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-6\">(a) <em>Applicability of section </em>\u2014 This section only applies to an employee:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">(1) in the management service;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-8\">(2) in executive service; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-9\">(3) under a special appointment described in \u00a7 6-405 of this article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-10\">(b) <em>Procedure. </em>\u2014 (1) An employee or an employee\u2019s representative may file a written appeal of a disciplinary action with the head of the principal unit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-11\">(2) An appeal:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-12\">(i) must be filed within 15 days after the employee receives notice of the disciplinary action; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-13\">(ii) may only be based on the grounds that the disciplinary action is illegal or unconstitutional.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-14\">(3) The employee has the burden of proof in an appeal under this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-15\">(c) <em>Conference. </em>\u2014 The head of the principal unit may confer with the employee before making a decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-16\">(d) <em>Disposition. </em>\u2014 (1) The head of a principal unit may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-17\">(i) uphold the disciplinary action; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-18\">(ii) rescind or modify the disciplinary action and restore to the employee any lost time, compensation, status, or benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-19\">(2) Within 15 days after receiving an appeal, the head of the principal unit shall issue the employee a written decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-20\">(3) The decision of the head of the principal unit is the final administrative decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-21\">(e) <em>Expungement of personnel records. </em>\u2014 Within 15 days after issuance of a decision to rescind a disciplinary action, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>the disciplinary action shall be expunged from the employee\u2019s personnel records.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The Commission concedes that, because Chairman Schisler is the \u201chead of the principal unit\u201d with respect to the Commission, he is the proper, and ordinarily would be the, individual under the statutory scheme to hear an appeal by Wilson of her re-termination. Indeed, that view is confirmed by the direction in the 29 October memorandum to Wilson notifying her of her re-termination and directing her to file with the Chairman any appeal she might care to make. Wilson argues that, because the Chairman initiated her termination, he was biased against her of necessity. She maintains that, under Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights (\u201cArticle 24\u201d),<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> she was entitled to a fair and impartial agency adjudicator.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> We, however, need not reach or decide the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>issue of whether Wilson was deprived unconstitutionally of a fair and impartial agency adjudicator because we conclude that she failed to invoke and exhaust the specific administrative remedy provided by statute when a management service, at-will employee of the PSC is terminated for other than misconduct. Therefore, she may not maintain in our State courts the claim she makes here.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">In <em>SEFAC Lift, &amp; Equipment Corporation v. Mass Transit Administration, </em>367 Md. 374, 380, 788 A.2d 192, 196 (2002), we elaborated on the exhaustion of remedies doctrine of administrative law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">We have long held, and have recently confirmed, that \u201c[wjhere an administrative agency has primary or exclusive jurisdiction over a controversy, the parties to the controversy must ordinarily await a final administrative decision before resorting to the courts for resolution of the controversy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">(citations omitted). <em>See also Furnitureland South, Inc. v. Comptroller, </em>364 Md. 126, 133, 771 A.2d 1061, 1065 (2001) (stating that, \u201cwhere the Legislature has provided an administrative remedy for a particular matter or matters, there is a presumption that the Legislature intended such remedy to be primary and intended that the administrative remedy must be invoked and exhausted before resort to the courts\u201d).<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>In this case, \u00a7 11-113 provided a specific statutory administrative appeal process for certain categories of State employees, of which Wilson was one. Although Wilson apparently submitted an administrative appeal pursuant to \u00a7 11-113 following her initial termination, she failed to do so with respect to her re-termination, instead opting to file an unsuccessful motion to hold the Commission in contempt in the action in the Circuit Court arising from the initial termination. We find that, before Wilson could seek a judicial forum to resolve the disputes she seeks to raise with her re-termination, she was required to file and prosecute to a final administrative decision an administrative appeal under \u00a7 11-113.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">This is not a mere reflexive application of the exhaustion doctrine. Whether such an appeal (and any issues as to illegality or unconstitutionality of the re-termination that may have been asserted) would have been considered and decided by the Chairman never will be known. <em>See </em>note 38 <em>supra. </em>The effort to mount the appeal may have been minimal (considering that much of the work from the prior appeal may have been recyclable), but the potential benefit to Wilson may have been great. Had the Chairman decided the appeal, as perhaps the re-termination notice implied would be the case, she would have taken from the Chairman and the Commission the argument they make here that the Commission intended to delegate that responsibility to another. By the same token, had she noted the appeal and it was delegated properly to an entity or person free of the alleged \u201coriginal sin\u201d of the Chairman, she may have gotten the impartial agency review she desired and would not have made the argument she now makes. In effect, by not filing the appeal, she enabled her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>argument here, in the nature of an anticipatory breach of the right she claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Wilson argues that, because Chairman Schisler was involved in the termination and re-termination decisions and the former administrative appeal process, she need not exhaust the administrative process following re-termination because he was <em>unconstitutionally </em>biased against her. Although we recognize that a constitutional challenge to a statute or regulation on its face may provide an exception to the normal application of the exhaustion doctrine, we conclude that that exception is not applicable here because Wilson\u2019s constitutional challenge is framed as an \u201cas applied\u201d one.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Maryland courts long have recognized a \u201cconstitutional exception\u201d to the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine. <em>See, e.g., Montgomery County v. Broadcast Equities, Inc., </em>360 Md. 438, 455-60, 758 A.2d 995, 1004-07 (2000) (chronicling the development and scope of the \u201cconstitutional exception\u201d to the exhaustion doctrine and emphasizing that it is very \u201cnarrow\u201d); <em>Shipp v. Bevard, </em>291 Md. 590, 599, 435 A.2d 1114, 1118 (1981). In <em>Shipp, </em>we observed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">[Wjhen there is an attack upon the constitutionality or validity of an enactment on its face, such case falls within a well-established exception to the principle that statutory administrative and judicial review remedies are normally deemed exclusive and must be pursued and exhausted. However, ... when the attack is upon the constitutionality of an enactment <em>as applied </em>to a particular situation, as contrasted with an attack upon the validity of an enactment as a whole, the case does not come within the exception and the statutory administrative and judicial review remedies are ordinarily exclusive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">291 Md. at 599, 435 A.2d at 1118.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">In this case, Wilson does not attack the constitutionality of \u00a7 11-113 on its face or as a whole, but rather as applied to the alleged facts of her situation. Her constitutional claim is premised on the particular facts of this case, <em>i.e. </em>Chairman Schisler\u2019s role in the initial termination action (and his partic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>ipation in voting, together with two other Commissioners, to re-terminate her) renders him unable to be fair and impartial in assessing whether the re-termination action was \u201cillegal or unconstitutional.\u201d Of course, on this record, we have no way of knowing what arguments as to \u201cillegality\u201d or \u201cunconstitutionality\u201d of the re-termination Wilson might have made under \u00a7 11 \u2014 113(b)(2)(ii) because she failed to offer them. Accordingly, it is difficult to analyze whether Chairman Sehisler\u2019s disposition of an imaginary appeal of the re-termination would reflect impermissible bias, assuming he would have served as the \u201chead of the principal unit\u201d in considering and deciding it, rather than delegating the responsibility to some entity or someone free of prior meaningful association with Wilson\u2019s case <em>(see </em>note 38 <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Even in the case of the \u00a7 11-113 appeal taken by Wilson from the initial termination, which, as we noted earlier, this record does not contain the writing whereby she tendered her specific arguments, we are unable to detect any obvious impermissible bias from the Chairman\u2019s written disposition of her assumed contentions. Wilson\u2019s presumed arguments as to illegality or unconstitutionality made at that time, whether correctly or incorrectly resolved, were accorded reasonably detailed explanations for their rejection. Furthermore, the Chairman\u2019s responses were not flippant, frivolous, or facetious on their face. We are unwilling to assume the apparent premise of Wilson\u2019s argument that some kind of blind pride of authorship or hubris of power renders an administrative decision-maker <em>ipso facto </em>unable to assess fairly and objectively arguments that his or her decision should be revisited, changed, or abandoned. In the instance of the recusal of members of administrative bodies, we have refused to adopt a <em>per se </em>rule of recusal. <em>See Spencer, </em>380 Md. at 534 n. 7, 846 A.2d at 352 n. 7. Because the record in this case does not reveal a factual predicate for specific personal bias against Wilson by Chairman Schisler, we shall not accept her invitation to excuse her failure to exhaust the specific administrative remedy made available to her by \u00a7 11-113.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">As noted <em>supra, </em>Section 11 \u2014 113 provides that, if a management employee wishes to appeal a disciplinary action, he or she must \u201cfile a written appeal ... with the head of the principal unit ... within 15 days after the employee receives notice of the disciplinary action.\u201d In this case, Wilson was given notice of her re-termination on 29 October 2004. She therefore was required to file a written appeal within 15 days of that date if she desired to contest the action taken against her on grounds of illegality or unconstitutionality. Wilson failed to do so, opting instead to file in the pending court action, on 4 November 2004, a petition to hold the Commission in contempt of court. As a result, Wilson allowed the relevant time period to expire without following the statutory directive under \u00a7 11-113. Application of the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies bars her effort to seek alternative redress in the Circuit Court on the ground that the \u00a7 11-113 administrative remedy was unconstitutional as applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Wilson argues in her brief that, should we conclude that she was not terminated \u201cfor cause,\u201d we should remand this matter to the Circuit Court for further discovery and possible trial of her claim that she was terminated because of her political affiliation and/or beliefs in violation of Article 40 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> This claim too is precluded by her failure to exhaust her opportunity to take an administrative appeal of the re-termination decision.

Prior to entry of the Circuit Court\u2019s 15 November 2004 order, the Commission, on 12 November 2004, filed an emergency motion in the Court of Special Appeals for a stay of that part of the Circuit Court's order allowing Wilson to \"physically return to work,\" which was granted by Chief Judge Joseph F. Murphy, Jr. that same day. On 23 November 2004, after considering Wilson\u2019s opposition, Chief Judge Murphy issued an order making the stay permanent abiding the outcome of the appeals. The stay was not altered by this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b182-9\">. Although it appears that, during her intra-agency administrative appeal following the initial termination, Wilson challenged her classification as a management service position employee and her status as an at-will employee, no real arguments to that effect were raised in the Circuit Court or here. In any event, the record demonstrates that Wilson\u2019s position, Manager of the Office of External Relations (officially classified as Administrative Program Manager II), was reclassified in 1996 from a skilled service to a management service classification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b184-11\">. In arguing that there is a presumption that the \"appointing authority\u201d is an individual, rather than a unit of government, the Commission does not address the fact that the definition of \"appointing authority\u201d as a \"person\u201d was only in effect for a short time. Prior to 1988, Md.Code (1957, 1988 Repl.Vol.), Art. 64A, \u00a7 1 defined \"appointing authority\u201d as \"any commission, board or officer having power to make appointments.\u201d In 1988, the former Art. 64A, \u00a7 1 was repealed and replaced with a new set of definitions. 1988 Md. Laws, Chap. 543. Md.Code (1957, 1988 Repl.Vol., 1992 Cum.Supp.), Art. 64A, \u00a7 1(1), defined \"appointing authority\u201d as \"a person having the power to make appointments and to terminate employment.\u201d Finally, in 1993, the definition was amended again to reflect its current language. 1993 Md. Laws, Chap. 10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b187-5\">. The Commission also argues that its interpretation is supported by-analyzing the predecessor to \u00a7 2-108(d), which was enacted in 1976. 1976 Md. Laws, Chap. 756. This statutory language, of which one purpose was that of \u201cproviding procedures for the appointment of Commission members,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\">16.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-7\">(A) The annual budget shall provide sufficient funds for the Commission to hire, develop, and organize a staff to perform its functions under this Article, including but not limited to the analysis of all data submitted to the Commission and the preparation of a staff position in matters pending before the Commission. <em>The staff shall include hut not he limited to economists, cost of capital experts, rate design experts, accountants, engineers, transportation specialists, lawyers, and any other experts deemed necessary to meet the needs of the Commission. </em>The Commission may, from time to time, retain additional experts as required for a particular matter. Those lawyers who represent the Commission staff in proceedings before the Commission shall be organized and operate independently of the Office of General Counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-8\">(B) The Commission shall hire hearing examiners to the extent required. Hearing examiners shall constitute a separate organizational unit reporting directly to the Commission and shall perform no other staff functions than those relating to hearings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>(C) The Commission shall hire personal staff for the Commissioners to the extent required to advise Commissioners, draft proposed orders and rulings, and perform other personal staff functions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-6\">(D) Subject to the restrictions of \u00a7 20, the Commission may delegate to any Commissioner or personnel of the Commission the authority to perform any administrative function necessary to the execution of the Commission\u2019s duties under this Article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">1976 Md. Laws, Chap. 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">One year later, the Legislature struck the language italicized above, instead placing the following language in its place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-9\">THE COMMISSION SHALL HIRE economists; cost of capital experts; rate design experts; accountants; engineers; transportation specialists; lawyers; and any other experts deemed necessary to meet the needs of the Commission; OR, AS REQUIRED, RETAIN SUCH PERSONS ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">1977 Md. Laws, Chap. 635.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-11\">The Commission argues that \"the intent of the additional language stating that the Commission \u2018SHALL HIRE' was to remove tire Commission's discretion with regard to whether such staff should be hired. No reasonable reading of this provision could result in the conclusion that the General Assembly was designating the five-member body as the Appointing Authority.\u201d We view the Commission's argument as misguided. Although the 1977 legislation required the Commission to hire the enumerated positions and experts, the essence of an \"appointing authority\u201d is not necessarily the authority to determine <em>which </em>positions for which to hire, but rather <em>who </em>is hired for the particular positions. This amendment is no different from the statutes in the PUC Article mandating that the Commission appoint an executive secretary, executive director, general counsel, and license hearing officer. Simply because the Legislature identifies certain positions it deems to be essential to the operation of a particular agency does not abrogate or negate the authority and discretion of the \"appointing authority\" to select the specific persons to be employed in those capacities.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b189-6\">. We draw no conclusion from an analysis of when the \"serves at the pleasure of the Commission\u201d language was added to each of the other relevant statutes. In the case of the statute authorizing the appointment of the Executive Secretary, the relevant language was added in 1998 upon the recodification of Article 78 into the Public Utility Companies Article. 1998 Md. Laws, Chap. 8. Although such language was absent from the respective provision in Article 78, the Revisor\u2019s Note states that the phrase, \"serves at the pleasure \u00f3f the Commission,\u201d is \"new language added for clarity reflecting the transfer of the Executive Secretary to the Executive Pay Plan.\u201d The relevant language, in regard to the Executive Director, was present in the original legislation authorizing the appointment of that position. 1980 Md. Laws, Chap. 801. In regard to the License Hearing Officer, the relevant language was also present in the original enactment of the statute authorizing the appointment of that position. 1966 Md. Laws, Chap. 379.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b190-7\">. Although the Commission cites examples of recent past Chairmen acting as the \"appointing authority\u201d during their tenures (dating back approximately ten years), the Commission presents no evidence that the Chairman's position has acted consistently as the \"appointing authority\u201d during the more than 90 year history of the Commission. Thus, on this record, there is no sufficiently longstanding, consistently followed administrative agency practice or interpretation that is entitled to deference in our analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b191-8\">. COMAR 17.04.01.04(A)(5), promulgated pursuant to Title 1 and \u00a7 4-106 of the Slate Personnel and Pensions Article, provides also that an \u201cappointing authority,\u201d consistent with the State Personnel and Pensions Article, may \u201c[d]elegate in writing the authority to act on the appointing authority's behalf to any other employee or officer under the appointing authority's jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b191-9\">. Although we quote here from the advice letter of the Assistant Attorney General, we afford no enhanced weight to its conclusions and analysis. We have remarked in several instances that, although we may give some consideration to formal opinions of the Attorney General, we are not bound by them. <em>See, e.g., Drew v. First Guaranty Mortgage Corp., </em>379 Md. 318, 332, 842 A.2d 1, 9 (2003) (giving formal opinion letter due consideration, but disagreeing with its conclusion). In this case, however, we are confronted not with a formal opinion, but an informal advice letter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b192-7\">. The Commission argues also that, even if we do not accept its interpretation of \"appointing authority,\u201d we should accord deference to the acquiescence of the State Department of Budget and Management (\"DBM\u201d) in the Commission\u2019s interpretation. The Commission cites instances in which past Chairmen filed with the DBM, without objection, formal delegations of the \"appointing authority\u201d without the approval, acquiescence, or delegation of the full Commission. <em>See </em>COMAR 17.04.01.04(D) (stating that the \u201cappointing authority\u201d must \"notify the Secretary [of the Department of Budget and Management] of any delegation of authority by providing the Secretary a copy of the delegation\"). Any weight accorded this passive acquiescence is negligible compared to the level of deference we traditionally give to the active interpretation of regulations in an adversarial environment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b194-7\">. Although a determination as to whether Wilson was terminated \"for cause\" did not appear in the 25 October order, the trial judge, at the 20 October 2004 hearing, commented on this issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-8\">It seems to me that the Commission is, is caught in a bind. They either \u2014 this was an at-will termination by the Chair, or it was a termination for one of the reasons set forth in Mr. Schisler's, the Chair\u2019s deposition, that it be for cause. If it was for cause, they\u2019ve got to follow the usual steps that are required for an at cause [sic] for termination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-9\">But I\u2019m going to give the benefit of a doubt in this case, and that he was terminating an at-will employee when he was not delegated the authority by the Commission....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">From this language (and the absence of a determination to the contrary in the 25 October order), it appears that the trial judge concluded that the termination was not deficient for failure to follow the statutory mandate of \u00a7 11-106 because it was not a termination based on \"employee misconduct\" (or, in the trial judge's terminology, \"for cause\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">During the 10 November hearing, the trial judge, although declining to hold the Commission in contempt, remarked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-12\">... I don\u2019t want to hold the Commission in contempt though their action probably was contemptuous.... All I want them to do \u2014 and I don't think they cured the situation <em>because I found that she was terminated for cause </em>\u2014 they have to go through the process of a hearing on whether they had cause to terminate her. Go through the process \u2014 the whole process they have for with cause termination. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-13\">The emphasized language from the 10 November hearing transcript suggests that the trial judge mis-recollected his earlier view or, at best, changed his mind.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b195-8\">. In the typical at-will employment situation that finds its way into litigation, we have explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-9\">In the at-will employment context, we have held that a jury may not review any aspect of the employer\u2019s decision to terminate and that the employer may, absent a contravening public policy, terminate an employer [sic] for any reason, even a reason that is arbitrary, capricious, or fundamentally unfair. For our purposes, the significant point is that courts and juries may not review either the employer's (1) motivation or (2) factual bases for termination in the context of an at-will employment relationship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-10\"><em>Towson Univ. </em>v. <em>Conte, </em>384 Md. 68, 82-83, 862 A.2d 941, 949 (2004) (citations omitted).

If the Chairman\u2019s deposition were read to contain contradictory positions whether he relied on the performance issues as cause for termination as Wilson maintains, that would generate the need for resolution of a material factual dispute by the trier of fact, based on a credibility assessmenl to some extent, and foreclose the grant of sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>mary judgment.

Throughout Wilson's argument and the language of the Circuit Court\u2019s orders, the term \"for cause\u201d is used to describe why Wilson was terminated. We note, however, that nowhere in the termination notices she received or in the current State Personnel and Pensions Article is the term \"for cause\u201d used or defined. This is not a distinction without a difference. It appears that, in utilizing the term \"for cause,\u201d the Circuit Court experienced some confusion in applying the doctrine of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>at-will employment as it relates to State management service employees. By categorizing Wilson's termination as \"for cause,\u201d rather than as the result of \"employee misconduct,\u201d the Circuit Court blurred the line between management service employees and employees within the skilled and professional services, the latter having been determined by the Legislature to be deserving of greater statutory protections than at-will employees. For example, when counsel for Chairman Schisler suggested, during the 10 November 2004 Circuit Court hearing, that the Circuit Court's \"Order alters Ms. Wilson\u2019s status from an at will employee to an employee who can only be fired for cause,\u201d the Circuit Court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-8\">No. It didn't alter her status. I said even an at will employee who is fired for cause \u2014 you have to go \u2014 you have to have a hearing and go through the process of terminating her. She remains an at will employee \u2014 if you don't say anything, and you just smile and say you\u2019re gone, that's fine, but when you go to the legislature, and you go to other people and say she was inefficient, she did this, she did that, she spent time out in the halls and talking to other employees. You know, whatever you want \u2014 all the reasons that you give for terminating, that is a for cause termination. It is not an at will termination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">We note also that the Circuit Court erred in failing to recognize a distinction between \"employee performance\u201d and \"employee misconduct,\u201d discussed <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b208-13\">. The examples of \"employee misconduct\u201d and \u201cemployee performance,\u201d together with the grounds for automatic termination identified in \u00a7 11-105, appear to constitute the entire scope of COMAR 06.01.01.47 (1996), which contained the definition of \"for cause\u201d under the prior State Personnel Management System.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b210-5\">.

The Commission's proposed rale, at first blush, appears to be a practical interpretation and application of the framework of \u00a7 11-106 in the context of State government at-will employees. We note that, in each of the reported cases in which \u00a7 11-106 has been examined or discussed in substance, the facts demonstrated that the terminated or disciplined employee was informed explicitly, usually in a formal termination letter, of the \u201cemployee misconduct\u201d for which he or she was being terminated. <em>See, e.g., Danaher, </em>148 Md.App. at 150, 811 A.2d at 366 (stating in a letter that the employee was terminated as a result of misconduct). Furthermore, the vast majority of these cases involved situations in which not only were the factual predicates for the misconduct communicated, but also the particular statutes, regulations, or guidelines that were breached by the terminated or disciplined employee. <em>See, e.g., W. Corr. Inst. v. Geiger, </em>371 Md. 125, 131-35, 807 A.2d 32, 36-38 (2002) (stating in a notice of termination the department standards and regulation that the terminated employee had violated). Complications arise in cases such as this, where the \u201cappointing authority\u201d is terse in the relevant communications with the employee. In this case, Wilson was not informed verbally or in writing that her termination was the result of \"employee misconduct,\u201d nor of the factual predicate for any alleged misconduct that she now sees as the inspiration for her termination. Of course, the terse termination notices in the present case are entirely consistent with the Commission\u2019s official position that Wilson was terminated for no particular reason because, as an at-will employee, no reason need be given.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b217-5\">. We recognize as an exception to this general principle that, even where there may be some factual basis upon which an argument may be mounted that consideration of \u201cemployee misconduct\u201d figured in reaching the termination decision, the \"appointing authority\u201d may not have to fulfill the process in \u00a7 11-106 where it can demonstrate satisfactorily that it would have taken the disciplinary action in question regardless of the alleged \"employee misconduct.\u201d This is not unlike certain federal statutory schemes, such as the Family and Medical Leave Act (\u201cFMLA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601 <em>et seq. </em>(2000), that provide employees with certain rights or protections against discrimination. The FMLA provides eligible employees the right to receive unpaid leave, with a right of reinstatement, for up to 12 weeks in the event of a serious medical condition. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2612. Although the FMLA prohibits an employer from taking any retaliatory actions, such as termination, against an employee as the result of the exercise of his or her rights under the statute, it does not prevent an employer from taking a disciplinary action if that action is shown to be unrelated to the exercise of rights under the FMLA. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2614(a)(3) (stating that \u201c[n]othing in this section shall be construed to entitle any restored employee to ... any right, benefit, or position of employment other than any right, benefit, or position to which the employee would have been entitled had the employee not taken the leave\u201d); <em>Geromanos v. Columbia Univ., </em>322 F.Supp.2d 420, 429 (S.D.N.Y.2004) (citations omitted) (stating that the \"FMLA is not a shield to protect employees from legitimate disciplinary action by their employers if their performance is lacking in some manner unrelated to their FMLA leave\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b218-6\">. For example, a reviewing tribunal might find \u201cemployee misconduct\u201d was a significant factor in the decision to take a particular disciplinary action if the employee demonstrates a temporal proximity between the uncharged misconduct and the imposition of disciplinary sanctions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b218-7\">. It is appropriate to comment here on another aspect of the Circuit Court\u2019s disposition. The Circuit Court found that, because Wilson was terminated \"for cause ... as a result of alleged misconduct,\u201d Wilson could only be terminated if the Commission followed the procedures outlined in \u00a7 11-106. One of the more integral aspects of \u00a7 11-106, however, is the provision stating that the \"appointing authority\u201d may not \u201cimpose any disciplinary action ... later than 30 days after the appointing authority acquires knowledge of the misconduct....\u201d <em>See, e.g., Geiger, </em>371 Md. at 144-45, 807 A.2d at 44 (holding that, \"viewed in context, \u00a7 11-106 gives the appointing authority 30 days to conduct an investigation, meet with the employee the investigation identifies as culpable, consider any mitigating circumstances, determine the appropriate action and give notice to the employee of the disciplinary action taken\u201d). It is clear from the record that Chairman Schisler acquired knowledge of the time sheet incident (and in his opinion, completed an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>investigation of such conduct) in late 2003. Assuming, for the sake of argument, that a majority of the Commissioners also acquired knowledge of the time sheet incident sometime prior to the re-termination, the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment tied the hands of the Commission with respect to its ability to terminate Wilson for that reason. The Circuit Court ordered that, because the alleged earlier conduct by the Chairman tainted the re-termination decision, Wilson may be terminated only if the Commission follows the statutory procedures in \u00a7 11-106. Under the plain language of the statute, however, the Commission would be barred from imposing any discipline, because it appears that more than thirty days passed since acquisition by the Chairman (and the Commission) of knowledge of the time sheet incident. Furthermore, as the Commission points out, the Circuit Court failed to identify any possible way for the Commission to remove or remediate the alleged \"taint\u201d perceived by the Circuit Court to be associated with the original termination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b219-6\">. Wilson emphasized in her brief and at oral argument that</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">[Chairman] Schisler testifies as a matter of fact that but for the misconduct issues (not the least of which is his allegation of fraud), he would not have terminated Ms. Wilson. As a result, she was terminated for cause as a matter of fact no matter how many times Chairman Schisler repeated the empty mantra that his <em>legal conclusion </em>is that she was not fired for cause, \"in a legal sort of frame work\u201d or that ... he \"didn\u2019t do the analysis with respect to a for cause termination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">The context of Wilson\u2019s pertinent question, as indicated <em>supra, </em>was whether Chairman Schisler would have terminated Wilson if she had not had any of the \"personnel problems\u201d discussed at the deposition \"and was doing a fantastic job in [Chairman Schisler\u2019s] view across the board.\u201d The Chairman, however, never mentioned expressly the lime sheet incident during his narrative explanation of his thinking about Wilson\u2019s tenure as the PSC\u2019s Director of External Relations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b220-7\">. Wilson claims that her re-termination by a majority of the full membership of the Commission was unlawful because it was \"tainted\" by the original, unlawful 15 April termination. Wilson, however, presented no evidentiary basis tending to show that the other two relevant Commissioners (i.e., those who voted with Chairman Schisler) considered the time sheet incident in voting to terminate her. Instead, she asserts that the absence of any evidence as to the relevant Commissioners' rationale indicates that those Commissioners shared Chairman Schisler's improper motives. The absence of any facts admissible in evidence as to the thinking of the other two Commissioners, however, is indicative only of Wilson's failure to discover or allege any factual support for her allegations. Our holding reflects our conclusion that, although the initial termination was unlawful because it was not effectuated by the full Commission, the re-termination was not unlawful as the result of the failure to follow \u00a7 11-106. Because Chairman Schisler\u2019s motive was not shown to be unlawful (and in fact may be irrelevant), no fact-finder could infer, under any theory advanced in this record, an improper motive on the part of the other two Commissioners.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b220-8\">. Even if those portions of Chairman Schisler\u2019s deposition pointed to by Wilson were able to be read as sufficient to generate a triable issue that her termination was based on misconduct regarding the time sheet incident (a reading we do not adopt), it was error nonetheless for the Circuit Court to grant her motion for summary judgment. Under summary judgment analysis, the parts of the deposition to which the parties directed the trial court\u2019s attention would be viewed in a light most favorable to the non-moving, non-prevailing party. Thus, at the best for Wilson in this line of argument, the deposition generated factual conflicts as to the Chairman's basis for the initial termination. Such conflicts may not be resolved by summary judgment. In any event, the re-termination by the majority of the full membership of the Commission cannot be said to be infected with the same factual conflicts as are argued to appear from the Chairman's deposition alone.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b222-6\">. Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, entitled \"Due process,\u201d states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">That no man ought to be taken or imprisoned or disseized of his freehold, liberties or privileges, or outlawed, or exiled, or, in any manner, destroyed, or deprived of his life, liberty or property, but by the judgment of his peers, or by the Law of the land.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b222-8\">. In its 15 November 2004 order, the Circuit Court held that, not only was the review of Wilson\u2019s appeal by Chairman Schisler unconstitutional because he was not impartial, but that \"neither the Chairman nor any of his employees may lawfully serve as an agency adjudicator regarding his own decision to terminate [Wilson].\u201d Although \u00a7 11-113 provides explicitly that the appeal is to be filed with, investigated by, and disposed of by the \u201chead of the principal unit,\u201d the Circuit Court does not make clear who, if anybody, in its view would be authorized, under the terms of its order, to hear an appeal of a proposed termination of Wilson. The Commission argues that, even though the re-termination letter stated that any appeal should be sent to Chairman Schisler in his position as \"head of the principal unit,\u201d neither he nor it intended for him actually to consider and decide any such appeal. The Commission did not elaborate who, if not the Chairman, would consider and decide such an appeal had it been timely filed following the re-termination. See, <em>e.g., Spencer v. Bd. of Pharmacy, </em>380 Md. 515, 533-34, 846 A.2d 341, 351-52 (2004) (evaluating alternatives for administrative agency to cure bias issues in hearing a contested case). The Commission, however, stated that, because Wilson did not pursue an administrative appeal of her re-termination, it was not called upon to resolve who or what entity that might not run afoul of the trial court's order would consider an appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b223-9\">. Neither the PUC Article nor the State Personnel and Pensions Article authorize a petition for judicial review of the Commission's final decision to terminate an at-will employee of the PSC. Undoubtedly aware of this, Wilson, in filing her complaint and amended complaint in the Circuit Court, sought judicial scrutiny of the Commission\u2019s actions through alternative legal vehicles. In both pleadings she plead lor a declaratory judgment, a writ of mandamus, common law certiorari, and injunctive relief; however, skillful pleading may not avoid application of the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies, for the reasons explained above. <em>See Converge Servs. Group v. Curran, </em>383 Md. 462, 482, 860 A.2d 871, 882 (2004) (stating that \"a preemptively or prematurely filed petition for declaratory judgment, where there is provided an exclusive administrative remedy for the subject matter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>should not then be entertained [by the court], if at all, until the administrative remedy is exhausted\u201d); <em>Josephson v. City of Annapolis, </em>353 Md. 667, 681, 728 A.2d 690, 696 (1998) (stating that \"the general rule ... remains that when administrative remedies exist in zoning cases, they must be exhausted before other actions, including requests for declaratory judgments, mandamus and injunctive relief, may be brought\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b227-7\">. Wilson, alleging that she is a Democrat and a known supporter of former U.S. President William Jefferson Clinton, claimed that Chairman Schisler, alleged to be a Republican appointed Chair by current Maryland Governor Robert L. Ehrlich, Jr., also a Republican, fired her for partisan reasons. Further she alleged that her replacement, appointed by the Chairman, was a Republican vetted with the Governor\u2019s Appointments Office.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
