In 1996, Wendy Simpkins leased an automobile from Primus Automotive Financial Services, Inc., a subsidiary of Ford Motor Credit Company (\u201cFMC\u201d). The leasing contract established a monthly payment and a late charge of 7.5% of the full amount of the scheduled payment or $50.00, whichever is less, for each payment not received within 10 days after its due date. Ms. Simpkins paid at least one late charge in accordance with two leases with FMC, one in 1996 and another in 1999. Since the filing of the initial complaint, the parties and claims in the instant case have gone through several incarnations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>dismissal of the Second Amended Complaint is the origin of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">In the Second Amended Complaint, Ms. Simpkins alleges that any late payment fee charged by FMC in excess of 6% <em>per annum </em>to its Maryland lease finance customers is an unlawful penalty under the Maryland Constitution and the common law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Ms. Simpkins asked the trial court to force FMC to refund all excessive late fees collected, plus prejudgment interest, to her and the members of the putative class. Ms. Simpkins also requested a declaratory judgment holding that the Maryland Consumer Motor Vehicle Leasing Contracts Act, Md.Code (1975, 2000 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 14-2001 <em>el aeq. </em>of the Commercial Law Article did not permit motor vehicle lessors like FMC to charge and collect a late fee in excess of the 6% <em>per annum, </em>constitutional limit on interest set forth in Art. Ill, \u00a7 57 of the Maryland Constitution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Finally, Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Simpkins alleged that she was entitled to statutory penalties and damages provided under Md.Code (1975, 2000 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 14-2002(g)(1)(I).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court dismissed Ms. Simpkins\u2019s remaining claims concluding that the amount of the late fee assessed is the amount specified by the lease, and not the 6% interest rate established by Md. Const. Art. III, \u00a7 57. Ms. Simpkins filed a timely appeal, and the intermediate appellate court affirmed the decision of the trial court. <em>Simpkins v. Ford Motor Credit Co., </em>160 Md.App. 1, 862 A.2d 471 (2004). We granted Ms. Simpkins\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Simpkins v. Ford Motor, </em>386 Md. 180, 872 A.2d 46 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Ms. Simpkins presents two questions for our review, which we have recast for clarity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">1. Does Md.Code (1975, 2000 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 14-2002(g)(l) of the Commercial Law Article and the Maryland Consumer Motor Vehicle Licensing Contracts Act authorize motor vehicle lessors to charge consumer lessees a late fee in excess of 6% per annum?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-7\">2. Does Md.Code (1975, 2000 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 14-1315 of the Commercial Law Article authorize FMC to charge Ms. Simpkins a late fee in excess of 6% per annum on the lease she entered into in 1999?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">We decline to reach the issues presented by Ms. Simpkins and remand the instant case for proceedings to address the effect, if any, of Ms. Simpkins\u2019s involvement with the settlement of the class action suit in <em>Stickles v.

The contract established a monthly payment of $430.70 for three years. It also stated: \u201cYou will pay a late charge on each payment that is not received within 10 days after it is due. The charge is 7.5% of the full amount of the scheduled payment or $50.00, whichever is less.\u201d Simpkins paid at least one late charge under this lease. On September 6, 1999, Simpkins entered into another three-year lease agreement with Ford Motor. This agreement provided for a monthly pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>ment of $437.73 and contained the same late charge provision, to which Simpkins was subjected at least once.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AoN\"><em>Simpkins, </em>160 Md.App. at 4, 862 A.2d at 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">On August 23, 2001, Ms. Simpkins and Mr. Martin removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, Southern Division. A Motion for Remand filed by Ms. Simpkins and Mr. Martin was granted on November 28, 2001, and the Federal Court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order remanding the case back to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">After the case was remanded, Ms. Simpkins and Mr. Martin filed the aforementioned Second Amended Complaint on September 10, 2002. Respondents filed motions to dismiss. The first hearing (on FMC\u2019s motion to dismiss) was held on January 17, 2003.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On February 4, 2003, a Rule 2-502 <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> hearing was held for the Circuit Court\u2019s determination of certain issues of law in accordance with a stipulated statement of facts.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> During the hearing, the court noted that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>defendants had requested a stay \u201cbased on the nationally certified case of <em>[Stickles </em>].\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> At this time, the trial judge briefly addressed <em>Stickles:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-5\">[THE COURT]: <em>Stickles v. Ford Motor Credit Company. </em>This is a case filed in the California Superior Court in the County of San Francisco, Case No. 981289. And there was a settlement reached in that case. And it\u2019s potentially possible, and 1 emphasize just potentially, it\u2019s potentially possible that the sole plaintiff in this case, Ms. Simpkins, may be a party to that case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-6\">However, it is my understanding that that settlement is now under appeal. The appeal was filed by one of the members <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>of the class. And since there is no final resolution to that case, there is, at least as far as this case is concerned, no reason to hold up my decision in this case. Is that a fair statement? Do either one of you want to add to that? [COUNSEL FOR FMC]: The only thing I would add, Your Honor, is that, it\u2019s a correct statement. If and when that case becomes final and there is a non-appealable order in California, we would make application to the Court for res judicata effect, but we are not in that position at the present time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-4\">[THE COURT]: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-5\">[COUNSEL FOR MS. SIMPKINS]: With that statement, I\u2019ll fight that battle when I have to fight that battle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AO5\">This colloquy was the only discussion that took place at the hearing on the implications of <em>Stickles. </em>On June 6, 2003, the Circuit Court dismissed the remaining claims of Ms. Simpkins\u2019s Second Amended Complaint and in its Memorandum Opinion and Order held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\">(1) that the holding in <em>United v. Burch, </em>is not binding on the Motor Vehicle Leasing Contracts Act, CL \u00a7 14-2002 <em>et seq.;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-7\">(2) that the amount of the late fees Defendants charge pursuant to CL \u00a7 14-2002(g)(2) shall be the amount specified in the lease, subject to the \u201cConsumer Leasing Act\u201d codified at 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1667 through 1667(e), and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, as amended. CL \u00a7 14-2001(e), until May 31, 2000;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-8\">(3) that commencing June 1, 2000, lessors in Maryland became subject to CL \u00a7 14-1315(a)-(e) and commencing October 1, 2000, lessors became subject to CL \u00a7 14 \u2014 1315(f);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-9\">(4) that CL \u00a7 14-1315 applies to and regulates late fees charged by motor vehicle lessors to consumer lessees after June 1, 2000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-10\">This Court also concludes that it is unnecessary to address Questions V [Whether the applicable statute of limitations for plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional and common law claims is three years or a greater period?] and VII [Whether plaintiff Wendy Simpkins states a cause of action under any com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>mercial motor vehicle lease?] since its rulings deny Plaintiff any and all relief she requested.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Ms. Simpkins filed a timely Notice of Appeal, and the intermediate appellate court issued its reported opinion on December 3, 2004, affirming the trial court\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This court issued its mandate on January 3, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The <em>Stickles </em>Settlement Agreement<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\"><em>Stickles v. Ford Motor Credit Company </em>is a class action suit filed by Connie Stickles and others in the Superior Court of California. The class action complaint asserted contract claims and violations of California\u2019s version of the Uniform Commercial Code against FMC as a result of alleged illegal penalties and/or late fee charges imposed upon motor vehicle lessees. In May 2002, the parties reached a settlement and executed a Settlement Agreement and Release.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Final Judgment stated that all members of the class certified in <em>Stickles </em>\u201chave released and are hereby permanently enjoined and restrained <em>from </em>filing or prosecuting any Settled Claim <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>against any of the Released Parties.\u201d \u201cPlaintiff Class\u201d was defined by the Final Judgment as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-4\">[A]ll persons in the United States ... who, at any time from September 24, 1992 to March 1, 2002:(1) entered into a lease of a vehicle for personal and/or business use for which Ford Motor Credit Company (but not one of its dbas) either directly or by assignment from a dealer, provided retail lease financing; (2) made one or more required lease payments after the payment due date; (3) were thereafter charged late fees by Ford Motor Credit Company; (4) paid those late fees; and (5) were not subject to counter claims from Ford Motor Credit Company. On August 1, 1999, Primus Automotive Financial Services, Inc. was merged into Ford Credit. The Plaintiff Class also includes former Primus customers who paid late fees to Ford Credit after August 1,1999.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The Release provided in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">5. As of the Effective Date of this Agreement, each Plaintiff, and each member of the Plaintiff Classes who has not opted out in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph 10 below, acknowledges full satisfaction of, and fully, finally and forever releases, settles and discharges the Released Parties of and from all Settled Claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>b. For purposes of this paragraph, \u201cSettled Claims\u201d means and includes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-4\">I. Any and all clams, actions, causes of action, offsets or liabilities, whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, contingent or matured, related to fees or other charges for delinquency, default or late payment, including claims for excessive late fees or improper disclosure of such fees or other charges, which any named plaintiff or any Class member has had, or now has[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Paragraph 14b of the Settlement Agreement provided that each settlement check mailed to a member of the Settlement Class contain a statement on the reverse side of the check reserved for endorsement by the payee indicating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\">In full satisfaction and release of all claims respecting Ford Motor Credit vehicle lease late fees and/or disclosures thereof as provided in paragraph [4.7]<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> of the judgment in <em>[Stickles v. Ford Motor Credit Co.], </em>no. 981289 in the San Francisco Superior Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">The Ford Motor Credit settlement period began on September 24, 1992, and ended on March 1, 2002. The Primus settlement period began on August 1, 1999, and ended on March 1, 2002.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Ms. Simpkins received a notice providing her with an opportunity to opt out of the <em>Stickles </em>settlement class, but she did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">FMC filed a Motion to Dismiss the instant appeal pursuant to Md. Rules 8-603, and 8-602(a)(l), (10),<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> on the grounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>that Ms. Simpkins\u2019s claims, and the issues raised on appeal, are moot in light of Ms. Simpkins\u2019s voluntary participation as a class member in <em>Stickles. </em>FMC supports its argument by noting that Ms. Simpkins filed a claim form and subsequently received a settlement payment of $24.11 as a class member, thus settling and releasing her claims against FMC regarding excessive late fees. Ms. Simpkins counters that, through the act of depositing the settlement check she received, she did not release her claims against FMC, nor did that act constitute an accord and satisfaction.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The issues raised by FMC\u2019s Motion to Dismiss and Ms. Simpkins\u2019s response were not considered substantively by the lower court. It is asserted here that Ms. Simpkins signed a release purportedly as a member of the <em>Stickles </em>class and deposited the settlement check she received from FMC. The court did not make findings of fact as to Ms. Simpkins\u2019s participation in that case nor did it explore what effect, if any, the alleged deposit of Ms. Simpkins\u2019s settlement check had on the present case and what Ms. Simpkins\u2019s exact actions were in connection with the receipt and execution of the Settlement Agreement purportedly sent to her by FMC. Moreover, there is some dispute raised before us as to whether Ms. Simpkins met the requirements of <em>Stickles </em>class membership because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>FMC had filed a counterclaim against her.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The <em>Stickles </em>Final Judgment Order, which defines both who is a member of the \u201cPlaintiff Class\u201d and what is a \u201cSettled Claim,\u201d were not a part of the record before the Circuit Court. There was limited mention of Ms. Simpkins\u2019s actions in connection with the receipt of the Settlement Agreement and Release, but little or no consideration or analysis of these actions at either the circuit or intermediate appellate court levels. It was admitted by counsel that Ms. Simpkins deposited the settlement check she received from FMC and never returned the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Generally, we may only review issues raised in, or decided by, the trial court. Md. Rule 8-131(a). As the bulk of these issues were not considered substantively by the trial court, we are not in a position to rule definitively whether Ms. Simpkins\u2019s was a member of the <em>Stickles </em>class, and what effect, if any, the alleged execution of the Settlement Agreement will have in the instant case. The Circuit Court, in the first instance, is in the best position to develop this record and decide these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Md. Rule 8-604 dictates our determination of a matter on appeal,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and Section (d)(1) details when a remand to the lower court is proper:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-7\"><em>Generally. </em>If the Court concludes that the substantial merits of a case will not be determined by affirming, reversing or modifying the judgment, or that justice will be served by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>permitting further proceedings, the Court may remand the case to a lower court. In the order remanding a case, the appellate court shall state the purpose for the remand. The order of remand and the opinion upon which the order is based are conclusive as to the points decided. Upon remand, the lower court shall conduct any further proceedings necessary to determine the action in accordance with the opinion and order of the appellate court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Because the merits of the case cannot be determined on the record before us, the matter must be remanded, providing the parties with an opportunity to engage in additional proceedings at the trial court \u201cas the purposes of justice may require.\u201d <em>Campbell v. Lowe, </em>9 Md. 500, 511 (1856). We are permitted to remand a case if \u201c \u2018the purposes of justice will be advanced by permitting further proceedings in the cause, either through amendment of any of the pleadings or the introduction of further evidence, making additional parties, or otherwise[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>State Rds.

Where there is solid evidence in support of disputed factual allegations, it is proper to place the responsibility for resolving such a conflict \u201cwith the trial court, a tribunal which is in a position vastly superior to that of an appellate court to perform this very important task.\u201d <em>Kowell Ford, Inc. v. Doolan, </em>283 Md. 579, 584, 391 A.2d 840, 843 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The <em>Stickles </em>case and its potential <em>res </em>judicata<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> effect on the instant case was brought to the hearing court\u2019s atten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>tion in both FMC\u2019s motion to dismiss and in open court on February 4, 2002. Prior to the intermediate appellate court\u2019s decision in the instant case, several key matters were decided in connection with Ms. Simpkins\u2019s case: most notably, FMC dismissed its counterclaim against Ms. Simpkins on November 16, 2002, and the appeal of the <em>Stickles </em>case was dismissed on August 29, 2003. There is some validity to the argument that the facts required to discuss these issues were not in place at the time of the hearing in February 2003; however, a final judgment in <em>Stickles </em>was issued on November 1, 2002, and all appeals of that decision were dismissed on August 29, 2003. The hearing court could have reasonably continued this matter as early as February 2003 at the Rule 2-502 hearing or in June 2003, at the time of its dismissal, to await resolution of the <em>Stickles </em>proceedings. FMC actually requested a stay during the February 2003 hearing, but that request was not ruled upon by the trial court. In any event, the issue of <em>res judicata </em>is now ripe. It would be improper for this court to consider this issue on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Moreover, the <em>Stickles </em>appeal was dismissed prior to the decision of the intermediate appellate court, and the issue of <em>res judicata, </em>should have been resolved prior to the resolution of the other statutory issues that were raised. It is a longstanding tenet of Maryland law \u201cto decide questions of law in advance of a determination of the main issue, if it is convenient so to do, by special case stated or otherwise.\u201d <em>Commissioners of Cambridge v.

Rule 2-502.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">We shall reverse the decision of the intermediate appellate court and remand this matter in order to permit the Circuit Court to reconsider the implication of the <em>Stickles </em>settlement. Specifically, consideration should be given to whether Ms. Simpkins executed a valid release, precluding any further litigation between herself and FMC, and what, if any, <em>res judicata </em>effect the <em>Stickles </em>settlement had on Ms. Simpkins\u2019s claims in the instant case.

Prior to argument, Ms. Simpkins and Mr. Martin voluntarily withdrew Counts V and VI. After hearing argument, the Circuit Court merged Counts I (unjust enrichment) and II (restitution) and denied the respondents' Motions to Dismiss Counts III (Declaratory Judgment), IV (Violation of the Maryland Motor Vehicle Licensing Act, Md.Code (1975, 2000 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 14-2002(g)(l)), and VII (Violation of the Maryland Consumer Protection Act, Md.Code (1975, 2000 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 13-301 <em>etseq. </em>of the Commercial Law Article).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b566-8\">. Md.

In resolving the question, the court may accept facts stipulated by the parties, may find facts after receiving evidence, and may draw inferences from these facts. The proceedings and decisions of the court shall be on the record, and the decisions shall be reviewable upon appeal after entry of an appeal-able order or judgment.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b566-10\">. At this hearing, the parties made certain stipulations. Ms. Simpkins withdrew Count VII of the Second Amended Complaint, alleging violations of the Maryland Consumer Protection Act. The parties also agreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>that \"what has been designated as the la1e fees in the instant case, and also as provided in [Md.Code (2000 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 14-2002 of the Commercial Law Article! is the category of late fees which falls under Class 4, as designated in ... <em>[United Cable v.

In its February 4, 2002 motion to dismiss, and in support of its request for a stay, FMC brought the potential effects of <em>Simpkins </em>on the instant case to the hearing court's attention:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-9\">Here, several factors weigh heavily in favor of granting a stay.... [A] nationwide class action proceeding in California, <em>Stickles v. Ford Motor Credit Co., </em>Case No. 981289, in the Superior Court of California in and for the County of San Francisco, addresses the same issues presented in this case \u2014 the validity of Ford Credit motor vehicle lease payment late fees. Attached as Exhibits A and B, respectively, are the amended complaint and the order granting nationwide class certification in the California action. Discovery in <em>Stickles </em>has been completed and the case is ready for trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-10\">Maryland consumers have been included in the <em>Stickles </em>class, to the extent that Ford Credit does not have a counterclaim against them. Therefore, there will be a significant overlap between the purported class members in this case and in <em>Stickles. </em>These class members should not be permitted to have two bites at the apple----It will be a hardship for Ford Credit to have to defend both the California class action and this class action, both addressing the same issues, at the same time. It will be a hardship for Ford Credit should the different actions have different results because it will be impossible for them to know how to structure their late fees so as to be in compliance with any different rulings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-13\">FMC also raised the issue in its list of affirmative defenses, stating that Ms. Simpkins's claims, in whole or in part, were barred as a result of her membership in the national class with \"some or all of [her] claims .. . being adjudicated\u201d in <em>Stickles.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b569-8\">.

Notwithstanding, in the exercise of our discretion, we have considered respondents' motion to dismiss and, under Rules 8-604(a)(5) and 8-604(d), remand for the trial court to reconsider the issue of <em>res judicata.

Ms. Simpkins also argues that FMC failed to raise and thus preserve in the Circuit Court its affirmative defenses of <em>res judicata </em>and release. We find this to be an incorrect characterization, as the record reflects that the matter was discussed by the parties and the hearing judge at the February 2003 hearing. <em>See </em>pages 432-35, 886 A.2d at 130-31, <em>supra. </em>We disagree with Ms. Simpkins\u2019s contention that the issues of <em>res judicata </em>and release are not threshold issues of law to be considered by the Circuit Court, especially where additional fact finding may be necessary to resolve these issues. To the contrary, the resolution of these issues determines whether this, or the intermediate appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>court, will ever reach the statutory and constitutional issues presented by Ms. Simpkins.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b573-9\">.

Maryland law requires the following elements for the application of res judicata: \"1) that the parties in the present litigation are the same or in privity, with the parties to the earlier dispute; 2) that the claim presented in the current action is identical to the one determined in the prior adjudication; and 3) that there was a final judgment on the merits.\u201d <em>Colandrea v. Wilde Lake Cmty. Ass'n, Inc., </em>361 Md. 371, 392, 761 A.2d 899, 910 (2000) (citing <em>Blades v. Woods, </em>338 Md. 475, 478-79, 659 A.2d 872, 873 (1995)). <em>See also Mackall v. Zayre Corp., </em>293 Md. 221, 227-28, 443 A.2d 98, 101-102 (1982). Accordingly, a judgment between the same parties and their privies acts as a final prohibition to any other proceeding upon the same cause of action and is final, \"not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>only as to all matters decided in the original suit, <em>but also as to matters that could have been litigated in the original suit.\u201d Colandrea, </em>361 Md. at 392, 761 A.2d at 910 (citation omitted). <em>Res judicata </em>is applied notwithstanding the type of court which rendered the earlier final judgment, <em>De Maio v.
