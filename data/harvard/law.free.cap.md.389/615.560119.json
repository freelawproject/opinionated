Whether the State of Maryland violates Articles 8 and/or 14 of the Declaration of Rights or the Maryland Consumer Protection Act (CPA), or is subject to the common law actions of unjust enrichment or for money had and received, when the State receives a commission on charges collected from collect phone calls made by prison inmates where the authorizing statute fails to establish the specific rate of commission to be remitted to the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-14\">2. Whether the notice provisions of the Maryland Tort Claims Act (MTCA) are satisfied when a claimant: (a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>brings an action on behalf of a class of plaintiffs; (b) fails to state the specific amount of damages sought, yet the Office of the State Treasurer (Treasurer) could possibly ascertain the amount of damages by investigation; and, (c) files a claim in court seeking injunctive relief one month after giving notice of the claim to the Treasurer when the claim submitted to the Treasurer sought damages only.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-4\">3. Whether the Circuit Court erred in denying post-judgment motions seeking permission to advance additional allegations beyond those asserted in Appellants\u2019 last amended class action complaints.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">Prison inmates who satisfy the security requirements of their respective correctional facilities are permitted to make non-emergency telephone calls, but only on a collect call basis.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR) \u00a7 12.02.14.01(C)(2). The State Department of Budget and Management (DBM), with the approval of the Board of Public Works, contracted with two private companies to install, maintain, and service telephones and monitoring equipment in the State\u2019s correctional facilities. The customer rates for these calls, which are paid by the persons accepting the collect calls placed by the inmate, are set under the contracts. At the operative times in the present litigation, the contract rates were as follows: a flat charge of $0.85 for local calls; $3.45 for the first minute, plus $0.45 for each additional minute, for intra-state long distance calls; and $4.84 for the first minute, plus $0.89 for each additional minute, for inter-state long distance calls. The telephone companies collected the charges from the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>receiving and accepting the calls, and then remitted the commissions to the State (a fixed percentage of the total telephone fees charged per call). The telephone commission rates were 20% of local call charges and 42% of long distance call charges.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Between Fiscal Year (FY) 1999 and FY 2002, the State received between $5.6 million and $7.3 million each year from the telephone commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 10-502 and 10-503(a)(2) of the Correctional Services Article of the Maryland Code,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the State\u2019s commissions are paid into the State Treasury to be used for an Inmate Welfare Fund (Fund), with each correctional facility having its own dedicated fund to provide goods and services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>that benefit the general inmate population of that facility.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The State Treasurer must hold separately, and the Comptroller account for, each fund. \u00a7 10 \u2014 503(a)(3). Furthermore, each facility\u2019s fund is subject to an audit by the Office of Legislative Audits, pursuant to \u00a7 10-503(a)(4). Under \u00a7 10-504, the Comptroller pays out money from each fund as authorized in the approved State Budget for each fiscal year.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">\n<em>The Present Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Sandra Benson and Mary Ann Dean, Appellants, received and accepted collect calls from inmate relatives during the periods 2 February 2001 through 9 February 2001 and 21 November 1998 through 6 April 2002, respectively, and paid the resulting bills calculated according to the rate structure outlined <em>supra, </em>including the State\u2019s commission. On 25 October 2001, Benson, purporting to act on behalf of herself and others similarly situated, sent a letter by certified mail to the Treasurer, pursuant to the MTCA, complaining about the \u201canti-competitive\u201d collect telephone call contract and fee \u201cmandated\u201d as a commission. She sought compensatory damages, punitive damages, and attorneys\u2019 fees.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">When the relief Benson sought was not forthcoming immediately, she filed a Class Action Complaint on 26 November 2001 in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Several amended complaints followed, consummated by her Fifth Amended Class Action Complaint on 19 May 2003. She alleged that the commission remitted to the State was illegal under nine causes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>of action, as both direct causes of action and actions filed under the MTCA. The various theories of recovery were based on asserted violations of: the Maryland Declaration of Rights, Article 8 (separation of powers); Maryland Declaration of Rights, Article 14 (Legislature\u2019s consent required to rate or levy an aid, charge, fee, tax or burthen); Maryland Antitrust Act; Maryland Consumer Protection Act; Maryland Constitution, Article III, \u00a7 32 (appropriations); Maryland Declaration of Rights, Article 24 (unlawful taking); unjust enrichment; common law action for money had and received; and, civil conspiracy. For each count, Benson sought prospective injunctive relief to enjoin the State from charging, billing, invoicing, and collecting the commission; an award for attorneys\u2019 fees, litigation costs, and interest; and compensatory and punitive damages for herself and each class member. Dean filed her virtually identical Class Action Complaint on 12 June 2003 in the Circuit Court of Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">On 24 July 2003, the State filed in each case an omnibus motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, and also asserted that all claims were barred by the MTCA. The State appended exhibits to its motion and, months later, filed an affidavit in further support of its contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">The Circuit Court dismissed all of Benson\u2019s and Dean\u2019s claims in a single order entered on 25 June 2004, nearly a year after the State filed its motion to dismiss. As to Benson\u2019s tort-based claims, the court dismissed them for non-compliance with the requirements of the MTCA. The court found that the MTCA did not authorize class action suits. The court also rejected Appellants\u2019 prayers for punitive damages as not permitted by the MTCA. In addition, the trial judge concluded that Benson brought her complaint prematurely because she filed it only one month after submitting her claim letter to the Treasurer and without awaiting a reply. The court opined that, because she sought monetary relief, Benson should have waited the sooner of either receiving the Treasurer\u2019s denial of relief or six months from the time of filing her claim with the Treasurer. Thus, having resolved that Benson failed to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>ceive a final denial from the Treasurer before she filed her complaint, maintenance of her tort claims was precluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Benson\u2019s non-tort claims under the Consumer Protection Act and the antitrust statute also were dismissed. The court dismissed the Consumer Protection Act claim because it concluded that the State was protected by sovereign immunity, the remittance of the telephone commission was not an unfair trade practice, and Appellants suffered no actual loss because they would have paid the same amounts to the private telephone companies even had no commission been remitted to the State. The court dismissed the antitrust claim on sovereign immunity grounds because the State was acting within its legal authority to require the remittance of the telephone commission from the private telephone companies, and because the court was not the appropriate body to decide whether the approved telephone call rates and commission were excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">The court dismissed all of Dean\u2019s claims as well. The court specifically found that Dean failed to give the State timely notice of her claimed injuries, which began in 1999, because her letter to the Treasurer was not sent until 2003. Thus, Dean\u2019s tort claims were precluded for failure to comply with the MTCA\u2019s notice provisions. The court also dismissed all of Dean\u2019s claims because she failed to allege in her complaint any facts supporting her claimed injury, concluding that the appended exhibits of her phone bills were insufficient to establish loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">On 2 July 2004, Benson and Dean filed a joint Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment seeking to add several allegations to their complaints, including that each of the plaintiffs \u201csuffered actual injury related to the matters complained of.\u201d Soon thereafter, Benson and Dean filed notices of appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. They then filed a second post-judgment motion with the Circuit Court on 13 September 2004 seeking to amend their complaints to add allegations that the violations were continuing. They argued that the court failed to recognize that Benson\u2019s initial complaint sought only injunctive relief and therefore she complied with MTCA require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>ments. The Circuit Court denied the post-judgment motions. We issued a writ of certiorari before the Court of Special Appeals could decide the appeals, <em>Benson v. State, </em>386 Md. 180, 872 A.2d 46 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">We treat the motion granted in this case as a true motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted because the trial court expressly limited its consideration to the factual allegations of the complaints and ignored the additional factual considerations tendered in the exhibits and affidavit submitted by the State in support of its motion to dismiss. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-322(c) (providing that if, in a motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action upon which relief may be granted, \u201cmatters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 2-501, and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 2-501\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">When reviewing the grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, we \u201cassume the truth of all well-pleaded, relevant, and material facts in the complaint and any reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Muthukumarana v. Montgomery County, </em>370 Md. 447, 474, 805 A.2d 372, 388 (2002) (quoting <em>Allied Invest. Corp. v. Jasen, </em>354 Md. 547, 555, 731 A.2d 957, 961 (1999)). \u201cDismissal is proper only if the alleged facts and permissible inferences, so viewed, would, if proven, nonetheless fail to afford relief to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Jasen, </em>354 Md. at 555, 731 A.2d at 961. Therefore, on appeal, this court determines whether the trial court was legally correct in granting the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">We also must determine whether the Circuit Court abused its discretion in denying Benson\u2019s and Dean\u2019s motions to alter or amend the judgment. <em>Renbaum v. Custom Holding, Inc., </em>386 Md. 28, 42-43, 871 A.2d 554, 563 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">\n<em>Articles U and 8 of the Declaration of Rights</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">Appellants claim that the collection and remittance of the telephone commission to the State violates Article 14 (no aid, tax, charge, fee or burthen shall be rated or levied without consent of the Legislature) and Article 8 (separation of powers) of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. We begin by considering whether the MTCA applies to alleged violations of Article 14 and whether a private right of action is available for an alleged violation of Article 14. If a private right of action under Article 14 may be brought, we must determine whether a plaintiff may be awarded damages for its violation, if proven. Thereafter, we shall construe Articles 14 and 8 to determine whether the imposition of the telephone commission is illegal as pleaded. These questions have not been directly raised or decided previously in a reported Maryland case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">\n<em>Applicability of the Maryland, Tort Claims Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">The Circuit Court concluded that the MTCA\u2019s procedural requirements must be satisfied in order to bring suit on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>a constitutional tort claim, and found that Benson\u2019s and Dean\u2019s Article 14 claims were precluded for failure to comply with the MTCA. We hold that the MTCA does not apply to alleged violations of Article 14 of the Declaration of Rights; thus, the trial court was mistaken on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">In <em>Lee v. Cline, </em>384 Md. 245, 256, 863 A.2d 297, 304 (2004), this Court held that the MTCA applied to a constitutional tort claim flowing from an asserted search and seizure violation, and extended to state personnel qualified immunity for such torts if committed within the scope of employment and without malice. We do not extend, however, our reasoning in <em>Lee v. Cline </em>so far as to require that all constitutional tort claims must comply with the requirements imposed by the MTCA. Rather, we hold that a claim for violation of Article 14 is not subject to the requirements of the MTCA because a claim under Article 14 is not compensable in monetary damages, <em>see infra </em>Section III(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">\n<em>Private Right of Action Under Article H</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">A private right of action for violation of Article 14 may lie because it is a self-executing constitutional provision.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Whether a constitutional provision is \u201cself-executing,\u201d so as to make it enforceable judicially, is an issue addressed by the U.S. Supreme Court in <em>Davis v. Burke, </em>179 U.S. 399, 21 S.Ct. 210, 45 L.Ed. 249 (1900). The Supreme Court set forth the elements and characteristics of a self-executing constitutional provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-9\">It supplies a sufficient rule by means of which the right given may be enjoyed and protected, or the duty imposed may be enforced; and it is not self-executing when it merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>indicates principles, without laying down rules by means of which those principles may be given the force of law ... it is self-executing only so far as it is susceptible of execution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"At3\"><em>Davis, </em>179 U.S. at 403, 21 S.Ct. at 212, 45 L.Ed. at 251 (quoting Thomas McIntyre Cooley, <em>A Treatise on the Constitutional Limitations which Rest upon ths Legislative Power of the States of the American Union </em>99 (6th ed. 1890)). When a provision is so complete, it may be enforced by the courts without the need of further legislative authority or direction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">We applied this analysis to a claim brought under Article 15 of the Declaration of Rights. In <em>Leser v. Lowenstein, </em>129 Md. 244, 250, 98 A. 712, 714 (1916), this Court found some of the provisions of Article 15 to be \u201cprohibitory and self-executing, and require no act of the Legislature to make them effective.\u201d One such clause prohibited the levy of a poll tax. Another was the provision declaring that paupers ought not be assessed for the support of government. The Court also found two provisions not to be self-executing because legislation was required to give effect to the provisions: the provision declaring the method to be used to set future levies for taxes and the provision charging the General Assembly to set uniform rules providing for separate assessment of land and classifications \u201cas it deems proper.\u201d <em>Leser, </em>129 Md. at 250, 98 A. at 714 (quoting Article 15 of the Declaration of Rights). This Court also has determined other constitutional and statutory provisions to be self-executing. <em>See e.g., Casey Development Corp. v. Montgomery County, </em>212 Md. 138, 150, 129 A.2d 63, 70 (1957) (finding a tax law self-executing); <em>Hammond v. Lancaster, </em>194 Md. 462, 476, 71 A.2d 474, 480 (1950) (finding Article XVI of the Maryland Constitution (referendum power reserved to the people of Maryland) self-executing); <em>Harris v. State, </em>194 Md. 288, 295, 71 A.2d 36, 40 (1950) (finding Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights self-executing) <em>overruled on other grounds, Stewart v. State, </em>282 Md. 557, 386 A.2d 1206 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">We conclude that Article 14 is self-executing. Article 14 of the Declaration of Rights provides that \u201cno aid, charge, tax, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>burthen or fees ought to be rated or levied, under any pretense, without the consent of the legislature.\u201d If action is taken in contravention of Article 14, then the action is voidable by a court. No further legislative action is required to effectuate Article 14. Furthermore, the provision supplies a sufficient rule by means of which the right to be free from aids, charges, taxes, burdens, and fees levied without the Legislature\u2019s consent may be enjoyed and protected. Courts may enforce Article 14 by declaring such charges invalid. Its provisions are not merely a statement of principles. It is a directive capable of execution. Also, our conclusion that its terms are self-executing is in harmony with the scheme of the Declaration of Rights, particularly when read with Article 8 (separation of powers) and Article 15 (describing some of the duties of the Legislature regarding the levy of taxes). Therefore, Benson and Dean, all other things being equal, could assert private claims under Article 14 of the Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">\n<em>Private Remedies for Violations of Article H</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">Having concluded that a private right action may lie based on an Article 14 violation, we must decide whether monetary damages may be awarded for its violation, if proven. The question becomes whether a common law action exists already to remedy the violation, or, if an action does not now exist, whether one should be judicially recognized. The Court has employed this common law tort analysis for constitutional claims previously, finding a right to sue for damages, but has done so only when it concluded that the constitutional provision at issue conveyed an individual right \u2014 for example, the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures or the right to be free from the taking of private property without just compensation. Thus, in <em>Widgeon v. Eastern Shore Hospital Center, </em>300 Md. 520, 479 A.2d 921 (1984), we held that a plaintiff could maintain an action for damages when alleging a violation of the Articles of the Declaration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>Rights addressing searches and seizures and the deprivation of liberty, life, and property because Maryland courts historically have recognized, as an established doctrine, that \u201cwhere a statute establishes an individual right, imposes a corresponding duty on the government, and fails to provide an express statutory remedy, a traditional common law action will ordinarily lie.\u201d <em>Widgeon, </em>300 Md. at 536, 479 A.2d at 929 (Citations omitted). In <em>Widgeon, </em>we concluded that Articles 24 and 26 were intended to preserve individual liberty <em>and </em>property interests, respectively. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">In contrast to Articles 24 and 26, Article 14 does not secure or proclaim an individual right; rather, its terms address principles akin to those of federalism, separation of powers, and the government\u2019s authority to tax. Applying common law tort analysis to the claimed Article 14 violation to determine whether an action for damages may lie for its violation, we conclude that it does not. We also decline to create judicially a monetary damages remedy for its alleged violation. This kind of asserted constitutional violation is best corrected by declaratory or injunctive relief, not damages, because the roots of the Article 14 are not born of the common law action of trespass, like Articles 24 and 26. Although an Article 14 violation is a \u201cconstitutional tort\u201d in the sense that it is a violation of a constitutional duty imposed upon government to refrain from levying aids, charges, taxes, burdens, or fees without the consent of the Legislature, it is not one of those individual rights for which a monetary damages remedy should be available.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Had Appellants not waived for appellate consideration their Article 24 due process claim asserted in the trial court, perhaps damages might be available were we to conclude that they pleaded sufficiently a claim that the telephone commission was illegal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Be that as it may, we hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>that a private right of action may lie for an alleged violation of Article 14; but only declaratory and injunctive relief are available to remedy such a violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">\n<em>Did Appellants Sufficiently Plead Violations of Article H and Article 8?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">We now address whether the commission collected and paid to the State violates Articles 14 and/or 8. The answer naturally requires us to construe the language of the Articles.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">l.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">\n<em>Relevant Principles of Constitutional Interpretation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b766-10\">The analytical framework applied to interpret the Constitution and Declaration of Rights is quite decided and familiar. We declared in <em>Johns Hopkins University v. Williams, </em>that, \u201cwhile the principles of the Constitution are unchangeable, in interpreting the language by which they are expressed it will be given a meaning which will permit the application of those principles to changes in the economic, social, and political life of the people, which the framers did not and could not foresee.\u201d 199 Md. 382, 386, 86 A.2d 892, 894 (1952) (Internal quotations omitted) (Citations omitted). Thus, while we may not depart from the Constitution\u2019s plain language, we are not bound strictly to accept only the meaning of the language at the time of adoption. <em>Cohen v. Governor of Maryland, </em>255 Md. 5, 16-17, 255 A.2d 320, 325 (1969); <em>Boyer v. Thurston, </em>247 Md. 279, 291-92, 231 A.2d 50, 57 (1967); <em>Buchholtz v. Hill, </em>178 Md. 280, 286, 13 A.2d 348, 351 (1940) (\u201cSo it has been said that a constitution is to be interpreted by the spirit which vivifies, and not be the letter which killeth.\u201d). In addition to the plain language of Article 14, we, for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>purpose of determining the true meaning of the language used, may consider</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-4\">the mischief at which the provision was aimed, the remedy, the temper and spirit of the people at the time it was framed, the common usage well known to the people, [ ] the history of the growth or evolution of the particular provision under consideration . .. and to [the] long continued contemporaneous construction by officials charged with the administration of the government, and especially by the Legislature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-5\"><em>Johns Hopkins University, </em>199 Md. at 386, 86 A.2d at 894 (Internal quotation omitted). Thus, we construe the Constitution\u2019s provisions to accomplish in our modern society the purposes for which they were adopted by the drafters. <em>Norris v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>172 Md. 667, 192 A. 531 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">ii.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">\n<em>Scope of Article 14</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">We shall hold that the telephone commission in the present case is within the scope of Article 14 because it is a \u201ccharge\u201d imposed by the State government. First, we analyze the plain language of the Article. In this process, we shall consult credible sources from both the time of adoption of Article 14 and our modern era, including Proceedings of the Conventions of the Province of Maryland Held at the City of Annapolis, sin <em>1774, 1775, &amp; 1776 </em>(1836); various laws enacted in 1776; and recent editions of Black\u2019s Law Dictionary and Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary. <em>See Harvey v.

The definition of \u201ccharge\u201d has not changed since 1776 when the framers of the Maryland Declaration of Rights employed the word in adopted resolutions. <em>See </em>Proceedings of the Conventions at 244 (stating that the \u201ccharge and expense\u201d of erecting and building two courthouses and prisons in two counties will be defrayed by the those counties and assessed with the public and county levy); Proceedings of the Conventions at 293 (resolving that the rivers Potowmack and Pocomoke \u201cought to be considered as a common high-way, free for the people of both [Maryland and Virginia], without being subject to any duty, burthens or charge\u201d). As the Resolution adopted at the Proceedings of the Conventions in 1776 demonstrates, a \u201cburthen\u201d meant the burden of a payment owed, such as a charge for use of a river. <em>See </em>Proceedings of the Conventions at 293. A \u201cburthen\u201d is now more commonly called a \u201cburden\u201d and is used as a general term referring to a duty, responsibility, encumbrance, or obligation imposed on a person or property. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary at 208, Webster\u2019s Dictionary at 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">A \u201ctax\u201d is a charge, usually of money, imposed ordinarily by a governmental authority on persons or property for public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>purposes.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Black\u2019s Law Dictionary at 1496; Webster\u2019s Dictionary at 1280. A review of the Declaration of Rights and the Constitution reveals that the definition of tax has not changed since 1776. A \u201cfee\u201d is a charge for labor, services, or a privilege. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary at 647; Webster\u2019s Dictionary at 459. This definition also has not changed since 1776. <em>See </em>Chapter xxv, \u00a7 9, of Acts of 1779 (setting out a list of the fees to be charged for carrying out various judiciary duties and the rates of tobacco to be accepted as payment); Chapter xv, \u00a7 4 of the Acts of 1769 (providing that \u201cany fee or fees\u201d claimed to be due to the sheriff under color of office shall be explained to the person paying the fee and a receipt given upon payment).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">These five kinds of payment, especially \u201ccharge\u201d and \u201cfee,\u201d encompass a wide variety of payments to the government. One shared sense of the words, however, is that they are all used in Article 14 to mean payments imposed by a sovereign on its citizens. That the drafters chose to include all five terms in the provision tends to show that the drafters intended that the scope of Article 14 encompass virtually all payments imposed by the government. Additionally, the clause \u201cunder any pretense\u201d modifies the clause: \u201cThat no aid, charge, tax, burthen or fee ought to be rated or levied.\u201d We construe this language to mean that calling a true aid, charge, fee, tax, or burden by a different name (such as \u201ccommission\u201d) will not shield the exacted payment from the scope of Article 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">The telephone commission provided for in \u00a7 10-503 fits within these broad terms \u2014 it is certainly a cost paid to the State by the telephone company and thus fits under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>general term \u201ccharge.\u201d The commission is also a \u201cfee\u201d from the point of view of the person accepting the inmate\u2019s collect, non-emergency telephone call because the recipient indirectly pays the commission. The State in the present case, citing <em>Goldsborough v. Postal Telegraph Cable Company, </em>123 Md. 73, 91 A. 147 (1914), argues that the telephone commission is not implicated by the terms of Article 14 because it is paid as part of a \u201cvoluntary\u201d commercial transaction and the commission is taken from charges collected by a third-party for telephone service provided at a State facility. This Court\u2019s decision in <em>Goldsborough, </em>however, does not support the State\u2019s argument because the Court did not hold that a commercial transaction involving the State as a party is exempt from Article 14. In <em>Goldsborough, </em>the State sought payments due on a lease originally executed between the former private owner of a bridge (the State purchased all property and rights to the parcels containing the bridge) and a telegraph company running telephone lines across the adjacent land and bridge. The telegraph company argued that it could not be required to make payments to the State as the successor lessor under the lease because the Legislature had not specifically consented to the payments. The Court found that the lease had been purchased by the State with the authorization of the Legislature by way of a statute directing the acquisition of the bridge. The fact that the lease payments were created by a pre-existing contract between two private parties distinguishes <em>Goldsborough </em>from the present case. The telephone commission in the present case was born of \u00a7 10-503 and is a charge imposed by the State government. Thus, the State\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">iii.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">\n<em>Construction and Application of Article 1J/.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">.As noted <em>supra, </em>Article 14 provides that \u201cno aid, charge, tax, burthen or fees ought to be rated or levied, under any pretense, without the consent of the Legislature.\u201d We now consider the plain meaning of the terms: rated, levied, and consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>\u201cRated,\u201d when used as a verb with regard to money, means to allot or to value. Webster\u2019s Dictionary at 1032. In laws passed in the 1770s, use of the verb \u201crate\u201d was specifically tied to money \u2014 either fines, taxes, or fees paid to government officials. <em>See </em>Chapter xx of the Acts of 1773 (providing that the sheriff shall be fined by the court\u2019s justices for certain conduct, a sum not exceeding three thousand pounds of tobacco, \u201crating tobacco at ten shillings per hundred, to be applied towards defraying the charge of the said county\u201d); Chapter xvii of the Acts of 1782 (providing that the appointed collector of certain specified taxes must record in a book \u201cthe persons rated and things assessed, to call upon the county commissioners of the tax to know the yearly valuation of property within said town, and to regulate the tax upon every hundred pounds worth of property\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">\u201cLevied,\u201d used as a verb, means to impose or to collect payment of money or property by legal authority or to require by authority. Webster\u2019s Dictionary at 715. This definition appears to have remained constant since the time Article 14 was adopted in 1776. <em>See </em>Proceedings of the Conventions at 160 (\u201cResolved, That the committee forbear to levy the said fines until the end of the next session of convention, and to stay all further proceedings therein.\u201d); Proceedings of the Conventions at 157 (\u201cAnd, upon non-payment thereof may, by warrant under their hands, empower any person they shall judge proper to levy the same, by distress and sale of the goods of the offender.\u201d); Proceedings of the Conventions at 256 (\u201c[A]n act of assembly passed, directing the justices of Talbot county to levy on the inhabitants of that county forty-five pounds of tobacco per tax.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">The most significant term in Article 14 is \u201cconsent\u201d because it is an imperative directed to the Legislature. To \u201cconsent\u201d is to voluntarily give assent, to agree, or to approve. Webster\u2019s Dictionary at 265. Its modern meaning is consistent with its 1776 meaning. <em>See </em>Chapter vii, \u00a7 9 of the Acts of 1777 (providing that a male under the age of 21 or a female under the age of 16, not before married, shall not be married \u201cwithout the consent of the parent or guardian of every such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>person\u201d or else the minister be forced to pay 500 pounds current money); Proceedings of the Conventions at 299 (providing, in a draft of the Declaration of Rights under consideration and later adopted with amendments, that \u201cno soldier ought to be quartered in any house in time of peace without the consent of the owner, and in time of war in such manner only as the legislature shall direct\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">The plain meaning of the pertinent language therefore is that payments imposed by the State should not be allotted, valued, imposed, or collected without the authorization or approval of the Legislature. The structure of the sentence is important. The Framers did <em>not </em>express their will in the imperative: The Legislature shall rate and levy taxes and charges. Rather, the Legislature must consent to the rate or levy of payments to the State. To read into the clause a requirement that the Legislature also must set the amount of all such payments in each instance is to depart from the Article\u2019s plain language and read into it an intent that is not evident.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Our review of the available written records from the creation of Article 14 reveals no intention to impose a nondelegable duty upon the Legislature to set the amount of every government charge. Article 14 was part of the original Declaration of Rights, although it then was designated Article 10. Appellants cite notable historical texts and cases in their Brief for the proposition that the Framers intended that the Legislature be required to set the amount of all aids, charges, taxes, burdens, and fees as a retaliation against the Proprietary fee system in effect in Maryland before Independence. Having reviewed these texts and others, we conclude that, though they do provide context and illumination for our interpretation of Article 14, they do not support Appellants\u2019 argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">The Proprietary structure enforced in Maryland while it was a colony of Great Britain allowed the proprietor and his agents to set fees and charges without the approval of the officials elected by the citizens of Maryland. It was the <em>lack of consent </em>by the people\u2019s legislative representatives that was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>denounced as the evil which the Framers of the Maryland Constitution sought to remedy. Our construction of the meaning of the Article is strengthened by a statement from the Constitutional Convention in 1776 that provided instructions for the deputies representing Maryland in Congress. If reconciliation could be reached with the British crown, then the representatives should</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-4\">tak[e] care to secure the colonies against the exercise of the right assumed by parliament to tax them, and to alter and change their charters, constitutions, and internal polity, without their consent, \u2014 powers incompatible with the essential securities of the lives, liberties, and properties of the colonists.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-5\"><em>Proceedings of the Conventions </em>at 83. In 1775, the convention resolved unanimously that, because of the \u201clong premeditated, and [then] avowed design of the British government, to raise a revenue from the property of the colonists, without their consent, on the gift, grant, and disposition of the commons of Great Britain\u201d and other reasons, it was \u201cfirmly persuaded that it [was] necessary and justifiable to repel force by force, [so did] approve of the opposition by arms, to the British troops employ[ed].\u201d Proceedings of the Conventions at 17-18. Article 14 codifies the catch-phrase of the Revolution: No taxation without representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Article 14 has undergone only one arguably substantive change since its adoption in the Constitution of 1776. At the Constitutional Convention of 1850-1851, the provision was amended from: \u201cThat no aid, charge, tax, burthen, fee, or fees, ought to be <em>set, </em>rated or levied, under any pretense, without the consent of the legislature\u201d to \u201cThat no aid, charge, tax, burthen or fees, ought to be rated or levied, under any pretense, without the consent of the Legislature,\u201d removing the word \u201cset\u201d from the provision. The records of the proceedings, committee reports, and debates of the 1850-1851 Convention offer little assistance in understanding why the change in language occurred. Apparently, the original version of Article 14 (then numbered Article 12) immediately preceding the Convention was passed out of committee without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>change. During the Convention proceedings, Article 14 was read aloud and no amendments were offered by the Convention members. Evidently, no debate took place. At the publication of the post-convention version of the Declaration of Rights and Constitution, however, the word \u201cset\u201d disappeared. With the removal of the word \u201cset,\u201d however, it became even plainer that the Legislature is not required to set expressly the amount of each aid, charge, tax, burden, or fee imposed by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Having construed Article 14 to include within its scope the telephone commission here and having found that Article 14 requires the Legislature\u2019s consent before a governmental charge or fee may be rated or levied by a body to which the power of setting the amount of the charge or fee has been delegated, we must determine whether the Legislature consented to the telephone commission at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">The Legislature enacted \u00a7\u00a7 10-502 and 10-503, which set up the Inmate Welfare Fund and financed it by the \u201cprofits derived from the sale of goods through the commissary operation and telephone and vending machine commissions.\u201d \u00a7 10-503(a)(2)(i)(1). We think this is clear evidence of the Legislature\u2019s consent to the imposition of a telephone commission. We hold, therefore, that the telephone commission charge does not violate Article 14 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">\n<em>Application of Article 8</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">Appellants argue that the telephone commission concomitantly violates separation of powers principles. Article 8 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>the Declaration of Rights provides that the \u201cLegislative, Executive, and Judicial powers of Government ought to be forever separate and distinct from each other; and no person exercising the functions of one of said Departments shall assume or discharge the duties of any other.\u201d In 1922, the Court held that there are certain powers only the Legislative body possesses and which it may not delegate. One of these nondelegable powers is to enact legislation. In <em>Brawner v. Curran, </em>141 Md. 586, 601, 119 A. 250 (1922), we examined a statute that was to be submitted to qualified voters in the State general election of 1922. The statute proposed to afford compensation to persons who served in active duty during World War II. The enactment provided that it must be accepted by the voters of Maryland by referendum in order to become effective. <em>Brawner, </em>141 Md. at 592, 119 A. 250. We held the enactment unconstitutional as an unlawful delegation in contravention of separation of powers principles. We based our conclusion on the text of Article III, \u00a7\u00a7 1 (Legislature shall consist of two branches), 27 (bills originate in either House of the General Assembly, three readings required), 28 (majority required for passage of bill or resolution, vote shall be recorded), 29 (style and subject-matter of laws), and 30 (presentment to Governor of bills passed) and Article II, \u00a7 17 (Governor to approve bill by signature or reject it by return with objections noted) of the Maryland Constitution. These provisions of the Constitution, we concluded, \u201cconfer upon the General Assembly of Maryland the exclusive power of making laws in that State\u201d because the provisions \u201cdefinitely and inevitably place the responsibility for the enactment of such laws upon each branch of the General Assembly and upon the Executive [with veto powers].\u201d <em>Brawner, </em>141 Md. at 601, 119 A. 250.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>Our construction of Articles 14 and 8 is consistent with <em>Brawner </em>because we do not here hold that the Legislature may delegate the power to enact laws.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Legislature must authorize the imposition of government charges for such charges to be valid. The Legislature, however, may choose to delegate the discreet power of setting the amount of government charges so approved to an Executive Branch agency or other governmental body without violating the separation of powers explicitly provided by the Constitution because the setting of fees and taxes is a delegable power. We have so held in <em>Burgess v. </em>Pue, 2 Gill 11 (1844) and <em>Baltimore v. State, </em>15 Md. 376 (1860). <em>See also State v. Smith, </em>305 Md. 489, 510-11, 505 A.2d 511, 522 (1986) (citing <em>Baltimore v. State </em>with approval and stating that the branches of state government are separate, but not completely so).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">In <em>Burgess v. Pue, </em>the legislative enactment at issue provided that a primary school tax be determined and set by the inhabitants of the school district.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Court held valid the Legislature\u2019s delegation of these powers to the people paying the tax, stating that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-6\">there is nothing in the Constitution prohibitory of the delegation of the power of taxation, in the mode adopted, to effect the attainment of it; we may say that grants of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>similar powers to other bodies, for political purposes, have been coeval with the Constitution itself, and that no serious doubts have ever been entertained of their validity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Id<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Again, in <em>Baltimore v. State, </em>the Court upheld a statute delegating the power to levy a tax, but this time to an Executive Branch body. The law at issue created a Police Commission authority in Baltimore City, authorized it to govern the City\u2019s police force, set its own budget, and required the City to levy taxes to fund the Commission\u2019s budget. The City, like Appellants in the present case, argued that the law violated separation of powers principles because the Legislature delegated its authority to set fees and taxes. The Court concluded that Article 8 \u201cis not to be interpreted as enjoining a complete separation between these several departments,\u201d based upon evidence of \u201ccontemporaneous construction, and acquiescence by the people, and the various departments of the government.\u201d <em>Baltimore v. State, </em>15 Md. at 457-58 (citing <em>Burgess </em>). Furthermore, the Court observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-6\">[t'Jhe power to levy taxes is a sovereign power, and unless committed to some portion of the people, may always be exercised by the Legislature. It is not to be considered as parted with by mere construction, and we have not been referred to any portion of the Constitution which divests it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>Hi *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-5\">Under the old system of levy courts, and tax commissioners, when appointed by the executive, it was never said that they had not power to make assessments and levy taxes. They were not elected by the people, nor accountable to them. They were appointed, under legislative authority, by the executive, and the State exercised its supreme power of taxing the people through their agency. <em>So here, the State chooses to substitute Commissioners in the place of the city authorities for the purpose of levying this tax, and we see no sufficient reason for denouncing the law on that account. That such a power may be delegated, see Burgess v. Pue, </em>2 Gill 11.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-6\"><em>Baltimore v. State, </em>15 Md. at 467-68 (Emphasis added). Thus, the Court held that the power to levy the specific amount of the tax was delegable. Many years later, in <em>Christ v. Department of Natural Resources, </em>335 Md. 427, 444-45, 644 A.2d 34, 42 (1994), we stated that clearly the Legislature \u201ccannot delegate a function which the Constitution expressly and unqualifiedly vests in the General Assembly itself,\u201d such as the power to impeach, enact statutes, or propose constitutional amendments. We failed then to include in the list of non-delegable powers the power to set the amount of government charges. The omission was intentional.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">Furthermore, this Court repeatedly has noted that Article 8 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights does not impose a complete separation between the branches of government. <em>Christ, </em>335 Md. at 441, 644 A.2d at 40 (Internal quotations omitted) (citing <em>Judy v. Schaefer, </em>331 Md. 239, 261, 627 A.2d 1039, 1050 (1993); <em>Dep\u2019t of Transp. v. Armacost, </em>311 Md. 64, 81, 532 A.2d 1056, 1064 (1987); <em>Dep\u2019t of Natural Res. v. Linchester Sand &amp; Gravel Corp., </em>274 Md. 211, 220, 334 A.2d 514, 521 (1975)). The delegation by the Legislature of legislative powers to Executive Branch agencies does not by itself usually violate Article 8 if \u201cguidelines or safeguards, sufficient under the circumstances, are contained in the pertinent statute or statutes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Citations omitted). Guidelines, howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>er, are not required uniformly by the Constitution in all cases. The Court has \u201crelaxed\u201d the necessity for the same many times \u201cin light of the complexity of modern conditions with which government must deal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Pressman v. Barnes, </em>209 Md. 544, 555, 121 A.2d 816, 822 (1956)).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">In <em>Lussier v. Maryland Racing Commission, </em>for example, we observed that when the Legislature grants broad power to an Executive Branch agency to promulgate regulations in a given area, the agency\u2019s regulations are valid unless they contradict the Legislature\u2019s express language or purpose in enacting the statute. 343 Md. 681, 688, 684 A.2d 804, 807 (1996). \u201cWe have repeatedly rejected the argument ... that the Legislature [is] required expressly or explicitly to authorize the particular regulatory action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore we ask: does \u00a7 10-503, which authorizes the imposition of the telephone commission, and \u00a7 3-702 of the State Finance and Procurement Article of the Maryland Code, which grants broad powers to regulate telephone services for State government, properly delegate the power to set the amount of the telephone commission to the Department of Budget and Management (DBM)?<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We conclude that the Legislature delegated that power properly because \u00a7 10-503 created a \u201ccommission\u201d but did not set an amount and \u00a7 3-702 of the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>Finance and Procurement Article of the Maryland Code granted broad authority to personnel of the DBM to procure telephone services for State government. Also, the existence of the telephone commission and its rates are consistent with the Legislature\u2019s intent to raise revenue to finance the Inmate Welfare Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">We recognize that administrative agencies have become essential to the State\u2019s operation. Though administrative agencies are essential, the Court is bound to ensure that those agencies act within the conf\u00ednes of their delegated powers. Here, we conclude that the DBM acted within its delegated power.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">We therefore hold that the Legislature validly delegated the power to set the rate of the telephone commission by its broad grant of authority to the DBM to regulate the operation of telephone systems in the State\u2019s correctional facilities and by the creation of the Inmate Welfare Fund to be funded by a commission to be charged on non-emergency, collect telephone calls placed by inmates. Because the power to set fees and charges may be delegated to administrative agencies, \u00a7 10-503 does not violate Article 8 of the Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">We conclude also that the absence in \u00a7 10-503 of direction for fixing the amount of the telephone commission does not violate separation of powers principles because there exists a legislative check on the Executive agency-established fee schedule. The Legislature is aware of the fee schedule and may, if it chooses, change it at anytime.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">\n<em>Consumer Protection Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Appellants asserted in their complaints that the telephone commission violates the Maryland Consumer Protection Act (CPA), codified as Maryland Code (1975, 2005 Repl.Vol.), Commercial Law Article, Title 13. We thus are required to decide whether the CPA governs the State\u2019s conduct here.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">Whether the CPA governs the State\u2019s conduct is a matter of statutory interpretation and a matter of first impression for the Court.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The primary canon of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>Comptroller of the Treasury v. Citicorp Int\u2019l Communications, Inc., </em>389 Md. 156, 165-66, 884 A.2d 112 (2005); <em>Rockwood Casualty Ins. Co. v. Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund, </em>385 Md. 99, 108, 867 A.2d 1026, 1031 (2005). We look first to the plain meaning of the language chosen by the Legislature. If the words of the statute are plain and unambiguous, then the Court will give effect to the statute as written and will refrain from adding or deleting language to reflect an intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>not evidenced in that language. <em>Moore v. Miley, </em>372 Md. 663, 677, 814 A.2d 557, 566 (2003). Hence, we examine the CPA\u2019s language to determine whether the Legislature intended for the CPA to apply to the activities of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Appellants argue that the CPA applies to the State\u2019s conduct because the CPA broadly applies to all sales of services primarily for personal, household, or family purposes, and thus includes the collect call telephone charges accepted by Appellants. This argument fails because, while the CPA applies broadly to the kinds of sales it governs, the statute also describes the actors to whom it applies and the State is not included in that description.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">The State contends that the legal principle applied in <em>Lomax v. Comptroller, </em>323 Md. 419, 593 A.2d 1099 (1991), applies to our analysis of the CPA. We agree. In <em>Lomax, </em>this Court applied the general principle that, when construing a statute whose language is written in general terms that are reasonably susceptible to being construed as applicable to the conduct of both governmental and private parties, the rule of construction to be applied is to exclude the government from the statute\u2019s operation unless the Legislature provides particular indication in the language that it intended to include the State in its sweep. <em>Lomax, </em>323 Md. at 421-22, 593 A.2d at 1100; <em>see also Glascock v.

The statute does not declare explicitly that it applies to the State. It lays out, however, a detailed regulatory scheme, listing prohibited practices, the covered actors in those practices, and the mechanisms for enforcement of the statute. Thus, for example, a \u201cperson\u201d may not engage in any \u201cunfair or deceptive trade practice\u201d in the \u201csale, lease, rental, loan, or bailment of any consumer goods, consumer realty, or consumer services\u201d or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>the offer of such. \u00a7 13-303. A \u201cperson\u201d is defined as including \u201can individual, corporation, business trust, estate, trust, partnership, association, two or more persons having a joint or common interest, or any other legal or commercial entity.\u201d \u00a7 13-101 (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">An \u201cunfair or deceptive trade practice,\u201d includes but is not limited to, any \u201c[f]alse, falsely disparaging or misleading oral or written statement, visual description, or other representation of any kind which has the capacity, tendency, or effect of deceiving or misleading consumers,\u201d certain representations concerning goods, and the \u201c[fjailure to state a material fact if the failure deceives or tends to deceive.\u201d \u00a7 13-301 (the section also contains a detailed list of practices that constitute an unfair or deceptive trade practice). Any practice prohibited by the Act is a violation, whether any consumer was in fact misled, deceived, or damaged as a result of the practice. \u00a7 13-302. Damages are considered in the remedy and penalty phases of enforcement. \u00a7 13-408(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">The CPA exempts from its application certain professional services by licensed professionals, a \u201cpublic service company, to the extent that the company\u2019s services and operations are regulated by the Public Service Commission,\u201d and television, radio, and print media who publish a third-party advertisement without knowledge that the advertisement violates the CPA. \u00a7 13-104.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">The statutory scheme establishes the Division of Consumer Protection in the Office of the State Attorney General, sets forth its power and duties, gives it rule-making and civil penalty-setting powers, provides it the ability to issue cease and desist orders based on findings made after a public hearing, allows it to recover the costs accrued in actions that it institutes, and permits it to hold administrative hearings and request criminal penalties for violations of the CPA. \u00a7\u00a7 13-201, 13-204, 13-205, 13-403, 13^05, 13-409, 13-410, 13-411. In addition to actions brought by the Consumer Protection Division, the Act authorizes any \u201cperson\u201d to file a private action \u201cto recover for injury or loss sustained by him as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>result of a practice prohibited by this title,\u201d and, if that person is successful, he or she may seek recovery of reasonable attorney fees for his or her attorney\u2019s efforts. \u00a7 13-408(a)-(b). It is under this Section of the CPA that Appellants brought their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Throughout the CPA, the State and its agencies serve multifaceted roles as investigator, enforcement officer, and quasi-judicial adjudicator' \u2014 holding hearings and setting civil penalties. The Legislature did not contemplate, apparently, the State as a \u201cperson\u201d within the coverage of the proscribed activities depicted in the CPA. We find no manifest intent in the language of the statute that the State\u2019s entrepreneurial revenue-raising activities were to be regulated by the CPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">We hold, therefore, that the CPA does not regulate the State\u2019s conduct in the present case. To hold otherwise would be to construe the CPA to reflect an intent not evidenced in its language and give the law a strained construction. Because we find that the CPA does not regulate the State\u2019s conduct, it is unnecessary to decide whether sovereign immunity protects the State from liability for a violation of the CPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">\n<em>The Common Law Actions of Unjust Enrichment and Money Had and Received</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">We next decide whether the Circuit Court correctly dismissed the common law counts of unjust enrichment and money had and received. We shall affirm the court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-10\">Appellants argue that, because the telephone commission is illegal, retention of the benefits it conferred would be inequitable as unjust enrichment. A claim of unjust enrichment is established when: (1) the plaintiff confers a benefit upon the defendant; (2) the defendant knows or appreciates the benefit; and (3) the defendant\u2019s acceptance or retention of the benefit under the circumstances is such that it would be inequitable to allow the defendant to retain the benefit without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>the paying of value in return. <em>Caroline County v. Dashiell, </em>358 Md. 83, 95 n. 7, 747 A.2d 600, 607 n. 7 (2000) (Citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Appellants failed to allege precisely why the collection of the telephone commission is an act of unjust enrichment, stating only that it \u201cwould be inequitable, for reasons stated <em>supra.\u201d </em>We assume that Appellants are referring to their allegations of: violations of Articles 14 and 8, and the CPA. We held <em>supra </em>that the State violated neither Article 14 nor Article 8. Moreover, we held <em>supra </em>that the CPA does not apply to the State\u2019s conduct here. Thus, there is no wrongful conduct upon which Appellants may rely to support a claim for unjust enrichment. The Circuit Court\u2019s dismissal of the unjust enrichment claim was correct.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">Appellants contended that the facts \u201cestablish the analogous cause of action under Maryland law for money had and received,\u201d citing <em>Electro-Nucleonics, Inc. v. Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission., </em>315 Md. 361, 554 A.2d 804 (1989), for the proposition that this Court recognized the ability to bring a common law action for money had and received in the context of a State constitutional violation. Our finding in <em>Electro-Nucleonics, Inc., </em>however, was not so expansive. Rather, we stated, the money had and received action could be brought in the context of an unconstitutional taking claim. <em>Electro-Nucleonics, Inc., </em>315 Md. at 372, 554 A.2d at 809. Reliance on <em>Electro-Nucleonics, Inc. </em>is misplaced in the present posture of this case where the Article 24 claim has been abandoned on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">The action for money had and received is a common count used to bring a restitution claim under the common law writ of assumpsit. <em>Ver Brycke v. Ver Brycke, </em>379 Md. 669, 698 n. 13, 843 A.2d 758, 775 n. 13 (2004). We have stated that this count \u201clies whenever the defendant has obtained possession of money which, in equity and good conscience, he ought not to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>allowed to retain.\u201d <em>State, Use of Employment Sec. Bd. v. Rucker, </em>211 Md. 153, 126 A.2d 846 (1956) (quoting Poe on Pleading, \u00a7 117 (Tiffany Edition) and citing <em>Moses v. Macferlan, 2 </em>Burr. 1005 (1760)). A money had and received count may lie where the defendant receives the money as a result of a mistake of law or fact and did not have a right to it. Because we concluded that the State\u2019s imposition of the telephone commission does not violate the Declaration of Rights or the CPA and does not confer an unjust benefit on the State, the action for money had and received was dismissed properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">\n<em>Plaintiff\u2019s Post-Judgment Motions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A59\">Finally, we determine whether the Circuit Court erred in denying Appellants\u2019 post-judgment motions seeking to amend their complaints. The applicable standard of review is whether the Circuit Court abused its discretion. <em>Renbaum v. Custom Holding, Inc., </em>386 Md. 28, 42-43, 871 A.2d 554, 563 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">Rule 2-534 of the Maryland Rules provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-8\">In an action decided by the court, on motion of any party filed within ten days after entry of judgment, the court may open the judgement to receive additional evidence, may amend its findings or its statement of reasons for the decision, may set forth additional findings or reasons, may enter new findings or new reasons, may amend the judgement, or may enter a new judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-9\">The Circuit Court has broad discretion whether to grant motions to alter or amend filed within ten days of the entry of judgment. Its discretion is to be applied liberally so that a technicality does not triumph over justice. <em>Bd. of Nursing v. Nechay, </em>347 Md. 396, 408, 701 A.2d 405, 411 (1997) (Citations omitted). We stated in <em>Board of Nursing v. Nechay </em>that \u201cwhether the court entertained a reasonable doubt that justice had not been done is an appropriate basis for the exercise of that discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Henley v.

Appellants filed their Second Motion to Alter/Amend the Judgement on 13 September 2004 \u2014 more than 30 days after entry of the court\u2019s pertinent judgment. The court denied both motions. Rule 2-534 is not implicated by the second motion to alter or amend because that motion was not filed within ten days of the entry of judgment. With regard to Rule 2-535(a), which applies to the court\u2019s power to revise its judgments generally, Appellants\u2019 second motion was filed more than 30 days after the entry of judgment. Thus, Rule 2-535(a) is not implicated. Because Appellants did not allege facts in their second motion that evince fraud, mistake, or irregularity, the second motion moreover is not one filed pursuant to Rule 2-535(b), which allows such a motion to be filed at any time. <em>See also Pickett v. Noba, Inc., </em>122 Md.App. 566, 573, 714 A.2d 212, 215 (1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>351 Md. 663, 719 A.2d 1262 (1998) (concluding that a second motion to revise the judgment that did not claim fraud, mistake, or irregularity and \u201cfiled more than thirty days after the entry of judgment, even though within thirty days after denial of the first motion, cannot be granted\u201d). Thus, the trial court acted within its discretion in denying Appellants\u2019 second motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>The first motion to alter or amend advanced three proposed additional allegations to be added to Appellants\u2019 already much-amended complaints: (1) that each plaintiff has suffered actual injury related to the matters in the complaint; (2) defendants engaged in antitrust activity and/or unlawfully exercised anti-competitive power; and (3) defendants engaged in a threatened and/or actual monopoly by their imposition of the telephone commission. We conclude that these additional allegations to alter or amend would not have changed the trial court\u2019s judgment. Therefore, the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the first motion because the allegations contained therein did not supply \u201creasonable doubt that justice had not been done\u201d by the court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">The first additional allegation, that Dean suffered actual injury, would not change the outcome of the case because, even had the court considered the allegation, it would have dismissed Dean\u2019s complaint nonetheless for the same reasons that it dismissed Benson\u2019s complaint. We know this to be so because the court dismissed Benson\u2019s complaint, where it had been properly alleged that she suffered actual injury. Benson\u2019s complaint was nearly identical to Dean\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">The second and third new allegations regarding Appellants\u2019 antitrust claims would also not change the outcome of the case because the new allegations would not impact the trial court\u2019s reasoning. The court concluded that the antitrust claims were barred by sovereign immunity, among other reasons. It therefore dismissed Appellants\u2019 antitrust claims. Even had the court considered the second new, wholly conclusory allegation, that defendants engaged in antitrust activity and/or unlawfully exercised anti-competitive power, or the third new allegation, that defendants engaged in a threatened and/or actual monopoly by their imposition of the telephone commission, it nonetheless would have dismissed the claims based on sovereign immunity principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE DIVIDED EQUALLY BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b755-9\">.

There exist three Maryland cases where it was argued specifically that a tax or fee was levied without the consent of the Legislature in violation of Article 14. In none did the Court consider specifically whether a private right of action would lie, yet implied that it might. In <em>Ogrinz </em>v. <em>James, </em>the Court succinctly dismissed the Article 14 claim on its merits on the basis that the Legislature in fact consented to the \u201ctaxes\u201d in question. 309 Md. 381, 396, 524 A.2d 77, 85 (1987) (finding that the \u201cGeneral Assembly clearly has imposed the tax\u201d).

Some confusion apparently exists as a result of the Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v.

Appellants argue in their Brief in the present case that <em>Mayhew </em>stands for the proposition that the Legislature is obligated to set the rate or amount of each revenue measure. We disagree. In his opinion for the Court in <em>Mayhew, </em>Judge Dorsey concluded that the Legislature could delegate the power to levy taxes to the levy courts or county commissioners, both of which were representatives o\u00ed the Judiciary and Executive branches of government, respectively. <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, <em>Mayhew </em>is inconsistent with <em>Burgess v.

The telephone commission is negotiated between the private telephone companies and the Department of Budget and Management and must be approved, after a public hearing, by of the Board of Public Works.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b781-8\">. No reported Maryland appellate opinion has determined whether the CPA applies to the activities of the State. In <em>Stern v. Board of Regents, </em>380 Md. 691, 846 A.2d 996 (2004), the plaintiff students of various campuses of the University of Maryland sued to enjoin the Board of Regents from implementing a mid-year tuition increase. Plaintiffs asserted, among other theories, a CPA complaint. <em>Stern, </em>380 Md. at 694, 846 A.2d at 998. At the 15 April 2003 motions hearing, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City granted the Regents\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the CPA count. After reviewing the CPA, its legislative history, and relevant case law, the court found no indicia supporting the contention that the CPA applied to the State, pointing out that \u201cthere\u2019s no reference whatsoever as to whether it is to be applied to institutions ... such as the Board of Regents here.\u201d <em>Reporter\u2019s Transcript </em>at 91-92. The Circuit Court recited the general rule that</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">it is well established that statutory provisions which are written in such general language, that they are reasonably susceptible to being construed as applicable to both the government and to private parties, are subject to a rule of construction which exempts the government from their operation in the absence of other particular indicia supporting a contrary result in particular instances.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 91. On appeal, this question was not advanced and, accordingly, was not decided by this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b783-6\">. In <em>City of Annapolis v. Anne Arundel County, </em>271 Md. 265, 316 A.2d 807 (1974), the Court held that the historic landmark preservation statute enacted by Anne Arundel County governed the City of Annapolis, giving to the County the authority to deny the City's request for a demolition order of a historic building. Justifying this result, the Court discerned an implied legislative intent indicated by the purpose for the law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-7\">the historically or architecturally valuable building is just as much lost by destruction by a public body as it would be by a private owner ... The General Assembly could well conclude that, to accomplish historic and architectural preservation, the jurisdiction of the Commission should extend to all owners be they private persons or governmental agencies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-8\"><em>City of Annapolis, </em>271 Md. at 291, 316 A.2d at 821. We observe that the conclusion and reasoning of <em>City of Annapolis </em>appears to be an anomaly, and, though not one disavowed expressly by the Court, is no longer followed. The subsequent cases on point <em>(Lomax, Glascock, Nationwide, City of Baltimore, </em>and Harden) have painted <em>City of Annapolis </em>into a tight jurisprudential corner. We apply here the rule observed in the subsequent cases, not only to be consistent with the greater precedent, but also because the rule is based upon a reading of the statute\u2019s language to discern the Legislature\u2019s intent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b786-8\">. Appellees argue that the unjust enrichment claim also must fail because the voluntary payments rule is a valid defense. Because of the scope of our holding, it is unnecessary to consider that argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
