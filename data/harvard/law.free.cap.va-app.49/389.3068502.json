ELDER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">Jeffrey E. Neel (appellant) appeals from his jury trial conviction for leaving the scene of an accident involving personal injury in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-894. On appeal, he concedes the evidence was sufficient to prove he failed to stop at the scene of an accident involving property damage, and he does not challenge his conviction for that offense, but he contends the evidence was insufficient to prove he knew or should have known the accident involved personal injury. We hold the facts were insufficient to support his conviction. Thus, we reverse the conviction and dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b437-13\">At about 5:30 p.m. on August 9, 2004, employees of the Prince William and Fauquier County Sheriffs Departments responded to a Fauquier County location where \u201ca woman ... had stopped in the middle of the road\u201d and \u201cwas blocking traffic.\u201d One deputy spoke with the woman while a second, Deputy Ron Christefano, directed traffic. Their sheriffs department vehicles were parked at the scene with emergency lights flashing.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>Deputy Christefano observed a car approach the scene and \u201cslow[] down properly.\u201d That car was driven by Deanna Swanson. Just as Swanson was coming to a stop about ten feet from Deputy Christefano, a car driven by appellant approached behind Swanson. Appellant\u2019s car \u201cslowed down some,\u201d but while still traveling at \u201ca good speed,\u201d it \u201crear-end[ed]\u201d Swanson\u2019s car. Swanson described the impact as \u201crather hard\u201d and said \u201c[i]t pushed [her vehicle forward] some.\u201d Deputy Christefano described the impact as a \u201cbang.\u201d He said it was \u201clike a crash. A rear-end. That\u2019s all it was. But I definitely heard it and saw it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The accident caused \u201c[n]ot a great deal [of damage to Swanson\u2019s car], but some.\u201d She described the damage as \u201ca crack in the cover of the light on the back\u201d and said, \u201cI can\u2019t hardly tell it\u2019s there.\u201d Her insurance company estimated the cost to repair the damage as \u201c$600 and some.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">\u201c[W]ithin seconds\u201d after the impact, Deputy Christefano approached Swanson\u2019s car and inquired whether \u201ceverybody\u201d in Swanson\u2019s vehicle was \u201cokay\u201d and whether anybody was \u201churting.\u201d Swanson looked at the other occupants of her vehicle, two of her grandchildren, and responded to Deputy Christefano that \u201cshe was fine,\u201d they were \u201cokay.\u201d Deputy Christefano told Swanson to pull over to the side of the road, and she did so. Deputy Christefano did not know whether appellant was able to hear his conversation with Swanson. Deputy Christefano did not assess the damage to Swanson\u2019s vehicle at the time, but he did not recall that \u201cany pieces of [Swanson\u2019s] car\u201d or any \u201cbroken glass that was attributable to this accident\u201d were \u201cin the roadway\u201d at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Deputy Christefano then went immediately to appellant\u2019s window and asked appellant, \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d Appellant \u201creally had no response.\u201d Deputy Christefano then \u201ctold [appellant] to follow behind [Swanson] and pull over on the side of the road.\u201d Deputy Christefano did not discuss with appellant anything concerning the condition of Swanson or her passengers.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>When Deputy Christefano completed his brief initial conversations with Swanson and appellant, \u201can ambulance was on the scene for the original [incident]\u201d that had caused the officers to stop, and Deputy Christefano \u201clet them know about what happened there.\u201d When Deputy Christefano turned his back to talk to the other deputy on the scene, appellant drove off.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Deputy Christefano gave chase and apprehended appellant at least a mile from the scene. When the officers apprehended appellant, they observed that his vehicle had a dent on the hood and bumper area that was \u201c[n]ot very big,\u201d \u201capproximately twelve inches maybe at the most across.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Unbeknownst to Deputy Christefano or appellant, Swanson had \u201cdeteriorating discs\u201d and had undergone neck surgery about eight months prior to the collision at issue. Swanson testified that between her December 2003 neck surgery and the rear-end collision with appellant on August 9, 2004, she had experienced no pain in her neck and that after the accident she felt pain in her neck and head. She testified that as of the date of trial, July 6, 2005, she was \u201cstfil hav[ing] problems with [her] neck.\u201d Swanson received medical attention at the scene of the August 9, 2004 accident, but no evidence indicated she received that attention while appellant was still present.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Appellant was indicted, <em>inter alia, </em>for violating Code \u00a7 46.2-894 by leaving the scene of an accident in which a person was injured without stopping to report his name, address, and other personal information or render reasonable assistance to the person injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">Following the Commonwealth\u2019s presentation of evidence in appellant\u2019s jury trial, appellant moved to strike, contending, <em>inter alia, </em>that the evidence failed to prove he knew or should have known anyone had been injured as a result of the accident. The trial court denied the motion. At the conclusion of all the evidence, appellant renewed his motion to strike, which the court again denied. The jury convicted appellant of the charged offenses, and he noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Under familiar principles of appellate review, we examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to the evidence all reasonable inferences fairly dedueible therefrom. <em>See, e.g., Martin v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987). The credibility of a witness, the weight accorded the testimony, and the inferences to be drawn from proven facts are matters solely for the fact finder\u2019s determination. <em>Long v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 194, 199, 379 S.E.2d 473, 476 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Code \u00a7 46.2-894 provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AyQ\">The driver of any vehicle involved in an accident in which a person is killed or injured or in which an attended vehicle or other attended property is damaged shall immediately stop as close to the scene of the accident as possible without obstructing traffic ... and report his name, address, driver\u2019s license number, and vehicle registration number forthwith to the State Police or local law-enforcement agency, to the person struck and injured if such person appears to be capable of understanding and retaining the information, or to the driver or some other occupant of the vehicle collided with or to the custodian of other damaged property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">If the accident resulted in injury or death, failure to comply with Code \u00a7 46.2-894 is a felony. Code \u00a7 46.2-894. \u201cThe identification requirement is intended to facilitate accident investigation and to preserve public order.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, 14 </em>Va.App. 769, 771, 418 S.E.2d 729, 731 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">In <em>Herchenbach v. Commonwealth, </em>185 Va. 217, 38 S.E.2d 328 (1946), the Supreme Court interpreted a predecessor version of this statute as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-11\">Knowledge necessarily is an essential element of the crime. This does not mean that the person should have positive knowledge of the extent of the damage or injuries inflicted. It does mean that, in order to be guilty of violating the statute, \u201cthe driver must be aware that harm has been done; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>it must be present in his mind that there has been an injury; and then, with that in his mind, he must deliberately go away without making himself known. If an injury is inflicted under such circumstances as would ordinarily superinduce the belief in a reasonable person that injury would flow, or had flowed, from the accident or collision, then it is the duty of the operator to stop his vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 220, 38 S.E.2d at 329 (quoting 5 Am.Jur. 921). We subsequently interpreted this language as requiring the Commonwealth to prove \u201cthat the defendant possessed actual knowledge of the occurrence of the accident, and such knowledge of injury which would be attributed to a reasonable person under the circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Kil v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 802, 811, 407 S.E.2d 674, 679 (1991). \u201cThis approach ... has been characterized as \u2018requiring subjective knowledge of the collision while holding the driver to a stricter reasonable man standard as to the fact or extent of the injury<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>. . . . \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 810, 407 S.E.2d at 679 (quoting <em>Commonwealth v. Kauffman, </em>323 Pa.Super. 363, 470 A.2d 634, 637 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Knowledge of injury may be imputed to a driver \u201cwhere the fact of personal injury is visible or where the seriousness of the collision would lead a reasonable person to assume there must have been resulting injuries.\u201d <em>People v. Carter, </em>243 Cal.App.2d 239, 52 Cal.Rptr. 207, 208 (1966) (citation omitted) (holding that where impact \u201cslightly dam aged\u201d bumper or fender of both cars and bumper had to be pulled away from wheel of one so it could be moved, \u201ccollision was not of sufficient magnitude to compel the conclusion that injuries had probably occurred\u201d); <em>see also </em>Marjorie A. Caner, Annotation, <em>Necessity and Sufficiency of Showing, in Criminal Prosecution Under \u201cHit-and-Run\u201d Statute, Accused\u2019s Knowledge of Accident, Injury, or Damage, </em>26 A.L.R.5th 1, \u00a7\u00a7 26, 29, 30 (1995 &amp; Supp.2006) (finding relevant the force of impact and amount of damage sustained by vehicles). \u201c[I]n some cases, such as [those involving] proof of intent or knowledge, [circumstantial evidence] is practically the only method of proof.\u201d <em>Parks v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 492, 498, 270 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>S.E.2d 755, 759 (1980). \u201cCircumstantial evidence is as competent and is entitled to as much weight as direct evidence, provided [the evidence as a whole] is sufficiently convincing to exclude every reasonable hypothesis except that of guilt.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Commonwealth, 226 </em>Va. 31, 53, 307 S.E.2d 864, 876 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Here, we conclude as a matter of law that the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, was insufficient to support a finding that appellant knew or should have known anyone in Swanson\u2019s car was injured. No evidence established that appellant or Swanson left their cars or that emergency personnel, other than Deputy Christefano, approached Swanson\u2019s car while appellant was at the scene. Although an ambulance was present when Deputy Christefano finished his brief conversations with Swanson and appellant immediately following their rear-end collision, it was undisputed that the ambulance was present at the scene to respond to the original incident that had disrupted traffic. It was also undisputed that medical personnel made no effort to attend to Swanson while appellant was at the scene. Thus, the arrival of an ambulance at the scene of the pre-existing traffic incident almost immediately following the occurrence of appellant\u2019s rear-end collision with Swanson, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, was not evidence indicating a reasonable person in appellant\u2019s position knew or should have known before he fled that someone in Swanson\u2019s car had been injured.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Further, although the impact from the rear-end collision was audible, described by Deputy Christefano as a \u201cbang,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>and pushed Swanson\u2019s car forward, appellant was present as Swanson, while remaining behind the wheel of her own car, spoke to Deputy Christefano and then pulled her car to the side of the road. Deputy Christefano then came immediately to appellant\u2019s car rather than attempting to render any type of aid to Swanson or any other occupants of her car or to call any of the other people then on the scene to render aid to Swanson or her passengers. Deputy Christefano also called attention to the fact that Swanson moved the car under her own power, telling appellant to \u201cfollow behind her and pull over on the side of the road.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Finally, Swanson described the damage to her car as \u201ca crack in the cover of the light on the back\u201d that was so minor \u201c[she could] hardly tell [it was] there.\u201d Deputy Christefano testified that he did not recall observing any debris in the roadway as a result of the impact between Swanson\u2019s and appellant\u2019s vehicles. Thus, the minimal nature of the damage to Swanson\u2019s vehicle was insufficient to put appellant on notice that she had been injured. Although the evidence would support a finding that appellant\u2019s front bumper and hood may have sustained some damage in the collision, no evidence establishes that appellant would have known about this damage before he fled the scene. <em>Compare Cottee v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 546, 558, 525 S.E.2d 25, 31 (2000) (holding evidence sufficient to prove knowledge where defendant \u201crevved\u201d engine and drove into the two victims, after which \u201c[s]everal bystanders were shouting that people were trapped under the car\u201d); <em>Kil, </em>12 Va.App. at 812-13, 407 S.E.2d at 680 (holding evidence sufficient to prove knowledge where impact caused extensive damage to right side of van, scattered numerous glass particles along front seat, threw bodies of three victims distances of 45 to 135 feet from point of impact, and residents inside nearby homes at time of accident described impact as \u201ca loud noise\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, we hold as a matter of law that the evidence failed to prove appellant knew or should have known personal injury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>as opposed to property damage,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> had resulted from the collision at the time he fled the scene. To hold otherwise would be to permit a driver involved in any but the most minor of accidents to be convicted of felony hit-and-run for leaving the scene of the accident -without personally investigating whether injury had occurred, regardless of how unforeseeable an injury was under the circumstances surrounding the accident. Whatever one\u2019s moral duty may be upon the occurrence of an accident, the applicable law in the form of the text of the statute itself and Virginia\u2019s appellate court decisions interpreting it does not permit conviction for felony hit-and-run based solely upon the happening of an accident and a failure to investigate. Rather, such a conviction must be based on evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, proving beyond a reasonable doubt the driver knew or should have known that personal injury, not just property damage, had resulted from the collision. <em>E.g., Kil, </em>12 Va.App. at 810-11, 407 S.E.2d at 679.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">For these reasons, we hold the evidence was insufficient to support appellant\u2019s felony conviction for leaving the scene of an accident involving personal injury in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-894. Thus, we reverse the challenged conviction and dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b442-7\">. The Commonwealth, in apparent recognition of this lack of relevance, made no attempt to rely on the presence of the ambulance in arguing to the juiy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b442-8\">. In ruling on the motion to strike, the trial court cited the occurrence of a \"loud bang\u201d and found this was enough to impose on appellant a duty to investigate in regard to property damage. However, the only witness who described the accident as causing a \"bang\u201d was Deputy Christefano, who was standing ten feet from the point of impact, and he described the accident as causing only a \"bang,\u201d not a \"loud bang.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b444-12\">. As previously mentioned, appellant was convicted for the misdemean- or of leaving the scene of an accident involving property damage and does not challenge that conviction on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b444-8\">Haley, J., dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">Although admitting that a \u201cjury\u2019s verdict will not be disturbed unless it is plainly wrong or without evidence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>support it,\u201d <em>Guda v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 453, 457, 592 S.E.2d 748, 750 (2004), the majority nonetheless concludes \u201cas a matter of law that the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, was insufficient to support a finding that appellant knew or should have known anyone in [the victim\u2019s] car was injured.\u201d Respecting the jury\u2019s decision to the contrary, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">II. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The following adds to and emphasizes the facts as set forth by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">In December of the year preceding the August 9, 2004 accident, Ms. Swanson had had two surgeries in which rods were inserted \u201cin [her] upper and lower back\u201d because of \u201cdeteriorating discs.\u201d As to the accident, she testified that there was a \u201crather hard impact. It pushed us some\u201d and that she \u201cwas frightened. And I felt pain.\u201d After she pulled to the shoulder, and the appellant had fled, \u201c[t]he people from the emergency vehicles came over.\u201d After taking her blood pressure, which was found elevated, and upon her telling them of her pain, medical personnel \u201ctook her to the hospital.\u201d At the hospital a CT scan and X-rays were taken. Though Ms. Swanson was released from the hospital seven hours after arrival, as of the date of trial, approximately eleven months after the incident, she \u201cstill [has] problems with [her] neck.\u201d The damages to Ms. Swanson\u2019s car totaled approximately $600.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">Deputy Ron Christefano heard a \u201cbang\u201d when appellant\u2019s vehicle collided with Ms. Swanson\u2019s. He testified that Ms. Swanson</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-9\">said she was okay. I told her to pull on the side of the road. I went over to the second vehicle and told [appellant] to ... pull over on the side of the road. When I did that, at that time an ambulance was on the scene for the original reason<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>why I went out there.... When I turned my back to talk to the other deputy, I looked over my shoulder and the [appellant] in the second vehicle shot off.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">III. JURY INSTRUCTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">The trial court considered the primary issue, that is, whether knowledge of injury could be attributable to a reasonable person under the circumstances, as one for jury determination. Relevant portions of the instructions to the jury follow:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">From Instruction 5 defining the elements of the offense: \u201c(3) That the defendant knew, or should have known, that another person was injured by the accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">Instruction 7: \u201cThe word \u2018injury\u2019 as used in these instruction[s] means any physical damage to the body caused by violence or accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">From Instruction 8: \u201cthe Commonwealth must prove ... knowledge of injury which would be attributed to a reasonable person under the circumstances of the case.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">From Instruction 9: \u201cfor an element may also be proved by circumstantial evidence. You may convict the defendant on circumstantial evidence alone.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-12\">IV. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b446-13\">The verdict of a jury \u201ccannot be overturned on appeal unless no \u2018rational trier of fact\u2019 could have come to the conclusion it did.\u201d <em>Stevens v. Commonwealth, </em>46 Va.App. 234, 248, 616 S.E.2d 754, 761 (2005) (quoting <em>Kelly v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 250, 257, 584 S.E.2d 444, 447 (2003) (en <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>banc)). <em>See also Pease v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 342, 355, 573 S.E.2d 272, 278 (2002) (en banc) (\u201cWe let the decision stand unless we conclude no rational juror could have reached that decision.\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>266 Va. 397, 588 S.E.2d 149 (2003); <em>O\u2019Connell v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 719, 726, 634 S.E.2d 379, 382 (2006). \u201cThis familiar standard gives full play to the responsibility of the trier of fact fairly to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and <em>to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.\u201d Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">That standard of review does not permit us to \u201csubstitute our judgment for that of\u2019 a properly instructed jury. <em>See Wactor v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 375, 380, 564 S.E.2d 160, 162 (2002). It is my view the majority does not honor that standard and engages in the substitution that standard prohibits. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b445-13\">. The dissent acknowledges that the ambulance had been called as a result of the accident that caused Ms. Swanson to slow and stop before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>being hit in the rear by the appellant.
