We hold the commission properly found that Travelers was required to file a Form 45H in each case, that the failure to do so kept the existing policies in effect, and that Travelers is responsible for the payment of benefits. Therefore, we affirm the awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A4V\">\n<em>Claimant Leslie C. Ely</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The material facts are not in dispute. Graycon, Inc., the insured, obtained a workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy with Travelers effective from July 30, 2003 through July 30, 2004. Prior to the expiration of the policy, an underwriter from Travelers offered the insured the opportunity to renew the policy. The insured inadvertently did not remit a premium to Travelers, and Travelers took no action to renew the policy. Travelers did not file a Form 45H non-renewal notice with the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Claimant was injured in a work-related accident on September 17, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">\n<em>Claimant Mathew L. Bailey</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">The material facts are not in dispute. Travelers issued a workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy to Willie M. Thomas Home Improvements, the insured, effective from October 25, 2003 through October 25, 2004. An underwriter for Travelers sent notice to the insured that the policy was about to expire and offered to renew the policy. Travelers received a premium payment on December 18, 2004, after the policy\u2019s expiration date. Prior to receiving this late premium payment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>Travelers did not file a Form 45H non-renewal notice with the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Claimant was injured in a work-related incident on December 16,2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">\n<em>Findings by the Full Commission</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">In each case, the commission interpreted the language of Code \u00a7 65.2-804(B) to determine whether the insured or Travelers was responsible for notifying the commission upon non-renewal of a policy. The full commission found that the operative phrase \u201cnon-renewed by the insurer\u201d is ambiguous, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-7\">The language of [Code \u00a7 ] 65.2-804 can be interpreted to mean non-renewed at the election of the insurer or that the insurer did not renew the policy, whether it was at the behest of the employer or insurer, as a result of an oversight by the parties, or for other reasons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">In interpreting Code \u00a7 65.2-804(B), the commission looked to the intent of the statute and determined that \u201call non-renewals are \u2018non-renew[als] by the insurer\u2019 as contemplated by [Code] \u00a7 65.2-804(B).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">The commission found in each case that because Travelers did not file a commission Form 45H, the policies were not effectively terminated and Travelers was responsible for benefits associated with each compensable injury. From these decisions, Travelers appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">The narrow issue in these consolidated cases is whether the phrase \u201cnon-renewed by the insurer\u201d in Code \u00a7 65.2-804(B) refers to only when the insurer initiates the non-renewal, or whether it is broad enough to encompass situations where the insured initiates the non-renewal. Put differently, is the insurer obligated to notify the commission and the insured every time the policy is not renewed, or only when the insurer/carrier initiates the non-renewal? In the cases before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>us, the insured did not pay the insurance premium prior to the expiration date of their respective policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">As we stated above, our resolution of the issue before us is the meaning of \u201cnon-renewed by the insurer.\u201d We find that in all cases of non-renewals, the insurer must provide notification pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-804(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">This appeal requires that we reconcile two neighboring provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act: Code \u00a7 65.2-804(A) dealing with notice requirements when an insured cancels his coverage; and Code \u00a7 65.2-804(B) dealing with notice requirements when the insurer cancels or does not renew the coverage. In order to reconcile the statutes, we apply the applicable rules of statutory construction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">It is well established that a statute should be read and considered as a whole, and the language of a statute should be examined in its entirety to determine the intent of the General Assembly from the words contained in the statute. In doing so, the various parts of the statute should be harmonized so that, if practicable, each is given a sensible and intelligent effect. Thus, \u201c[a] statute is not to be construed by singling out a particular phrase; every part is presumed to have some effect and is not to be disregarded unless absolutely necessary.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Zamani, </em>256 Va. 391, 395, 507 S.E.2d 608, 609 (1998); <em>accord Jeneary v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 418, 430, 551 S.E.2d 321, 327 (2001).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-7\"><em>Dep\u2019t of Med. Assistance v. Beverly Healthcare, </em>268 Va. 278, 285, 601 S.E.2d 604, 608 (2004) (other citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">\u2018We consider the language of each statute at issue to determine the General Assembly\u2019s intent from the plain and natural meaning of the words used. When the language of a statute is unambiguous, courts are bound by the plain meaning of that language.\u201d <em>Hoffman Family, LLC v. City of Alexandria, </em>272 Va. 274, 284, 634 S.E.2d 722, 727 (2006) (citations omitted). Because statutory interpretation presents a pure question of law, it is subject to <em>de novo </em>review by this Court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number><em>Boynton v. Kilgore, </em>271 Va. 220, 227, 623 S.E.2d 922, 925 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Our analysis begins with the premise that the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act was adopted for the protection of workers and their dependents. <em>Hartford Co. v. Fidelity, </em>223 Va. 641, 643, 292 S.E.2d 327, 328 (1982). It is undisputed that Code \u00a7 65.2-804(B) includes a notice and delay provision. The notice and delay requirements of Code \u00a7 65.2-804(B) protect the worker against a lapse in his employer\u2019s insurance coverage where a workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy is canceled or not renewed by giving the employer an opportunity to acquire other insurance and by giving the commission the opportunity to timely invoke its enforcement authority. <em>Pennsylvania Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. Waldron, </em>16 Va.App. 991, 994, 434 S.E.2d 690, 691 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">In interpreting this statutory language, we must review the entire statutory scheme. We begin by reviewing all subsections of Code \u00a7 65.2-804 in order to understand the import of the notice provisions. Code \u00a7 65.2-804(A)(l) requires each insured to file annually with the commission evidence of compliance with the insurance requirements of the Act. However, if the employer subsequently cancels the insurance, employer shall immediately notify the commission of such cancellation. Every insurer must also notify the commission \u201cimmediately upon the cancellation of any policy issued by it____\u201d Additionally, Code \u00a7 65.2-804(A)(2) requires the employer, prior to canceling the insurance, to give employees 30 days written notice of its intent to cancel. \u201cEvery employer who received the notice required under subsection (B) of this section shall immediately forward a copy to his employees covered.\u201d Thus, subsection (A) addresses notice requirements when the employer cancels the insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Prior to 1993, Code \u00a7 65.2-804(B) provided that the insurer notify the commission upon cancellation initiated exclusively by the insurer. During that same time, Code \u00a7 65.2-804(A) addressed the notice requirements when the insured exclusively initiated cancellation. In 1993, however, the General As<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>sembly amended the statute to also include notification to the commission upon \u201cnon-renewal\u201d of a policy. Importantly, the legislature changed only subsection (B), the provision that deals with cancellation by the insurer. Subsection (A) remained unchanged. We interpret this legislative action to mean that the General Assembly contemplated that in the case of every non-renewal, the insurer was the party responsible for giving notice to the commission. Had the legislature intended that in cases in which the insured initiated a non-renewal, rendering the insured rather than the insurer responsible for giving notice, then the General Assembly would have also amended subsection (A), which addresses actions taken by the insured. Thus, we find that \u201cnon-renewal by the insurer\u201d as stated in subsection (B) contemplates all non-renewals.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">Claimant Ely\u2019s case presents an ideal example in support of the commission\u2019s ruling that subsection (B) requires the insurer to notify the commission in all non-renewals. While the insured/employer acknowledged receiving Travelers\u2019 renewal package prior to the expiration of the policy, employer erroneously understood the policy had been renewed. A representative from Travelers testified that Travelers never notified employer of non-renewal. Had Travelers complied with the mandate of subsection (B), it would have notified employer and the commission of the status of the policy. Employer would then have had the opportunity to secure another policy. This notice also would have alerted the commission to employer\u2019s non-compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Travelers\u2019 suggested interpretation fails to \u201c \u2018promote the ability of the enactment to remedy the mischief at which [Code \u00a7 65.2-804] is directed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Natrella v. Bd. of Zoning Appeals, </em>231 Va. 451, 461, 345 S.E.2d 295, 301 (1986) (quoting <em>Jones v. Conwell, </em>227 Va. 176, 181, 314 S.E.2d 61, 64 (1984)). Such an interpretation ignores the commission\u2019s enforcement duties, deprives the employer of the delay provisions, and fails to acknowledge the purpose of the notice provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">We conclude that Code \u00a7 65.2-804(B) requires that when the policy is not renewed, the insurer must notify the commission and the employer of the non-renewal, irrespective of who initiated the non-renewal. Thus, the policy of each claimant was in effect on the date of each claimant\u2019s injury. We affirm the commission\u2019s decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b318-14\">. Code \u00a7 65.2-804(B) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-15\">No policy of insurance hereafter issued under the provisions of this title, nor any membership agreement in a group self-insurance association, shall be cancelled or non-renewed by the insurer issuing such policy or by the group self-insurance association canceling or nonrenewing such membership, except on thirty days\u2019 notice to the employer and the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission, unless the employer has obtained other insurance and the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission is notified of that fact by the insurer assuming the risk, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>unless, in the event of cancellation, said cancellation is for nonpayment of premiums; then ten days\u2019 notice shall be given the employer and the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b324-6\">KELSEY, J., dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Travelers Property Casualty Company of America appeals two decisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission requiring Travelers to provide workers\u2019 compensation coverage beyond the expiration of its insurance policies. Finding no statutory basis for this compulsory coverage, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">This consolidated appeal includes two cases. The first involves an insurance policy issued by Travelers to Graycon, Inc. By its terms, the policy expired on July 30, 2004. In May 2004, Travelers offered the employer an opportunity to renew the policy prior to its expiration. If accepted by the employer, the renewal would have extended the policy for another year. The employer failed to renew, mistakenly thinking it could do so after the policy expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">In September 2004, a month and a half after the policy expired, an employee (Leslie C. Ely) injured himself on the job. Travelers declined coverage, arguing that its policy had expired because the employer failed to renew it. The employee\u2019s claim, Travelers contended, should be compensated by other statutory employers or their insurance carriers. A deputy commissioner agreed with Travelers. On review, the full commission reversed and held that Travelers failed to provide the employer and the commission notice of nonrenewal \u201cby the insurer\u201d as required by Code \u00a7 65.2-804(B). Travelers must pay the claim, the commission concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>The second case involves a policy issued by Travelers to Willie M. Thomas Home Improvements. By its terms, this policy expired on October 25, 2004. More than two months prior to the policy expiration, Travelers offered the employer an opportunity to renew the policy for another year of coverage. The employer failed to respond to the offer. About a month and a half after the policy expired, an employee (Mathew L. Bailey) sustained a job-related injury. Two days later, the employer asked Travelers to renew the prior policy and to provide retroactive coverage for the employee\u2019s injury. Travelers refused, arguing that the claim should be paid by the Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund (\u201cUEF\u201d) pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-1203.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A deputy commissioner ordered Travelers to cover the claim, concluding that Travelers failed to provide the employer and the commission notice of nonrenewal \u201cby the insurer\u201d as required by Code \u00a7 65.2-804(B). On review, the full commission affirmed on the same basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">In both cases, the commission\u2019s records demonstrate that the employers had filed proof-of-coverage notices with the National Council for Compensation Insurance (NCCI), with whom the commission has outsourced much of its data management duties with respect to insurance coverage. <em>See generally Villwock v. Ins. Co. of N. Am./CIGNA, </em>22 Va.App. 127, 130-31, 468 S.E.2d 130, 132 (1996). The commission regularly uses NCCI\u2019s \u201cProof of Coverage Policy Information System.\u201d <em>Squire v. Elco Concrete Co., Inc., </em>VWC File No. 185-16-50, 1998 Va. Wrk. Comp. Lexis 4838, at *2 (April 23, 1998).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> NCCI\u2019s proof-of-coverage records for the nonrenewed policies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>at issue specifically disclose their expiration dates. The commission, therefore, had notice of the expected expiration date of both policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">On appeal, Travelers argues that the commission misconstrued Code \u00a7 65.2-804(B) because that statute requires the insurer to notify the insured and the commission only when the policy has been \u201ccancelled or nonrenewed <em>by the insurer.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). This argument presents a pure question of law, a matter of statutory interpretation we review <em>de novo. See Mattaponi Indian Tribe v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 690, 707, 601 S.E.2d 667, 675 (2004) (recognizing that \u201cpure statutory interpretation is the prerogative of the judiciary\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Our analysis should begin, \u201cas always, with the language of the statute.\u201d <em>Meador v. Va. Birth-Related Neurological Injury Comp. Program, </em>44 Va.App. 149, 153-54, 604 S.E.2d 88, 90 (2004) (citation omitted). Working from the statutory text, \u201cwe strive to give that language a \u2018literal construction\u2019 unless doing so \u2018would involve a manifest absurdity.\u2019\u201d <em>Cent. Va. Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology Assocs., P.C. v. Whitfield, </em>42 Va.App. 264, 276, 590 S.E.2d 631, 638 (2004) (citation omitted). By literal, we mean the words \u201cshould be given their \u2018common, ordinary and accepted\u2019 \u201d understanding. <em>Meador, </em>44 Va.App. at 154, 604 S.E.2d at 91 (citation omitted). This textualist approach presumes the legislature \u201c \u2018chose, with care,\u2019 the specific words of the statute.\u201d <em>Kane v. Szymczak, </em>41 Va.App. 365, 371, 585 S.E.2d 349, 352-53 (2003) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Guided by these principles, I would hold that Code \u00a7 65.2-804(B) means just what it says: An insurer must notify the employer and commission only when the policy has been cancelled or nonrenewed \u201cby the insurer.\u201d That did not happen here. Travelers did nothing to nonrenew either of the two policies at issue in this consolidated appeal. Just the opposite is true. Travelers timely offered the employers the opportunity to renew, but both failed to do so. The policies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>were nonrenewed solely by the actions or inactions of the employers, not the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Under generally accepted principles of insurance law, extended coverage cannot be judicially imposed on an insurer that expressly \u201coffered a renewal but the insureds permitted the policy to expire on its own terms.\u201d 3 Eric Mills Holmes, <em>Appleman on Insurance </em>\u00a7 16.5, at 321 (2d ed.1998). \u201cThe statutory notice requirement applies only to policies that are not renewed <em>by the insurer </em>and not those which are not renewed <em>by the insured.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). Notice statutes may not extend coverage when the insured knew the policy \u201cwas about to expire well before the expiration date but failed to renew the policy by paying or tendering the premium.\u201d 2 Lee R. Russ &amp; Thomas F. Segalla, <em>Couch on Insurance </em>\u00a7 29:8, at 29-14 (3d ed.1995). When an insurer offers to renew and the insured fails to take the necessary steps to accept the offer, the policy has been nonrenewed by the insured, not \u201cby the insurer.\u201d <em>Axson v. A. Mortgage Co., Inc., </em>312 S.C. 433, 441 S.E.2d 193, 194, <em>aff'd, </em>316 S.C. 253, 449 S.E.2d 491 (1994). In my opinion, this generally accepted view is the most natural reading of the by-the-insurer qualification to the notice requirement of Code \u00a7 65.2-804(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The commission adopted a contrary view on the premise that the phrase \u201cby the insurer\u201d was ambiguous. The commission resolved this ambiguity by construing the phrase \u201cby the insurer\u201d to apply to <em>all </em>nonrenewals\u2014whether caused by the insurer or by the employer. \u201cWe believe this to be the most reasonable approach,\u201d the commission reasoned, \u201cbecause it is the insurer who performs the final act of issuing or not issuing the policy.\u201d After all, the commission observed, \u201cultimately control over renewal and nonrenewal is with the insurer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">I cannot concur with this reasoning. Renewing a policy is a bilateral act of both contracting parties. Together the insured and insurer must agree to extend the expiration date of the existing policy or to substitute in its place a new policy beginning upon the expiration of the old one. Absent a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>contrary provision in the policy, \u201cneither party has any right to require a renewal\u201d and \u201cneither is bound to renew the contract.\u201d Russ &amp; Segalla, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 29:5, at 29-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">In contrast, a nonrenewal of a policy can be (and usually is) a wholly unilateral act by one of the two contracting parties. The failure of either party to agree dooms a renewal. The nonrenewal decision, therefore, is not within the ultimate control of the insurer any more than it is in the ultimate control of the insured. Thus, when \u201cthe insurer has clearly manifested its willingness to renew a policy but the insured failed to accept the offer in a timely manner, the policy will lapse upon the expiration of the policy period.\u201d Holmes, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 16.5, at 321. When this occurs, the policy is nonrenewed <em>by the insured. </em>A nonrenewal by the insured does not require, as the commission reasoned, some \u201cfinal act\u201d by the insurer. It requires no act at all by the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">In defense of the commission\u2019s interpretation, the appellees argue that a literal reading of \u201cby the insurer\u201d undermines the overriding statutory policy of ensuring that adequate insurance funds always remain available for employees with legitimate claims. Though the point seems to me overstated,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>1 see no need to engage it directly. In Virginia, \u201cwhen a statutory text speaks clearly on a subject, \u2018effect must be given to it regardless of what courts think of its wisdom or policy.\u2019 \u201d <em>South v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 247, 251-52, 623 S.E.2d 419, 421 (2005) (quoting <em>Temple v. City of Petersburg, </em>182 Va. 418, 423, 29 S.E.2d 357, 358 (1944)), <em>remanded for resentencing, </em>272 Va. 1, 630 S.E.2d 318 (2006). \u201cWe can only administer the law as it is written.\u201d <em>Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund v. Wilson, </em>46 Va.App. 500, 506, 619 S.E.2d 476, 479 (2005) (citation omitted). \u201cWhether it \u2018may or may not be better public policy\u2019 to do otherwise, \u2018such judgments are not ours to make.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Along the same lines, the meaning of the statute cannot be judicially expanded \u201csimply because it may seem to us that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>similar policy applies, or upon the speculation that if the legislature had thought of it, very likely broader words would have been used.\u201d <em>Franklin &amp; Pittsylvania Ry. Co. v. Shoemaker, </em>156 Va. 619, 624, 159 S.E. 100, 102 (1931) (quoting <em>McBoyle v. United States, </em>283 U.S. 25, 27, 51 S.Ct. 340, 75 L.Ed. 816 (1931) (Holmes, J.)). For me, the \u201cquestion here is not what the legislature intended to enact, but what is the meaning of that which it did enact. We must determine the legislative intent by what the statute says and not by what we think it should have said.\u201d <em>South, </em>47 Va.App. at 252, 623 S.E.2d at 421 (quoting <em>Carter v. Nelms, </em>204 Va. 338, 346, 131 S.E.2d 401, 406 (1963)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">That said, I acknowledge that literalism has its limits. While undisturbed by the . mere banter of policy debates, a literal reading of a statute should not be adopted when \u201cdoing so \u2018would involve a manifest absurdity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Meador, </em>44 Va.App. at 154, 604 S.E.2d at 91 (citation omitted). In this case, however, I see nothing absurd about the General Assembly\u2019s decision to limit the insurer\u2019s notification duty to nonrenewals \u201cby the insurer.\u201d The employer needs no notice of nonrenewals \u201cby the employer.\u201d Nor does the commission. Code \u00a7 65.2-804(A) requires the employer to report annually on insurance coverage. The required filing specifically alerts the commission to the policy expiration date. Unlike a cancellation, which can occur any time, a nonrenewal takes place at the end of the policy term. An employer\u2019s failure to renew a policy, therefore, is something the commission could know from NCCI records the day after the previously announced expiration of the earlier year\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">It is true, as the commission points out, that an employer might misread the insurer\u2019s initial notice offering to renew the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>policy and mistakenly believe it need not respond to the offer for the renewal to take place. Under such circumstances, a final notice of nonrenewal by the insurer to the employer may prompt the employer to discover its mistake and cause it to correct the problem before a lapse in coverage occurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">This hypothesis, however, falters even under the commission\u2019s interpretation of Code \u00a7 65.2-804(B). As was true for both Travelers policies at issue here, an insurer\u2019s offer to renew can usually be accepted by the employer at any time prior to the expiration of the policy term. The insurer would not know whether the offer has been accepted until the last day. A subsection (B) notice of nonrenewal must be made 80 days <em>prior </em>to the expiration of the policy term. The only way an insurer could file the notice on time\u2014while still giving the employer its right to accept the renewal offer up until the last day\u2014is to do something the statute nowhere contemplates, much less permits: to notify the commission and employer of a <em>potential </em>nonrenewal of the policy, which may or may not become an <em>actual </em>nonrenewal depending on what happens over the course of the last month of the policy term.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Because Travelers did not violate Code \u00a7 65.2-804(B), I believe the commission erred in ordering the two Travelers policies in this case to remain in effect past their expiration dates for purposes of providing coverage for the two disputed injuries. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b325-5\">. Funded by \"taxes levied upon insurers,\" <em>Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund v.
