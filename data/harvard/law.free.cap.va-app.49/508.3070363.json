For the following reasons, we disagree, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">\u201cOn appeal, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987). So viewed, the evidence established the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">On July 4, 2005, at about ten o\u2019clock p.m., a concerned citizen reported \u201csuspicious activity\u201d occurring in the parking lot of a Walgreen\u2019s pharmacy. Officer Newman (\u201cNewman\u201d) of the Portsmouth Police Department responded to the call, and observed Gilliam riding his bicycle through the parking lot. Newman approached Gilliam and identified himself. Gilliam immediately jumped off his bike, approached Newman, and reached into his pocket and removed his identification card.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">Newman observed that Gilliam seemed \u201cunsteady on his feet,\u201d and was \u201cslightly agitated\u201d during the encounter. His eyes were \u201cglassy and bloodshot,\u201d and he had a strong \u201codor of alcoholic beverage coming from his person.\u201d Newman talked with Gilliam, and during the conversation, Gilliam\u2019s voice became increasingly loud, and he became more agitated. Newman twice asked Gilliam if he had \u201cany weapons on him,\u201d and both times, Gilliam responded that he did not. Eventually, Newman placed Gilliam in custody for public intoxication. Newman then conducted a search incident to arrest, and found a \u201clong black-handled knife\u201d with a sheath in Gilliam\u2019s back pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">On August 26, 2005, a grand jury indicted Gilliam for carrying a concealed weapon after having been convicted of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>felony, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. On December 13, 2005, finding that it was \u201cbound by the opinion and the description that\u2019s been handed up [ ] in the <em>Richards </em>case,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the trial court convicted Gilliam of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. The trial court sentenced Gilliam to serve three years in prison, with two years and two months suspended.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Gilliam now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Gilliam contends that the knife he was carrying is not proscribed by Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 and, thus, the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A) provides, in part, that it is unlawful for \u201cany person\u201d to carry \u201cabout his person, hidden from common observation ... any dirk, bowie knife, switchblade knife, ballistic knife, machete, razor\u201d or \u201cany weapon of like kind as those enumerated in this subsection.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 further provides that it is a Class 6 felony for a previously convicted felon \u201cto knowingly and intentionally carry about his person, hidden from common observation, any weapon described in subsection A of \u00a7 18.2-308.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A) enumerates certain items that are clearly proscribed by the statute. <em>See Farrakhan v. Commonwealth, </em>273 Va. 177, 639 S.E.2d 227 (2007).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If the item in question meets the definition of an enumerated item -within Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A), the evidence is clearly sufficient for a conviction under the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 182, 639 S.E.2d at 230. If the item in question \u201cis not enumerated, concealment of the item may be proscribed by Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A) if it is a \u201cweapon of like kind.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">\u201c[I]n order to be a \u201cweapon\u2019 within the definition of \u201cweapon of like kind,\u2019 the item must be designed for fighting purposes or commonly understood to be a \u201cweapon.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Once the item is determined to be a weapon, it must then be determined if the item possesses similar characteristics to the enumerated items in Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A), thus, making its concealment prohibited. <em>Id. </em>These are questions of fact, which we can overturn only if \u201cplainly wrong,\u201d or \u201cwithout [supporting] evidence.\u201d <em>Ohin v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 194, 199-200, 622 S.E.2d 784, 786-87 (2005) (citing Code \u00a7 8.01-680); <em>see also Delcid v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 14, 17, 526 S.E.2d 273, 274 (2000) (holding that the question whether a particular knife is a \u201cweapon of like kind\u201d is \u201ca question of fact to be determined by the trier of fact\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">In this case, Newman testified that the item in question was a \u201clong black-handled knife.\u201d The trial court made no specific findings of fact stating only that, \u201cI am bound by the opinion and the description that\u2019s been handed up to me in the <em>Richards </em>case.\u201d However, the trial court never enunciated which description in <em>Richards </em>provided the basis for its finding of guilt. Regardless, on appeal, if there are facts to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the knife is either one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>of the enumerated items within the statute, or a \u201cweapon of like kind,\u201d we are bound by that conclusion. <em>See Delcid, </em>32 Va.App. at 17, 526 S.E.2d at 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">In this case, the knife is not a bowie knife or a dirk, as defined by this Court,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> nor is it any of the other enumerated items. Thus, we must determine if this knife falls into the category of \u201cweapon of like kind.\u201d We hold that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">To be a \u201cweapon of like kind,\u201d the knife must first be a weapon. <em>Farrakhan, </em>273 Va. at 182, 639 S.E.2d at 230; <em>see also Delcid, </em>32 Va.App. at 17, 526 S.E.2d at 275. Generally, a weapon is \u201c[a]n instrument of offensive or defensive combat: something to fight with.\u201d <em>Delcid, </em>32 Va.App. at 18, 526 S.E.2d at 275 (citing <em>Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary </em>1326 (1977)). Because a bladed instrument may be \u201cpossessed and used for non-aggressive as well as aggressive purposes,\u201d determining whether the knife \u201cis an implement or a weapon requires consideration not only of the physical character of the instrument itself, but also of the circumstances surrounding its possession and use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19, 526 S.E.2d at 275. Although the purpose for carrying the knife is irrelevant under Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-308(A) and 18.2-308.2, \u201cthat purpose is one of the defining characteristics of the item in question.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Here, as shown, the knife in question has a 6-inch blade and a 5/\u00a3-inch handle. The blade has one dull, straight edge, and one sharp edge. Both edges come to a sharp point. The knife contains the inscription \u201cMCR-11 Handmade\u201d on one side, and \u201cTaylor/Seto Surgical Japan\u201d on the other. The knife does not fold to cover the blade. Rather, a leather sheath protects the blade. The knife is clearly not an \u201cinnocuous household [knife or an] industrial kni[fe] which may be carried for legitimate purposes.\u201d <em>Richards, </em>18 Va.App. at 246 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>n. 2, 448 S.E.2d at 179 n. 2. Nor is it an implement possessed for \u201cnon-aggressive\u201d purposes. <em>See generally Delcid, </em>32 Va. App. at 19, 526 S.E.2d at 275. Moreover, Gilliam did not possess this item during the day at a job site. Instead, the knife was found in his possession after he was arrested for public intoxication around ten o\u2019clock at night.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> And although Gilliam testified that he used the knife for construction, the trial court found this testimony incredible. Thus, we hold that there is sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that the knife in question is a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Because we hold that the knife is a weapon, we must now determine if the knife has similar characteristics to those items enumerated in Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A). <em>See Farrakhan, </em>273 Va. at 182, 639 S.E.2d at 230. We hold that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">Here, although the knife\u2019s blade does not have the distinctive shape of the bowie knife\u2014that is, a slight dip in the dull, upper portion of the blade\u2014the knife has other similar characteristics of the bowie knife. Specifically, it has \u201ca single sharp <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>edge, a dull ... flat edge and a point.\u201d <em>Richards, </em>18 Va.App. at 246 n. 2, 443 S.E.2d at 179 n. 2. It also has a substantial hilt with a notch designed to prevent the hand from slipping onto the blade.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Gilliam argues that although some of the characteristics may be similar, bowie knives are usually longer than the knife in question. Gilliam therefore contends there are not enough similar characteristics of the bowie knife to bring this particular knife within the ambit of the statute. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A) provides that any weapon \u201cof like kind\u201d to those enumerated in the statute are likewise prohibited under the statute. Generally, the word \u201clike\u201d is defined as \u201calike, similar, analogous, or comparable.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1310 (1993). It does not mean <em>\u201cexactly </em>like, or <em>identical </em>to.\u201d If the knife in question had all of the characteristics of a bowie knife as Gilliam suggests it must, it would actually be a bowie knife, and we would not need to reach the question of whether this was a knife of \u201clike kind.\u201d In other words, the statute contemplates that some \u201cweapons\u201d will resemble those specifically delineated in the statute, but will in fact have some different characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">That is exactly what we have in this case. Although the knife is clearly not a bowie knife, it has many similar characteristics of one. In other words, it is \u201ccomparable\u201d to the bowie knife. Accordingly, we hold that the evidence was sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the knife has similar characteristics to those proscribed by Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">Having met the two-part test as set forth in <em>Farrakhan, </em>we hold that the evidence was sufficient to support Gilliam\u2019s conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-308. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b556-15\">. Code 18.2-308.2 states, in pertinent part, that \"[i]t shall be unlawful for [] any person who has been convicted of a felony ... to knowingly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>and intentionally carry about his person, hidden from common observation, any weapon described in subsection A of \u00a7 18.2-308.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b558-8\">. In <em>Richards v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 242, 245, 443 S.E.2d 177, 178 (1994), the trial court convicted Richards of carrying a concealed weapon, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308. The trial court found that Richards' knife was a \"spring knife\u201d and that the handle of the knife was deceptive in its appearance so as to disguise the true nature of the knife, thereby rendering it concealed under the statute. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, this Court held that the trial court erred in finding that the weapon was a \"spring knife.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 245, 443 S.E.2d at 179. In fact, this Court held that the blade resembled a dirk. <em>Id. </em>at 246, 443 S.E.2d at 179. And because the weapon, from common observation, was just as it appeared, this Court held that it was not of such a deceptive appearance as to disguise its true nature. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, this Court reversed Richards\u2019 conviction, holding that Richards did not conceal the weapon, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b558-9\">. The trial court never made any specific findings of fact as to the characteristics of the knife. Essentially, the only description on record, aside from the Commonwealth\u2019s closing argument, comes from Newman\u2019s testimony that it was a \"long black-handled knife.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b559-7\">. In <em>Farrakhan, </em>the Virginia Supreme Court found that a kitchen knife, with a blade sharpened on one side and a handle below, was not a \u201cweapon\u201d because \"it [was] not designed for fighting purposes nor [was] it commonly understood to be a 'weapon.\u2019 \u201d <em>Farrakhan, </em>273 Va. at 183, 639 S.E.2d at 230. The Court did not reach the issue of whether the knife was one of \u201clike kind,\" as it held that the knife was not a weapon.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b560-8\">. A \"dirk\u201d or weapon ... is any stabbing weapon having two sharp edges and a point, including daggers, short swords and stilettos.
