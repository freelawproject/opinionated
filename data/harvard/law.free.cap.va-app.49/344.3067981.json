BENTON, JR., Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">The trial judge convicted Luther Lee Wise of obstructing justice in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2\u2014160(C). Wise contends Code \u00a7 18.2-460(C) is unconstitutional, in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, both facially and as applied to him. We hold the statute is not constitutionally infirm, and we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">A grand jury indicted Wise for felony obstruction of justice, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-160(C). In pertinent part, this subsection of the statute provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-12\">If any person by threats of bodily harm ... knowingly attempts to intimidate or impede a judge, magistrate, justice, juror, witness, or any law-enforcement officer, lawfully engaged in the discharge of his duty ... relating to the violation of any violent felony offense listed in subsection C of [Code] \u00a7 17.1-805, he shall be guilty of a Class 5 felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2S\">The indictment charged that Wise feloniously, by threats of bodily harm, knowingly attempted to intimidate or impede a law-enforcement officer engaged in the discharge of his duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-13\">In a motion to dismiss the indictment, Wise contended Code \u00a7 18.2-160(0 was overbroad and violated the First Amendment. The motion and supporting memorandum asserted, in part, that the statute criminalized mere words, infringed upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>a substantial amount of protected speech, and did not require the Commonwealth to \u201cprove that the words alleged to have been spoken by [Wise] intimidated or frightened the person to whom they were directed.\u201d The trial judge heard argument on the motion prior to trial and overruled the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The evidence at trial proved a police officer arrested Wise for breaking and entering a residence, a violent felony offense listed in Code \u00a7 17.1-805(0 and incorporated in Code \u00a7 18.2-460(C). After a magistrate denied bail to Wise, Wise asked the police officer if he could make a telephone call. When the officer told Wise he could do so at the jail, Wise responded \u201cGood. Because I\u2019m going to use it to have you dusted.\u201d The officer testified he questioned Wise about his statement and his intent. When the officer told Wise he would obtain a warrant for the threat, Wise then said he only intended to call the magistrate\u2019s office to have the officer terminated from his employment. Upon arriving at the jail, Wise said to the officer: \u201cThe first thing ... I\u2019m going to do when I get out is find you. I know where you live, or, I see you all the time in town. You\u2019re mine.\u201d Later, while in his cell, Wise said in the presence of another officer, \u201cI\u2019m going to stab that fucking cop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Wise testified he was intoxicated during the incident and did not recall his statements. When asked if he responded \u201cyes\u201d to the officer\u2019s inquiry about whether \u201cdusted\u201d meant \u201ckilled,\u201d Wise said he did not recall his response. The officer testified on rebuttal, however, that Wise said \u201cyes\u201d when the officer asked him if dusted \u201cmeant he was going to have [the officer] killed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">At the conclusion of the evidence, the trial judge found that Wise\u2019s testimony was not credible, that Wise was angry when he made the threats, and that Wise made threats of bodily harm to intimidate the officer in the performance of his duties. The trial judge, therefore, convicted Wise of the felony of obstructing justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Wise contends Code \u00a7 18.2-460(0 is facially unconstitutional in violation of the First Amendment because it is not narrowly tailored to avoid criminalizing constitutionally protected speech. He advances three specific arguments in support of this contention: (1) the statute \u201cis not limited ... to only words having a tendency to incite the listener to immediate violence\u201d and, thus, it contravenes the \u201cfighting words\u201d doctrine articulated in <em>Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, </em>315 U.S. 568, 62 S.Ct. 766, 86 L.Ed. 1031 (1942); (2) the statute\u2019s \u201cuse of the term \u2018threat\u2019 ... does not remove it from [infringing upon] the class of protected speech\u201d; and (3) the statute offends the First Amendment because it \u201cis limited to statements made to law enforcement.\u201d The Commonwealth argues Code \u00a7 18.2-460(C) is facially valid because it does not reach a substantial amount of constitutionally protected speech. We hold that the statute is not overbroad in contravention of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">(A)</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">\u201cAs a general rule, if there is no constitutional defect in the application of the statute to a litigant, he does not have standing to argue that it would be unconstitutional if applied ... in hypothetical situations ... [; however, the Supreme Court has recognized a] limited exception ... for statutes that broadly prohibit speech protected by the First Amendment.\u201d <em>Ulster County Court v. Allen, </em>442 U.S. 140, 155, 99 S.Ct. 2213, 2223, 60 L.Ed.2d 777 (1979) (citing <em>Broadrick v. Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. 601, 610-16, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 2914-18, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973)). \u201cThe Court has repeatedly held that such a statute may be challenged on its face even though a more narrowly drawn statute would be valid as applied to the party in the ease before it.\u201d <em>City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, </em>466 U.S. 789, 798-99, 104 S.Ct. 2118, 2125, 80 L.Ed.2d 772 (1984). To invoke this exception and to establish that Code \u00a7 18.2-460(C) is overly broad in violation of the First Amendment, Wise initially must show the statute \u201cpun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>ishes a \u2018substantial\u2019 amount of protected free speech, \u2018judged in relation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep.\u2019 \u201d <em>Virginia v. Hicks, </em>539 U.S. 113, 118-19, 123 S.Ct. 2191, 2196, 156 L.Ed.2d 148 (2003) (citation omitted). If the statute does not reach a substantial amount of constitutionally protected speech, Wise\u2019s overbreadth challenge fails. <em>Id.; Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 489, 494-95, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 1191, 71 L.Ed.2d 362 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Wise first contends the statute is unconstitutional \u201cbecause it is not limited in its application to only words having a tendency to incite the listener to immediate violence.\u201d In other words, he argues he cannot be punished under a statute that \u201ccriminalizes speech outside the bounds of the classic \u2018fighting words.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The Supreme Court long ago noted \u201cthat the right of free speech is not absolute at all times and under all circumstances.\u201d <em>Chaplinsky, </em>315 U.S. at 571, 62 S.Ct. at 769. Upholding a New Hampshire statute, the Court held states have the authority to punish \u201ccertain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech ... includ[ing] the lewd and obscene, the profane, the libelous, and the insulting or \u2018fighting\u2019 words\u2014those which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 571-72, 62 S.Ct. at 769 (footnote omitted). The Court did not hold, however, that those enumerated instances were exhaustive of the state\u2019s authority under the First Amendment. Indeed, as the following quotation demonstrates, the Supreme Court specifically referred to <em>Chaplinsky </em>when later recognizing another limited class of speech exempt from the protection of the First Amendment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">The protections afforded by the First Amendment ... are not absolute, and we have long recognized that the government may regulate certain categories of expression consistent with the Constitution. See, e.g., <em>Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, </em>315 U.S. 568, 571-572, 62 S.Ct. 766[, 769], 86 L.Ed. 1031 (1942) (\u201cThere are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and pun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>ishment of which has never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem\u201d). The First Amendment permits \u201crestrictions upon the content of speech in a few limited areas, which are \u2018of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality.\u2019 \u201d <em>R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, </em>[505 U.S. 377, 382-83, 112 S.Ct. 2538[, 2542-43], 120 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992)] (quoting <em>Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, supra, </em>at 572, 62 S.Ct. [at 769]).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">Thus, for example, a State may punish those words \u201cwhich by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.\u201d <em>Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, supra, </em>at 572, 62 S.Ct. [at 769]; see also <em>R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, supra, </em>at 383, 112 S.Ct. [at 2543] (listing limited areas where the First Amendment permits restrictions on the content of speech).... And the First Amendment also permits a State to ban a \u201ctrue threat.\u201d <em>Watts v. United States, </em>394 U.S. 705, 708, 89 S.Ct. 1399[, 1401], 22 L.Ed.2d 664 (1969) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted); accord, <em>R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, supra, </em>at 388, 112 S.Ct. [at 2546] (\u201c[T]hreats of violence are outside the First Amendment\u201d); <em>Madsen v. Women\u2019s Health Center, Inc., </em>512 U.S. 753, 774, 114 S.Ct. 2516, [2529], 129 L.Ed.2d 593 (1994); <em>Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network of Western N.Y., </em>519 U.S. 357, 373, 117 S.Ct. 855[, 865], 137 L.Ed.2d 1 (1997).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-6\"><em>Virginia v. Black, </em>538 U.S. 343, 358-59, 123 S.Ct. 1536, 1547-48, 155 L.Ed.2d 535 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">\u201c[T]hese areas of speech can, consistently with the First . Amendment, be regulated <em>because of their constitutionally proscribable content </em>(obscenity, defamation, etc.).\u201d <em>City of St. Paul, </em>505 U.S. at 383, 112 S.Ct. at 2543. In other words, speech that contains a threat of physical harm \u201cis independently proscribable\u201d under the First Amendment. <em>Madsen, </em>512 U.S. at 774, 114 S.Ct. at 2529. <em>See also NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., </em>458 U.S. 886, 916, 102 S.Ct. 3409, 3427, 73 L.Ed.2d 1215 (1982) (noting that \u201c[t]he First Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>ment does not protect violence\u201d); <em>Milk Wagon Drivers Union of Chicago, Local 753 v. Meadowmoor Dairies, Inc., </em>312 U.S. 287, 292-93, 61 S.Ct. 552, 554-55, 85 L.Ed. 836 (1941) (explaining the Constitution does not shelter speech that is made in the context of violence and that is indistinguishable from threats of harm). The speech proscribed by Code \u00a7 18.2-460(C) falls within this limited class because it encompasses only \u201cthreats of bodily harm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">We hold, therefore, Code \u00a7 18.2-460(0 is not unconstitutional merely because, as Wise argues, \u201cit criminalizes the utterance of words without a requirement that those words would incite an immediate breach of peace of the person to whom the words are directed.\u201d The \u201cfighting words\u201d doctrine of <em>Chaplinsky </em>is not the exclusive justification for the state\u2019s power to regulate expression. <em>Black, </em>538 U.S. at 359, 123 S.Ct. at 1547-48. Subsection C of Code \u00a7 18.2-460 extends to speech only when it contains threats of bodily harm. <em>See City of St. Paul, </em>505 U.S. at 388, 112 S.Ct. at 2546 (noting that \u201cthreats of violence are outside the First Amendment\u201d). For these reasons, we reject Wise\u2019s assertion that merely \u201c[b]e-cause the statute criminalizes speech outside the bounds of the classic \u2018fighting words\u2019 it is overly broad and violates the First Amendment.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>Wise also contends \u201cthe use of the term \u2018threat\u2019 in [Code \u00a7 ]18.2-460(C) does not remove it from [infringing upon] the class of protected speech.\u201d He argues the Supreme Court\u2019s reference in <em>Chaplinsky </em>to \u201cthreatening ... revilings\u201d as unprotected speech, 315 U.S. at 573, 62 S.Ct. at 770, was \u201cdicta,\u201d and he argues, in any event, the \u201cCourt was using the term \u2018threats\u2019 to refer to words, which like \u2018fighting words\u2019 are of a type which, by their very nature, will provoke violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Wise\u2019s argument is grounded in the premise that threats, just as fighting words, are exempt from First Amendment protection only when they \u201chave the \u2018characteristic of plainly tending to excite the addressee to a breach of the peace.\u2019 \u201d Approving New Hampshire\u2019s construction of its statute, the <em>Chaplinsky </em>decision recognized the statute did \u201cno more than prohibit ... \u2018classical fighting words,\u2019 words in current use less \u2018classical\u2019 but equally likely to cause violence, ... including ... threats.\u201d 315 U.S. at 573, 62 S.Ct. at 770. As we have earlier explained, the Supreme Court in <em>Black </em>was not limiting its holding to the <em>Chaplinsky </em>definitions but, rather, referred to \u201cfighting words\u201d and \u201ctrue threats\u201d as distinct, separate exemptions from First Amendment protections. <em>Black, </em>538 U.S. at 359, 123 S.Ct. at 1547-48. The Court explained this latter <em>category of </em>speech as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">\u201cTrue threats\u201d encompass those statements where the speaker means to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals. See <em>Watts v. United States, supra, </em>at 708, 89 S.Ct. [at 1401] (\u201cpolitical hyberbole\u201d is not a true threat); <em>R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, </em>505 U.S., at 388, 112 S.Ct. [at 2546]. The speaker need not actually intend to carry out the threat. Rather, a prohibition on true threats \u201cprotects] individuals from the fear of violence\u201d and \u201cfrom the disruption that fear engenders,\u201d in addition to protecting people \u201cfrom the possibility that the threatened violence will occur.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Intimidation in the constitutionally proscribable sense of the word is a type of true threat, where a speaker directs a threat to a person or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>group of persons with the intent of placing the victim in fear of bodily harm or death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 359-60, 123 S.Ct. at 1548.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Wise argues that \u201cthreats\u201d as proscribed in Code \u00a7 18.2-460(C) do not fall within this narrow category because the statute \u201cdoes not limit its application to face-to-face statements\u201d and does not encompass only words with the \u201cinnate ability to incite immediate violence.\u201d He further argues that our holding in <em>Polk v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 590, 358 S.E.2d 770 (1987), \u201c \u2018strips\u2019 the word \u2018threat\u2019 of its First Amendment exemption\u201d because it rendered the listener\u2019s response immaterial in a prosecution under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">We are mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that regulation of speech must be narrowly drawn.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-8\">The constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech forbid the States to punish the use of words or language not within \u201cnarrowly limited classes of speech.\u201d Even as to such a class, however, because \u201cthe line between speech unconditionally guaranteed and speech which may legitimately be regulated, suppressed, or punished is finely drawn,\u201d \u201c[i]n every case the power to regulate must be so exercised as not, in attaining a permissible end, unduly to infringe the protected freedom.\u201d In other words, the statute must be carefully drawn or be authoritatively construed to punish only unprotected speech and not be susceptible of application to protected expression. \u201cBecause First Amendment freedoms need breathing space to survive, government may regulate in the area only with narrow specificity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-9\"><em>Gooding, Warden v. Wilson, </em>405 U.S. 518, 521-22, 92 S.Ct. 1103, 1104, 31 L.Ed.2d 408 (1972) (citations omitted). Thus, the Court has held that \u201c[wjhat is a threat must be distinguished from what is constitutionally protected.\u201d <em>Watts, </em>394 U.S. at 706, 89 S.Ct. at 1400-01 (finding defendant\u2019s statement, \u201c[i]f they ever make me carry a rifle the first man I want to get in my sights is L.B.J.,\u201d was \u201cpolitical hyperbole,\u201d made during a public rally, and not a \u201ctrue threat\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Proscribable threats are threats that \u201cencompass those statements where the speaker means to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals.\u201d <em>Black, </em>538 U.S. at 359, 123 S.Ct. at 1548. Under this standard, the government is not required to prove an \u201capparent present ability to carry [the threat] out ... [because] a threat causes disruptions, inconveniences, and costs even if its maker is unable to carry through with it.\u201d <em>United States v. Fuller, </em>387 F.3d 643, 648 (7th Cir.2004). Indeed, the Supreme Court also has held that \u201c[t]he speaker need not actually intend to carry out the threat\u201d to be proscribable. <em>See Black, </em>538 U.S. at 359-60, 123 S.Ct. at 1548. \u201cThe reasons why threats of violence are outside the First Amendment ... [include] protecting individuals from the fear of violence, from the disruption that fear engenders, and from the possibility that the threatened violence will occur.\u201d <em>City of St. Paul, </em>505 U.S. at 388, 112 S.Ct. at 2546.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-460(C) satisfies these concerns because the only speech it proscribes is \u201cthreats of bodily harm.\u201d The plain language of Code \u00a7 18.2-460(C) indicates the legislature intended to proscribe knowing attempts to intimidate or impede individuals engaged in the operation of the legal system. In Virginia, \u201c[a] threat, in the criminal context, is recognized to be a communication avowing an intent to injure another\u2019s person or property.\u201d <em>Summerlin v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va. App. 288, 297, 557 S.E.2d 731, 736 (2002). Virginia courts must consider a communication in its particular context when determining whether a speaker\u2019s words constitute a true threat. <em>See DiMaio v. Commonwealth, </em>46 Va.App. 755, 767, 621 S.E.2d 696, 702 (2005), <em>aff'd, </em>272 Va. 504, 636 S.E.2d 456 (2006). In view of this requirement, the proscription against threats of bodily harm complies with <em>Watts </em>and its progeny. <em>See Watts, </em>394 U.S. at 708, 89 S.Ct. at 1401 (considering context in which threat was made, conditional nature of statement, and reaction of the listeners to determine whether defendant\u2019s statements were a \u201ctrue threat\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Lockhart, </em>382 F.3d 447, 451-52 (4th Cir.2004) (apply<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>ing <em>Watts </em>factors to determine whether appellant\u2019s statements constituted \u201ctrue threat\u201d); <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>865 F.2d 88, 85 (4th Cir.1989) (same). Our case decisions define the term \u201cthreat\u201d narrowly to avoid encompassing protected speech within its scope and, thus, Code \u00a7 18.2-460(C), proscribes only true threats.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The appellant in <em>Polk </em>challenged the sufficiency of the evidence against him, arguing words alone did not constitute a violation of former Code \u00a7 18.2-460(A). We rejected that argument and held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">The plain language of Code \u00a7 18.2-460(A) provides that <em>threats </em>constitute a violation of the statute when they are knowingly made in an attempt to intimidate or impede law enforcement officers who are performing their duties. Thus, it is the threats made by the offender, coupled with his intent, that constitute the offense. The resulting effect of the offender\u2019s threats, such as fear, apprehension, or delay, is not an element of the crime defined in Code \u00a7 18.2-460. By the express terms of the statute, it is immaterial whether the officer is placed in fear or apprehension. The offense is complete when the attempt to intimidate is made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-7\"><em>Polk, </em>4 Va.App. at 593-94, 358 S.E.2d at 772. Thus, we held that Polk\u2019s statement that he would kill the officer \u201cwas a threat as contemplated by the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 594, 358 S.E.2d at 772. This holding does not diverge from the <em>Watts </em>requirement that the state prove a \u201ctrue threat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">Wise further asserts that Code \u00a7 18.2-460(0 offends the First Amendment because of the class of individuals it seeks to protect. He argues that criminalizing threats made against a \u201csubpopulation of the at-large community\u201d is troubling for two reasons: first, persons such as law enforcement officers \u201cmay be less likely than other citizens to react with violence to certain threats because of their training and experience\u201d; second, the provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-460(0 do not propose a unique and compelling reason to protect the individuals identified in the statute. He argues the select class of individuals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>identified in the statute \u201cserves to reinforce the notion that this section is not designed to prevent violence, the threat of violence, or the fear of violence, but merely to criminalize the utterance of words directed at a selected audience.\u201d These arguments have no merit.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-5\">[The Supreme Court of Virginia has] previously described the public policy underlying the obstruction of justice statute as reflecting \u201cthe General Assembly\u2019s intent to prohibit interference with the administration of justice\u201d and [to] proteet[ ] \u201cthe public\u2019s safety and welfare.\u201d <em>City of Virginia Beach v. </em>Harris, 259 Va. 220, 233, 523 S.E.2d 239, 246 (2000). The goal of this policy is not to protect individuals from intimidation, but to protect the public from a flawed legal system due to impaired prosecution of criminals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AzQ\"><em>Rowan v. Tractor Supply Co., </em>263 Va. 209, 215, 559 S.E.2d 709, 712 (2002). Under Code \u00a7 18.2-460(C), \u201c[d]ifferential treatment of threats against [law enforcement officers] ... selects nothing but special risks, not special messages.\u201d <em>Black, </em>538 U.S. at 384, 123 S.Ct. at 1560 (Souter, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Wise relies on <em>Marttila v. City of Lynchburg, </em>33 Va.App. 592, 535 S.E.2d 693 (2000), in support of his assertion. In <em>Marttila, </em>the appellant challenged his conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-16, Virginia\u2019s breach of peace statute, which criminalizes \u201cfighting words.\u201d 33 Va.App. at 598, 535 S.E.2d at 698. We recognized that when confronted with an individual\u2019s use of \u201cfighting words,\u201d police officers were required to exercise \u201cgreater restraint in their responses than the average citizen.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 600, 535 S.E.2d at 697. Code \u00a7 18.2-460(C) aims, however, to protect the integrity of the legal process, not any individual personally. Whether a speaker\u2019s words would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>provoke a law enforcement officer to a violent response is immaterial to the application and validity of Code \u00a7 18.2-460(C). <em>Martilla, </em>therefore, is distinguishable from the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">For these reasons, we hold that Code \u00a7 18.2-460(C) does not reach a substantial amount of constitutionally protected speech and is not facially violative of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Wise further contends Code \u00a7 18.2-460(0 is unconstitutional as applied to him because his statements, taken in context, do not rise to the level of \u201cfighting words.\u201d The Commonwealth responds that \u201cfighting words\u201d are not necessary for a conviction under the statute and Code \u00a7 18.2-460(C) \u201cis clearly and properly applicable\u201d to Wise\u2019s behavior. We agree with the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">According to the officer\u2019s testimony, Wise threatened to have him \u201cdusted.\u201d Wise said \u201cthe first thing I\u2019m going to do when I get out is find you. I know where you live, or, I see you all the time in town. You\u2019re mine.\u201d Later, Wise was heard to say, \u201cI\u2019m going to stab that fucking cop.\u201d The trial judge found that Wise\u2019s testimony was \u201cnot credible\u201d and that this evidence proved Wise meant he \u201cwas going to have [the officer] killed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">The First Amendment is not implicated in this case because Wise made a threat of bodily harm within the meaning of the statute. This was not a situation involving hyperbole analogous to <em>Watts </em>and the context does not otherwise indicate Wise was making a political statement. The trial judge found the evidence, in context, proved Wise intended to intimidate the officer by threatening physical harm. <em>See Selph v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 426, 433-35, 632 S.E.2d 24, 27-28 (2006) (holding intent to intimidate or threaten may be proved by circumstantial evidence, such as one\u2019s conduct or statements). <em>See also Crawley v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 372, 375, 512 S.E.2d 169, 170 (1999) (\u201ccredibility of a witness, the weight accorded the testimony, and the inferences to be drawn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>from proven facts are matters solely for the fact finder\u2019s determination\u201d). Wise\u2019s threats of bodily harm were precisely prohibited by Code \u00a7 18.2-460(0; they were \u201ctrue threats\u201d; and they were not protected speech. Therefore, his \u201cas applied\u201d challenge also fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">In summary, we hold Code \u00a7 18.2-460(0 is not constitutionally overbroad and is not unconstitutional as applied to the facts of this case. For these reasons, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b398-6\">. Wise relies upon <em>City of Houston v.
