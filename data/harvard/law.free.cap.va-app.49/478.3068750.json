FRANK, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Frederick C. Klein, husband, appeals from an order of the Arlington County Circuit Court granting the motion of Karen N.E. Klein, wife, to strike husband\u2019s evidence as to the basis of calculating a management fee owed to husband under the terms of a settlement agreement. On appeal, husband contends that: (1) the trial court erred in granting wife\u2019s motion to strike as husband\u2019s evidence was sufficient to \u201ccalculate the amount due,\u201d (2) the trial court erred in limiting the testimony of husband\u2019s witness, (3) the trial court erred in determining that the figures provided by husband were \u201chighly questionable\u201d and in determining that husband did not provide certain records to wife, and (4) the trial court erred in not offering an explanation for its interpretation of an order entered by another court. For the reasons stated, we dismiss husband\u2019s appeal and remand the case to the trial court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">As to his first issue, husband cited two cases for the standard of review that applies to an appellate court\u2019s review of a motion to strike the evidence. Husband then argues that the trial court applied the wrong standard in ruling on the motion to strike. Husband limits his argument only to the trial court\u2019s application of the wrong standard; husband presents no argument or authority that addresses the substantive issue of his first question presented, namely that husband presented sufficient evidence for the trial court to calculate the amount of the management fee due to husband. Further, husband did not include in his questions presented the issue of whether the trial court applied the incorrect standard in ruling on the motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">Husband asks us to find that a question presented as to the sufficiency of the evidence preserves for appeal an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>argument as to the trial court\u2019s application of an incorrect standard on a <em>motion to </em>strike. We decline to do so. Sufficiency of the evidence and the applicable standard for evaluating the evidence, while interrelated, are wholly separate concepts under our law. <em>See United States v. Alerre, </em>430 F.3d 681, 691 (4th Cir.2005) (considering appellant\u2019s argument that his guilty verdict must be set aside because the trial court referred to an erroneous standard of proof, despite the fact that appellant conceded the sufficiency of the evidence), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1925, 164 L.Ed.2d 667 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The standard for reviewing a plaintiff\u2019s evidence on a motion to strike evaluates whether plaintiff has made a <em>prima facie </em>case; that is, accepting plaintiffs evidence as true and granting to it all reasonable inferences that can be derived therefrom, the trial court must determine whether it is \u201c \u2018conclusively apparent that plaintiff has proven no cause of action against defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams v. Vaughan, </em>214 Va. 307, 309, 199 S.E.2d 515, 517 (1973) (quoting <em>Leath v. Richmond, Fredericksburg &amp; Potomac R.R. Co., </em>162 Va. 705, 710, 174 S.E. 678, 680 (1934)). Sufficiency of the evidence refers to whether the evidence presented by a party meets this particular standard. Thus, the standard of review on a motion to strike is the yardstick by which the sufficiency of the evidence is measured. <em>See Richmond Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. v. Carter, </em>28 Va.App. 494, 497-98, 507 S.E.2d 87, 88 (1998) (\u201cIf the trier of fact is not informed of the proper standard of proof, the trier of fact cannot appropriately assess whether the party with the burden of proof has met the applicable risk of persuasion borne by that party.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Where, as here, husband alleges error in the trial court\u2019s finding of sufficiency in his question presented, but argues only the trial court\u2019s application of the incorrect standard by which to measure sufficiency on a motion to strike, husband has not preserved either argument for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Husband\u2019s argument as to the incorrect standard was not included in husband\u2019s questions presented; thus, we will not consider it on appeal. Rule 5A:20; <em>Hillcrest Manor </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number><em>Nursing Home v. Underwood, 35 </em>Va.App. 31, 39 n. 4, 542 S.E.2d 785, 789 n. 4 (2001) (finding that \u201can issue [was] not <em>expressly </em>stated among the \u2018questions presented,\u2019 ... we, therefore, decline to consider [it] on appeal\u201d (emphasis added)). Further, husband provides no argument or authority to support his contention that the evidence he presented was sufficient to survive wife\u2019s motion to strike. \u201cStatements unsupported by argument, authority, or citations to the record do not merit appellate consideration. We will not search the record for errors in order to interpret the appellant\u2019s contention and correct deficiencies in a brief.\u201d <em>Buchanan v. Buchanan, </em>14 Va.App. 53, 56, 415 S.E.2d 237, 239 (1992). Rule 5A:20(e) bars us from addressing any issues unsupported by authority. <em>Epps v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 687, 718, 626 S.E.2d 912, 926 (2006) <em>(en banc), aff'd, </em>\u2014 Va. -, 641 S.E.2d 77 (Mar. 2, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">Regarding the remaining three questions presented, husband cites no cases to support his arguments.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> By failing to cite any authority in support of these arguments in his brief, husband has violated the provisions of Rule 5A:20(e). <em>See Buchanan, </em>14 Va.App. at 56, 415 S.E.2d at 239. Therefore, we do not address the merits of the issues raised by husband on appeal. <em>See Epps, </em>47 Va.App. at 718, 626 S.E.2d at 926.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">Husband also seeks an award of his appellate attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. However, he offers no reason to require wife to pay any of his appellate expenses. Because nothing in the record indicates wife \u201cgenerated unnecessary delay or expense in pursuit of [her] interests\u201d in defending this appeal, <em>Estate of Hackler v. Hackler, </em>44 Va.App. 51, 75, 602 S.E.2d 426, 438 (2004), we deny husband\u2019s request for appellate attorneys\u2019 fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>and costs. <em>See O\u2019Loughlin v. O\u2019Loughlin, </em>23 Va.App. 690, 695, 479 S.E.2d 98, 100 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Wife requests an award of her appellate attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. As husband\u2019s case on appeal lacks merit, we grant wife\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. <em>Miller v. Cox, </em>44 Va.App. 674, 688-89, 607 S.E.2d 126, 133 (2005) (holding that when the appellate court determines that an appeal lacks merit, the case is remanded to the trial court to award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees incurred while defending the appeal). Accordingly, we remand this case to the trial court for it to determine and enter an appropriate award of appellate attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in favor of wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">\n<em>Dismissed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b526-9\">. We need not recite the facts of the case since we do not address the merits of husband\u2019s arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b528-9\">. Husband also argues that the trial court should recuse itself from hearing this matter on remand, \"as the record below raises questions as to whether [the trial court] is able to provide [husband] with an impartial hearing in this matter.\u201d Husband cites no authority for this proposition, nor did he include the matter in his questions presented. As such, we will not consider it on appeal. Rule 5A:20.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
