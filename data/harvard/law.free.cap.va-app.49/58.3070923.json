PETTY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Nicholas Everette Wright, appellant, was convicted of first-degree murder in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-32, pursuant to a guilty plea and a plea agreement. On appeal, he contends the trial court erred by imposing a three-year period of post-release supervision that appellant asserts was not included in the terms of the plea agreement. We disagree and affirm the sentence imposed by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">A grand jury indicted Wright for capital murder in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-31 (4). On June 17, 2005, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney and Wright entered into a plea agreement. The agreement provided: (1) the Commonwealth would amend the capital murder charge to first-degree murder; (2) Wright would plead guilty to first-degree murder; (3) Wright would be sentenced to imprisonment for life; (4) Wright would acknowledge that he violated the terms of his parole on three previous drug-related charges; and (5) Wright would be sentenced to serve the previously suspended concurrent sentences of five years on each of the drug charges, to run consecutively to the life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">The trial court entered the sentencing order on August 16, 2005. In addition to the terms of the plea agreement as set forth above, the court sentenced Wright to \u201can additional three (3) year sentence which the Court re-suspended for a period of post-release supervision should the Defendant ever be admitted to any form of probation or parole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Wright objected to the sentence, arguing Rule 3A:8(c)(l)(C) prohibited the trial court from adding the three-year suspended sentence and period of post-release supervision. The trial court held that the post-release supervision was required by statute and is necessarily incorporated into any plea agreement. Wright did not move to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">We are called upon to determine whether the trial court correctly applied Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-10(g) and 19.2-295.2 when it imposed a sentence in addition to that set forth in the plea agreement. \u201cIn determining whether the trial court made an error of law, we review the trial court\u2019s statutory interpretations and legal conclusions <em>de novo.\u201d Rollins v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 73, 79, 554 S.E.2d 99, 102 (2001) (citing <em>Timbers v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 187, 193, 503 S.E.2d 233, 236 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">Wright argues that Rule 3A:8(c)(l)(C) prohibited the trial court from imposing the additional three-year sentence. Rule 3A:8(c)(l)(C) provides that a defendant and the Commonwealth may enter into an agreement that establishes a specific sentence as \u201cthe appropriate disposition of the case.\u201d Rule 3A:8(c)(3) furthermore provides that, upon acceptance of the plea agreement, \u201cthe court shall inform the defendant that it will embody in its judgment and sentence the disposition provided for in the agreement.\u201d Wright, relying on contract law, contends the trial court erred when it accepted the plea agreement but then changed its terms by imposing a sentence greater than that agreed upon by the parties.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Wright\u2019s contract argument fails to recognize the \u201cbasic rule\u201d of contract law that \u201cthe law in force on the date a contract is formed determines the rights of its parties.\u201d <em>Esparza v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 600, 607, 513 S.E.2d 885, 888 (1999) (citing <em>Paul v. Paul, </em>214 Va. 651, 653, 203 S.E.2d 123, 125 (1974)). In <em>Esparza, </em>we determined that such basic rules of contract law apply to plea agreements. <em>Id. </em>The statutory provisions which Wright challenges, Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-10(g) and 19.2-295.2, apply to felonies committed on or after July 1, 2000, and were the law in effect at the time the plea agreement was formed. Thus, we hold the plea agreement necessarily included the suspended sentence and post-release supervision as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">This conclusion is well supported by both the rules of statutory construction and our prior decisions. In pertinent part, Code \u00a7 18.2-10(g) requires trial courts to \u201cimpose an additional term of not less than six months nor more than three years, which shall be suspended conditioned upon successful completion of a period of post-release supervision pursuant to \u00a7 19.2-295.2 and compliance with such other terms as the sentencing court may require\u201d in felony cases involving \u201can active term of incarceration in a correctional facility.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-295.2 requires trial courts to \u201cimpose a term of post-release supervision of not less than six months nor more than three years, as the court may determine\u201d when sentencing convicted felons to a term of imprisonment in a state or local correctional facility. The General Assembly\u2019s intent in enacting these mandatory sentencing statutes was to prevent the release of felons \u201cfrom incarceration into the community without having a minimum of six months\u2019 supervision\u201d after the abolition of parole in Virginia. <em>Lamb v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 52, 58, 577 S.E.2d 530, 532 (2003); <em>see also Allard v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 57, 67, 480 S.E.2d 139, 144 (1997) (\u201c \u2018[A] fundamental rule of statutory construction requires that courts view the entire body of legislation and the statutory scheme to determine the true intention of each part.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Virginia Real Estate Bd. v. Clay, </em>9 Va.App. 152, 157, 384 S.E.2d 622, 625 (1989))).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>Moreover, Virginia courts have specifically held that the mandatory post-release terms and supervision requirements of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-10 and 19.2-295.2 are to be read in conjunction with other sentencing statutes to give effect to the General Assembly\u2019s intent. Our Supreme Court rejected an appellant\u2019s argument that applying Code \u00a7 19.2-295.2 to a statutory maximum sentence increased the sentence beyond that allowed by law, holding that the post-release supervision provision must be read with the statute setting the sentence for the underlying offense, thus increasing the maximum allowable sentence. <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>270 Va. 580, 584, 621 S.E.2d 98, 100 (2005). Similarly, in <em>Boyd v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 537, 507 S.E.2d 107 (1998), we rejected an appellant\u2019s argument that the trial court\u2019s imposition of a suspended sentence and post-release supervision in addition to the sentence recommended by a jury violated his right to be sentenced by a jury. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There, we held that \u201cthe legislature intended the procedures outlined in Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 for the jury's ascertainment of punishment to be subject to ... the provisions of \u00a7 19.2-295.2, which permit the trial court to impose a suspended term of incarceration and post-release supervision when the jury\u2019s sentence includes an active term of incarceration____\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Boyd, </em>28 Va.App. at 542, 507 S.E.2d at 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Since both our prior decisions and the decisions of our Supreme Court establish that the mandatory language of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-10 and 19.2-295.2 increase maximum allowable sentences and apply to sentences recommended by a jury, we hold these provisions also apply to sentences imposed pursuant to a plea agreement. To do otherwise would ignore \u201c[t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>plain, obvious, and rational meaning of [the] statute[s]\u201d and require trial judges to disregard the mandatory provisions of the statutes when imposing sentence pursuant to a plea and create an anomaly in our sentencing procedures. <em>Branch v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 836, 839, 419 S.E.2d 422, 424 (1992). Finally, to hold that these provisions do not apply to felons who are sentenced in accordance with plea agreements would defeat the purpose of the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Wright also contends the trial court erred when it did not offer him the opportunity to withdraw his plea agreement after it imposed a sentence greater than he expected and had agreed upon. Wright did not move to withdraw his plea agreement and that issue was never before the trial court. Thus, we will not address the merits of this argument, as it was not properly preserved for appeal. Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">The trial court correctly applied Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-10 and 19.2-295.2. We therefore affirm its judgment and the sentence it imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b107-8\">. We also note that if Wright is released prior to the completion of his life sentence, it will be pursuant to the geriatric release provisions of Code \u00a7 53.1-40.01, and will therefore involve post-release supervision in any event. As a practical matter, the additional three-year post-release supervision imposed by the trial court pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-10 and 19.2-295.2 would not result in any addition to Wright's life sentence. However, as neither parly presented this argument, we do not consider it in deciding this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b109-8\">. Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 provides that, \"[i]n cases of trial by jury, upon a finding that the defendant is guilty of a felony ... a separate proceeding limited to the ascertainment of punishment shall be held as soon as practicable before the same jury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b109-9\">. The provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-10(g) and Code \u00a7 19.2-295.2 were discretionary in relation to felonies committed on or after January 1, 1995, and became mandatory in relation to felonies committed on or after July 1, 2000.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
