ARTHUR KELSEY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Baraka Bolden appeals his convictions on various drug and weapons charges. He argues the trial court abused its discretion in continuing the trial at the Commonwealth\u2019s request and in finding the evidence of guilt sufficient to convict. Concluding the trial court erred in neither respect, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">Under settled principles, we review the evidence in the \u201clight most favorable\u201d to the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth v. Hudson, </em>265 Va. 505, 514, 578 S.E.2d 781, 786 (2003). That principle requires us to \u201cdiscard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences to be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Parks v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 492, 498, 270 S.E.2d 755, 759 (1980) (emphasis and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">A police officer noticed Bolden sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of a vehicle improperly parked in a motel parking lot. As the officer walked over to investigate, both Bolden and his female passenger got out of the car. When the officer was within about five feet of Bolden, he saw Bolden drop brown rolling papers and a one-inch square zip-top bag. The officer looked at the bag and concluded it likely contained cocaine. He arrested and searched Bolden. The officer found on Bolden five individually wrapped bags of marijuana, $590, and a cellular phone. From the vehicle, the officer recovered a handgun in a blue, plastic grocery bag on the driver\u2019s seat next to the armrest. The officer also found in the vehicle a knapsack containing a bag of marijuana, various plastic bags, and a digital scale. A second digital scale was discovered on the floorboard.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>At trial, the arresting officer testified that the handgun was located in such a position that Bolden must have either been sitting on it or right beside it when he occupied the vehicle. The bag Bolden dropped on the ground contained cocaine, just as the arresting officer suspected. Another officer, testifying as a drug distribution expert, described the circumstances as inconsistent with mere drug possession. Each of the five bags of marijuana appeared to be packaged for street-level sales. In addition to the digital scales and plastic bags, the expert added, the immediate accessibility of a handgun likewise confirmed the drug distribution inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Finding these circumstances proved Bolden\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the trial court convicted him of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, Code \u00a7 18.2-248, possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, Code \u00a7 18.2-248.1, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> possession of a firearm while possessing illegal drugs, Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4, and possession of a concealed weapon, Code \u00a7 18.2-308.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The bench trial took place on October 19, 2005. It had been scheduled originally to go forward on October 3, but because the arresting officer was unavailable to testify, the trial court continued the case for trial on October 19. The trial court heard no evidence in the ease until October 19. Both on October 3 and 19, Bolden objected to the continuance on two grounds. He first argued that the officer, though under subpoena, was unavailable merely because of personal reasons. No continuance should be granted on this basis, Bolden contended. Second, Bolden noted that the Commonwealth filed its certificate of analysis of the drug evidence only five days before the original October 3 trial date, not seven days as required by Code \u00a7 19.2-187. The trial court found Bolden\u2019s first objection an insufficient reason to deny the requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>continuance and his second objection \u201cmoot\u201d given his ruling on the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">A. <em>Continuance of Trial Date</em></p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">When a criminal defendant argues on appeal that the trial court erred by denying his continuance motion or by granting the Commonwealth\u2019s, we apply a \u201ctwo-pronged test\u201d asking whether \u201cthe court abused its discretion\u201d and whether the defendant \u201cwas prejudiced by the court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Lebedun v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 697, 712-13, 501 S.E.2d 427, 434 (1998); <em>see also Silcox v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 509, 513, 528 S.E.2d 744, 746 (2000) (applying the \u201ctwo-pronged test\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">\u201cAbuse of discretion and prejudice to the complaining party are essential to reversal.\u201d <em>Butler v. Commonwealth, </em>264 Va. 614, 621, 570 S.E.2d 813, 817 (2002) (citations omitted). The absence of one renders inconsequential the presence of the other. <em>See Lowery v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 304, 307, 387 S.E.2d 508, 509-10 (1990) (finding no prejudice while assuming <em>arguendo </em>an abuse of discretion). We cannot reverse if the defendant \u201chas shown no prejudice resulting from what he claims was an abuse of discretion\u201d in granting or denying a continuance motion. <em>Quintana v. Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 127, 135, 295 S.E.2d 643, 646 (1982). Prejudice, moreover, \u201cmay not be presumed; it must appear from the record.\u201d <em>Lowery, </em>9 Va.App. at 307, 387 S.E.2d at 510 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">In this case, we need not address Bolden\u2019s abuse-of-discretion argument because we find no merit in his claim of prejudice. Citing <em>Bottoms v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 466, 457 S.E.2d 796 (1995), Bolden lays out his theory of prejudice this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-9\">The results [of the continuance] were harmful to the appellant, given that section 19.2-187 mandates strict compliance. On October 3, 2005 that section had not been complied with, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>as counsel had not received a copy of the certificate of analysis seven days prior to trial, nor had it been filed with the Clerk, seven days prior to trial, and there had been a proper request of the same. A continuance could not have been awarded, and cannot be a remedy for non-compliance with section 19.2-187.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Appellant\u2019s Br. at 13. This prejudice argument, however, assumes its conclusion: a violation of Code \u00a7 19.2-187 sufficient to trigger the exclusionary rule of <em>Bottoms.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Construing Code \u00a7 19.2-187 \u201cstrictly against the Commonwealth,\u201d <em>Bottoms </em>held that granting \u201ca continuance of any length <em>after the trial had begun\u201d </em>would not remedy the Commonwealth\u2019s untimely filing of a certificate of analysis and would render it inadmissible at trial. <em>Bottoms, </em>20 Va.App. at 469, 457 S.E.2d at 797 (emphasis added). For most purposes, however, a bench trial begins when the trial court starts to hear evidence. At that point, a bench trial commences for double jeopardy purposes and likewise triggers the timing of the speedy trial statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We see no reason why the same principle should not also govern the commencement of bench trials for purposes of Code \u00a7 19.2-187\u2019s pretrial disclosure requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Bolden\u2019s trial, therefore, did not begin on October 3. It began on October 19, more than seven days after the certificate was filed. Consequently, the trial court did not grant a continuance \u201cafter trial had begun,\u201d <em>Bottoms, </em>20 Va.App. at 469, 457 S.E.2d at 797, but before it had begun. Far from prejudicing Bolden, the trial court\u2019s management of this case amply protected Bolden\u2019s right to a pretrial disclosure under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Code \u00a7 19.2-187 and did so without forcing the Commonwealth to go to trial unprepared.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">B. <em>Sufficiency of Evidence\u2014Firearm Charges</em></p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">On appeal, Bolden does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his convictions for possession of cocaine and marijuana with intent to distribute. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-248, 18.2-248.1. Instead, he challenges only the firearm convictions and further limits his challenge to the trial court\u2019s finding that he possessed the handgun found in the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">We review the factfinding of a lower court \u201cwith the highest degree of appellate deference.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 605, 608, 633 S.E.2d 229, 231 (2006). Presuming these factual findings to be correct, we reverse \u201conly if the trial court\u2019s decision is \u2018plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kelly v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 250, 257, 584 S.E.2d 444, 447 (2003) <em>(en banc) </em>(citations omitted). A reviewing court, however, does not \u201cask itself whether it believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Haskins v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 1, 7-8, 602 S.E.2d 402, 405 (2004) (citation and emphasis omitted). The issue on appeal is whether <em>\u201cany </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Barnes v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 105, 110, 622 S.E.2d 278, 280 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">In this case, the trial court found Bolden possessed the firearm recovered from the vehicle. \u201cA conviction for the unlawful possession of a firearm can be supported exclusively by evidence of constructive possession.\u201d <em>Rawls v. Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 334, 349, 634 S.E.2d 697, 705 (2006). \u201cEvidence of actual possession is not necessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>omitted). It is enough that the circumstances demonstrate that he knew of the firearm and kept it \u201csubject to his dominion and control.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Proximity to the firearm and occupancy of the place where it was found are \u201ccircumstances probative of possession and may be considered as factors in determining whether the defendant possessed the firearm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 350, 634 S.E.2d at 705 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Bolden does not contest these general principles but complains that the evidence of his possession of drugs with intent to distribute should be given no weight in determining whether he simultaneously possessed the handgun. \u201cThey are separate issues,\u201d Bolden argues. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Factfinders may take into account \u201cthe commonsense \u2018relationship between the distribution of controlled substances ... and the possession and use of dangerous weapons.\u2019 \u201d <em>Logan v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 437, 445, 452 S.E.2d 364, 369 (1994) <em>(en banc). </em>\u201cGuns are the \u2018tools of the trade\u2019 in the underground drug world.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 741, 755, 607 S.E.2d 738, 744 (citation omitted), <em>adopted upon reh\u2019g en banc, </em>45 Va.App. 811, 613 S.E.2d 870 (2005). In a variety of contexts, courts have observed \u201cthe connection between illegal drug operations and guns in our society is a tight one.\u201d <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 692, 701 n. 3, 636 S.E.2d 403, 407 n. 3 (2006) (quoting in parenthetical <em>United States v. Grogins, </em>163 F.3d 795, 799 (4th Cir.1998)). As a result, \u201cevidence linking a defendant to drug distribution may be considered as one factor in determining whether he may have had a motive to possess a firearm.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>44 Va.App. at 755, 607 S.E.2d at 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Consistent with these principles, the evidence in this case supports the rationality of the trial court\u2019s finding that Bolden constructively possessed the firearm. It was found in the driver\u2019s seat of the vehicle. Bolden was either sitting on it or just next to it when the officer first saw him. Noticing the officer approaching, Bolden got out of the vehicle and dropped a bag of cocaine. Additional drugs were found in the vehicle, along with digital scales and empty plastic bags to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>package drugs for distribution. Having been found guilty of possessing these drugs with the intent to distribute (a finding unchallenged on appeal), Bolden can hardly complain that the evidence falls short of showing that he also possessed the handgun\u2014as much a tool of his trade as the digital scales or the plastic distribution bags.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Finding no error in the trial court\u2019s decision to continue the trial date or in the sufficiency of the evidence supporting Bolden\u2019s firearm convictions, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b335-7\">. At trial, Bolden did not dispute his status as a convicted felon. Conviction orders from the Hampton Circuit Court had previously found him guilty of possessing a firearm after having been convicted of a felony and illegally possessing a concealed firearm.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b337-8\">. Under the speedy trial statute, \"a trial is deemed commenced at the point when jeopardy would attach or when a plea of guilty or nolo contendere is tendered by the defendant.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-243. Jeopardy attaches in bench trials when the trial court \"begins to hear evidence.\" <em>Painter v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 225, 234, 623 S.E.2d 408, 413 (2005) (citation omitted); <em>see generally </em>Ronald J.
