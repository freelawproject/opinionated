Flowers contends that the trial court erred in finding that the evidence was sufficient to prove that she acted \u201cwillfully\u201d and in \u201creckless disregard of the life of another\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-371.1(B)(1). For the following reasons, we disagree, and therefore affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">When considering the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal of a criminal conviction, we view the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and grant all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Ellis v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 548, 551, 513 S.E.2d 453, 454 (1999). So viewed, the evidence established the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">On January 17, 2004, A.W.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was spending the weekend with her mother, Kimberly Custer (\u201cCuster\u201d). A.W. made plans to spend the night with E.L., her friend and next-door neighbor. However, at some point in time, A.W. and E.L. decided to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>spend the night at Flowers\u2019 house with Flowers\u2019 daughter, M.F.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When A.W. arrived at Flowers\u2019 home for the evening, Flowers was asleep on the couch. A.W. went to M.F.\u2019s bedroom, where M.F., her boyfriend, and E.L. were \u201changing out.\u201d At some point in time, A.W. took four Ambien sleeping pills. A.W. remembers going to sleep, getting sick, and being unable to stand up.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Sometime between ten and twelve o\u2019clock that night, Flowers went upstairs to check on the children.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After seeing the children looking \u201cvery sleepy\u201d and disoriented, Flowers called her daughter\u2019s fiance, Jason Setchall (\u201cSetchall\u201d), and told him that she had \u201can emergency.\u201d She asked him to come over and check on the kids upstairs because \u201csomething seemed wrong.\u201d When Setchall arrived, sometime between ten and twelve o\u2019clock, he noticed that the children<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> were huddled around each other \u201cstaring at the floor\u201d and that one of the girls was \u201cdrooling out of the mouth.\u201d Setchall told Flowers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>\u201cthey\u2019re obviously on something; you need to go ahead and get them checked out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Instead of calling 911, Flowers called Ricky Waid (\u201cWaid\u201d), AW.\u2019s father. Flowers placed this call between 3:00 and 3:30 a.m., at least three hours after Setchall advised her that the children needed medical attention. Moreover, although A.W. was visiting her mother, who lived in the same complex, Flowers did not call her to tell her that something was wrong with A.W. Instead, she called Waid who lived \u201cless than thirty minutes away\u201d and who had physical custody of the child. Flowers told Waid that she believed A.W. had taken something and that she needed medical attention. However, Flowers asked him not to call his ex-wife, Custer, or the police, because she did not \u201cwant a bunch of hoopla\u201d at her apartment. She indicated that Custer would only make the situation worse and that she did not \u201cwant the police involved.\u201d When Waid arrived, he found his daughter in M.F.\u2019s room awake, but unable to stand. He \u201cended up having to pick [A.W.] up and physically move her out of the house.\u201d Waid then drove A.W. to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">A.W. arrived at the hospital at 4:53 a.m., and Dr. Paul Haskins (\u201cHaskins\u201d) evaluated her within ten minutes of her arrival. Based on A.W.\u2019s representation of her condition, Haskins treated her for possible ingestion of Ambien. A.W.\u2019s exam indicated that she was \u201cextremely tachacardic, or she had a very high heart rate.\u201d Dr. Haskins testified that tachacardia is \u201cdangerous if it [is] prolonged\u201d and could possibly \u201ccreate a heart attack.\u201d Dr. Haskins also testified that, in hindsight, A.W. had not suffered a serious injury. However, at the time of her presentation at the emergency room, she \u201cabsolutely\u201d had the potential for such injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">A grand jury indicted Flowers on three counts of reckless endangerment, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-371.1(B)(1).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> During trial, the court and Flowers had the following dialog:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>COURT: Your testimony from what I can remember [was that] ... your major concern was to take care of the kids.... You had asked [Waid] not to call ... [and you] wanted him to take kids to the hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">FLOWERS: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\">FLOWERS: I didn\u2019t want to take any chances. When you\u2019re dealing with teenagers, teenagers are taking Ecstasy, I found out the other day they were mixing Viagra with Ecstasy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-8\">COURT: Alright, was there any indication ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-9\">FLOWERS: They\u2019re killing themselves.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-10\">COURT: Was there any indication to you that she was in need of hospitalization?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-11\">FLOWERS: No. Because I really don\u2019t know the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-12\">COURT: Okay. Well let me ask you this then. If you, you did not know how she reacted, I believe is what you just testified to. You wanted [Waid] to take her to the emergency room because you didn\u2019t know what they had been having, they may have mixed drugs or whatever. At that juncture, not knowing what was going on, why didn\u2019t you cafi 9-1-1?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-13\">FLOWERS: I didn\u2019t see the need.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-14\">COURT: WeH ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-15\">FLOWERS: I, these kids were, you\u2019d had to have been there, Your Honor, these kids were coherent. They were walking, talking, they didn\u2019t reaUy seem like they had anything wrong with them, but I didn\u2019t want to take the chance on maybe they took something. You know, I didn\u2019t want to take that chance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-16\">COURT: Ms. Flowers, that\u2019s the reason I asked you the question about the hospitalization. You wanted them to go to the hospital. You didn\u2019t want them to be checked by a doctor tomorrow, you wanted them, on your own testimony, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>your major concern was to take care of the kids ... [you] wanted [Waid] to take them to the hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\">FLOWERS: Right, I asked him to take them straight ... COURT: If it\u2019s that dire need, Ms. Flowers, why didn\u2019t you call 9-1-1 because of the time frame it would take, you didn\u2019t know how long it was going to take him to get there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ax4\">On September 1, 2005, the trial court convicted Flowers of one count of reckless endangerment, and sentenced her to three years, with all but two months suspended. Flowers appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">On appeal Flowers contends that the evidence was insufficient to prove she acted \u201cwillfully\u201d and \u201cin reckless disregard\u201d of another\u2019s life. For the following reasons, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">When the sufficiency of the evidence is challenged on appeal, the judgment of the trial court will not be set aside unless it appears from the evidence that the judgment is \u201cplainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987). Also, \u201c[g]reat deference must be given to the fact finder who, having seen and heard the witnesses, assesses their credibility and weighs their testimony.\u201d <em>Walton v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 422, 426, 497 S.E.2d 869, 871 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">Flowers was convicted of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-371.1(B)(1), which provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-10\">Any parent, guardian or other person responsible for the care of a child under the age of 18 whose willful act or omission in the care of such child was so gross, wanton and culpable as to show a reckless disregard for human life shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">Thus, to support a conviction for felony child neglect, the Commonwealth must establish that the defendant, through her willful act or omission, created a situation placing the child at risk of actual physical harm. <em>Barrett v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 170, 183, 597 S.E.2d 104, 110 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>A willful act is one \u201c \u2018which is intentional, or knowing, or voluntary, as distinguished from accidental.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ellis, </em>29 Va.App. at 554, 513 S.E.2d at 456 (quoting <em>Snead v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 643, 646, 400 S.E.2d 806, 807 (1991)); <em>see also Morris v. Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 732, 738, 636 S.E.2d 436, 439 (2006) (\u201c[T]he term willful, as used in the statute, refers to conduct that \u2018must be knowing or intentional, rather than accidental, and [undertaken] without justifiable excuse, without ground for believing the conduct is lawful, or with a bad purpose.\u2019 \u201d). \u201cThe act necessarily implies \u2018knowledge that particular conduct will likely result in injury or illegality.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mangano v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 210, 214, 604 S.E.2d 118, 120 (2004) (quoting <em>Ellis, </em>29 Va.App. at 554, 513 S.E.2d at 456). In other words, \u201cthe defendant must have been aware that [the] conduct was likely to result in serious injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 215, 604 S.E.2d at 121 (citing <em>Collado v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 356, 366, 533 S.E.2d 625, 630 (2000) (shaken baby syndrome)).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Moreover, Code \u00a7 18.2-371.1(B)(1) does not require a showing of actual injury or death. Rather, it proscribes conduct that is so \u201cgross, wanton and culpable\u201d as to demonstrate a \u201creckless disregard\u201d for the child\u2019s life. <em>See Commonwealth v. Duncan, </em>267 Va. 377, 385, 593 S.E.2d 210, 215 (2004). \u201cSuch \u2018reckless disregard\u2019 can be shown by conduct that subjects a child to a substantial risk of serious injury, as well as to a risk of death, because exposure to either type of risk can endanger the child\u2019s life.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Barrett, </em>268 Va. at 186, 597 S.E.2d at 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">In this case, even though Flowers believed that the children had taken something and that they needed immediate medical attention, she failed to call 911 or to take any other prompt action to secure medical attention for A.W. Specifically, Flowers waited three hours to call Waid. Moreover, she requested that Waid refrain from calling the police or the child\u2019s mother, who lived nearby, in order to avoid \u201cany hoopla.\u201d In ruling from the bench, the trial court indicated that it was this omission\u2014the deliberate decision to not call 911 or otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>secure prompt medical attention\u2014that constituted the \"willful act.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Clearly, Flowers made the decision to call Waid instead of emergency medical services. Her failure to do so was not \u201caccidental.\u201d Flowers called Waid at least three hours after Setchall advised her of his opinion that the children had \u201ctaken something\u201d and needed to be \u201cchecked out.\u201d At that point, instead of notifying the parent who lived in the same apartment complex, she opted to call Waid, who lived considerably farther away. Moreover, Flowers elected not to call the 911 emergency number, or otherwise secure medical assistance, even though she knew that A.W., along with M.F. and her boyfriend, had ingested some type of drug. As evidenced by her testimony and her request that the children be taken to the hospital, Flowers knew that ingesting drugs was likely to cause serious injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">On the evidence before us, the trial court was entitled to consider the fact that Flowers could have sought immediate medical assistance for A.W. by either taking the child to a medical care provider, calling 911 for emergency services, or by promptly alerting the child\u2019s mother who lived nearby. Instead, Flowers chose to call the child\u2019s father who lived some distance away. Moreover, Flowers specifically asked him not to call either the child\u2019s mother or the police. Under the totality of the circumstances this record presents and when considered in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as the prevailing party below, we hold that a reasonable fact finder could find that Flowers\u2019 actions and deliberate inaction \u201ccreated a situation placing the child at risk of actual physical harm.\u201d <em>Barrett, </em>268 Va. at 183, 597 S.E.2d at 110. Thus, we cannot say that the trial court\u2019s classification of this type of behavior as a willful omission for purposes of Code \u00a7 18.2-371.1(B)(1) is \u201cplainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Martin, </em>4 Va.App. at 443, 358 S.E.2d at 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">With respect to the \u201creckless disregard\u201d element of Code \u00a7 18.2\u2014371.1(B)(1), as already noted, Flowers admitted to the trial court that she suspected that the children had taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>some type of drug. In fact, Flowers testified that Setchall told her that the teenagers were probably on something and that they should be checked out. Thus, Flowers was aware that ingesting prescription or illicit drugs could pose a substantial risk for serious injury or death.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Moreover, although Dr. Haskins indicated that in hindsight A.W. did not sustain a life threatening injury, he also indicated that at the time, her condition had the potential to be life threatening. Thus, even though there was no actual injury, there was \u201ca substantial risk of serious injury, as well as to a risk of death.\u201d <em>Duncan, </em>267 Va. at 385, 593 S.E.2d at 215. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court\u2019s finding that Flowers\u2019 failure to act was in reckless disregard for A.W.\u2019s life, is not \u201cplainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Martin, </em>4 Va.App. at 443, 358 S.E.2d at 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Flowers\u2019 willful act of failing to secure prompt medical attention for juveniles in her charge, despite her recognition that ingesting drugs can pose a substantial risk of serious injury or death, satisfies the requirement of a \u201cwillful act\u201d in \u201creckless disregard for human life,\u201d as required by Code \u00a7 18.2-371.1(B)(1). Therefore, we hold that the evidence was sufficient to support Flowers\u2019 conviction of reckless endangerment, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-371.1(B)(1), and we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-13\">. At the time, A.W. was fourteen years old. The other individuals, referred to by their initials, were also juveniles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b290-6\">. Custer testified that A.W. told her of the change in plans, however she did not check with Flowers because the girls spent the night at one another\u2019s house on a regular basis. A.W. also indicated to her mother, and at trial, that she spoke with Flowers who told her it was okay for her to stay the night. However, Flowers testified that she told A.W. that she could not spend the night, as she did not have enough room to entertain that many children. To the extent that there is a discrepancy in the testimony, we must reconcile it in favor of the Commonwealth. <em>See Barrett v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 170, 179, 597 S.E.2d 104, 108 (2004) (\"In accordance with familiar principles, we will state the evidence and all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party at trial.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b290-7\">. Flowers testified that she had been up to check on the children earlier, and found them smoking cigarettes. She also testified that when she confiscated the cigarettes, A.W. told her that she was leaving to \"find more drugs.\u201d As the trial court noted, this testimony was in direct conflict with portions of Flowers\u2019 earlier testimony in which she stated \"why would she tell me they were going out to get drugs when she knew I wouldn\u2019t want them there.\u201d In any event, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. <em>Barrett, </em>268 Va. at 179, 597 S.E.2d at 108.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b290-8\">. The record is unclear as to how many children were actually in the room at the time. However, the record is clear that Flowers\u2019 daughter, Flowers\u2019 daughter\u2019s boyfriend, and A.W. were in the room.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b291-8\">.
