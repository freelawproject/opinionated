BEALES, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Harlan Anthony Phelps appeals from his bench trial conviction of felony eluding police in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-817(B). Appellant asserts \u201cthe trial court erred in denying [his] motion to strike where there was no evidence that [appellant\u2019s] vehicle interfered with or endangered the law enforcement vehicle or any person.\u201d Finding that the statute\u2019s contemplation of \u201cendanger[ing] a person\u201d includes appellant himself, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">On appeal, \u201c \u2018we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Peake v. Commonwealth, </em>46 Va.App. 35, 37, 614 S.E.2d 672, 674 (2005) (quoting <em>Archer v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 1, 11, 492 S.E.2d 826, 831 (1997) (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">Here, the uncontested facts are that, at approximately one o\u2019clock in the morning on February 9, 2005, Officer Shadrix of the James City County Police Department observed appellant driving a red Toyota C\u00e9lica. Shadrix noticed that the Celica\u2019s \u201cbrake lights flashed a couple of times\u201d and watched as appellant, who was traveling on Richmond Road, made a left-hand turn onto Chickahominy Road without utilizing the middle turn lane. Shadrix followed the vehicle and turned on his emergency lights. The vehicle continued for approximately 100 yards, and Shadrix then activated his siren.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-12\">Shadrix testified that the C\u00e9lica initially maintained the speed limit, 35 miles per hour, but after the siren was activated, \u201cthe vehicle picked up [speed] rapidly.\u201d Shadrix did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>know how fast the vehicle was traveling, as he was paying attention to his own driving. Shadrix continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-5\">We were traveling in the area of Chickahominy Road, at that time there was a bit of construction. There was a large dip in the road and two big curves. The vehicle\u2014we were traveling southbound on Chickahominy just prior to the address of 3385. It was the house just before that, the vehicle traveled through the northbound lane into the ditch and was traveling down the ditch and then struck the culvert for the driveway of 3385 and then flipped over.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ag1\">Appellant crawled out of the wrecked car and took flight. Shadrix pursued on foot and arrested appellant. Shadrix testified that the foot chase took place in the same residential area where the car had crashed and that he finally caught up to appellant in the backyard of one of those residences.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Appellant moved to strike the evidence, arguing that \u201cthe Commonwealth ha[d] not shown that the operation of the vehicle interfered with or endangered the law enforcement vehicle or any person.\u201d The Assistant Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney, after being asked by the trial court whether there was evidence the officer was in danger, explained, \u201cThe Commonwealth\u2019s argument will be either the defendant himself was in danger or the potential of other individuals from the residential area. We are not arguing that the officer was endangered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">The trial court took the matter under advisement. Before sentencing, the trial judge stated that he found appellant \u201cguilty as charged of evading and eluding a police officer, a felony.\u201d An appeal to this Court followed. Following oral argument, this Court ordered the parties to submit a supplemental brief discussing whether or not \u201ca person,\u201d as contemplated in Code \u00a7 46.2-817(B), includes the defendant (appellant) himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">Code \u00a7 46.2-817(B) reads, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Any person who, having received a visible or audible signal from any law-enforcement officer to bring his motor vehicle to a stop, drives such motor vehicle in a willful and wanton disregard of such signal so as to interfere with or endanger the operation of the law-enforcement vehicle or endanger a person is guilty of a Class 6 felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Here, appellant argues that his actions did not actually endanger \u201ca person\u201d or the operation of the law enforcement vehicle and that, therefore, the evidence is insufficient to sustain his conviction. We disagree because appellant clearly endangered himself during his vehicular flight.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Under familiar principles of statutory construction, \u2018We give the words of a statute \u2018their common, ordinary and accepted meaning,\u2019 absent an indication by the legislature to the contrary.\u201d <em>Saunders v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 196, 201, 629 S.E.2d 701, 703 (2006) (quoting <em>General Trading Corp. v. Motor Vehicle Dealer Bd., </em>28 Va.App. 264, 268, 503 S.E.2d 809, 811 (1998)). However, we are also mindful that \u201c \u2018a statute should never be construed so that it leads to absurd results.\u2019 \u201d <em>Auer v. Commonwealth, </em>46 Va.App. 637, 651, 621 S.E.2d 140, 147 (2005) (quoting <em>Branch v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 836, 839, 419 S.E.2d 422, 424 (1992)). And, as the Virginia Supreme Court has explained, the \u201ccase law uses the phrase \u2018absurd result\u2019 to describe situations in which the law would be internally inconsistent or otherwise incapable of operation.\u201d <em>Cook v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 111, 116, 597 S.E.2d 84, 87 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">A literal reading of the phrase \u201ca person,\u201d as contained in Code \u00a7 46.2-817(B), and the accompanying ordinary and accepted meaning of the indefinite article \u201ca,\u201d would include appellant in this case. Here, the uncontested facts show that appellant, while driving at a high rate of speed in an attempt to elude Officer Shadrix, crossed over the oncoming lane of traffic, drove into a ditch, struck a culvert, and flipped his own vehicle. Though Shadrix did not know exactly how fast appellant\u2019s vehicle was traveling, the vehicle\u2019s speed must have well exceeded the 35 miles per hour speed limit, since Shadrix\u2019s own vehicle was traveling 35 miles per hour before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>appellant\u2019s \u201cvehicle picked up [speed] rapidly.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is clear that appellant\u2019s vehicle reached a rate of speed where he was no longer able to maintain control and remain in the roadway. Therefore, by operating his vehicle in such a manner while evading and eluding a law enforcement officer, appellant endangered himself (i.e., \u201cendangered] a person\u201d) and violated Code \u00a7 46.2-817(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">We cannot say that the legislature, in its selection of the language \u201cendanger[s] <em>a person,\u201d </em>meant to exclude appellant, a member of the general public, from the protection afforded by Code \u00a7 46.2-817(B). This conclusion is reinforced by language in other sections of Title 46.2 where the General Assembly used the phrase \u201canother person\u201d to specifically exclude an offending individual from the public-at-large. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-865.1(A) (punishing a driver engaging in a race that results in the death or injury of \u201canother person\u201d) and 46.2-868.1(A) (defining and punishing aggressive driving; requiring an intent to \u201cinjure or obstruct another person\u201d). Therefore, our interpretation of the language \u201ca person\u201d found in Code \u00a7 46.2-817(B), and its subsequent application to the facts of this case, does not render the law in this area \u201cinternally inconsistent or otherwise incapable of operation,\u201d <em>Cook, </em>268 Va. at 116, 597 S.E.2d at 87, and, accordingly, our interpretation certainly does not lead to an absurd result.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">We affirm appellant\u2019s conviction. The Commonwealth proved that appellant (\u201ca person\u201d) endangered himself while seeking to evade and elude Officer Shadrix.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>trial court did not err in finding him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of violating Code \u00a7 46.2-817(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b315-9\">. As noted above, the Commonwealth did not argue that Officer Shadrix was in danger.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b315-10\">. Because we find that appellant is \"a person,\" as noted in Code \u00a7 46.2-817(B), we need not address whether other \"person[s]\" were \"endanger[ed]\u201d by appellant\u2019s actions\u2014i.e., those who might have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>traveling the same road on that night or who might have occupied the homes adjacent to where appellant\u2019s car crashed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
