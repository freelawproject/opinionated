ARTHUR KELSEY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">The trial court convicted Mark Dywayne Bishop of driving after having been declared an habitual offender in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-357(A) and obstruction of justice in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-460(C). On appeal, Bishop claims (i) the habitual offender conviction should be reversed for insufficient evidence, and (ii) the obstruction of justice conviction should be vacated because the statute invites an unconstitutionally broad scope of prosecutorial discretion. Finding neither argument persuasive, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">Under settled principles, we review the evidence in the \u201clight most favorable\u201d to the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth v. Hudson, </em>265 Va. 505, 514, 578 S.E.2d 781, 786 (2003). That principle requires us to \u201cdiscard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences to be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Parks v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 492, 498, 270 S.E.2d 755, 759 (1980) (emphasis and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">In December 2004, two police officers arrived at Bishop\u2019s home with a warrant for his arrest. Bishop was not there. The officers parked at a nearby location where they would not likely be seen and waited for Bishop to arrive. Shortly thereafter, the officers observed Bishop drive a vehicle down the public road and park in his driveway. He was alone. The officers confronted him in the driveway and asked if he was Mark Bishop. He said he was not. Believing him to be Bishop, the officers told him he was under arrest. Bishop <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>resisted arrest and fought the officers, leaving one of the officers with abrasions and fractured ribs.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">At trial, the Commonwealth introduced into evidence Bishop\u2019s DMV transcript. Prior to his most recent arrest, his driving record shows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-6\">\u2022 a 1994 conviction for operating an uninsured vehicle</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-7\">\u2022 three 1996 court-ordered license suspensions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-8\">\u2022 two 1996 convictions for driving under a revoked or suspended license</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-9\">\u2022 two 1996 court-ordered revocations of his license</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-10\">\u2022 a 1996 improper driving conviction</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-11\">\u2022 a 1997 court-ordered license suspension</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-12\">\u2022 a 1997 conviction for driving under a revoked or suspended license</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-13\">\u2022 a 1997 DMV administrative declaration of habitual offender status</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-14\">\u2022 a 1997 DMV administrative license revocation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-15\">\u2022 a 1999 court-ordered license suspension</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-16\">\u2022 three 2000 court-ordered license suspensions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-17\">\u2022 six 2001 court-ordered license suspensions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-18\">\u2022 two 2001 convictions for driving under a revoked or suspended <em>license\u2014one of the two offenses occurring on March 10, 2001</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-19\">\u2022 several 2001 convictions for operating an uninspected vehicle, improper registration or license plates, and operating an uninsured <em>vehicle\u2014all offenses occurring on March 10, 2001</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-20\">\u2022 a 2002 court-ordered license suspension</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-21\">\u2022 two 2003 court-ordered license suspensions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-22\">\u2022 a 2003 conviction for driving under a revoked or suspended license, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-23\">\u2022 a 2004 court-ordered license suspension.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-24\">Taking the stand in his own defense, Bishop did not challenge any aspect of the DMV transcript. He did not mention, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>much less contest, his habitual offender declaration or his personal knowledge of that status at the time of the offense. Nor did he dispute the multitude of traffic offenses and license suspensions upon which DMV predicated its administrative declaration of Bishop as an habitual offender. Instead, Bishop testified that his girlfriend drove the vehicle while he sat in the passenger seat. After she pulled into a private driveway and walked away from the car, Bishop stated, he moved into the driver\u2019s seat. On cross-examination, Bishop admitted to two prior felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">At the close of the evidence, Bishop\u2019s counsel challenged the habitual offender charge on only one very specific ground:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmE\">First of all, as to the habitual offender. If you look at the driving record I believe it will tell you that the revocation which occurred April 28th, 1997 ... that <em>he was notified for the H.O. determination, that is the habitual offender determination by law enforcement. </em>It doesn\u2019t actually say he was notified after he was declared habitual offender. I think that that is an important distinction. He was notified of the process whereby he was going to be waived or where he was going to be adjudicated habitual offender so that he would know that it was going to occur, but it doesn\u2019t actually say he was notified having been adjudicated an habitual offender. And I would suggest to the Court that under the <em>Reed </em>case---- First of all, actual notice is required and I would suggest to the Court we don\u2019t even see constructive notice on this record. We <em>know he was notified that there was going to be a termination, but we don\u2019t see in the record that he was going to be notified that he was determined habitual offender. </em>But I would suggest that without notice we cannot sustain a conviction here for\u2014 a conviction of habitual offender.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">On the obstruction of justice charge, Bishop\u2019s counsel argued that the similarities between Code \u00a7 18.2-60(C)\u2019s felony provision and \u00a7 18.2-460(B)\u2019s misdemeanor provision gave the prosecution unconstitutionally broad discretion. The trial court rejected Bishop\u2019s arguments and convicted him of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>misdemeanor habitual offender charge and the felony obstruction of justice charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">A. <em>The Habitual Offender Conviction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">On appeal, Bishop does not disavow his concession at trial that he received the notice indicated by the entry on the DMV transcript. He admits on appeal that the transcript shows that \u201cAppellant received notification from law enforcement on March 10, 2001.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 7. Bishop simply disagrees that the notice he received was that he \u201cwas or had been declared an habitual offender.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Just as he argued at trial, Bishop argues on appeal that the notice merely reflected that the habitual offender determination process had begun. He points to two entries on the transcript, \u201cthe interpretation of which is the critical issue here.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">We agree with Bishop\u2019s framing of the issue on appeal but disagree with his interpretation of the DMV transcript. The disputed entries, as they appear on the transcript, read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-8\">DETERMINED ON: 1997/04/23 HABITUAL OFFENDER BY DMV ELIGIBLE TO RESTORE UNDER CURRENT LAW ON: RESTRICTED: N/A FULL: 2000/04/23</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-10\">REVOCATION ISS: 1997/04/28 EFFECTIVE: 1997/05/28 FOR HO DETERMINATION PROCESS NOTIFIED: 2001/03/10 BY LAW ENFORCEMENT ORDER DELIVERY DATE: ORDER MAILED</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">Bishop\u2019s driving record is a creature of statute, required by Code \u00a7 46.2-208(H) to be maintained by DMV. \u201cThe statutory scheme for the enforcement of the habitual offender act\u201d specifically relies upon DMV driving records as the principal database combining administrative and judicial records. <em>Smoot v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 562, 565, 445 S.E.2d 688, 690 (1994). DMV is \u201cpresumed to have kept accurate records\u201d and to have done so consistent with its \u201cstatutory duties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Commonwealth v. Dalton, </em>11 Va.App. 620, 623, 400 S.E.2d 801, 803 (1991)). Bishop\u2019s DMV <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>transcript, therefore, must be interpreted in conformity with the statutes governing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Based upon his numerous traffic violations and license suspensions, DMV issued an administrative order determining Bishop to be an habitual offender in 1997. \u201cUpon such determination, the Commissioner shall immediately cause the Department\u2019s records to indicate that the person <em>has been determined </em>to be an habitual offender.... \u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-352(A) (repealed 1999) (emphasis added). Consistent with that requirement, Bishop\u2019s DMV transcript states: \u201cDETERMINED ON: 1997/04/23 HABITUAL OFFENDER BY DMV.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Five days later, the transcript confirms, DMV issued its revocation order in conformity with the \u201cHO DETERMINATION PROCESS\u201d\u2014just as former Code \u00a7 46.2-352(A) required.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Bishop concedes he received the notice from \u201claw enforcement\u201d in 2001. The DMV transcript indicates law enforcement provided this notice on March 10, 2001\u2014the same day Bishop committed four driving offenses for which he was later convicted. The notice Bishop received could not have been, as he claims, notice of the possibility of <em>a future </em>habitual offender determination. He had already been determined to be an habitual offender years earlier. The trial court, therefore, had ample reason to reject the only hypothesis of innocence asserted by Bishop at trial: that the 2001 notice he received from \u201claw enforcement\u201d <em>preceded </em>any determination of his status as an habitual offender.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Bishop complains that this reasoning conflicts with <em>Reed v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 467, 424 S.E.2d 718 (1992). We disagree. <em>Reed </em>involved a judicial, not an administrative, declaration of habitual offender status. The defendant in <em>Reed </em>received a show cause order commanding him to appear at a hearing to address whether he should be judicially declared an habitual offender. When the defendant failed to appear, the trial court declared him an habitual offender in his absence and served a copy of the declaration order on the defendant\u2019s father. <em>Reed </em>held that the pre-declaration notice received by the defendant warned only of the possibility of a future declaration, not of a then-existing declaration. <em>Reed </em>also found the post-declaration notice inadequate, as it was served only on the defendant\u2019s father but not on the defendant. Even if service on the defendant\u2019s father constituted \u201cconstructive notice,\u201d <em>Reed </em>reasoned, the habitual offender statute requires \u201cactual notice\u201d of the declaration. <em>Id. </em>at 473, 424 S.E.2d at 721.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">No aspect of <em>Reed\u2019s </em>reasoning conflicts with ours. In this case, the trial judge did not find \u201cconstructive\u201d notice. He did not need to. Bishop conceded actual notice by law enforcement. The only question was what that notice said. Sitting as factfinder, the trial court inferred that the notice Bishop received in 2001 was of his <em>then-existing </em>habitual offender status. Factfinders may \u201cdraw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts,\u201d <em>Barnes v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 105, 110 n. 1, 622 S.E.2d 278, 280 n. 1 (2005) (citation omitted), unless doing so would push \u201cinto the realm of <em>non sequitur, \u201d Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 605, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>608, 633 S.E.2d 229, 231 (2006) (citation omitted). Nothing in this case suggests the trial court went beyond the proper limits of its factfinding discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Implicit in Bishop\u2019s argument is the erroneous conflation of constructive notice principles (that is, he may not have received notice, but we will treat him as if he did) and circumstantial proof of actual notice (he did get notice, and we can infer this from the surrounding circumstances). Actual notice is not downgraded to constructive notice simply because the evidentiary proof shifts from direct to circumstantial. <em>See, e.g., Hofheimer v. Booker, </em>164 Va. 358, 365-66, 180 S.E. 145, 147 (1935) (holding \u201cactual notice embraces all degrees and grades of evidence, from the most direct and positive proof to the slightest circumstances from which [the factfinder] would be warranted in inferring notice\u201d (citation omitted)); <em>Parrish v. Cleveland, </em>372 F.3d 294, 303 (4th Cir.2004) (noting that actual knowledge \u201cis a question of fact subject to demonstration in the usual ways, including inference from circumstantial evidence\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">B. <em>Constitutionality of Code \u00a7 18.2-460</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Bishop challenges his felony obstruction of justice conviction on the ground that Code \u00a7 18.2-460 gave the prosecutor unfettered discretion to charge his conduct as either a misdemeanor under subsection (B) of the statute or as a felony under subsection (C). In the context of resisting arrest, Bishop argues, the two subsections criminalize essentially the same conduct.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Leaving the charging decision solely in the hands of the prosecutor violates due process and equal protection principles, Bishop contends.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>We see no constitutional infirmity in the prosecutorial discretion necessarily required by the separate misdemean- or and felony provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-460. If subsections (B) and (C) were separate statutes, no constitutional claim could be advanced. Under settled principles, \u201cwhen an act violates more than one criminal statute, the Government may prosecute under either so long as it does not discriminate against any class of defendants.\u201d <em>United States v. Batchelder, </em>442 U.S. 114, 123-24, 99 S.Ct. 2198, 2204, 60 L.Ed.2d 755 (1979); <em>Muhammad v. Commonwealth, </em>269 Va. 451, 502, 619 S.E.2d 16, 45 (2005). Consequently, a \u201cprosecutor has the discretion to decide under which of several applicable statutes the charges shall be instituted.\u201d <em>In re Horan, </em>271 Va. 258, 264, 634 S.E.2d 675, 679 (2006) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">We find no principled basis not to recognize this same broad prosecutorial discretion when the charging decision involves two subsections of the same statute. It is the \u201cstructure of tripartite government\u201d that \u201ccreates a judicial presumption in favor of \u2018broad\u2019 prosecutorial discretion,\u201d <em>Boyd v. County of Henrico, </em>42 Va.App. 495, 521, 592 S.E.2d 768, 781 (2004) <em>(en banc) </em>(citations omitted), not the mostly ministerial decision to codify related felony and misdemeanor crimes as separate statutes rather than separate subsections of the same statute. <em>See United States v. Rietzke, </em>279 F.3d 541, 546 (7th Cir.2002) (rejecting argument that prosecutorial discretion recognized by <em>Batchelder </em>does not apply to subsections of the same statute). For this reason, the trial court correctly rejected Bishop\u2019s constitutional challenge to the prosecutorial discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>tion inherent in the different grades of obstruction of justice offenses criminalized by Code \u00a7 18.2-460.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Rejecting Bishop\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of his habitual offender conviction and to the constitutionality of the obstruction of justice statute, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b303-7\">. Bishop\u2019s DMV transcript noted he was eligible for license restoration in 2000. The transcript, however, shows multiple entries from 2000 to the time of the most recent offense, <em>supra </em>at 2, all refuting the possibility of a license restoration. By statute, one subject to an habitual offender declaration may only have his privilege to drive restored by court order. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-356; <em>Sink v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 655, 659, 507 S.E.2d 670, 672 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b303-8\">. Given our holding, we need not address the Commonwealth\u2019s additional argument that DMV's mailing of its habitual-offender/revocation order (noted on Bishop\u2019s DMV transcript) provided adequate notice to Bishop. <em>See Clements v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 56, 60, 596 S.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>88, 89-90 (2004) (presuming that DMV, after issuing an habitual-offender/revocation order under Code \u00a7 46.2-352(A), \"followed the statute\u2019s requirements for mailing\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b304-7\">.

Therefore, the DMV transcript falls short of proving the notice required by <em>Reed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">The majority recites that Bishop \u201cconcedes he received the notice from \u2018law enforcement\u2019 in 2001.\u201d It bases its finding of this concession on defense counsel\u2019s argument at the conclusion of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>At trial, appellant\u2019s attorney attempted to interpret the notations on the DMV transcript and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\">[The DMV transcript] will tell you that the revocation which occurred April 28, 1997, I\u2019m sorry, April 28, 1997, that he was notified for the H.O. determination, that is the habitual offender determination by law enforcement. It doesn\u2019t actually say he was notified after he was declared habitual offender. I think that is an important distinction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\">He was notified of the process whereby he was going to be waived or where he was going to be adjudicated habitual offender so that he would know that it was going to occur, but it doesn\u2019t actually say he was notified having been adjudicated an habitual offender.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-7\">And I would suggest to the Court that under the <em>Reed </em>case, and I have copies right here. First of all, actual notice is required and I would suggest to the Court we don\u2019t even see constructive notice on this record. We know he was notified that there was going to be a termination, but we don\u2019t see in the record that he was going to be notified that he was determined habitual offender. But I would suggest without notice we cannot sustain a conviction</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-8\">In his petition, appellant\u2019s attorney wrote:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-9\">The DMV record in this case has two notations, the interpretation of which is the critical issue here. First, the record indicates that on April 23, 1997, Appellant was \u201cDETERMINED\u201d to be an habitual offender by DMV. The record does not show whether or not Appellant was ever notified of this determination. Immediately below this notation is an indication that there existed a \u201cREVOCATION\u201d issued on April 28,1997 and effective on May 28,1997. The notation then reads: \u201cFOR HO DETERMINATION PROCESS.\u201d <em>That same entry reflects that an order was mailed and that Appellant received notification from law enforcement on March 10, 2001.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-10\">The DMV record is ambiguous on its face, however, a point which Appellant\u2019s trial counsel noted. It indicates that Appellant was notified of something by law enforce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>ment, but not as to what that something was. The most clear reading of the DMV record, and the only one supported by the plain language, is that Appellant was notified of the \u201cHO DETERMINATION PROCESS,\u201d not that he was notified that he was or had been declared an habitual.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Appellant\u2019s attorney\u2019s representations were not evidence. They were not a stipulation of evidence intended to limit the scope of required proof. They were argument as to what, if anything, could be concluded from the evidence. This argument must be considered <em>in tato. </em>Bishop cannot be charged with what his counsel didn\u2019t say.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Moreover, in recognizing that appellant received some notice on March 10, 2001, appellant\u2019s attorney did not concede the contents of that notice. Instead, he argued that the record was unclear as to what notification appellant received from the unidentified \u201claw enforcement.\u201d To comply with <em>Reed, </em>the Commonwealth had the burden of proving through testimony or documents from \u201claw enforcement\u201d the details and circumstances of notification. This the Commonwealth failed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">The majority notes that the statutorily prescribed \u201cprocess\u201d is a review procedure post-determination. It holds that defense counsel should have known this and that his concession of notice of the process must acknowledge notice of the underlying habitual offender determination. In my view, this approach transgresses the appropriate standard of review. Knowledge of law is one thing. Proof of fact is another. We cannot substitute our knowledge of the statutory scheme, or our hopeful attribution of such knowledge to counsel, for proof that Bishop was in fact given the notice required by <em>Reed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">I would reverse Bishop\u2019s habitual offender conviction and order that charge dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
