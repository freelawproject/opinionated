He contends the trial court abused its discretion in admitting into evidence: (1) a forensic scientist\u2019s testimony concerning the contents of a certificate of analysis when the scientist had no recollection of the certificate\u2019s contents, (2) the certificate of analysis because the scientist had no recollection of the contents, and (3) the chemical test results from a machine when the testing scientist had no first hand knowledge of the machine\u2019s calibration on the day of the test. Bell also contends that absent this inadmissible evidence, the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions. Finding no merit in Bell\u2019s first three questions presented, we decline to address his final question presented, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AEi\">A. <em>The Arrest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">On appeal, a court reviews the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the Commonwealth,\u201d as the prevailing party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>below, giving \u201cit all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Higginbotham v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 349, 352, 218 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1975). Viewed as such, the evidence proved that on November 4, 2003, Bell was driving a gold Pontiac at a high rate of speed southbound on Elm Avenue in Portsmouth. Bell suddenly made a left hand turn from Elm Avenue onto Lincoln Street, causing oncoming vehicles to \u201cslam on\u201d their brakes to avoid a collision. Officer Kevin Parker (\u201cParker\u201d) of the Portsmouth Police observed the near collision, and activated his emergency lights and siren in pursuit of Bell. Bell did not respond to Parker\u2019s attempts to stop him, and a high-speed chase through Portsmouth ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">After police were finally able to take Bell into custody, Parker conducted a search incident to arrest, and recovered from Bell\u2019s jacket pocket two bags containing what he suspected to be crack cocaine and marijuana. Police also discovered a partially-smoked cigar containing suspected marijuana, and $1,713 in U.S. currency. They did not recover any drug ingestion devices. Parker later packaged the suspected drugs and sent them to the Department of Forensic Science (\u201cthe Department\u201d) for analysis. A certificate of analysis later confirmed that the two bags contained 17.8 grams of marijuana and 11.498 grams of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">B. <em>Proceedings in the Trial and Appellate Courts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Bell was previously convicted in a bench trial on the charges of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, third or subsequent offense, and possession of marijuana. During Bell\u2019s October 5, 2004 trial, the court admitted the certificate of analysis into evidence over Bell\u2019s objection, which was based on the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to comply with the mailing requirements of Code \u00a7 19.2-187.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>convicted Bell of both charges.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Bell appealed to this Court. On December 5, 2005, we reversed the trial court and remanded for a new trial, holding that the Commonwealth had not complied with the mailing requirements of Code \u00a7 19.2-187, and thus that the certificate of analysis was inadmissible hearsay. We held, in other words, that the Commonwealth could not use the certificate of analysis as a substitute for the testimony of the forensic scientist who performed the analysis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Upon retrial, on March 6, 2006, the Commonwealth called Arthur Christy (\u201cChristy\u201d), the scientist who had performed the analysis, as a witness. The court qualified him as an expert in the analysis of chemical compounds and controlled substances. Christy described three general screening tests he performed in carrying out his analysis; namely, a \u201cMarquis Reagent\u201d test, and a \u201ccobalt thyocyanide\u201d test, both of which involve the use of liquids that turn certain colors when combined with cocaine, and a \u201cthin layer chromatography test,\u201d which involves comparing the suspected sample of a controlled substance with a known sample. Christy also described using a \u201cgas chromatograph-mass spectrometer\u201d (\u201cspectrometer\u201d), which is used to analyze the structure of a suspected controlled substance. Based on these tests, Christy determined that the first substance was cocaine, and based on similar tests, he determined the second substance to be marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">On the day Christy performed the tests, he ran a \u201cnegative control\u201d test on the spectrometer, which involves testing the machine to make sure that nothing remains from a previous sample. Another chemist had performed the daily calibration of the machine, to ensure all its electronic systems functioned properly. According to the Department\u2019s protocol, if the records indicate that the machines have not been calibrated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>that day, the Department is to retest all samples from that day. The Department did not retest any samples from that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Christy relied on the certificate of analysis to refresh his recollection during his testimony. After the Commonwealth established a proper foundation to allow use of the certificate, the following exchange took place between Christy and the prosecutor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-6\">COMMONWEALTH\u2019S ATTORNEY: Did you [] prepare [a] written memorandum of your findings?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-7\">CHRISTY: Yes, I have a certificate of analysis for this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-8\">COMMONWEALTH\u2019S ATTORNEY: And do you have an independent recollection of having performed these particular analyses? In other words, do you remember actually doing this particular analysis amongst all the thousands that you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-9\">CHRISTY: No, I do not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-10\">COMMONWEALTH\u2019S ATTORNEY: And do you use the lab certificate or the certificate of analysis to refresh your recollection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-11\">CHRISTY: Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-12\">COMMONWEALTH\u2019S ATTORNEY: And is that signed and dated by you and prepared by you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-13\">CHRISTY: Yes, it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-14\">COMMONWEALTH\u2019S ATTORNEY: And do you rely on that at least in part for your testimony here today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A08\">CHRISTY: For the most part, yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-15\">Bell objected, arguing that Christy should not be able to refer to hearsay documents of which he had no independent recollection, during his testimony. Bell also objected to the admission of the certificate itself into evidence, reminding the trial court of our previous holding that the Commonwealth could not substitute the certificate for Christy\u2019s live testimony. Bell further objected to evidence obtained from the spectrom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>eter, because Christy had not himself performed the calibrations of that machine on the day in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The trial court overruled Bell\u2019s objections and convicted him of both charges. The current appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">A. <em>Christy\u2019s Use of the Certificate as a Present Recollection Refreshed</em></p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">Bell argues on appeal, as he did at trial, that Christy should not have been permitted to use the certif\u00edcate of analysis in his testimony, because Christy had no independent recollection of an otherwise hearsay document. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">\u201cThe admissibility of evidence is within the broad discretion of the trial court, and a ruling will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Blain v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 10, 16, 371 S.E.2d 838, 842 (1988). However, \u201c[b]y definition, when the trial court makes an error of law, an abuse of discretion occurs.\u201d <em>Bass v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 373, 382, 523 S.E.2d 534, 539 (2000). The proponent of the evidence bears the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence, the facts necessary to support its admissibility. <em>See Bloom v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 814, 821, 554 S.E.2d 84, 87 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">The Commonwealth contends that Christy\u2019s use of the certificate to aid his testimony was proper, because it was a present recollection refreshed. When a witness is called to testify and is unable to remember all of the facts upon which they are supposed to testify, \u201ccounsel may ... refresh the witness\u2019s memory by allowing the witness to examine material, usually writings, which relate to the incident in question.\u201d Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia, </em>\u00a7 3-7 (6th ed.2003). \u201cUpon completion of his examination, the witness is required to testify <em>from independent memory, </em>which has supposedly returned to him upon sight of the refreshing material.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 3-7(a) (emphasis in original). \u201cThere is no requirement that the material itself be admitted into evidence, or <em>even that it be admissible. </em>However, the adverse party has the right to examine the material, to use it in cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>examining the witness, and to show it to the [fact finder].\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). This method of refreshing the witness\u2019 memory is commonly referred to as \u201cpresent recollection refreshed.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Here, Bell argues that because Christy was unable to testify, from independent memory, regarding his performance of the analysis, he should not have been permitted to testify from the certificate. However, when asked by the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney if he used the certificate of analysis to refresh his recollection, Christy responded: \u2018Yes, I do.\u201d Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, <em>see Higginbotham, </em>216 Va. at 352, 218 S.E.2d at 537, the evidence supported the required factual determination that Christy used the certificate first to refresh his recollection, and then to testify from independent memory. Furthermore, Bell had the opportunity to examine the certificate, cross-examine Christy, and show the certificate to the trial court, if he so desired. The Commonwealth met its burden of proof that Christy used the certificate to refresh his recollection. Consequently, we hold that the trial court did not err in allowing Christy to testify after reference to the certificate to refresh his recollection.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">B. <em>The Certificate of Analysis and Compliance With Code \u00a7 19.2-187</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Bell next argues that the trial court erred by admitting the certificate of analysis into evidence, contrary to our earlier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>ruling in <em>Bell v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 126, 622 S.E.2d 751 (2005). In that opinion, we held that the Commonwealth had not complied with Code \u00a7 19.2-187, and thus the certificate was inadmissible hearsay. <em>See id. </em>at 140, 622 S.E.2d at 757. Because of our prior holding, on retrial the Commonwealth called Christy as a witness. Bell, however, continues to argue that the certificate is inadmissible, despite the fact that Christy testified at trial. In making this argument, Bell ignores the underlying purpose of Code \u00a7 19.2-187.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">\u201cA written report offered -to prove the results of testing or of an analysis would generally be inadmissible hearsay evidence <em>unless the person who conducted the testing or prepared the report testified to authenticate the document and verify its contents.\u201d Myrick v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va. App. 333, 336-37, 412 S.E.2d 176, 178 (1991) (emphasis added). Code \u00a7 19.2-187 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-6\">In any hearing or trial of any criminal offense ... a certificate of analysis of a person performing an analysis or examination, performed in any laboratory operated by the Division of Consolidated Laboratory Services or the Division of Forensic Science ... shall be admissible in evidence as evidence of the facts therein stated and the results of the analysis or examination referred to therein, provided (i) the certificate of analysis is filed with the clerk of the court hearing the case at least seven days prior to the hearing or trial and (ii) a copy of such certificate is mailed or delivered by the clerk or attorney for the Commonwealth to counsel of record for the accused at least seven days prior to the hearing or trial upon request made by such counsel to the clerk with notice of the request to the attorney for the Commonwealth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Code \u00a7 19.2-187 was enacted to allow for the introduction into evidence of a certificate of analysis without the forensic scientist who performed the tests being present, provided certain procedures were met. <em>See Myrick, </em>13 Va.App. 333 at 337, 412 S.E.2d at 178. The rationale for requiring compliance with these safeguards is that the statute allows the introduc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>tion of otherwise inadmissible and unreliable hearsay. By testifying in court as to his findings and preparation of the certificate, and authenticating the certificate, Christy resolved any hearsay problems. Code \u00a7 19.2-187, therefore, is not implicated. Accordingly, by admitting the certificate of analysis, the trial court did not violate Code \u00a7 19.2-187, nor did it ignore our previous holding in <em>Bell.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We thus affirm the judgment of the trial court on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">C. <em>Calibration of the Spectrometer</em></p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Bell\u2019s third contention is that the results of the chemical analysis should be excluded, because Christy did not have first hand knowledge of whether the spectrometer had undergone calibration on that particular day. We disagree with Bell on this issue as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">\u201cExpert testimony is generally admissible ... if it will assist the trier of fact in understanding the evidence or determining a factual issue. However, admissibility depends on whether the expert testimony satisfies certain fundamental requirements, including the requirement that the testimony be based on an adequate factual foundation.\u201d <em>Santen v. Tuthill, </em>265 Va. 492, 498, 578 S.E.2d 788, 792 (2003) (citations omitted). <em>See also Tarmac Mid-Atlantic Inc. v. Smiley Block Co., </em>250 Va. 161, 166, 458 S.E.2d 462, 465 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">Bell relies on <em>Santen, </em>in which the Supreme Court of Virginia held that an expert witness could not testify regarding the effect of an individual\u2019s alcohol consumption, and the amount of alcohol that individual would have had to consume to reach a certain blood alcohol content. <em>Santen, </em>265 Va. at 499, 578 S.E.2d at 792. This testimony was based upon the specific result of a preliminary breath test. According to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>proffered evidence, the \u201ctype of machine used to administer the test was accurate, and thus also the result, \u2018assuming [the machine] was regularly calibrated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 498, 578 S.E.2d at 792. Because the proponent of the testimony did not proffer that the machine had, in fact, been calibrated, the court held that the expert testimony was not based on an adequate factual foundation, and thus was inadmissible. <em>Id. </em>at 499, 578 S.E.2d at 792.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Bell\u2019s reliance on <em>Santen </em>is misplaced. There, the proponent of the testimony did not proffer any evidence to lay a factual foundation as to the machine\u2019s reliability. In the case before us, Christy testified to numerous safeguard and quality assurance procedures employed by the Department to ensure the accuracy of the spectrometer\u2019s results. The Department requires its laboratories to send records of daily spectrometer calibrations to Department headquarters. If the records do not indicate that the spectrometer has been calibrated on a particular day, then Department policy requires all samples run on a particular day to be retested. Christy was not required to retest samples from that day, nor had he ever been required to do so in five and a half years as a forensic scientist for the Department. Furthermore, Christy performed a \u201cnegative control\u201d test, in which he tested the machine to ensure that the test results would not be contaminated by the remnants of the previous sample. Although Christy did not personally calibrate the spectrometer, the Commonwealth nevertheless presented evidence of its calibration. Christy\u2019s expert testimony was therefore based on an adequate factual foundation, and thus admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">D. <em>Sufficiency of the Remaining Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Bell\u2019s final contention on appeal is that absent the inadmissible evidence discussed above, the remaining evidence is insufficient to sustain the conviction. We have held above that the evidence in question <em>was </em>admissible, and thus we need not address this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">We hold that the trial court did not err in permitting Christy to refer to the certificate of analysis during his testimony to refresh his recollection, in admitting the certificate of analysis into evidence, or in allowing Christy to testify as an expert regarding his analysis. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b619-8\">. The circuit court clerk\u2019s office delivered a copy of the certificate of analysis to Amamath H. Meda, Bell\u2019s counsel, on September 29, 2004, six days before Bell\u2019s first trial. On October 1, 2004, four days prior to trial, the commonwealth\u2019s attorney\u2019s office delivered a copy of the certificate of analysis to Mr. Meda as part of its response to Bell\u2019s request for discovery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b620-8\">. Bell was also convicted of attempting to elude and assault and battery on a law enforcement officer. He does not challenge those convictions on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b620-9\">. <em>See Bell v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 126, 622 S.E.2d 751 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b623-8\">. We note the distinction between a present recollection refreshed, which is merely a form of witness examination, and a past recollection recorded, which is a specific hearsay exception. Under this exception, a witness with no independent recollection of an incident may testify directly from notes or reports if the following requirements are met:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-9\">(1) [t]he witness must have had firsthand knowledge of the event[;]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-10\">(2) [t]he written statement must be an original memorandum made at or near the time of the event, when the witness had a clear and accurate memory of it[;]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-11\">(3) [t]he witness must lack a present recollection of the event[;]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-12\">(4) [t]he witness much vouch for the accuracy of the written memorandum.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-13\"><em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia, </em>\u00a7 3\u20147(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b625-9\">. Even if Code \u00a7 19.2-187 were implicated, the seven-day mailing requirement of this statute would be satisfied, because Bell\u2019s counsel received a copy of the certificate of analysis from the clerk\u2019s office on September 29, 2004, six days before the original trial. We released our first opinion on this matter on December 6, 2005. Bell's retrial did not occur until March 6, 2006. Therefore, upon retrial. Bell had notice of the contents of the certificate of analysis for over 17 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
