FRANK, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Darrio L. Cost, appellant, was convicted, in a bench trial, of possession with the intent to distribute heroin, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248. On appeal, he contends the trial court erred in finding the evidence sufficient to prove intent and erred in finding the seizure of twenty capsules of heroin after a pat down did not violate appellant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. For the reasons stated, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">Portsmouth Police Officer B.C. Davis approached appellant, who was sitting in the passenger\u2019s seat of a vehicle in the parking lot for residents of a public housing property. The officer was investigating whether the occupants in the car were residents of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">When Officer Davis arrived at the window, appellant \u201cimmediately reached across his body towards his left front pants pocket.\u201d Davis asked him what he was reaching for, but appellant did not respond. The officer \u201ctold him to get away from his pocket. He did that another time at which point [Davis] got him out of the vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">Appellant immediately said, \u201cYou can\u2019t search me, but you can pat me down.\u201d The officer first patted down appellant\u2019s left front pocket, the same pocket appellant had earlier reached for. Officer Davis immediately felt numerous capsules. He felt a \u201clarge bulge\u201d and within that \u201clarge bulge\u201d he felt what he believed to be heroin capsules, based on his training and experience. Officer Davis had made 50-60 arrests involving heroin capsules over 4-1/2 years as a police officer. He had also attended several narcotics classes.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Believing the capsules to contain heroin, Officer Davis reached into appellant\u2019s pocket and retrieved a baggie containing twenty capsules of heroin, with a total weight of 1.7 grams. The baggie was found on top of a large wad of money, consisting of a twenty-dollar bill and 108 one-dollar bills. In another pocket, the officer found 5 ten-dollar bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">On cross-examination, Davis testified the capsules could have contained over-the-counter legal drugs such as Motrin or Tylenol, but emphasized he knew it was heroin. He had \u201cnever arrested anybody with Motrin in their pocket.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Detective R.M. Holley qualified as an expert witness in packaging and distribution of narcotics. He indicated one would normally not find ingesting devices with heroin because a user would simply open the capsule and ingest the heroin. A heavy user might use an average of five capsules a day, thus, twenty capsules would represent three to five days use. However, the detective indicated a heavy user \u201cwouldn\u2019t necessarily carry their stash with them.\u201d The number of capsules, when viewed with the denominations of the cash found on appellant, led Detective Holley to conclude that \u201cit\u2019s inconsistent with personal use.\u201d Holley did characterize these circumstances as \u201cfairly borderline.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Additionally, Holley considered the fact that $50 cash was found in one pocket and $128 cash was found in the other pocket. He testified that it is the practice of drug sellers to separate sale proceeds in separate pockets. Holley also indicated that, since a capsule of heroin sells for $10, the 5 ten-dollar bills are relevant to a determination of whether appellant\u2019s possession was inconsistent with personal use. Detective Holley indicated the 108 one-dollar bills are also \u201cfairly consistent with something other than personal use----\u201d Since the arrest occurred on December 14, a day before normal payday, the large quantity of one-dollar bills indicated purchasers are \u201cscraping.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">\n<em>Probable Cause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">On appeal, appellant first contends the police exceeded the scope of the \u201cpat down\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by seizing the capsules found in his pocket. Specifically, he argues that when the police felt the capsules, it was not immediately apparent that the capsules were contraband, concluding the police had no probable cause to seize the contents of his pocket. Appellant maintains that the seizure of the capsules was unconstitutional and should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, \u201c[t]he burden is upon [appellant] to show that this ruling, when the evidence is considered most favorably to the Commonwealth, constituted reversible error.\u201d <em>Fore v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 1007, 1010, 265 S.E.2d 729, 731 (1980). Determining whether police may make a warrantless search or seizure involves issues of both law and fact and is reviewed <em>de novo </em>on appeal. <em>See Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 696-97, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1661-62, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996) (articulating standard for reviewing determinations of reasonable suspicion and probable cause). However, \u201c[i]n performing such analysis, we are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact unless \u2018plainly wrong\u2019 or without evidence to support them[,] and we give due weight to the inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, 25 </em>Va.App. 193, 198, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en </em>banc) (citing <em>Ornelas, </em>517 U.S. at 699, 116 S.Ct. at 1663).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-8\">During an investigative stop authorized under <em>Terry [v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)], an officer may conduct a limited search for concealed weapons if the officer reasonably believes that a criminal suspect may be armed and dangerous. The purpose of this \u201cpat down\u201d search is not to uncover evidence of criminal activity, but to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>permit the officer to conduct his investigation without encountering a violent response.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-5\"><em>Murphy v. Commonwealth, </em>264 Va. 568, 573-74, 570 S.E.2d 836, 839 (2002) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">In <em>Minnesota v. Dickerson, </em>508 U.S. 366, 113 S.Ct. 2130, 124 L.Ed.2d 334 (1993), the Supreme Court discussed the seizure of contraband detected by sense of touch during a \u201cpat down\u201d search. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-7\">If a police officer lawfully pats down a suspect\u2019s outer clothing and feels an object whose contour or mass makes its identity immediately apparent, there has been no invasion of the suspect\u2019s privacy beyond that already authorized by the officer\u2019s search for weapons; if the object is contraband, its warrantless seizure would be justified by the same practical considerations that inhere in the plain-view context.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 375-76, 113 S.Ct. at 2137. \u201cHowever, when the character of the item is not immediately apparent from the \u2018pat down\u2019 search, and the officer does not reasonably suspect that the item is a weapon, further search regarding the item is not allowed because such an evidentiary search is unrelated to the justification for the frisk.\u201d <em>Murphy, </em>264 Va. at 574, 570 S.E.2d at 839. Additionally, the police must have probable cause to believe that the item in question is evidence of a crime or is contraband. <em>Arizona v. Hicks, </em>480 U.S. 321, 326, 107 S.Ct. 1149, 1153, 94 L.Ed.2d 347 (1987).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-9\">The legal standard of probable cause, as the term suggests, relates to probabilities that are based upon the factual and practical considerations in everyday life as perceived by reasonable and prudent persons. The presence or absence of probable cause is not to be examined from the perspective of a legal technician. Rather, probable cause exists when the facts and circumstances within the officer\u2019s knowledge, and of which he has reasonably trustworthy information, alone are sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution to believe that an offense has been or is being committed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number><em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 816, 820, 284 S.E.2d 833, 836 (1981).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">\u201cIn determining whether probable cause exists[,] courts will test what the totality of the circumstances meant to police officers trained in analyzing the observed conduct for purposes of crime control.\u201d <em>Hollis v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 874, 877, 223 S.E.2d 887, 889 (1976). \u201c \u2018Probable cause requires only a probability or substantial chance of criminal activity, not an actual showing of such activity.\u2019\u201d <em>Boyd v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 179, 188-89, 402 S.E.2d 914, 920 (1991) (quoting <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 243 n. 13, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2335 n. 13, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983)). Moreover, an investigating officer does not have to \u201cdeal with hard certainties, but with probabilities,\u201d and is permitted to make \u201ccommon-sense conclusions about human behavior\u201d in assessing a situation. <em>Texas v. Brown, </em>460 U.S. 730, 742, 103 S.Ct. 1535, 1543, 75 L.Ed.2d 502 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Thus, the narrow issue before us is whether the police, based on the totality of the circumstances, had probable cause to believe the capsules contained an illicit drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Appellant relies on <em>Murphy, </em>264 Va. 568, 570 S.E.2d 836, to support his argument. In <em>Murphy, </em>during a \u201cpat down,\u201d Officer Harvey felt a plastic bag, which, based on the officer\u2019s training and experience, led him to believe it contained marijuana. <em>Id. </em>at 571, 570 S.E.2d at 837. The officer then removed the plastic bag, which, in fact, contained marijuana. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court reversed Murphy\u2019s conviction, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjG\">Harvey\u2019s testimony established only that the character of the object as a plastic bag was immediately apparent from the \u201cpat down\u201d search, and that he knew from his training and experience that plastic bags often are used to package marijuana. This information was insufficient under the holding in <em>Dickerson </em>to establish probable cause to search Murphy\u2019s pocket because Harvey\u2019s conclusion that the bag contained marijuana was not based on his tactile perception of the bag\u2019s contents. Rather, his sense of touch revealed only that there was a plastic bag in Murphy\u2019s pocket. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>Officer Harvey lacked probable cause to seize the item from Murphy\u2019s pocket because the character of the bag\u2019s contents as contraband was not immediately apparent from the frisk.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Asp\"><em>Id. </em>at 574-75, 570 S.E.2d at 839.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Similarly, in <em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 146, 400 S.E.2d 191 (1991), the police officer patted down Harris, and felt a film canister that he believed contained illegal drugs. The officer seized the canister, opened it, and found illegal drugs. <em>Id. </em>at 148, 400 S.E.2d at 192. In finding the officer did not have probable cause during the pat down to believe the canister contained illegal drugs, the Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtX\">[The officer] knew from his personal experience of working \u201cplain clothes assignments\u201d and \u201cmaking arrests\u201d that certain people kept their narcotics and drugs in film canisters and \u201cthings of that nature.\u201d However, law-abiding citizens, on a daily basis, also use film canisters to store film, which is a legitimate use. At best, [the officer] had a \u201chunch\u201d and a report from an informant. However, the record in this case does not contain any evidence that the informant was reliable or credible. <em>See Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 230, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2328, 76 L.Ed.2d 527, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983) (such evidence \u201cmay usefully illuminate the ... question whether there is \u2018probable cause\u2019 \u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 154, 400 S.E.2d at 196 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">The Commonwealth urges us to distinguish <em>Murphy </em>on its facts. The Commonwealth argues that unlike <em>Murphy, </em>Officer Davis immediately recognized the items as capsules of heroin similar to those he detected in his 50-60 prior heroin capsule arrests. The Commonwealth contends that rather than simply feeling a plastic bag as in <em>Murphy, </em>Davis felt numerous capsules which he knew to be heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">In <em>Murphy </em>and <em>Harris, </em>the only issue before the Supreme Court of Virginia was whether it was immediately apparent to the officers that the plastic bag or the film canister contained illicit drugs. In <em>Murphy, </em>the officer\u2019s conclusion that the bag contained marijuana was not based on his tactile perception of the bag\u2019s contents. Rather, his sense of touch revealed only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>that there was a plastic bag in Murphy\u2019s pocket. <em>Murphy, </em>264 Va. at 574, 570 S.E.2d at 839. Here, the officer actually felt the numerous capsules, which he knew to be contraband. A plastic bag could accommodate any number of items, whereas a capsule, by its nature, is an individual container designed solely for dispensing a prearranged dosage of medication. In addition, there was no evidence of furtive gestures in <em>Murphy </em>or <em>Harris. </em>In <em>Harris, </em>although there was evidence that the officer saw \u201c \u2018a lot of overt movement in the vehicle\u2019 with its occupants reaching and \u2018bobbing around\u2019 \u201d and Harris refused to get out of the vehicle, 241 Va. at 148, 400 S.E.2d at 192, these facts were not part of the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis. Rather, the analysis was premised on the officer\u2019s \u201chunch\u201d that the canister contained illegal drugs. <em>Id. </em>at 154, 400 S.E.2d at 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">However, in the instant case, when the officer approached appellant, he \u201cimmediately reached across his body towards his left front pants pocket.\u201d When asked what he was reaching for, appellant did not respond. The officer told appellant to \u201cget away from the pocket,\u201d and appellant again reached toward his left front pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">In determining whether there was probable cause to seize the capsules located in the same pocket appellant reached for, the trial court could properly infer appellant was attempting to conceal the illegal contents of that pocket. <em>See Parker v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 96, 107, 496 S.E.2d 47, 53 (1998) (noting appellant\u2019s act of grabbing the waistband of his boxer shorts and pulling them \u201cto the side, up and down\u201d in an apparent effort to prevent the crack cocaine from falling to the ground was a consideration in evaluating whether the arresting officer had probable cause that appellant was engaged in criminal activity).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-6\">Furtive gestures alone have been held insufficient to establish probable cause. <em>See People v. Superior Court, </em>3 Cal.3d 807, 91 Cal.Rptr. 729, 478 P.2d 449, 454-55 (1970) (explaining why mere furtive gestures, without more, do not establish probable cause). However, furtive gestures cou<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>pled with other indicia <em>of </em>criminal engagement may suffice to establish probable cause. <em>See Sibron v. New York, </em>392 U.S. 40, 66, 88 S.Ct. 1889, 1904, 20 L.Ed.2d 917 (1968) (noting that \u201cdeliberately furtive actions ... at the approach of strangers or law officers are strong indicia of <em>mens rea, </em>and when coupled with specific knowledge on the part of the officer relating the suspect to the evidence of crime, they are proper factors to be considered in a decision to make an arrest\u201d (emphasis added)); 2 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure </em>\u00a7 3.6(d), at 319 (3d. ed. 1996) (\u201cif police see a person in possession of a highly suspicious object or some object which is not identifiable but which because of other circumstances is reasonably suspected to be contraband, <em>and then </em>observe that person make an apparent attempt to conceal that object ..., probable cause is then present\u201d (emphasis added)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-5\"><em>Copeland v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 424, 434, 592 S.E.2d 391, 395-96 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">In addition to appellant reaching over to the same pocket containing the capsules, appellant also failed to heed the officer\u2019s warning to \u201cget away from his pocket.\u201d Appellant thus continued this furtive behavior despite the officer\u2019s command to refrain.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">While feeling the capsules alone may not be sufficient probable cause, the totality of the circumstances gave the officer probable cause to believe the numerous capsules contained illicit drugs. Appellant attempted to conceal the drugs, failed to heed the officer\u2019s demand that he cease the furtive behavior, and failed to respond to the officer\u2019s questions. <em>See generally </em>2 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Search &amp; Seizure </em>\u00a7 3.6(f), at 364 (4th ed. 2004) (explaining that \u201crefusal to answer is one factor which an officer may consider, together with evidence that gave rise to his prior suspicion, in determining whether there are grounds for arrest\u201d). Based on the totality of the circumstances, consisting of furtive movements and suspicious conduct, culminating in the officer feeling numerous capsules, which based on the officer\u2019s training and experience contained heroin, the officer had probable cause to seize the capsules.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>The trial court did not err in denying the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">\n<em>Sufficiency</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Appellant next contends the evidence was not sufficient to prove he had the intent to distribute heroin. He does not contest that he possessed the drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">When addressing the sufficiency of the evidence, we \u201c \u2018presume the judgment of the trial court to be correct\u2019 and reverse only if the trial court\u2019s decision is \u2018plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kelly v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 250, 257, 584 S.E.2d 444, 447 (2003) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 96, 99, 570 S.E.2d 875, 876-77 (2002)). In practical terms, a reviewing court does not \u201c \u2018ask itself whether <em>it </em>believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stevens v. Commonwealth, </em>46 Va.App. 234, 249, 616 S.E.2d 754, 761 (2005) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-19, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)) (emphasis in original), <em>aff'd, </em>272 Va. 481, 634 S.E.2d 305 (2006). We ask only whether \u201c \u2018any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 249, 616 S.E.2d at 761 (quoting <em>Kelly, </em>41 Va.App. at 257, 584 S.E.2d at 447). \u201c \u2018This familiar standard gives full play to the responsibility of the trier of fact fairly to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kelly, </em>41 Va.App. at 257-58, 584 S.E.2d at 447 (quoting <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. at 2789). Thus, we do not \u201csubstitute our judgment for that of the trier of fact\u201d even if our opinion were to differ. <em>Wactor v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 375, 380, 564 S.E.2d 160, 162 (2002).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">\u201cBecause direct proof of intent [to distribute drugs] is often impossible, it must be shown by circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Servis v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 507, 524, 371 S.E.2d 156, 165 (1988). Such evidence may include the quantity of drugs and cash possessed and whether appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>used drugs. Possession of a large sum of money, especially in small denominations, and the absence of any paraphernalia suggestive of personal use, also are regularly recognized as factors indicating an intent to distribute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-5\"><em>Welshman v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 20, 37, 502 S.E.2d 122, 130 (1998) <em>(en </em>banc) (other citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">In accord with settled standards of appellate review, we view the evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from that evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the party prevailing below. <em>Yopp v. Hodges, </em>43 Va.App. 427, 430, 598 S.E.2d 760, 762 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Detective Holley, qualified as an expert in packaging and distribution of narcotics, concluded the twenty capsules are inconsistent with personal use. Expert testimony, usually that of a police officer familiar with narcotics, is routinely offered to prove the significance of the weight and packaging of drugs, regarding whether possession is for personal use or for distribution. <em>White v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 446, 453, 482 S.E.2d 876, 879 (1997). Holley opined that while a heavy user might use an average of five capsules a day, such a heavy user \u201cwouldn\u2019t necessarily carry their stash with them.\u201d The detective further considered the amount of cash and the denominations found on appellant. Since heroin capsules sell for $10 per capsule, Holley indicated the 5 ten-dollar bills were a factor in reaching his conclusion. He also pointed out that appellant had $50 cash in one pocket and $128 in the other. Holley testified that it is the practice of drug dealers to separate sale proceeds in separate pockets.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">The trial court was entitled to conclude that appellant intended to distribute heroin. <em>See McCain v. Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 483, 493, 545 S.E.2d 541, 547 (2001) (finding that the quantity of the drugs seized, the manner in which they are packaged, and the presence of equipment related to drug distribution are indicia of distribution); <em>Hunter v. Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 569, 570, 193 S.E.2d 779, 780 (1973) (holding that proof that quantity possessed exceeds that normally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>intended for personal use, without more, is sufficient to show intent to distribute).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the trial court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress. Additionally, the trial court did not err in finding the evidence sufficient to convict appellant of possession of heroin with the intent to distribute. Accordingly, the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b268-9\">.
