ARTHUR KELSEY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">Following the entry of a conditional guilty plea, the trial court convicted Keith I. Glenn of robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery. On appeal, Glenn argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress. A divided panel of this Court agreed with Glenn and vacated his convictions. <em>Glenn v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 556, 633 S.E.2d 205 (2006). At the Commonwealth\u2019s request, we set aside our panel opinion and reconsidered the matter <em>en banc. </em>Finding no error in the trial court\u2019s decision, we now affirm Glenn\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-11\">On appeal from a denial of a suppression motion, we review the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, giving it the benefit of any reasonable inferences.\u201d <em>Kyer v. Commonwealth, </em>45 Va.App. 473, 477, 612 S.E.2d 213, 215 (2005) <em>(en banc) </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-12\">Believing Glenn had just robbed a man, police officers went to the home of Glenn\u2019s grandparents where Glenn had been living for about two months. Glenn answered the door and was immediately arrested. The officers asked Glenn\u2019s grandfather for permission to search his home. Unable to speak because of a medical condition, the grandfather nodded his head in agreement. The officers then asked the grandfather if Glenn paid rent. The grandfather shook his head no. When asked if Glenn was in fact his grandson, the grandfather nodded yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>The officers went to a bedroom identified by Glenn as the \u201croom he slept in\u201d and found, among other things, boxes containing his grandmother\u2019s clothing. The officers then went to a second room, identified by Glenn as a room that he also slept in on occasion. There, the officers discovered a backpack on the floor. Nothing suggested to the officers the backpack was locked, used for any particular purpose, or owned by any particular person. The officers opened the backpack and found the robbery victim\u2019s cell phone. When questioned later about the robbery, Glenn gave police a full confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Prior to trial, Glenn filed a motion to suppress seeking to exclude from evidence the cell phone found in the backpack.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the suppression hearing, Glenn\u2019s grandmother testified that the backpack belonged to Glenn. The grandmother, however, conceded that Glenn did not pay rent. Nor did he have exclusive access to, or control over, any room in the house. She agreed to the characterization of the first room searched as \u201cKeith\u2019s room\u201d and \u201chis bedroom.\u201d The woman\u2019s clothes in Glenn\u2019s bedroom were hers, she admitted. She also said she kept a box of her clothes in the second room. There were no locks on the doors of either room. The police officers added that the doors of both rooms were open at the time of their search.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The trial court denied Glenn\u2019s motion to suppress, reasoning that the grandfather\u2019s consent to search was given \u201cwithout reservation or qualification.\u201d The scope of this consent, the court held, provided the officers with apparent authority to search the entire house and to open the backpack found during the search. Following the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress, Glenn entered a conditional guilty plea pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-254 and appealed his convictions for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>robbery in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-58 and conspiracy to commit robbery in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Though the ultimate question whether the officers violated the Fourth Amendment triggers <em>de novo </em>appellate scrutiny, \u201cwe defer to the trial court\u2019s findings of \u2018historical fact\u2019 and give \u2018due weight to the inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u2019 \u201d <em>Slayton v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 101, 105, 582 S.E.2d 448, 449-50 (2003) (citation omitted). \u201cTo prevail on appeal, the defendant must show that the trial court\u2019s denial of his suppression motion, when the evidence is considered in the light most favorable to the prosecution, was reversible error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 105, 582 S.E.2d at 450 (quoting <em>Whitfield v. Commonwealth, </em>265 Va. 358, 361, 576 S.E.2d 463, 464 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">In this case, Glenn argues that his grandfather\u2019s consent to search the home did not extend to opening the backpack and examining its contents. The trial court disagreed, as do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">Under settled Fourth Amendment principles, \u201ca search authorized by consent is wholly valid.\u201d <em>Kyer, </em>45 Va.App. at 483, 612 S.E.2d at 218 (quoting <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 222, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 2045, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973)). \u201cPolice officers act in full accord with the law when they ask citizens for consent. It reinforces the rule of law for the citizen to advise the police of his or her wishes and for the police to act in reliance on that understanding.\u201d <em>Barkley v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 682, 696, 576 S.E.2d 234, 241 (2003) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">Consent to search can be given by one with actual authority or apparent authority. Actual authority exists if the consenting party has a privacy interest in the premises to be searched, and thus, a concomitant right to waive that interest and authorize the search. <em>See United States v. Matlock, </em>415 U.S. 164, 170-71, 94 S.Ct. 988, 993, 39 L.Ed.2d 242 (1974). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Apparent authority exists if it merely <em>appears </em>to a reasonable officer that the consenting party has \u201cauthority over the premises.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Rodriguez, </em>497 U.S. 177, 188, 110 S.Ct. 2793, 2801, 111 L.Ed.2d 148 (1990). When multiple parties share privacy interests in the premises, any one of them with \u201ccommon authority over the premises\u201d may consent to the search despite the lack of express concurrence by others possessing a shared privacy interest. <em>Id. </em>at 181, 110 S.Ct. at 2797.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Here, the trial court found that the grandfather owned the home and consented to its search. The police knew Glenn was staying in his grandfather\u2019s home and confirmed Glenn did not have the status of a renter. From these facts, the police had ample reason to accept the grandfather\u2019s consent to search the home and every room in it. No circumstances suggested to the police that Glenn had preserved a private enclave within the home or had somehow undermined the grandfather\u2019s access to, or authority over, any space within his home. The police, therefore, crossed no Fourth Amendment boundary by searching either of the two rooms in which Glenn slept.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Perhaps so, Glenn argues, but that boundary was crossed when the police opened the backpack and looked inside. We disagree. Consent to search a space generally includes consent to search containers within that space. <em>See Florida v. Jimeno, </em>500 U.S. 248, 251, 111 S.Ct. 1801, 1804, 114 L.Ed.2d 297 (1991). This principle applies to automobiles, <em>Wyoming v. Houghton, </em>526 U.S. 295, 302, 119 S.Ct. 1297, 1301, 143 L.Ed.2d 408 (1999), as well as physical premises, <em>United States v. Melgar, </em>227 F.3d 1038, 1041-42 (7th Cir.2000). \u201cThe rule regarding containers found in automobiles applies also to containers found in premises.\u201d 27 James W. Moore <em>et al., Moore\u2019s Federal Practice &amp; Procedure </em>\u00a7 641.44, at 641-151 (3d ed. 2006). \u201cA grant of consent to search premises includes consent to search closed containers found within the premises <em>unless </em>the officers have reliable information that the container is not under the control of the person granting consent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added); <em>see also State v. Odom, </em>722 N.W.2d 370, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>373 (N.D.2006) (\u201cSpecific consent to search every container is not needed when consent to search a room is given.\u201d); <em>see generally 4 </em>Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure </em>\u00a7 8.3(g), at 183 (4th ed. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">This conclusion stems from the observation that a \u201clawful search of fixed premises generally extends to the entire area in which the object of the search may be found and is not limited by the possibility that separate acts of entry or opening may be required to complete the search.\u201d <em>United States v. Ross, </em>456 U.S. 798, 820-21, 102 S.Ct. 2157, 2170-71, 72 L.Ed.2d 572 (1982) (footnote omitted). The consent to search a home may reasonably include the \u201cauthority to open closets, chests, drawers, and containers\u201d in which the object of the search may be found. <em>Id. </em>at 821, 102 S.Ct. at 2171; <em>see also United States v. Ladell, </em>127 F.3d 622, 624 (7th Cir.1997). \u2018When a legitimate search is under way, and when its purpose and its limits have been precisely defined, nice distinctions between closets, drawers, and containers, in the case of a home, or between glove compartments, upholstered seats, trunks, and wrapped packages, in the case of a vehicle, must give way to the interest in the prompt and efficient completion of the task at hand.\u201d <em>Ross, </em>456 U.S. at 821, 102 S.Ct. at 2171 (footnote omitted). This reasoning \u201capplies equally to all containers, as indeed we believe it must.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 822, 102 S.Ct. at 2171.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Practically speaking, \u201cthe real question for closed container searches is which way the risk of uncertainty should run.\u201d <em>Melgar, </em>227 F.3d at 1041. \u201cIs such a search permissible only if the police have positive knowledge that the closed container is also under the authority of the person who originally consented to the search ... or is it permissible if the police do not have reliable information that the container is <em>not </em>under the authorizer\u2019s control.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). We agree with the Seventh Circuit that it must be the latter. Any different approach</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-7\">would impose an impossible burden on the police. It would mean that they could never search closed containers within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>a dwelling ... without asking the person whose consent is being given <em>ex ante </em>about every item they might encounter. We note that there is no possibility of such a rule for automobile searches, because the Supreme Court has already authorized this type of container search in that context. <em>See Ross, supra; Houghton, supra. </em>Our conclusion here rests in part on the discussion in <em>Houghton </em>that indicates that the container rule rests on general principles of Fourth Amendment law that do not depend on the special attributes of automobile searches.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-5\"><em>Melgar, </em>227 F.3d at 1042 (emphasis in original); <em>see also Ladell, </em>127 F.3d at 624 (holding that a mother had \u201capparent authority to consent\u201d to a search of her adult son\u2019s bedroom, including a closed vinyl bag found in the bedroom).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Reinforcing these traditional principles, <em>Georgia v. Randolph, 547 </em>U.S. 103, 126 S.Ct. 1515, 1520, 164 L.Ed.2d 208 (2006), addressed the underpinnings of the apparent authority doctrine as applied to the \u201cco-occupant consent\u201d situation. <em>Randolph </em>recognized that police must be permitted to rely on \u201cwidely shared social expectations\u201d when discerning the apparent authority of one person to consent to a search of an area in which another has a dual privacy interest, particularly if the relationship between them falls into \u201csome recognized hierarchy\u201d apparent to the officers. <em>Id. </em>at 1521, 1523.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>\u201cDisputed permission,\u201d however, undermines that reliance because no reasonable officer could rely on one co-inhabitant\u2019s apparent authority to speak for another when the person spoken for is, at that very moment, \u201cexpressly refusing consent\u201d to the search. <em>Id. </em>at 1524, 1526. But if the spoken-for inhabitant does not object, the speaking inhabitant\u2019s apparent authority remains secure. As the majority in <em>Randolph </em>conceded, \u201cwe have to admit that we are drawing a fine line; if a potential defendant with self-interest in objecting is in fact at the door and objects, the co-tenant\u2019s permission does not suffice for a reasonable search, whereas the potential objector, nearby but not invited to take part in the threshold colloquy, loses out.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1527. This approach places the burden on the potential objector to assert his objection. For the very reason that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-5\">it would be unjustifiably impractical to require the police to take affirmative steps to confirm the actual authority of a consenting individual whose authority was apparent, we think it would needlessly limit the capacity of the police to respond to ostensibly legitimate opportunities in the field if we were to hold that reasonableness required the police to take affirmative steps to find a potentially objecting co-tenant before acting on the permission they had already received.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-6\"><em>Id. </em>If this were not the rule, \u201cevery co-tenant consent case would turn into a test about the adequacy of the police\u2019s efforts to consult with a potential objector.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1527-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Consistent with these principles, we hold the police officers had reasonable grounds to believe that the grandfather\u2019s consent to search his house included permission to open a backpack found on the floor in one of the rooms. The grandfather owned the home and had not encumbered his prerogatives as a homeowner by entering into any sort of contractual relationship with Glenn. His relationship with Glenn was not one of landlord-tenant, but of grandfather-grandson.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>Equally important, nothing about the backpack itself put the officers on notice that Glenn claimed an <em>exclusive </em>privacy interest in it. The backpack had no lock or, for that matter, anything else ostensibly designed to inhibit someone from opening it. The backpack was found on the floor of a room sometimes used by Glenn, not squirreled away in some secretive place within his principal bedroom. No identifying information on the backpack revealed who owned it, used it, or had access to it. The officers did not know who left it there or who, if anyone, intended to come back for it. Under such circumstances, the officers were not required to speculate\u2014as Glenn implicitly suggests\u2014that grandsons, but never grandfathers, use backpacks.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Applying settled principles of apparent authority, we hold the grandfather\u2019s unqualified consent to search his house included permission to open an unlocked, unidentified, unclaimed backpack found in plain view on the floor of one of its rooms.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because the trial court correctly denied Glenn\u2019s motion to suppress, we affirm his convictions for robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b463-7\">. Glenn also filed a motion to suppress his confession on Fifth Amendment grounds. The trial court overruled that motion. Pursuant to Code \u00a7 17.1-407(D), a three-judge panel of this Court denied Glenn's petition for appeal on this ground.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b467-7\">. The dissent comes to the opposite conclusion based on the belief that an individual has a \"heightened expectation of privacy in the contents of a closed container.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 425, 642 S.E.2d at 288; <em>see also Glenn v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 556, 569, 633 S.E.2d 205, 212 (2006). This proposition, however, was accepted only by the two-Justice dissent in <em>Jimeno </em>(from which the quoted language comes), not from the <em>Jimeno </em>majority's reasoning or holding. <em>Florida v. Jimeno, </em>500 U.S. 248, 253, 111 S.Ct. 1801, 1805, 114 L.Ed.2d 297 (1991) (Marshall &amp; Stevens, JJ., dissenting). We also find unpersuasive the dissent\u2019s reliance on <em>United States v. Chadwick, </em>433 U.S. 1, 13, 97 S.Ct. 2476, 2484-85, 53 L.Ed.2d 538 (1977), given that it has been expressly abrogated (in favor of the reasoning in <em>Ross) </em>by <em>California v. Acevedo, </em>500 U.S. 565, 573, 578, 111 S.Ct. 1982, 1990, 114 L.Ed.2d 619 (1991) (applying <em>Ross </em>and agreeing with the <em>\"Chadwick </em>dissenters\" who \u201cpredicted that the container rule would have \u2018the perverse result of allowing fortuitous circumstances to control the outcome\u2019 of various searches\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b469-10\">. Given our holding, we need not address the Commonwealth's additional argument that Glenn\u2019s confession renders harmless any error associated with the suppression ruling. The grant of <em>en banc </em>review vacates the prior panel opinion <em>in toto, </em>including its holding that harmless error principles do not apply to appeals of conditional guilty pleas. We thus do not resolve the differing views expressed by the panel majority and dissent on this subject. <em>Cf. Glenn, </em>48 Va.App. at 577-87, 633 S.E.2d at 216-21 (rejecting harmless error), with <em>id. </em>at 598-604, 633 S.E.2d at 226-29 (applying harmless error).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b469-8\">HUMPHREYS, J., with whom BENTON, ELDER and CLEMENTS, JJ., join, dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">From a nod of the head from an elderly stroke victim, the majority finds apparent authority, as a matter of law, to search not merely a home, but any closed containers found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>within. Moreover, the majority finds that no \u201creasonableness\u201d standard requires law enforcement officers to clarify the scope of such consent, despite such officers having ready access to all the individuals who might possess a reasonable expectation of privacy over the premises and any closed containers within. Because I find no authority in constitutional precedent for such an expansive view of the Fourth Amendment waiver doctrine, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">7. <em>The Scope of the Consent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">I agree with the majority that in this case, Glenn\u2019s grandfather\u2014the owner of the premises\u2014\u201cshar[ed] common authority\u201d over the bedroom and, thus, possessed the actual authority to consent to a search of that room. <em>See, e.g., Georgia v.

Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 540, 542, 425 S.E.2d 534, 535 (1993). Thus, I agree that the general search of the premises, including the bedroom, did not violate Glenn\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. <em>See Matlock, </em>415 U.S. at 171, 94 S.Ct. at 993 (\u201cPermission to search [may be] obtained from a third party who possesses] common authority over or other sufficient relationship to the premises or effects sought to be inspected.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">However, I must part company with the majority with respect to whether the grandfather\u2019s consent to the search of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>Ms home also vested the officers with the authority to open and search Glenn\u2019s backpack. <em>See Randolph, </em>126 S.Ct. at 1522 (noting, for example, that, \u201cwhen it comes to searching through bureau drawers, there will be instances in wMch even a person clearly belonging on the premises as an occupant may lack any perceived authority to consent\u201d); <em>United States v.

For the following reasons, I would hold that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">According to settled principles, a third party, with standing to do so, may validly consent to the search of a closed container, even though the actual owner of the container has a heightened expectation of privacy in its contents. <em>See, e.g., Frazier v.

Accordingly, if the facts, as the officer reasonably believed them to be, would have justified an objectively reasonable belief that the third party either owned or maintained joint access or control for most purposes over a closed container found within the area being searched, the resulting search of that closed container does not violate the Fourth Amendment. <em>United States v.

Melgar, </em>227 F.3d 1038, 1041-42 (7th Cir.2000), the majority finds in a general consent to search a home, apparent authority for a complete waiver of Fourth Amendment protections over any containers found within. In my view, the analysis of the majority improperly conflates two distinct constitutional principles: the proper scope of a consent to search and the proper scope of a warrantless search based upon probable cause. In this case, it matters not a whit where the evidence the police were seeking might be found. The only issue is the contextual breadth of Glenn\u2019s grandfather\u2019s waiver of Fourth Amendment protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Unlike the majority, I do not read either Ross<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or Jimeno,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> both of which were automobile search cases, as retreating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>from the fundamental principles laid down in <em>Chambers v. Maroney, </em>399 U.S. 42, 90 S.Ct. 1975, 26 L.Ed.2d 419 (1970). As Justice White noted in <em>Chambers,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATr\">the guaranty of freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures by the Fourth Amendment has been construed, practically since the beginning of the Government, as recognizing a necessary difference between a search of a store, dwelling house or other structure in respect of which a proper official warrant readily may be obtained, and a search of a ship, motor boat, wagon or automobile, for contraband goods, where it is not practicable to secure a warrant because the vehicle can be quickly moved out of the locality or jurisdiction....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-5\"><em>Chambers, </em>399 U.S. at 48, 90 S.Ct. at 1979. Moreover, <em>Wyoming v. Houghton, </em>526 U.S. 295, 303, 119 S.Ct. 1297, 1302, 143 L.Ed.2d 408 (1999), reiterated the Supreme Court\u2019s recognition of the reduced expectation of privacy in automobiles stating,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">drivers[] possess a reduced expectation of privacy with regard to the property that they transport in cars, which travel public thoroughfares, seldom serve as ... the repository of personal effects, are subjected to police stop and examination to enforce pervasive governmental controls as an everyday occurrence, and, finally, are exposed to traffic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>accidents that may render all their contents open to public scrutiny.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">(Internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Here, in contrast to an automobile, the locus of this search was a home, and a closed and constitutionally protected backpack within that home.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, I find the issue in this case to be anything but complex. It is simply whether, when considering the totality of the circumstances, an objective police officer could have reasonably believed that the grandfather used, controlled, or had unrestricted access to the backpack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>and its contents. The majority answers this question in the affirmative based solely upon the presence of the backpack in the home. The majority ignores the fact that the rooms and the backpack were searched solely because of their nexus to Glenn, and not because of any nexus to his grandfather.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The record, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, establishes that Glenn lived with his grandparents, but did not have exclusive control over the rooms searched. However, the record also establishes that Officer Ferguson focused his search exclusively on the rooms identified by Glenn as those he \u201cslept in.\u201d In fact, the room in which Officer Ferguson found the backpack had a pair of men\u2019s pants on the bed, men\u2019s clothing hanging in the closet, a cell phone lying on the closet floor, and a backpack on the bedroom floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">With respect to the backpack, it was closed, but not locked or otherwise sealed shut. <em>Cf. United States v. Block, </em>590 F.2d 535, 541 (4th Cir.1978) (although mother could consent to search of house, she could not consent to search of locked footlocker found in her son\u2019s room). The backpack was not tucked under the mattress or otherwise hidden from view, <em>cf. Commonwealth v. Sardone, </em>10 Mass. L. Rep. 97, 1999 WL 1319236 (Super.Ct. 1999) (mother could not consent to the search of her son\u2019s knapsack that was at least partially under the foot of the bed in an area not visible from the door), and there were no marks or tags on the knapsack that would indicate its ownership. From these facts, the question of whether the grandfather owned, used, or otherwise controlled the backpack was ambiguous, at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Given awareness by the police officers of the ambiguities present here with respect to the apparent ownership of the backpack, I would hold that the police could not \u201cinfer such authority [to search the backpack] merely from [the consenter\u2019s] ownership of the house.\u201d <em>Salinas-Cano, </em>959 F.2d at 866 (internal quotations omitted) (second alteration in original); <em>State v. Tonroy, </em>32 Kan.App.2d 920, 92 P.3d 1116, 1120 (2004) (\u201c[C]onsent by an owner or tenant of a residence does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>necessarily give the police consent to search closed containers within the residence that belong to others.\u201d). <em>See also Basinski, </em>226 F.3d at 834 (\u201cFor purposes of closed containers, mere possession of the container by a third party does not necessarily give rise to a reasonable belief that the third party has authority to consent to a search of its contents.\u201d); <em>Salinas-Cano, </em>959 F.2d at 866 (\u201cTo hold that an officer may reasonably find authority to consent solely on the basis of the presence of a [container] in the home of another would render meaningless the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection of such [containers].\u201d). Indeed, the evidence supports only one reasonable inference. That is, the backpack was opened and searched because Officer Ferguson believed it belonged to Glenn, and not because he believed it belonged to his grandfather.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Moreover, although not clearly addressed by the Supreme Court of the United States, many lower courts have held that the burden of proving apparent authority \u201c \u2018cannot be met if [law enforcement] agents, faced with an ambiguous situation, nevertheless proceed without making further inquiry.\u2019 \u201d <em>Salinas-Cano, </em>959 F.2d at 864 (quoting <em>United States v. Whitfield, </em>939 F.2d 1071, 1075 (D.C.Cir.1991)). Thus, if the officers \u201cdo not learn enough, if the circumstances make it unclear whether the property about to be searched is subject to \u2018mutual use\u2019 by the person giving consent, \u2018then [a] warrantless [search] is unlawful without further inquiry.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Whitfield, </em>939 F.2d at 1075); <em>accord United States v. Waller, </em>426 F.3d 838, 846 (6th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Chun Yen Chiu, </em>857 F.Supp. 353, 361 (D.N.J.1993); <em>People v. Jenkins, </em>22 Cal.4th 900, 95 Cal.Rptr.2d 377, 997 P.2d 1044, 1097-98 (2000); <em>People v. Gonzalez, </em>88 N.Y.2d 289, 644 N.Y.S.2d 673, 667 N.E.2d 323, 326-27 (1996); <em>Riordan v. State, </em>905 S.W.2d 765, 771 (Tex. App.1995); <em>State v. Kieffer, </em>217 Wis.2d 531, 577 N.W.2d 352, 359-60 (1998). I agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">We have often noted that the touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness. <em>See, e.g., Bryant, </em>39 Va.App. at 471-72, 573 S.E.2d at 335; <em>Weathers v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 652, 658, 529 S.E.2d 847, 850 (2000). Considering the heightened expectation of privacy that exists in closed contain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>ers, I believe that, when permitted by the circumstances, \u201creasonableness\u201d requires officers acting under third-party consent to make reasonable attempts to resolve any apparent ambiguity in the ownership or control over any closed containers located within the place being searched. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>497 U.S. at 188-89, 110 S.Ct. at 2801 (holding that, when law enforcement officers obtain consent to search pursuant to apparent authority, if the \u201csurrounding circumstances [are] such that a reasonable person would doubt [that authority exists] and not act upon [the consent] without further inquiry, ... <em>then [the] warrantless [search] without further inquiry is unlawful unless authority actually exists\u201d </em>(emphasis added)).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Hence, absent some affirmative indicia that the party consenting to a general search of the premises either owns or maintains joint access and control for most purposes over a closed container found within the place being searched, law enforcement officers should not proceed further without first determining that the third party has an interest in the container sufficient to vest that party with the authority to consent to its search.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> To hold otherwise encourages law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>enforcement officers to remain deliberately ignorant of whether the party consenting to the search has any interest in the closed container, thereby heightening the risk that those officers will infringe upon the Fourth Amendment rights of the absent owner. Moreover, although I agree that there is a risk of uncertainty that a citizen\u2019s privacy will be invaded without justification, I disagree with the majority as to \u201cwhich way the risk of uncertainty should run.\u201d Instead of assigning that risk to the citizen, I would assign that risk to the police officers who are not relying on probable cause or an emergency situation, but who seek to rely exclusively on a mistaken perception of who may consent to the search.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">In this case, although Glenn did not object to the search of his backpack, neither did he consent. He was instructed by the officers to wait in the living room while Ferguson conducted the search of the bedrooms. Thus, even if he had wanted to object to the search of his backpack, Glenn was not given the opportunity to identify the backpack as belonging to him until after it had been opened.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> And, because it was ambigu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>ous at best as to who owned the backpack, and because both Glenn and his grandfather were mere steps away, a reasonable officer easily could, and should have made further inquiries and asked either the grandfather or Glenn for permission to search it. <em>See Salinas-Cano, </em>959 F.2d at 864. Because Officer Ferguson failed to do so, I would hold that the search exceeded the scope of the consent, and was thus \u201cunlawful.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The majority argues, however, that the Supreme Court\u2019s recent holding in <em>Randolph </em>eschews any duty to inquire. In support of this proposition, the majority quotes language from <em>Randolph, </em>opining that \u201cit would be unjustifiably impractical to require the police to take affirmative steps to confirm the actual authority of a consenting individual <em>whose authority was </em>apparent....\u201d 126 S.Ct. at 1527 (emphasis added). For the reasons discussed above, however, the grandfather\u2019s authority to consent to a search of the backpack was not apparent under these circumstances. The language quoted by the majority is, therefore, not applicable in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Moreover, unlike this case, <em>Randolph </em>involved \u201cdisputed permission\u201d by individuals who each inarguably had <em>actual </em>authority to waive Fourth Amendment protections over the place searched. As Justice Souter expressly reaffirmed in <em>Randolph, </em>society recognizes that a houseguest has a legitimate expectation of privacy in his host\u2019s home. <em>See Minnesota v. Olson, </em>495 U.S. 91, 98, 110 S.Ct. 1684, 1688-89, 109 L.Ed.2d 85 (1990). As in <em>Olson, </em>Glenn\u2019s status was that of a houseguest, and as in <em>Olson, </em>Glenn\u2019s grandfather had no authority to consent to a search of Glenn\u2019s belongings merely by virtue of their presence in the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">In sum, although the facts of this case would \u201cwarrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief\u2019 that the grandfather \u201chad authority over the premises,\u201d in my view, those same facts were insufficient to \u201cwarrant a man of reasonable caution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>in the belief\u2019 that Glenn\u2019s grandfather either owned or shared control of the backpack. <em>Rodriguez, </em>497 U.S. at 188-89, 110 S.Ct. at 2801 (internal quotations omitted). If so, it then follows that the Commonwealth failed to prove that the grandfather possessed the apparent authority to consent to the search of the backpack. And, because an objective law enforcement officer could not have reasonably believed that the grandfather had the authority to consent to a search of the backpack, I believe that the resulting search violated the Fourth Amendment. Accordingly, I dissent from the analysis and holding of the majority, and would hold that the trial court erred in denying Glenn\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">\n<em>II. The Appropriate Appellate Remedy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Because I would reverse the trial court on the issue of the search of the backpack and because this Court has affirmed the trial court with respect to the admissibility of Glenn\u2019s incriminating statements to the police, I must necessarily address the applicability of Code \u00a7 19.2-254. This statute provides that, if a defendant who enters a conditional guilty plea \u201cprevails on appeal, he shall be allowed to withdraw his plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">For the reasons that follow, I would hold that an appellant who partially prevails on appeal is entitled to an opportunity to withdraw his conditional guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">No Virginia appellate court has ever addressed the question of whether an appellant who partially prevails on appeal should be entitled to withdraw his conditional plea. Every other jurisdiction to have directly addressed this issue, however, has held that an appellant should be given the opportunity to withdraw his conditional guilty plea if he succeeds in excluding, on appeal, evidence that would reasonably have influenced his decision to enter a conditional plea. I agree. Accordingly, I would remand this case to give Glenn the opportunity to withdraw his conditional plea and, if he so chooses, proceed to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>Of the approximately thirty jurisdictions<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> that authorize some form of a conditional plea procedure, a number of them have held that a defendant who partially prevails on appeal is entitled to an opportunity to withdraw his conditional plea. For example, in <em>State v. Juarez, </em>120 N.M. 499, 903 P.2d 241 (Ct.App.1995), the New Mexico Court of Appeals observed that, \u201cif improperly admitted evidence could have influenced a defendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty, there is a fair inference that the evidence contributed to the plea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 248. Thus, in situations involving a defendant who is \u201cpartially successful,\u201d the court concluded that it must \u201cremand so that Defendant may have the opportunity to reassess the admissible evidence in this case and either plead guilty or proceed to trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Similarly, in <em>State v. Piorkowski, </em>236 Conn. 388, 672 A.2d 921 (1996), the Connecticut Supreme Court observed that, under the applicable state statute, \u201cthere may be suppression issues that result in only partial appellate success,\u201d reasoning that \u201c[t]he denial of a motion to suppress based on a claim of an unreasonable search and seizure\u201d could conceivably \u201cyield an appellate result suppressing part, but not all, of the evidence gathered as a result of the search.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 930-31. The <em>Piorkowski </em>court concluded that, when an appellant has par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>tially prevailed on the appeal of a conditional plea, the appropriate appellate remedy would be to remand so as to permit \u201cboth the state and the defendant ... to reevaluate their respective positions in light of the availability of some, but not all, of the evidence gathered as a result of the search.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 931 n. 15; <em>accord United States v. Tantalo, </em>680 F.2d 903 (2d Cir.1982); <em>United States v. Mejia, </em>69 F.3d 309, 317 n. 8 (9th Cir.1995); <em>People v. Hill, </em>12 Cal.3d 731, 117 Cal.Rptr. 393, 528 P.2d 1, 28 (1974); <em>State v. Dinsmore, </em>182 Or.App. 505, 49 P.3d 830, 838 (2002), <em>aff'd, </em>336 Or. 565, 87 P.3d 1120 (2004); <em>see also United States v. Leake, </em>95 F.3d 409, 420 &amp; n. 21 (6th Cir.1996) (articulating a case-specific standard that \u201crequires an examination of the degree of success and the probability that the excluded evidence would have had a material effect on the defendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">I agree with the reasoning in these decisions. There is nothing in the language of Code \u00a7 19.2-254 indicating that an appellant must prevail on appeal with respect to every issue that formed a basis for his conditional plea. To construe the language of the statute otherwise would render moot <em>every </em>conditional appeal unless the petitioner could convince a reviewing judge or panel of this Court that every issue presented to this Court had merit. Where, as here, a defendant has sought to exclude two separate bodies of evidence on different constitutional grounds, and this Court only reverses the trial court\u2019s decision on one of those two grounds, in my view, it would be unduly harsh to punish that defendant for exercising his statutory right to appeal the denial of both motions to suppress. Holding that a defendant who \u201cprevails in part\u201d is not entitled to withdraw his conditional guilty plea would then have the practical effect of forcing a defendant to select just one appealable issue and waive any other constitutional objections he might have to the remaining evidence. In my view, this does not comport with either the spirit or language of Code \u00a7 19.2-254.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Accordingly, in situations where an appellant has conditionally pleaded guilty pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-254 and has been partially successful on appeal, I would hold that the appropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>ate remedy is to remand the case \u201cso that Defendant may have the opportunity to reassess the admissible evidence in this case and either plead guilty or proceed to trial.\u201d <em>Juarez, </em>903 P.2d at 249.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Therefore, because I would hold that Glenn has prevailed on the merits of his motion to suppress the physical evidence recovered from the backpack, I would remand this case to allow Glenn the opportunity to decide whether he \u201cwishes to withdraw [his] plea and go to trial,\u201d or, \u201cin light of [his] limited success on appeal, not to withdraw it.\u201d <em>Dinsmore, </em>49 P.3d at 838.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b472-7\">. There is no evidence to suggest that the grandfather possessed the <em>actual </em>authority to consent to a search of the backpack.

Indeed, Glenn's grandmother testified that neither she nor Glenn's grandfather ever used the backpack. Thus, it follows that the Commonwealth failed to prove that the grandfather possessed the actuad authority to consent to a search of the backpack.

In other words, <em>Acevedo </em>\"eliminate[s] the warrant requirement for closed containers\u201d within <em>automobiles. Id. </em>at 579, 111 S.Ct. at 1991. <em>Acevedo </em>clearly indicates that \"automobile searches differ from other searches,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 578, 111 S.Ct. at 1990, and thus, I believe that it does not govern the outcome of the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Moreover, <em>Acevedo </em>does not abrogate the Fourth Amendment's protection of \"the right of the people to be secure in their person, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures,\u201d U.S. Const, amend. IV, and its application as expressed in <em>Chadwick </em>to closed containers, including those inside a home, that may cany a heightened expectation of privacy. The long-standing principle of apparent authority that common authority \"rests ... on mutual use of the property by persons generally having joint access or control for most purposes,\u201d <em>Matlock, </em>415 U.S. at 171 n. 7, 94 S.Ct. at 993 n. 7, recognizes that although individuals may have joint access to rooms within a home, they may not necessarily have joint access to closed containers within that room. <em>Cf. Cupp, </em>394 U.S. at 740, 89 S.Ct. at 1425 (By allowing his cousin Rawls \"to use the bag\u201d and by \"leaving it in his house,\u201d the defendant \"assumed the risk that Rawls would allow someone else to look inside.\u201d). The holdings in the automobile exception <em>cases\u2014Ross, Acevedo, </em>and the like\u2014do not persuade me that when dealing with apparent authority, and the scope of a consent to search, the Supreme Court has abandoned this constitutional principle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b478-5\">. I note that this rule does not necessarily extend to all types of closed containers, but only those\u2014like backpacks\u2014that \"historically command a high degree of privacy.\u201d <em>Salinas-Cano, </em>959 F.2d at 864 (noting that \"the type of container at issue is ... an important consideration\u201d); <em>see also Jimeno, </em>500 U.S. at 253, 111 S.Ct. at 1805 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (describing the \"heart of the Fourth Amendment\u201d as the protection of containers that are \"common repositories for one\u2019s papers and effects\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b478-6\">. The majority cites <em>Melgar, </em>227 F.3d at 1041, for the proposition that a search is \"permissible if the police do not have reliable information that the container is <em>not </em>under the authorizer\u2019s control.\u201d I don\u2019t find <em>Melgar </em>persuasive to the extent that the majority does. In <em>Melgar, </em>the police had no reason to know that the purse in question did not belong to the woman authorizing the search. <em>Id. </em>at 1042. Specifically, they knew that the woman giving the consent rented the room in which the purse was found. <em>Id. </em>In addition, there were no exterior markings on the purse that should have alerted them to the fact that it belonged to someone other than the woman who rented the room. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the woman who consented to the search \"knew that the[] [officers] were searching for evidence of counterfeit dividend checks, which could easily fit inside the purse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Taken together, the court con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>cluded that the scope of the consent encompassed the officer\u2019s right to look into the purse. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">In this case, the officers knew that Glenn occupied the room. In fact, he stated that he slept in this particular room. Moreover, there were men\u2019s pants on the bed, men's clothing hanging in the closet, and a backpack on the floor. Unlike in <em>Melgar, </em>Glenn did not give Officer Ferguson specific consent to search the room where the container was located. Moreover, there is no indication in the record that Glenn\u2019s grandfather, who consented to the search, knew what the officers were looking for, or that they intended to search the backpack.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b479-8\">. I note that in this case, the officers were perfectly willing to walk across the room to engage Glenn when it suited their purpose. In other words, the officers did not approach Glenn to ask if they could search the backpack. Instead, they searched the backpack and then asked if the contents belonged to him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b479-9\">. This Court has stated that \"where the defendant is present and not objecting, the police are not thereby prevented from relying on a consent to search given by a third patty <em>with sufficient authority.\u201d Walls v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 639, 651, 347 S.E.2d 175, 182 (1986) (emphasis added). As in <em>Walls, </em>the grandfather had sufficient authority to authorize the search of the house. However, as indicated, in my view, that consent does not extend to the backpack, and, thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Glenn\u2019s failure to object does not automatically render the search \"reasonable.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b482-6\">.

I note that there is no constitutional right to conditionally plead guilty and that, under Code \u00a7 19.2-254, the Commonwealth and the trial court must approve a conditional guilty plea before it may be entered. Accordingly, both the Commonwealth and the trial court share control with the defendant over any issues ultimately presented to this Court on appeal. <em>See generally United States v. Lace, 669 </em>F.2d 46, 53 n. 5 (2d Cir.1982) (\"If a plea is tendered upon condition that more than one issue is reserved for appeal, the district court should satisfy itself that the reserved issues are significant to the outcome of the case.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b484-6\">. I note, as the Commonwealth argued to the panel, that some federal jurisdictions have held that a conditional guilty plea is void at its inception if the defendant attempts to reserve issues for appeal that are non-case-dispositive. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Bundy, </em>392 F.3d 641, 645 (4th Cir.2004) (citing precedent from the Second, Third, Fifth, and Seventh Circuits). These cases have their roots in the Official Comments to the Federal Rule, which suggest that a conditional plea should only reserve the right to appeal case-dispositive issues. Specifically, the Official Comment notes that requiring governmental consent for conditional pleas is appropriate because \"[t]he government is in a unique position to determine whether the matter at issue would be casedispositive, and, as a party to the litigation, should have an absolute right to refuse to consent to potentially prejudicial delay.\u201d Official Comment, Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2). <em>See generally United States v. Wong Ching Hing, </em>867 F.2d 754, 758 (2d Cir.1989) (discussing rationale behind the \"dispositiveness\u201d requirement). In contrast, the text of Code \u00a7 19.2-254 permits a defendant to \u201creserv[e] the right, on appeal from the judgment, to a review of the adverse determination of <em>any </em>specified pretrial motion.\u201d (Emphasis added). Because there is no \"dispositiveness requirement\u201d evident on the face of the statute itself, I would decline the Commonwealth\u2019s invitation to add one by judicial fiat. <em>See generally State v. Montoya, </em>887 P.2d 857, 860 (Utah 1994) (declining to add a \"dispositiveness requirement\u201d to Rule ll(i) of the Utah Rules of Criminal Procedure, reasoning that text of the rule \"allows a defendant entering a conditional plea to reserve the right to appeal \u2018the adverse determination of <em>any </em>specified pre-trial motion,\u2019 not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>just dispositive ones\u201d (quoting Utah R.Crina. P. 11 (i)) (emphasis in original)). Accordingly, I do not address whether the issues Glenn reserved for appeal might be deemed \"non-case-dispositive,\u201d so as to render his conditional plea void at its inception.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
