WILLIS, JR., Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b72-19\">On appeal from an order dismissing his petitions to voluntarily relinquish his parental rights to his two minor children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>and awarding attorney\u2019s fees to Kimberly R. Cartwright (mother), Glenn R. Cartwright (father) presents four questions, but appears to contend only that the trial court erred (1) in holding that Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-277.02(0 and 16.1-278.3(D) do not permit a non-custodial parent to petition for voluntary relinquishment and termination of parental rights, and (2) in awarding mother attorney\u2019s fees. Mother seeks an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs associated with this appeal. We affirm the judgment of the trial court and award mother attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">On appeal, we view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to mother as the party prevailing below. <em>See McGuire v. McGuire, </em>10 Va.App. 248, 250, 391 S.E.2d 344, 346 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Mother and father are the divorced natural parents of two minor children, of whom mother, by court order, has sole custody. Father, the non-custodial parent, petitioned the juvenile and domestic relations district court (juvenile court) seeking \u201cto be permanently relieved of the care and custody of\u2019 the children and alleging that the termination of his parental rights was in the children\u2019s best interests. The juvenile court dismissed father\u2019s petitions. Father appealed that ruling to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">The trial court dismissed father\u2019s petitions, holding that \u201cvoluntary relinquishment of parental rights by a party is contemplated only under circumstances not relevant in this matter and therefore there is no statutory mechanism for the voluntary relinquishment or termination of parental rights as pled in this case.\u201d It awarded mother $2,732.50 in attorney\u2019s fees. Father appeals that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">Jurisdiction to terminate parental rights can be found neither in the common law nor in a court\u2019s inherent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>authority to proceed under its general equity powers. <em>Willis v. Gamez, </em>20 Va.App. 75, 81-82, 455 S.E.2d 274, 277-78 (1995) (\u201c \u2018there was [no] legal authority under the common law ... for a total relinquishment of parental rights and obligations or any inherent authority in any court to terminate them\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Carroll County Dept. of Social Servs. v. Edelmann, </em>320 Md. 150, 577 A.2d 14, 25 (1990)). Accordingly, jurisdiction of the circuit courts to terminate parental rights must be found, if at all, within the statutory scheme. <em>Id. </em>at 81-83, 455 S.E.2d at 277-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\"><em>Church v. Church, </em>24 Va.App. 502, 505-06, 483 S.E.2d 498, 500 (1997) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Father argues that Code \u00a7 16.1-277.02 provides a mechanism whereby he, as a non-custodial parent, may voluntarily relinquish his residual parental rights. However, Code \u00a7 16.1-277.02, by its terms, concerns only \u201c[Requests for petitions for relief of the care and custody of a child____\u201d Father, as a non-custodial parent, is not invested with \u201ccare and custody\u201d of his children from which he can be relieved. Mother has sole custody of the children. \u201c \u2018Sole custody' means that [she alone] retains responsibility for the care and control of [the children] and has primary authority to make decisions concerning [them].\u201d Code \u00a7 20-124.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">Father argues that Code \u00a7 16.1-277.02 speaks also to \u201ca limited or secondary form of custody of the child\u201d created by visitation rights. The statute defines no such status. It is well settled that \u201cwhen analyzing a statute, we must assume that \u2018the legislature chose, with care, the words it used when it enacted the relevant statute, and we are bound by those words as we interpret the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>City of Virginia Beach v. ESG Enterprises, Inc., </em>243 Va. 149, 153, 413 S.E.2d 642, 644 (1992) (quoting <em>Barr v. Town and Country Properties, </em>240 Va. 292, 295, 396 S.E.2d 672, 674 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">\u201cThe main purpose of statutory construction is to determine the intention of the legislature \u2018which, absent constitutional infirmity, must always prevail.\u2019 \u201d <em>Last v. Virginia State Bd. of Med., </em>14 Va.App. 906, 910, 421 S.E.2d 201, 205 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>(1992) (quoting <em>Board of Supervisors v. King Land Corp., </em>238 Va. 97, 103, 380 S.E.2d 895, 897 (1989)). \u201cWhen, as here, a statute contains no express definition of a term, the general rule of statutory construction is to infer the legislature\u2019s intent from the plain meaning of the language used.\u201d <em>Hubbard v. Henrico Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>255 Va. 335, 340, 497 S.E.2d 335, 338 (1998). We may not, by interpretation or otherwise, \u201cadd to a statute language which the legislature has chosen not to include.\u201d <em>County of Amherst Bd. of Supervisors v. Brockman, </em>224 Va. 391, 397, 297 S.E.2d 805, 808 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Code \u00a7 16.1-278.3, which defines the procedures for granting custody to the Department of Social Services pursuant to a petition for relief of care and custody of a child, addresses situations where \u201cthe parent or other custodian seeks to be relieved permanently of the care and custody of any child.\u201d Again, because father is not the children\u2019s custodial parent, he provides no actual care and custody from which he can be relieved. Thus, Code \u00a7 16.1-278.3 provides him no basis for seeking termination of his parental rights and obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Code \u00a7 16.1-278.3(D) provides that upon granting the petition of a \u201cparent or other custodian\u201d for relief, etc., \u201c[i]f the remaining parent has not petitioned for permanent relief ... the residual rights of that parent may be terminated pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-283. Father argues that this provision contemplates and acknowledges the right of a non-custodial parent to petition for relief. Father misconstrues the meaning of the term \u201cremaining parent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Code \u00a7 16.1-278.3 provides procedures to be followed successive to proceedings under Code \u00a7 16.1-277.02. Its purpose is not to provide an avenue for relief from parental obligation, but rather to ensure that a child is not left without proper care and support. The petition to which it refers is a petition authorized by Code \u00a7 16.1-277.02. This is made clear in subsection (D) by reference to a request for relief by \u201ca parent or other <em>custodian.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Thus, the reference to a \u201cremaining custodial parent [who] has not petitioned\u201d is to a parent who could have petitioned under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Code \u00a7 16.1-277.02 for relief from care and custody that he/she is providing. Father is not such a party. Furthermore, Code \u00a7 16.1-278.3(D) authorizes consideration of the status and rights of a remaining parent only following the granting of a petition properly filed under Code \u00a7 16.1-277.02. No such petition has been filed or granted in this case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AY\">The preservation of the family, and in particular the parent-child relationship, is an important goal for not only the parents but also government itself____Statutes terminating the legal relationship between parent and child should be interpreted consistently with the governmental objective of preserving, when possible, the parent-child relationship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ag\"><em>Weaver v. Roanoke Dep\u2019t of Human Res., </em>220 Va. 921, 926, 265 S.E.2d 692, 695 (1980). It is well established that \u201c[b]oth parents owe a duty of support to their minor children.\u201d <em>Kelley v. Kelley, </em>248 Va. 295, 298, 449 S.E.2d 55, 56 (1994) (citing Code \u00a7 20-61; <em>Featherstone v. Brooks, </em>220 Va. 443, 448, 258 S.E.2d 513, 516 (1979)). <em>See also Hur v. Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., Div. of Child Support Enforcement ex rel. Klopp, </em>13 Va.App. 54, 58, 409 S.E.2d 454, 457 (1991) (\u201cChild support has long been recognized as an obligation owed to the infant child, not the payee parent. This duty arises from principles of natural law.\u201d (citation omitted)). Interpreting the statutes in the manner father proposes would undermine these important objectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The 1984 Attorney General\u2019s Opinion cited by father does not support his interpretation of the statutes. The opinion does not address a non-eustodial parent\u2019s voluntary relinquishment of his parental rights and duties. <em>See </em>1984-1985 Op. Va. Att\u2019y Gen. 155 (Sept. 25, 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">As we find no support for father\u2019s contentions, we affirm the trial court\u2019s dismissal of his petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">In pertinent part, Code \u00a7 16.1-296(1) provides that \u201c[i]n all cases on appeal, the circuit court in the disposition of such cases shall have all the powers and authority granted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>the chapter to the juvenile and domestic relations district court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">Code \u00a7 16.1-278.19 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-5\">In any matter properly before the court, the court may award attorneys\u2019 fees and costs on behalf of any party as the court deems appropriate based on the relative financial ability of the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Thus, the trial court was authorized to award costs and attorney\u2019s fees in this case. We find no error in its award to mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Mother also seeks costs and attorney\u2019s fees associated with this appeal. We find such an award appropriate under Code \u00a7 16.1-278.19. <em>See Gottlieb v. Gottlieb, </em>19 Va.App. 77, 95, 448 S.E.2d 666, 677 (1994). Therefore, we award attorney\u2019s fees to mother and remand this case to the trial court for determination of attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred in responding to this appeal, and for any fees and costs incurred at the hearing on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">\n<em>Affirmed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
