HUMPHREYS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b152-17\">Appellant Robert William Eberth (\u201cEberth\u201d) appeals' his conviction for violating Prince William County Code \u00a7 13-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>322(a)(1), which forbids any individual from parking a vehicle not in compliance with state inspection standards on a \u201cpublic highway.\u201d For the reasons that follow, we hold that the Prince William County ordinance is invalid to the extent that it authorizes the local government to issue a parking citation to an uninspected vehicle parked in the private parking lot of an apartment budding complex. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment below and dismiss the underlying citation.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">On August 25, 2004, Officer Patricia Biller, a parking enforcement officer, entered the parking lot of an apartment complex located in Prince William County.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In one of the parking spaces, she discovered a burgundy car bearing Virginia plates, a January 2001 registration sticker, and an inspection sticker that expired in December of 1999. Officer Biller issued a parking violation summons, citing Eberth for parking a vehicle with an expired inspection sticker on a \u201cpublic highway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">During the resulting bench trial, Eberth moved to dismiss the citation. Although Code \u00a7 46.2-1307 permits localities to define certain private roadways as \u201chighways\u201d for law enforcement purposes, Eberth argued that the ordinance was invalid because the County impermissibly \u201cexpand[ed][the] authority\u201d granted to it by the statute. Eberth reasoned that, because Code \u00a7 46.2-1307 only permits localities to designate as \u201cpublic\u201d roadways in areas containing one hundred or more \u201clots,\u201d the County exceeded the scope of this statute when it defined \u201cpublic highway\u201d to also encompass private roadways in areas containing one hundred or more \u201cdwelling units.\u201d Eberth further contended that Code \u00a7 46.2-1307 violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and that the County ordinance was a \u201cnullity\u201d because the laws of the Commonwealth prohibit uninspected vehicles from being operated\u2014rather than parked\u2014on public highways.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>The trial court denied the motion to dismiss and found the evidence sufficient to establish a violation of the county ordinance. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">On appeal, Eberth raises three separate assignments of error. First, Eberth contends that Code \u00a7 46.2-1307, which vests localities with the authority to define certain private roads as \u201chighways\u201d for law-enforcement purposes, violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Second, Eberth argues that the Prince William County ordinance is invalid because it impermissibly extends the scope of the authority granted to the County under Code \u00a7 46.2-1307. Third, Eberth contends that the ordinance is a \u201cnullity\u201d because the laws of the Commonwealth only require a vehicle to display an inspection sticker when it is being \u201coperated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">A. <em>Statutory Scheme</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">According to Code \u00a7 46.2-1157, \u201c[n]o owner or operator shall fail to submit a motor vehicle ... operated on the highways in this Commonwealth to [an] inspection [of its mechanism and equipment].\u201d Any vehicle \u201crequired to be inspected ... shall be reinspected within twelve months of the month of the first inspection and at least once every twelve months thereafter.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-1158. Failure to submit a vehicle for a required inspection \u201cconstitutes a traffic infraction.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-1157; <em>see also Reel v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 262, 269, 522 S.E.2d 881, 884 (2000) (\u2018Virginia law requires that all cars registered and operated in Virginia undergo an annual safety inspection, regardless of the city or county in which the owner resides.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">In a related provision, Code \u00a7 46.2-1163 provides that a valid inspection sticker \u201cshall be displayed on the windshield of such vehicle ... at all times when it is operated on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>highways in the Commonwealth and until such time as a new inspection period shall be designated and a new inspection sticker issued.\u201d A first violation of this provision constitutes a Class 3 misdemeanor, and any subsequent conviction constitutes a Class 1 misdemeanor. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-1171; <em>see also Fisher v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 395, 402-03, 592 S.E.2d 377, 380-81 (2004) (discussing statutory scheme); <em>Reel, </em>31 Va.App. at 266, 522 S.E.2d at 883 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-1157 and 46.2-1163, by their terms, only prohibit the operation of uninspected vehicles on \u201cthe highways in the Commonwealth.\u201d A \u201chighway\u201d is statutorily defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">the entire width between the boundary lines of every way or place open to the use of the public for purposes of vehicular travel in the Commonwealth, including the streets and alleys, and, [2] <em>for law-enforcement purposes, the entire width between the boundary lines of all private roads or private streets that have been specifically designated \u201chighways\u201d by an ordinance adopted by the governing body of the county, city, or town in which such private roads or streets are located.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Code \u00a7 46.2-100 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As pertinent to the latter portion of this definition, Code \u00a7 46.2-1307 vests \u201c[t]he governing body of any county, city, or town\u201d with the authority to \u201cadopt ordinances designating the private roads, within any residential development containing 100 or more lots, as highways for law-enforcement purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Although Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-1157 and 46.2-1163 prohibit the <em>operation </em>of an uninspected vehicle on a public highway, Prince William County Code \u00a7 13-322 further provides that \u201c[i]t shall be unlawful for any person to <em>park ... </em>any motor vehicle ... in or on any public highway, street, alley, public easement or other public thoroughfare in the county, or any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>other area in the county subject to regulation by the county,\u201d if that motor vehicle is not \u201ccurrently inspected and approved in accordance with the provisions of the laws of the state.\u201d County Code \u00a7 13\u2014322(a)(1) (emphasis added). And, in accordance with Code \u00a7 46.2-1307, County Code \u00a7 13-277(a) provides that \u201c[pjrivate roads and private streets located within any residential development, located within the unincorporated area of the County, containing one hundred (100) or more lots or residential dwelling units are hereby designated as highways for law enforcement purposes.\u201d Taken together, then, these Prince William County ordinances prohibit \u201cany person\u201d from \u201cpark[ing] ... any motor vehicle\u201d that is not \u201ccurrently inspected\u201d on a \u201c[pjrivate road[] [or] private street[]\u201d in a \u201cresidential development\u201d with \u201cone hundred (100) or more lots or residential dwelling units.... \u201d County Code \u00a7\u00a7 13-277(a) &amp; 13-322.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">B. <em>Whether the County Possessed the Authority to Enact County Code \u00a7 13-277(a)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The sole question we need address is whether Prince William County possessed the authority to enforce Code \u00a7 13-322 in the private parking lot of Eberth\u2019s apartment complex.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Ordinarily, a locality lacks the authority to enforce its public parking regulations in private parking areas. <em>See Parker v. DeBose, </em>206 Va. 220, 223, 142 S.E.2d 510, 512 (1965) (\u201c[G]overnmental regulations with respect to the operation of motor vehicles ordinarily are applicable only to operation on public streets and highways, and do not apply to operation on private premises, including operation on a private driveway or a private road____\u201d (internal quotations omitted)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As discussed above, however, Code \u00a7 46.2-1307 permits localities to \u201cadopt ordinances designating the private roads, within any residential development containing 100 or more <em>lots, </em>as highways for law-enforcement purposes.\u201d (Emphasis added). By defining \u201chighways\u201d to encompass \u201cprivate roads and private streets within any residential development ... containing one hundred (100) or more lots <em>or residential dwelling units,\u201d </em>County Code \u00a7 13-277(a), Eberth contends that the County impermissibly expanded the scope of its law enforcement authority. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">\u201cIn determining the legislative powers of the local governing bodies, Virginia follows the Dillon Rule of strict construction.\u201d <em>Richmond v. Confrere Club of Richmond, Inc., </em>239 Va. 77, 79, 387 S.E.2d 471, 473 (1990). Specifically, \u201c[t]he Dillon Rule provides that municipal corporations possess and can exercise only those powers expressly granted by the General Assembly, those necessarily or fairly implied there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>from, and those that are essential and indispensable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf there is any reasonable doubt whether legislative power exists, that doubt must be resolved against the local governing body.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 79-80, 387 S.E.2d at 473. <em>See generally City Council of Alexandria v. Lindsey Trusts, </em>258 Va. 424, 427, 520 S.E.2d 181, 182 (1999) (discussing Dillon Rule); <em>Stallings v. Wall, </em>235 Va. 313, 315-16, 367 S.E.2d 496, 497 (1988) (same); <em>Commonwealth v. County Board of Arlington County, </em>217 Va. 558, 573-74, 232 S.E.2d 30, 40 (1977) (same); <em>Winchester v. Redmond, </em>93 Va. 711, 714, 25 S.E. 1001, 1002 (1896) (adopting Dillon Rule); <em>Lawless v. County of Chesterfield, </em>21 Va.App. 495, 499, 465 S.E.2d 153, 154-55 (1995) (discussing application of Dillon Rule to county ordinances).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">On appeal, Eberth argues that, by defining \u201cpublic highway\u201d to encompass \u201cprivate roads\u201d located within residential developments containing one hundred or more \u201clots <em>or residential dwelling units,\u201d </em>County Code \u00a7 13-277(a) (emphasis added), and by punishing the mere \u201cparking\u201d of an uninspected motor vehicle, the County exceeded the scope of the limited authority granted to the County by Code \u00a7 46.2-1307. In other words, Eberth contends that the ordinance violates the Dillon Rule. The County, in contrast, argues only that the ordinance complies with the Dillon Rule because the word \u201clots,\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 46.2-1307, should be read to encompass the phrase \u201cresidential dwelling units.\u201d We agree with Eberth.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Although not defined in Chapter 46.2 of the Virginia Code, the generally accepted definition of \u201clot\u201d is \u201c[a] tract of land\u201d with \u201cspecific boundaries.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>958 (7th ed. 1999); <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7 55-337 (defining \u201clot\u201d as \u201cany unit, parcel, division, or piece of land\u201d); Code \u00a7 55-509 (defining \u201clot\u201d as \u201cany plot or parcel of land designated for separate ownership or occupancy\u201d). A \u201cresidential dwelling unit,\u201d in contrast, is \u201ca single unit providing complete independent living facilities for one (1) or more persons, including permanent provisions for living, sleeping, eating, cooking, and sanitation.\u201d County Code \u00a7 5-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>From these definitions, it is clear that a \u201cresidential dwelling unit\u201d is not necessarily equivalent to a \u201clot.\u201d The term \u201clot\u201d denotes a separate and distinct plot of land, or perhaps, under certain circumstances, a separately owned unit in a condominium. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 55-509. So, for example, although an apartment building may be located on a \u201clot,\u201d the living units within that building do not each individually fall within the plain meaning of this term.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">In contrast, \u201cdwelling unit\u201d is a much broader term, encompassing apartments and other living spaces that may be located, collectively, in a single building on a single lot. It follows that, although the parking lot at Eberth\u2019s apartment complex would not qualify as a private road located \u201cwithin any residential development containing 100 or more <em>lots,\u201d </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-1307 (emphasis added), it would qualify as a private road located within a residential development containing one hundred or more \u201clots <em>or residential dwelling units,\u201d </em>County Code \u00a7 13-277(a) (emphasis added). Accordingly, by defining \u201chighway\u201d to include private parking areas at residential developments containing one hundred or more \u201clots <em>or residential dwelling units,\u201d </em>the County expanded the scope of the limited authority granted to it by Code \u00a7 46.2-1307. To the extent that County Code \u00a7 13-277(a) vests law enforcement officers with the authority to enforce its parking regulations in the private parking lot of an apartment complex such as the one at issue in this case,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we hold that the ordinance is invalid and unenforceable. <em>See Bd. of Supervisors v. Countryside Inv. Co., </em>258 Va. 497, 503, 522 S.E.2d 610, 613 (1999) (\u201cWhen a local ordinance exceeds the scope of [the] authority [granted to the locality by the General Assembly], the ordinance is invalid.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Eberth also contends that County Code \u00a7 13-322 violates the Dillon Rule by prohibiting uninspected cars from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>\u201cparking\u201d on public highways, whereas Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-1157 and 46.2-1163 prohibit only the \u201coperation\u201d of uninspected vehicles on public highways. The County responds that the County Code does not conflict with Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-1157 and -1163, but complements them. We agree with Eberth on this issue as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Although \u201coperate\u201d is not separately defined statutorily, Code \u00a7 46.2-100 defines an \u201coperator\u201d as any \u201cperson who either (i) drives or is in actual or physical control of a motor vehicle on a highway, or (ii) is exercising control over or steering a vehicle being towed by a motor vehicle.\u201d This definition is appropriate for the purpose of determining whether one \u201coperates\u201d a vehicle. <em>See Nicolls v. Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 257, 259, 184 S.E.2d 9, 11 (1971) (interpreting Code \u00a7 46.1-1(17), now codified in \u00a7 46.2-100). \u201cPark\u201d is similarly undefined statutorily, but the generally accepted definition of \u201cpark\u201d is \u201cthe leaving of a vehicle in an accessible location.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1642 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Based upon these definitions, \u201coperate\u201d and \u201cpark\u201d have substantially different meanings, and therefore ought not be used interchangeably. In this case, the County has prohibited the \u201cparking\u201d of an uninspected motor vehicle on a public highway, whereas the General Assembly has merely prohibited the \u201coperation\u201d of such vehicle on a public highway. We can find no statutory authority authorizing the County to take such action and the County offers none, thus there is a clear conflict between County Code \u00a7 13-322 and Code \u00a7 46.2-1163. Accordingly, County Code \u00a7 13-322(a)(l) violates the Dillon Rule in this regard as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Because the County lacks the authority to apply County Code \u00a7 13-322 to a vehicle parked in the private parking lot of an apartment complex, we reverse Eberth\u2019s conviction and dismiss the underlying citation.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">For these reasons, we hold that, in enacting County Code \u00a7 13-277(a), Prince William County exceeded the scope of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>authority granted to it by Code \u00a7 46.2-1307. The County did not have the authority to enforce its parking regulations on \u201cprivate roads\u201d such as the one at issue in this case. Likewise, the County did not have the authority to enact County Code \u00a7 13-322, which prohibits the parking of uninspected vehicles on public highways. We reverse<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the judgment below and dismiss the underlying citation.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b153-7\">. At the time, the complex contained seven hundred and thirty-two individual rental apartments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b154-9\">. A \u201ctraffic infraction\u201d is \"a violation of law punishable as provided in \u00a7 46.2-113, which is neither a felony nor a misdemeanor.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-100.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b155-8\">. In contrast, a \"private road\u201d is \"every way in private ownership and used for vehicular travel by the owner and those having express or implied permission from the owner, but not by other persons.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-100.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b156-6\">. The County apparently concedes that, because there is no evidence in the record that the parking lot located in Eberth\u2019s apartment complex is \"open to the use of the public,\u201d the parking area does not fall within the first, and more general, definition of \"idghway\" provided by Code \u00a7 46.2-100. <em>See, e.g., Caplan v. Bogard, </em>264 Va. 219, 227, 563 S.E.2d 719, 724 (2002) (holding that a driveway leading to a restaurant parking lot was not a \"highway\u201d because the plaintiffs \"failed to establish the required element of unrestricted access\u201d); <em>Crouse v. Pugh, </em>188 Va. 156, 165, 49 S.E.2d 421, 426 (1948) (\"The paving of a way does not make it a 'highway.' The true test is whether the 'way or place of whatever nature' is 'open to the use of the public for purposes of vehicular travel.\u2019 \u201d); <em>see also Roberts v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 401, 403, 504 S.E.2d 890, 891 (1998) (\" \u2018The test for determining whether a way is a \"highway\u201d depends upon the degree to which the way is open to public use for vehicular traffic.\u2019 \" (quoting <em>Furman v. Call, </em>234 Va. 437, 439, 362 S.E.2d 709, 710 (1987))). Accordingly, we will assume, for purposes of this appeal, that the parking lot is, at most, a \"private road.\u201d <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-100. <em>But cf. Kay Management Co. v. Creason, </em>220 Va. 820, 830, 263 S.E.2d 394, 401 (1980) (holding, under a prior definition of \"highway,\u201d that the streets within an apartment complex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>qualified as \"highways\u201d because they were \"paved, curbed, and bordered by sidewalks,\u201d and there was \"no evidence that the streets or roadways of the complex were restricted exclusively to the private use of the apartment dwellers or those persons who visited them\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b157-7\">. Although Code \u00a7 15.2-2027 vests localities with the authority to \"regulate and control private roadways within multifamily residential developments,\u201d it does so only \"to such extent as to allow police, fire and rescue vehicles access to the developments.\u201d The County does not argue that County Code \u00a7 13-322 falls within the scope of this exception. Similarly, although Code \u00a7 15.2-1200 authorizes localities to \"adopt such measures as it deems expedient to secure and promote the health, safety and general welfare of its inhabitants,\u201d the County does not contend that defining \"public highway\u201d to include parking lots such as the one at issue in this case will \"promote the health, safety and general welfare\u201d of its residents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b159-6\">.
