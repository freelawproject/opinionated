Charity (appellant) of carjacking, assault of a police officer, attempted escape, and conspiracy to commit escape from prison. We granted this appeal on the sole issue of whether sufficient evidence exists to find him guilty of the charge of conspiracy to commit escape from prison. So finding, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-13\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b629-14\">\u201cOn appeal, we examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. That principle requires us to discard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth and to regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences that may be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Guda v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 458, 455, 592 S.E.2d 748, 749 (2004) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-15\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b629-16\">On May 25, 2004, appellant and three other inmates of the Sussex II State Prison were working yard maintenance within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>the prison grounds. Officer Silas Cain supervised the inmates on that day. According to Cain, after the inmates finished working and as they were being escorted back to the enterprise area, appellant and another inmate began running toward a tractor-trailer that had recently arrived to pick up supplies. Appellant pushed the truck driver, who was working near the rear of the truck, to the ground and jumped into the driver\u2019s seat alongside the other inmate, who had already jumped in and moved over to the passenger seat. As Cain explained, appellant attempted to \u201ctake off with the truck.... You could hear the motor and the gears scraping, and he was trying to, you know, mash on the gas, get the truck moving, but he couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Cain radioed for assistance. Accompanied by two other officers, Cain ran to the truck and noticed that \u201csomehow the truck had shut down, and the [driver\u2019s side] door opened.\u201d As Cain and the other officers started to pull on the door, appellant \u201cacted like he was getting ready to come down, and then he didn\u2019t.\u201d Appellant kicked one of the other officers in the chin and then pulled the door back shut. Cain and the other officers pulled on the door from the outside while appellant and the other inmate worked together to keep it pulled shut from the inside. Cain could see appellant and the other inmate working together to try and keep the door closed. With the assistance of additional arriving officers, Cain and the others \u201ceventually got the two inmates out and got them restrained.\u201d Cain estimated the above situation took place over the eourse of two to three minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Douglas Kane, the driver of the tractor-trailer truck, had been routinely delivering and picking up plastic at the prison for almost a year. He explained, \u201cwhat I do is I go in, drop my load in. There\u2019s another trailer sitting there. I pick it up and I go back with it.\u201d After arriving at the prison on the morning of May 25, Kane \u201cdropped [his] trailer\u201d and left his truck unlocked and running while he hooked into another trailer. As he began to wind his \u201clanding gear\u201d up, something knocked him to the ground. Kane rolled over and saw appellant and another inmate running toward the truck cab. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>He got up and chased after the two men. Upon reaching the truck, Kane opened the driver\u2019s side door with his spare key, but appellant and the other inmate pulled it back shut. According to Kane, \u201cEventually more officers came and they opened the door and got them out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Appellant moved to strike, <em>inter alia, </em>the conspiracy charge by arguing that there was no evidence of an agreement, specifically no evidence of a conversation, between himself and the other inmate. The trial court denied the motion, noting \u201call this is done within the confines and with the\u2014through the efforts of two people and not just by the one act. So they both are acting together, and the Court will grant that there was no conversation. But they certainly were acting together to make all acts happen.\u201d A jury subsequently convicted appellant of carjacking, assault of a police officer, attempted escape from prison, and conspiracy. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Generally speaking, \u201cWhen a case, civil or criminal, is tried by a jury ... the judgment of the trial court shall not be set aside unless it appears from the evidence that such judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-680. When considering the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal, \u201c \u2018the relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kelly v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 250, 257, 584 S.E.2d 444, 447 (2003) <em>(en banc) </em>(quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)). \u201c \u2018If there is evidence to support the conviction,\u2019 we will not substitute our judgment for that of the trier of fact, even were our opinion to differ.\u201d <em>Wactor v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 375, 380, 564 S.E.2d 160, 162 (2002) (quoting <em>Commonwealth v. Presley, </em>256 Va. 465, 466, 507 S.E.2d 72, 72 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">In this appeal, appellant contends the evidence is not sufficient to prove a conspiracy. \u201cConspiracy requires a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>shared intent and joint action, whereas attempt does not. \u2018Conspiracy requires ... (1) an agreement between two or more persons, which constitutes the act; and (2) an intent thereby to achieve a certain objective[,] either an unlawful act or a lawful act by unlawful means.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hix v. Commonwealth, </em>270 Va. 335, 347, 619 S.E.2d 80, 87 (2005) (quoting Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 12.2, at 621 (4th ed. 2003)). As the Virginia Supreme Court explained in <em>Gray v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 675, 680, 537 S.E.2d 862, 865 (2000), \u201cthe crime of conspiracy is complete when the parties agree to commit an offense____ No overt act in furtherance of the underlying crime is necessary.\u201d (Citation omitted.) A conspiracy \u201cmay be proved by circumstantial evidence. Indeed, because of the very nature of the offense, \u2018it often may be established only by indirect and circumstantial evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Floyd v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 575, 580, 249 S.E.2d 171, 174 (1978)). In addition, as this Court has held, when \u201cit has been shown that the defendants \u2018by their acts pursued the same object, one performing one part and the others performing another part so as to complete it or with a view to its attainment, the jury will be justified in concluding that they were engaged in a conspiracy to effect that object.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 73, 78, 390 S.E.2d 386, 388 (1990) (quoting <em>Amato v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 544, 552, 352 S.E.2d 4, 9 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">The underlying crime that appellant allegedly conspired to commit is an escape from a correctional facility in violation of Code \u00a7 53.1-203. That code section states, \u201cIt shall be unlawful for a prisoner in a state, local or community correctional facility or in the custody of an employee thereof to: 1. Escape from a correctional facility or from any person in charge of such prisoner.... \u201d Therefore, in order to prove that a conspiracy existed in this case, the evidence must show that appellant formed an agreement and possessed the requisite intent to escape from the correctional facility in violation of Code \u00a7 53.1-203.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">Here, appellant and the other inmate began running toward the truck, which <em>routinely </em>delivered and picked up loads at the prison on most days, at or around the same time. Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>lant shoved the truck driver aside and to the ground and climbed into the driver\u2019s seat. The other inmate had already climbed into the truck and had slid over to the passenger seat, which allowed appellant the opportunity to get in the driver\u2019s seat of the truck and attempt to drive the truck away. The two inmates worked together while trying to keep the truck driver and officers from opening the driver\u2019s side door of the truck. These facts demonstrate that the two men specifically focused their combined efforts on reaching and attempting to drive away in the truck, which was crucial to the success of their attempted escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">We hold that sufficient evidence exists to find, as the trial court noted in denying the motion to strike, that the actions described above were undertaken by the efforts of two men acting together to attain the ultimate goal of escaping from prison. The fact that there is no evidence of an actual conversation between appellant and the other inmate is not dispositive; as noted above, a conspiracy may be inferred by actions alone. Therefore, the jury, acting as a rational trier of fact, could reasonably conclude that there was an agreement between appellant and the other inmate to attempt an escape and that both men, as illustrated by their actions, intended to attain that objective.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction of conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
