Dowden, Jr. (claimant) appeals a decision of the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (commission) terminating his temporary partial disability benefits. Claimant contends the commission erred in determining he did not partially cure his unjustified refusal of selective employment offered by Hercules, Inc. (employer). For the reasons that follow, we reverse the decision of the commission and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. Claimant began working for employer in 1969. After thirty years of employment, he voluntarily applied for early retirement on August 23, 2000, pursuant to a buy-out offer designed to assist employer in reducing its workforce. On January 31, 2001, while his application for early retirement was pending, claimant injured his back at work. Prior to his injury, claimant earned an average weekly wage of $1,243.64 per week. Upon returning to light-duty work with employer, he earned a wage of $1,002 per week. The commission subsequently awarded claimant temporary partial disability benefits from February 1, 2001, and continuing, at a rate of $161.10 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">After claimant returned to light-duty work, he was notified that his application for early retirement had been approved. Claimant accepted employer\u2019s offer of early retirement and retired effective May 1, 2001. Employer continued to pay claimant $161.10 per week in temporary partial disability payments through July 13, 2003. On or around that date, employer discovered claimant had accepted employment as a sales associate with a friend's seafood company on March 10, 2003, earning $200 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">On July 24, 2003, employer filed an application with the commission seeking termination or suspension of claimant\u2019s award and credit for benefits paid from March 10, 2003, through July 13, 2003. Employer argued that claimant unjustifiably refused selective employment by voluntarily retiring and that he failed to cure his unjustified refusal. Claimant filed a change-in-condition application on September 5, 2003, seeking a continuation of his temporary partial disability wage-loss benefits of $161.10 per week. Claimant argued that he did not refuse selective employment when he retired, but, if the commission found he did, he cured that refusal on March 10, 2003, when he procured other selective employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Finding that claimant\u2019s voluntary retirement constituted an unjustified refusal of selective employment pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-510(A) and that claimant did not effectuate a cure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>within six months from the date of his retirement as required by Code \u00a7 65.2-510(C), the deputy commissioner granted employer\u2019s application and denied claimant\u2019s change-in-condition application. Upon review, the full commission agreed with the deputy commissioner that claimant unjustifiably refused selective employment when he voluntarily retired. It disagreed, however, that Code \u00a7 65.2-510(C)\u2019s six-month statute of limitations to cure the unjustified refusal began running on the date of claimant\u2019s retirement. Accordingly, the full commission remanded the case \u201cfor determination of the date the claimant\u2019s cure requirement began ... and whether the claimant cured the unjustified refusal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">On remand, the deputy commissioner determined that, because claimant failed \u201cto report his return to work on March 10, 2003,\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-510(C)\u2019s six-month statute of limitations to cure claimant\u2019s unjustified refusal began to run on that date.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The deputy commissioner then found that claimant failed to cure his unjustified refusal by September 10, 2003, and, thus, was not entitled to temporary partial disability benefits beyond March 10, 2003. In reaching that decision, the deputy commissioner found that claimant\u2019s employment paying $200 per week did not cure his unjustified refusal of selective employment because it was not comparable to the employment paying $1,002 per week he had refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Appealing the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision to the full commission, claimant asserted that his return to work selling seafood on March 10, 2003, constituted a cure of his unjustified refusal of selective employment under Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B). He argued that Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B) did not require him to obtain employment at a wage \u201ccomparable\u201d to the wage he would have earned had he continued the selective employment offered by employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">A majority of the full commission disagreed with claimant, holding that the employment an injured worker procures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>\u201cmust be at a wage comparable to that of the previously refused position\u201d to constitute a cure under Code \u00a7 65.2-510. Accordingly, the commission affirmed the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision that claimant failed to cure his unjustified refusal of selective employment, noting as follows: \u201cThe claimant was earning $1,002 per week in his selective employment, and after his refusal, he began earning $200 per week. The evidence does not indicate that the employment he procured was comparable and effectuated a cure of his unjustified refusal of selective employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">This appeal by claimant followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">The sole issue on appeal is whether claimant\u2019s acceptance on March 10, 2003, of selective employment paying $200 per week was sufficient under Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to cure his unjustified refusal of selective employment offered by employer paying $1,002 per week. Relying on this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Food Lion, Inc. v. Newsome, </em>30 Va.App. 21, 515 S.E.2d 317 (1999), and <em>Clements v. Riverside Walter Reed Hospital, </em>40 Va.App. 214, 578 S.E.2d 814 (2003), the commission concluded that claimant\u2019s procurement of the $200-per-week selective employment was not sufficient to cure his unjustified refusal because the wage he earned at that employment was not comparable to the wage he earned at the selective employment offered by employer. We hold that our decision in <em>Hillcrest Manor Nursing Home v. Underwood, </em>35 Va.App. 31, 542 S.E.2d 785 (2001), and the express language of Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>\u00a7 65.2-510(B) control the outcome of this case and require the opposite conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">It is well settled that an injured employee who unjustifiably refuses selective employment offered by the employer is not \u201centitled to receive disability compensation during the continuance of the refusal.\u201d <em>Virginia Wayside Furniture, Inc. v. Burnette, </em>17 Va.App. 74, 78, 435 S.E.2d 156, 159 (1993); <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-510(A). However, \u201conce an employee has cured an unjustified refusal of selective employment, he ... is entitled to reinstatement of benefits,\u201d <em>Newsome, </em>30 Va.App. at 25, 515 S.E.2d at 319 (citing Code \u00a7 65.2-510), as long as the cure is effectuated within \u201csix months from the last day for which compensation was paid before suspension pursuant to [Code \u00a7 65.2-510(A) ],\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-510(C). The calculation of the employee\u2019s benefits following a timely cure depends on whether he fully cured the unjustified refusal or only partially cured it. <em>Compare Newsome, </em>30 Va.App. at 25-26, 515 S.E.2d at 319-20 (addressing compensation following a full cure under Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-510 and 65.2-502), <em>with Hillcrest Manor Nursing Home, </em>35 Va.App. at 37, 39, 542 S.E.2d at 788, 789 (addressing compensation following a partial cure under Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">A full cure occurs when the injured employee procures \u201cother selective employment at a wage equal to or greater than\u201d the wage of the refused selective employment. <em>Newsome, </em>30 Va.App. at 23, 26, 515 S.E.2d at 318, 320. If the employee fully cures his unjustified refusal, he is entitled to \u201ca weekly compensation equal to 66 2/3 percent of the difference between his average weekly wages before the injury and the average weekly wages ... <em>he is able to earn thereafter </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-502 (emphasis added); <em>see Newsome, </em>30 Va.App. at 25, 515 S.E.2d at 319 (\u201cOnce an employee cures an unjustified refusal of employment, Code \u00a7 65.2-510 returns the parties to their pre-refusal status, and Code \u00a7 65.2-502 obligates the employer to pay partial incapacity benefits.\u201d). Accordingly, we held in <em>Newsome </em>that, although the injured employee was unemployed for seven-and-one-half weeks during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>post-refusal period for which he sought compensation, because he had already fully cured his refusal and marketed his full residual work capacity during the period of unemployment, the employer\u2019s liability was not limited \u201cto the difference between [the employee\u2019s] refused selective employment wage and his pre-injury wage.\u201d 30 Va.App. at 25-26, 515 S.E.2d at 319-20. In other words, having fully cured his refusal of selective employment, the employee was entitled to compensation for a full cure under Code \u00a7 65.2-502(A), rather than compensation for a partial cure under Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">A partial cure occurs when the injured employee procures other selective employment \u201c\u2018at a wage less than that originally offered\u2019 \u201d by the employer. <em>Hillcrest Manor Nursing Home, </em>35 Va.App. at 37, 39, 542 S.E.2d at 788, 789 (quoting and citing Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B)). If the employee partially cures his unjustified refusal, he is entitled to \u201ca weekly compensation equal to 66 2/3 percent of the difference between his average weekly wages before his injury and the average weekly wage the employee would have earned by accepting the original proffered light duty employment.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B); <em>see Hillcrest Manor Nursing Home, </em>35 Va.App. at 37, 39, 542 S.E.2d at 788, 789. Accordingly, the employer\u2019s liability under Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B) is not based on the difference between the employee\u2019s pre-injury wage and the wage he could or does earn, but rather on the difference between his pre-injury wage and the wage he would have earned had he not refused the selective employment offered by the employer. This approach does not defeat the purposes of Code \u00a7 65.2-510\u2014to the contrary, it encourages the injured employee to return to work, any work, and limits the employer\u2019s liability to the same liability it would have had if the employee had not refused the employer\u2019s offer of selective employment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Big D Quality Homebuilders v. Hamilton, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>228 Va. 378, 382, 322 S.E.2d 839, 841 (1984) (\u201cThe legislative intent [of Code \u00a7 65.1-63 (recodified as Code \u00a7 65.2-510) ] is to encourage injured employees to seek selective employment rather than to remain unemployed....\u201d); <em>Food Lion, Inc. v. Lee, </em>16 Va.App. 616, 619, 431 S.E.2d 342, 344 (1993) (\u201cCode \u00a7 65.2-510 was enacted ... to encourage employers to procure employment suitable to partially incapacitated employees.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Nothing in Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B) limits the application of that subsection to only injured employees who procure selective employment at wages comparable to the wages they would have earned had they not refused the originally offered selective employment. <em>See Britt Construction v. Magazzine Clean, LLC, </em>271 Va. 58, 62-63, 623 S.E.2d 886, 888 (2006) (\u201cWhen statutory language is unambiguous, we are bound by the plain meaning of that language. Therefore, when the General Assembly has used words of a definite import, we cannot give those words a construction that amounts to holding that the General Assembly meant something other than that which it actually expressed.\u201d (citations omitted)). Indeed, the only wage-related provision that limits Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B)\u2019s application is the subsection\u2019s express requirement that the wage of the selective employment procured by the employee be \u201cless than that originally offered\u201d by the employer. Thus, contrary to the commission\u2019s conclusion, an employer may not escape liability for workers\u2019 compensation benefits under Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B) simply because the employee procures selective employment that pays substantially less than the selective employment offered by the employer. <em>See Peacock v. Browning Ferris, Inc., </em>38 Va.App. 241, 248, 563 S.E.2d 368, 372 (2002) (\u201c[W]e will withhold the deference we normally accord the commission\u2019s statutory interpretation of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act when the commission\u2019s interpretation conflicts with the plain language of the statute.\u201d); <em>Hillcrest Manor Nursing Home, </em>35 Va.App. at 39-40, 542 S.E.2d at 789 (applying Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>In <em>Hillcrest Manor Nursing Home, </em>the claimant suffered a compensable injury by accident that limited her work capacity and prevented her from continuing in her full-time, full-duty position. 35 Va.App. at 34-35, 542 S.E.2d at 787. The employer offered the claimant part-time selective employment, which the claimant accepted. <em>Id. </em>at 35, 542 S.E.2d at 787. Thereafter, the employer offered the claimant full-time selective employment, which the claimant unjustifiably refused. <em>Id. </em>at 35-36, 38, 542 S.E.2d at 787, 789. The claimant continued to work part-time for the employer and took no apparent steps to market her full residual work capacity. <em>Id. </em>at 35-36, 542 S.E.2d at 787. Considering the claimant\u2019s request for benefits for the period following her refusal of the full-time selective employment, the commission determined that the claimant \u201cpartially cured her ... [unjustified] refusal of full-time selective employment by simply continuing the part-time, light duty work that predated the offer\u201d of full-time employment. <em>Id. </em>at 39, 542 S.E.2d at 789. \u201c[T]he commission reasoned that, \u2018although it was the claimant\u2019s decision to work the reduced hours, the effect was the same as if she, in an attempt to cure, had obtained alternate employment at a reduced wage.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the commission awarded the claimant partial disability benefits \u201cpursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B).\u201d <em>Id. </em>We affirmed the commission\u2019s judgment, noting as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-5\"><em>If claimant had refused the offer of full-time employment, resigned and thereafter immediately accepted part-time, light duty work with employer or elsewhere, at reduced wages, she would have partially cured such refusal </em>Likewise, continued part-time, selective employment with [the employer], following the full-time offer, constituted a partial cure of her prior unjustified refusal of such employment within the intendment of Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B). A contrary result would deny benefits under circumstances evincing little substantive difference in conduct, thereby thwarting the purposes of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act____ Accordingly, the commission correctly determined that \u201cclaimant would still be entitled to temporary benefits based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>the difference between her pre[-]injury average weekly wage and the wage she would have earned had she accepted [the] full-time hours.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 39-40, 542 S.E.2d at 789 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">In this case, claimant did just what we spoke of in <em>Hillerest Manor Nursing </em>Home\u2014he refused employer\u2019s offer of continued full-time selective employment, resigned in order to take voluntary retirement, and thereafter timely accepted selective employment with a different employer at reduced wages. Accordingly, we hold that <em>Hillerest Manor Nursing Home </em>is applicable to this ease and requires the conclusion that claimant partially cured his refusal of selective employment under Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">Moreover, we are aware of no controlling precedent since Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B)\u2019s enactment in 1995 that supports the commission\u2019s conclusion that claimant did not partially cure his unjustified refusal of selective employment under Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B) because the position he procured was not \u201cat a wage comparable to that of the previously refused position.\u201d As noted above, <em>Newsome </em>was decided under the full cure provisions of Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-510 and 65.2-502. <em>See </em>30 Va.App. at 26, 515 S.E.2d at 320 (\u201c[B]ecause Newsome properly cured his refusal of selective employment, as long as he fully markets his residual capacity, we find no authority to limit the employer\u2019s liability to the difference between Newsome\u2019s refused selective employment wage and his pre-injury wage.\u201d). In <em>Clements, </em>we cited Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B) and <em>Hillerest Manor Nursing Home </em>for the proposition that a claimant may \u201cpartially cure a refusal\u201d but expressly stated in a footnote that the claimant in that case \u201cnever argued that she partially cured her refusal.\u201d 40 Va.App. at 225 <em>&amp; </em>n. 7, 578 S.E.2d at 819 &amp; n. 7. Similarly, we expressly noted in <em>Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority v. Lusby, </em>41 Va.App. 300, 315 n. 8, 585 S.E.2d 318, 325 n. 8 (2003), that, although Code \u00a7 65.2-510 \u201cwas amended in 1995 to allow for a \u2018partial\u2019 cure[, it was] clear from the full commission\u2019s opinion that it proceeded under the former statute, which was in effect at the time of [the claimant\u2019s] injury, because it [did] not contemplate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>or consider partial cure as a basis for recovery in [the] case.\u201d Thus, none of these cases was decided under the partial cure provisions of Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">We hold, therefore, pursuant to <em>Hillcrest Manor Nursing Home </em>and the express language of Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B), that claimant\u2019s acceptance on March 10, 2003, of selective employment paying $200 per week was sufficient under Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B) to partially cure his unjustified refusal of selective employment paying $1,002 per week. Consequently, having timely partially cured his unjustified refusal of selective employment, claimant was entitled to a continuation of his temporary partial disability wage-loss benefits in accordance with Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">For these reasons, we reverse the commission\u2019s decision and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b718-8\">.

McGuinn, </em>8 Va.App. 267, 380 S.E.2d 31 (1989), a case that predates the enactment of Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B), the dissent reads Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B)\u2019s \"employment suitable to his capacity\" language as permitting a partial cure only where an injured employee either (1) procures selective employment that requires him \"to perform tasks comparable to those he performed during his selective employment\u201d with the employer or (2) demonstrates he has made reasonable efforts to procure such selective employment or to market his full residual work capacity.

He sustained a compensable injury on January 31, 2001, five months after he submitted an application for early retirement. He returned to work the day following his injury and continued to perform light-duty tasks until he retired May 1, 2001. During that time, claimant received temporary partial disability wage-loss benefits at a rate of $161.10 per week.

It is well-settled that \u201c[i]f an injured employee unjustifiably refused selective employment offered by the employer, he or she is \u2018no longer entitled to receive [wage-loss benefits] during the continuance of the refusal.\u2019\u201d <em>ARA Services v. Swift, </em>22 Va.App. 202, 206, 468 S.E.2d 682, 684 (1996) (citing <em>Virginia Wayside Furniture, Inc. v. Burnette, </em>17 Va.App. 74, 78, 435 S.E.2d 156, 159 (1993); Code \u00a7 65.2-510(A)). However, the injured employee is entitled to a reinstatement of such benefits if he cures his unjustified refusal of selective employment, <em>Food Lion, Inc. v. Newsome, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>30 Va.App. 21, 25, 515 S.E.2d 317, 319 (1999), \u201cwithin six months from the last day for which compensation was paid,\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-510(C). Adopting claimant\u2019s argument that Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> permits an injured employee to partially cure an unjustified refusal of selective employment by obtaining \u201cany\u201d alternate employment, the majority concludes \u201cthat claimant\u2019s acceptance ... of selective employment paying $200 per week was sufficient under Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B) to partially cure his unjustified refusal of selective employment paying $1,002 per week.\u201d In my view, the majority disregards Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B)\u2019s \u201csuitable to his capacity\u201d language, which I believe requires the opposite conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Claimant\u2019s argument on appeal raises a question of statutory construction. Although the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act \u201cis highly remedial and should be liberally construed to advance its purpose ... [of compensating employees] for accidental injuries resulting from the hazards of [] employment[,]\u201d <em>Henderson v. Central Tel. Co., </em>233 <em>Va. </em>377, 382, 355 S.E.2d 596, 599 (1987), \u201c[t]hat liberality, however, has its limits.\u201d <em>Clinchfield Coal Co. v. Reed, </em>40 Va.App. 69, 73, 577 S.E.2d 538, 540 (2003). \u201cWe are required to construe the law as it is written.\u201d <em>Peacock v. Browning Ferris, Inc., </em>38 Va.App. 241, 248, 563 S.E.2d 368, 372 (2002) (citation omitted). \u201c mere the legislature has used words of a plain and definite import the courts cannot put upon them a construction which amounts to holding the legislature did not mean what it has actually expressed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Barr v. Town &amp; Country Props., Inc., 240 </em>Va. 292, 295, 396 S.E.2d 672, 674 (1990) (quoting <em>Watkins v. Hall, </em>161 Va. 924, 930, 172 S.E. 445, 447 (1934)). Thus, \u201c[w]e are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>not authorized to amend, alter or extend the ... Act\u2019s provisions beyond their obvious meaning.\u201d <em>Peacock, </em>38 Va.App. at 248-49, 563 S.E.2d at 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The majority concludes that our decision in <em>Hillcrest Manor Nursing Home v. Underwood, </em>35 Va.App. 31, 542 S.E.2d 785 (2001), is applicable to claimant\u2019s case because \u201cclaimant did just what we spoke of in <em>Hillcrest Manor Nursing </em>Home\u2014he refused employer\u2019s offer of continued full-time selective employment, resigned in order to take voluntary retirement, and thereafter timely accepted selective employment with a different employer at reduced wages.\u201d I respectfully disagree. While we recognized in <em>Hillcrest Manor Nursing Home </em>that Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B) permits an injured employee to \u201cpartially cure\u201d an unjustified refusal of selective employment by obtaining alternate employment at a reduced wage, we did not address the statutory provision\u2019s requirement that an employee\u2019s alternate employment must be \u201csuitable to his capacity.\u201d In my view, Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B)\u2019s \u201csuitable to his capacity\u201d language was not at issue in <em>Hillcrest Manor Nursing Home </em>because the same tasks the employee performed in the part-time position were identical to those to be performed in the offered full-time selective employment, only at a reduced wage. 35 Va.App. at 38, 542 S.E.2d at 788. Therefore, her alternate employment was clearly suitable to her residual capacity for work.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Claimant\u2019s alternate employment selling seafood at a substantially reduced wage did not require him to perform tasks comparable to those he performed during his selective employment as a plant mechanic. Consequently, Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B)\u2019s \u201csuitable to his capacity\u201d language, in my view, must be considered in determining whether claimant\u2019s employment selling seafood partially cured his unjustified refusal of selective employment. <em>See Barr, </em>240 Va. at 295, 396 S.E.2d at 674 (\u201cWe must ... assume that the legislature chose, with care, the words it used when it enacted the ... statute, and we are bound by those words as we interpret the statute.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>In interpreting Code \u00a7 65.1-63,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> an earlier version of Code \u00a7 65.2-510 containing substantially similar language, the Supreme Court defined employment \u201csuitable to his capacity\u201d as \u201cemployment within the employee\u2019s residual capacity resulting from the industrial accident.\u201d <em>American Furniture Co. v. Doane, </em>230 Va. 39, 42, 334 S.E.2d 548, 550 (1985). Consistent with that definition, we held in <em>National Linen Service v. McGuinn, </em>8 Va.App. 267, 380 S.E.2d 31 (1989), that \u201cCode \u00a7 65.1-63 ... clearly require[d] a disabled employee to make a \u2018reasonable effort\u2019 to market his remaining work capacity in order to receive continued workers\u2019 compensation benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 269, 380 S.E.2d at 33. Under former Code \u00a7 65.1-63, \u201cthe mere fact that the [injured] employee obtained a new job, where the pay is substantially less than that received at the old job, [was], standing alone, insufficient proof of making a reasonable effort to market\u2019s one\u2019s remaining work capacity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 268, 380 S.E.2d at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">\u201cThe General Assembly subsequently reenacted Code \u00a7 65.1-63 as Code \u00a7 65.2-510 and amended it to recognize the ability of an injured employee to [partially] cure a refusal of selective employment procured for him and to provide a time limit on the period in which an employee may do so.\u201d <em>M &amp; S Auto Parts, Inc. v. Presgraves, </em>45 Va.App. 455, 463, 611 S.E.2d 655, 659 (2005) (citing 1991 Va. Acts, ch. 355; 1995 Va. Acts, ch. 319; 1996 Va. Acts, ch. 252). \u201cHowever, the General Assembly did not alter the basic purpose of the statute or the interpretation given it by our appellate courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In my view, the Supreme Court\u2019s definition of \u201csuitable to his capacity\u201d in <em>Doane </em>continues to be embodied in Code \u00a7 65.2-510\u2019s \u201csuitable to his capacity\u201d language.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> I am also of the view <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>that the reenactment of Code \u00a7 65.1-63 as Code \u00a7 65.2-510, and the subsequent amendment of Code \u00a7 65.2-510 to include subsection (B) did not disturb our holding in <em>McGuinn </em>that temporary wage-loss benefits may be continued only where an injured employee secures suitable employment within his physical limitations or continues to market his residual work capacity. <em>See Burke v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 183, 188, 510 S.E.2d 743, 745-46 (1999) (\u201cWhen new provisions are added to existing legislation by amendment, we presume that the legislature \u2018acted with full knowledge of and in reference to the existing law upon the same subject and the construction placed upon it by the courts.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>City of Richmond v. Sutherland, </em>114 Va. 688, 693, 77 S.E. 470, 472 (1913))).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">In my view, a partial cure may be accomplished under Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B) by the injured employee either obtaining alternate employment that, although paying a reduced wage, is \u201csuitable\u201d to an injured employee\u2019s residual capacity for work, or, by accepting any alternate employment, regardless of its \u201csuitability,\u201d and demonstrating a reasonable effort to market his full residual capacity for work.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Here, claimant worked for employer as a plant mechanic earning $1,243.64 per week. After sustaining a compensable back injury on January 31, 2001, he returned to light-duty work performing the same tasks, but with restrictions on lifting. Claimant remained on light duty with employer, earning $1,002 per week, until May 1, 2001, the date his voluntary retirement became effective. By continuing to work for employer for three months after sustaining his compensable injury, claimant established that the selective light-duty position was within his residual capacity for work. I find no credible evidence in the record that claimant\u2019s position selling seafood for $200 per week is \u201csuitable to his capacity\u201d for work as required by Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B). Moreover, the record before us contains no evidence of claimant\u2019s efforts to obtain alternate employment suitable to his residual work capacity or to market his residual work capacity for some twenty months following his voluntary retirement. It was only by chance that employer discovered that claimant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>obtained employment at his friend\u2019s business at a wage of $200 per week. It is difficult, in my view, on the record before us, to conclude that claimant cured, even partially, his refusal of selective employment\u2014particularly in light of his failure to report his new employment to employer, and when asked why he had not reported it, he replied that, \u201cI didn\u2019t see where it was anybody\u2019s business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Accordingly, I would hold on this record that claimant failed to cure his unjustified refusal of selective employment under Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B), and would affirm the decision of the commission.</p>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b726-8\"><em>. </em>Employer did not file an application for hearing to terminate claimant's wage-loss benefits under Code \u00a7 65.2-510(A) during the period of time from claimant's voluntary retirement until it learned of his new employment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b726-9\">.
