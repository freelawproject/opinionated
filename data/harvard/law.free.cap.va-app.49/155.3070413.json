ELDER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">Kellup Lamonte Brooks (appellant) appeals from his jury trial conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. On appeal, he contends the trial court erred in admitting the certificates of analysis establishing that some of the substances seized at the time of his arrest on an unrelated offense were cocaine. He argues the certificates contained hearsay considered testimonial under <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), and, thus, that admitting them without having the forensic analyst present to testify, although permitted by Code \u00a7 19.2-187 as an exception to state hearsay rules, violated his Confrontation Clause rights. Assuming without deciding the certificates contained information considered testimonial under <em>Crawford, </em>we hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>the procedure in Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-187 and 19.2-187.1 adequately protects a defendant\u2019s Confrontation Clause rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">On June 16, 2004, narcotics investigators arrested appellant in a motel room in which they found several different quantities of suspected cocaine, cash, and paraphernalia associated with drug distribution. Appellant was charged, <em>inter alia, </em>with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. Appellant was indicted for that offense on September 1, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">On September 21, 2004, more than seven days prior to trial, as required by the hearsay exception provision of Code \u00a7 19.2-187, the Commonwealth filed certificates of analysis confirming that several of the items seized were cocaine or contained cocaine or heroin residue. By letter of October 22, 2004, in response to appellant\u2019s motion for discovery and with a copy of the letter to the court, the Commonwealth provided appellant\u2019s counsel with copies of those certificates of analysis, expressly indicating they were being \u201cprovided in accordance with the Code of Virginia \u00a7 19.2-187.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">At trial on August 24, 2005, appellant moved to exclude the certificates of laboratory analysis of the drugs,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> claiming that the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to call the forensic scientist who tested the substances denied him his constitutional right to confrontation under <em>Crawford. </em>The Commonwealth responded that Code \u00a7 19.2-187.1 provides a mechanism giving a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>defendant \u201cthe right to call the person performing such analysis ... at the cost of the Commonwealth\u201d but that appellant had not notified the Commonwealth he had an objection to admitting the certificates in the absence of the scientist. The Commonwealth averred that \u201cif defense counsel had told me specifically he had any objection ..., I would have ensured [the analyst\u2019s] presence here today; and if [the analyst was] unable to be here, ... I would have requested a continuance.\u201d The Commonwealth argued that the provision of Code \u00a7 19.2-187.1 allowing a defendant to assert his right of confrontation in a particular manner prevented it from running afoul of <em>Crawford. </em>Appellant argued \u201cthe fact that [he] could have subpoenaed somebody because the code allows it doesn\u2019t really answer the math because that\u2019s shifting the burden of proof to the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The court denied the motion on two grounds. It reasoned first that Code \u00a7 19.2-187.1</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\">provides for a right to call a person who conducted an examination to have them present, if the defense so desires. It does not shift the burden of proof. What it is, is a procedural provision that simply requires that a party do something in a timely manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">There is no violation of the Confrontation Clause to require a defendant to do something or raise an issue [or] objection in advance of trial because you are balancing the defendant\u2019s right to challenge evidence against the right of the public, in effect, to have an efficiently run court system that\u2019s not bogged down by late requests and objections to evidence that, for example, leaves a jury sitting in a jury room for 35 minutes or more past lunch because we are resolving something that really should have been resolved in advance of trial, if there was any real meat to the objection ____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-8\">... All you have to do is say, you know, I want these people present for this trial, and the Commonwealth would have been forced to [have them present]. And as [the prosecutor] has said, if [you had made such a request in this case], he would have been forced to request a continu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>anee----[T]hen if the Court had granted that request for a continuance, the question of whether or not a speedy trial violation would occur and your objection [could have been addressed]. All those procedural rights and everything would be protected. The confrontation clause [rights] would be protected____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The court also concluded that <em>Crawford </em>was inapplicable because it did not cover non-testimonial hearsay and the court found that reports of scientific examination such as the certificates of drug analysis were non-testimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">At trial, the certificates of analysis were admitted as part of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence. The jury convicted appellant for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, and he noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">The Confrontation Clause of the United States Constitution provides that, \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI. This \u201cprocedural guarantee\u201d also \u201capplies to state prosecutions.\u201d <em>Michels v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 461, 466, 624 S.E.2d 675, 678 (2006). In its 2004 decision in <em>Crawford, </em>the United States Supreme Court clarified the test for \u201cdetermining whether the admission of hearsay,\u201d an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, \u201cviolates the accused\u2019s right[s] under the Confrontation Clause.\u201d <em>Horton v. Allen, </em>370 F.3d 75, 83 (1st Cir.2004). \u201c[W]hen the declarant appears for cross-examination at trial,\u201d stated the Court, \u201cthe Confrontation Clause places no constraints at all on the use of his prior ... statements.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 59 n. 9, 124 S.Ct. at 1369 n. 9, 158 L.Ed.2d at 197 n. 9. However, if the declarant does not appear for trial and the statement is \u201ctestimonial\u201d in nature, \u201cthe Sixth Amendment demands what the common law required: [proof of the] unavailability [of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>declarant] and a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68, 124 S.Ct. at 1374, 158 L.Ed.2d at 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Appellant avers the trial court erred in admitting the certificates of analysis establishing that the substances seized were cocaine, contending the certificates contained hearsay considered testimonial under <em>Crawford </em>and, thus, that admitting them without having the forensic analyst present to testify, although permitted by Code \u00a7 19.2-187 as an exception to state hearsay rules, violated his Confrontation Clause rights. Assuming without deciding the certificates contained information considered testimonial under <em>Crawford, </em>we hold the procedure in Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-187 and 19.2-187.1 adequately protects a defendant\u2019s Confrontation Clause rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The applicable version of Code \u00a7 19.2-187 provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-7\">In any hearing or trial of any criminal offense ..., a certificate of analysis of a person performing an analysis or examination, performed [in any of several specified laboratories] when such certificate is duly attested by such person, shall be admissible in evidence as evidence of the facts therein stated and the results of the analysis or examination referred to therein, provided (i) the certificate of analysis is filed with the clerk of the court hearing the case at least seven days prior to the hearing or trial and (ii) a copy of such certificate is [provided to counsel of record for the accused upon request made in the manner prescribed by the statute].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">2005 Va. Acts, chs. 868, 881.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">Code \u00a7 19.2-187.1 provides that, \u201cin any hearing or trial in which a certificate of analysis is admitted into evidence pursuant to \u00a7 19.2-187,\u201d the accused \u201cshall have the right to call the person performing such analysis or examination ... as a witness therein, and examine him in the same manner as if he had been called as an adverse witness.\u201d That code section further provides that \u201c[s]ueh witness shall be summoned and appear at the cost of the Commonwealth.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-187.1. Manifestly, in order to compel the attendance of a witness at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>trial via the court\u2019s subpoena power, a subpoena for that witness must be issued and served in advance of trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Here, because appellant failed to notify the Commonwealth or the trial court of his desire to confront the preparer of the certificates of drug analysis until the day of trial, appellant failed properly to avail himself of the protections of Code \u00a7 19.2-187.1. We hold, as have other courts interpreting similar statutes, that this failure constituted a simultaneous waiver of any right he may have had under the Confrontation Clause to cross-examine the preparer of the certificates.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The right of an accused to confront and cross-examine is \u201c \u2018not absolute and may, in appropriate cases, bow to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Baugh v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 368, 371, 417 S.E.2d 891, 893 (1992) (quoting <em>Chambers v. Mississippi </em>410 U.S. 284, 295, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 1046, 35 L.Ed.2d 297, 309 (1973)). \u201cIt has [also] long been recognized that a defendant may voluntarily waive the right to eonfront[ation]____\u201d <em>State v. Cunningham, </em>903 So.2d 1110, 1120 (La.2005) (citing <em>Diaz v. United States, </em>223 U.S. 442, 450, 32 S.Ct. 250, 252, 56 L.Ed. 500, 503 (1912)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-9\">[T]he right may be waived by a guilty plea, <em>Boykin v. Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969) , by a defendant\u2019s disruptive conduct in the courtroom, <em>Illinois v.

Carlson, </em>547 F.2d 1346 (8th Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 914, 97 S.Ct. 2174, 53 L.Ed.2d 224 (1977).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-5\"><em>Bilokur v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 467, 472, 270 S.E.2d 747, 751 (1980). The Virginia Supreme Court has also held that a defendant may, through counsel, waive his right to confrontation by stipulating to the use of a witness\u2019 prior testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 473-74, 270 S.E.2d at 751-52 (adopting \u201cas the rule in Virginia\u201d that counsel for a criminal defendant may, under certain circumstances, \u201c \u201cwaive his client\u2019s Sixth Amendment right of confrontation by stipulating to the admission of evidence\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Stephens, </em>609 F.2d 230, 232-33 (5th Cir.1980))).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>It is also \u201cbeyond question that under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment [a state] may attach reasonable time limitations to the assertion of federal constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Michel v. Louisiana, </em>350 U.S. 91, 97, 76 S.Ct. 158, 162, 100 L.Ed. 83, 91 (1955). \u201cA state procedural rule which forbids the raising of federal questions at late stages in the case, or by any other than a prescribed method, has been recognized as a valid exercise of state power.\u201d <em>Williams v. Georgia, </em>349 U.S. 375, 382-83, 75 S.Ct. 814, 819, 99 L.Ed. 1161, 1170 (1955). Under Code \u00a7 19.2-266.2, for example, absent \u201cgood cause shown,\u201d an accused seeking to exclude evidence he contends was gathered in violation of his Fourth, Fifth, or Sixth Amendment rights waives the opportunity to raise such a claim if he does not file a written motion to suppress at least seven days before trial. That code section contains a related subdivision addressing a defendant\u2019s claim that charges against him are based on an unconstitutional statute and provides that failure to raise such a claim in a timely fashion also constitutes a waiver. <em>See Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 634, 644-45, 561 S.E.2d 1, 6 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Similarly, we hold Code \u00a7 19.2-187.1 sets out a reasonable procedure to be followed in order for a defendant to exercise his right to confront a particular limited class of scientific witnesses at trial and that a defendant\u2019s failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>follow this procedure amounts to a waiver of the constitutional right to confront such witnesses.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This procedure encourages judicial and governmental economy by providing that certain scientific witnesses, employees of the state, need not routinely be called to testify, but it preserves the right of a defendant to confront any such witness as long as he notifies the Commonwealth, in a specific and timely fashion, of his desire to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The holding in <em>Crawford, </em>the United States Supreme Court\u2019s 2004 Confrontation Clause decision, does not compel a contrary result, as appellate courts in other jurisdictions have decided. The Supreme Court of Louisiana, for example, reached just such a result in <em>State v. Cunningham, </em>903 So.2d 1110 (La.2005). Pursuant to the statute at issue in <em>Cunningham, </em>if the prosecutor provided a defendant with a copy of the certificate of analysis and written notice, at least ten days prior to trial, of his intent to offer the certificate into evidence at trial, the court was required, subject to certain exceptions, to admit the certificate \u201cas prima facie proof of the facts shown thereon, and as prima facie proof of [the chain of] custody of the physical evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1115 (citing La.Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 15:501). The statute provided the certificate would not serve as prima facie proof if \u201cthe party against whom the certificate is offered requests a subpoena for the person performing the analysis at least five days before trial\u201d or \u201c \u2018the person subpoenaed responds to the subpoena.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting La.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 15:501). The defendant contended the statute both deprived him of his right to confront and cross-examine the witness and impermissibly shifted the burden of proof to him. <em>Id. </em>at 1113-14.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-6\">In rejecting the defendant\u2019s arguments, the court explained: These statutes are [merely] a formalized means of effecting a stipulation to the admissibility of matters which often are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>not in dispute.... After the State has put the defendant on notice, the statute provides the defendant with a small procedural step which must be taken to exercise the right to confrontation. In essence, it is the defendant\u2019s decision which dictates whether the State must produce the individual who prepared the report or whether the defendant will agree to use of the [analyst\u2019s] report....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-5\">... As the State conceded at oral argument, once the defendant requests the subpoena, [the express language of the statute provides] the certificate of analysis has no evidentiary value and the State must call the relevant witnesses to prove its case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1119-21; <em>see also City of Las Vegas v. Walsh, </em>121 Nev. 899, 124 P.3d 203, 207-08 (2005) (en banc); <em>State v. Campbell, </em>719 N.W.2d 374, 376-78 (N.D.2006). As additional support for its reasoning, the Louisiana Supreme Court cited a recognized procedural step involved in a defendant\u2019s exercising his Fourth Amendment rights under Louisiana law, noting that \u201ca defendant must file a [pre-trial] motion to suppress in order to contest an unconstitutional search.\u201d <em>Cunningham, </em>903 So.2d at 1121 n. 11; <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-266.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Oregon\u2019s appellate courts have taken a like approach, holding Oregon\u2019s statute \u201cis a legislative decision to make what amounts to [a request to the defendant to stipulate to the contents and chain of custody of a certificate of analysis] in <em>every ... </em>case.\u201d <em>State v. Hancock, </em>317 Or. 5, 854 P.2d 926, 929 (1993); <em>see State v. Miller, </em>208 Or.App. 424, 144 P.3d 1052, 1060 (2006) (holding reasoning in <em>Hancock </em>still valid after Crawford). The Oregon statute at issue in <em>Hancock, </em>which set out a procedure almost identical to Virginia\u2019s, provided that certain reports analyzing controlled substances \u201c \u2018shall be! accepted as prima facie evidence of the results of the analytical findings\u2019 \u201d but that \u201c \u2018the defendant may subpoena the [analyst] to testify at the prehminary hearing and trial ... at no cost to the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hancock, </em>854 P.2d at 926 (quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 475.235). Pursuant to that statute, the Court observed in <em>Hancock,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-4\">Defendant has the right to confront the [analyst]----By its very terms, [the Oregon statute] expressly safeguards a defendant\u2019s right to confront and cross-examine, \u201cface-to-face,\u201d the person who performed the tests\u2014 If a defendant wants to cross-examine the [analyst], he or she must subpoena the [analyst]. Service of the subpoena puts the state on notice that the defendant wants to cross-examine the [analyst]. At trial, the state can, if it wishes, call the [analyst] to testify to the testing processes, or it can offer the report [as permitted by the statute].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 929.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">Similarly, we hold that, even in the wake of <em>Crawford, </em>Virginia\u2019s applicable statutes, Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-187 and 19.2-187.1, are merely a request to the defendant to stipulate to the admissibility of the contents of any properly filed certificates of analysis. Where a defendant waits until trial to assert his right to cross-examine the analyst who prepared a particular certificate, he accepts the request to stipulate and waives his right to confront that witness. <em>See </em>John G. Douglass, <em>Beyond Admissibility: Real Confrontation, Virtual Cross-Examination, and the Right to Confront Hearsay, </em>67 Geo. Wash. L.Rev. 191, 229 (1999) (\u201cProperly applied, ... a rule providing that defendants must request a subpoena to invoke the confrontation right should not work a serious hardship on defendants. In essence, the rule requires that a defendant mean what he says when he asks for confrontation.\u201d). <em>But see State v. Smith, </em>2006 Ohio 1661, *P21-*P26, 2006 WL 846342, *6-*7, 2006 Ohio App. Lexis 1555, **18-**22 (holding \u201cwaiver of the confrontation right before trial must be made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily\u201d and that waiver not voluntary in Smith\u2019s case because language on copy of certificate provided to him contained insufficient information regarding effect of waiver); <em>State v. Caulfield, </em>722 N.W.2d 304, 312-13 (Minn. 2006) (adopting reasoning of Ohio Court of Appeals in <em>Smith). </em>If the defendant does not wish to enter into such a stipulation, Code \u00a7 19.2-187.1 provides the mechanism by which he may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>reject the request and have the analyst summoned to appear at trial at the cost of the Commonwealth in order to be subject to cross-examination. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 59 n. 9, 124 S.Ct. at 1369 n. 9, 158 L.Ed.2d at 197 n. 9 (\u201c[W]hen the declarant appears for cross-examination at trial, the Confrontation Clause places no constraints at all on the use of his prior ... statements.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">In sum, we hold a defendant\u2019s failure timely to notify the Commonwealth of his desire to confront the forensic analyst at trial constitutes a waiver of that right. To the extent appellant also claims the procedure in Code \u00a7 19.2-187.1 unconstitutionally placed upon him the burden of presenting evidence in order to exercise his right to call the analyst, <em>see, e.g., Green v. Young, </em>264 Va. 604, 609, 571 S.E.2d 135, 138 (2002) (recognizing due process right of accused to have Commonwealth prove every element of case against him beyond reasonable doubt), we hold that question is not before us on appeal. Because appellant failed under Code \u00a7 19.2-187.1 to \u201csummon[ ]\u201d \u201cthe person performing [the] analysis or examination\u201d or to ask that the Commonwealth do so, the trial court never had occasion to address the proper order of proof. Assuming without deciding the provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-187.1 relating to the order of proof at trial could conceivably be applied in a way that violates an accused\u2019s due process rights,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> such an application did not occur in appellant\u2019s case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number><em>See Grosso v. Commonwealth, </em>177 Va. 830, 838-39, 13 S.E.2d 285, 288 (1941) (assuming without deciding statute may be applied in discriminatory fashion, \u201cone challenging the constitutionality of a provision in a statute has the burden of showing that he himself has been injured thereby\u201d). Thus, we do not consider such a claim in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">For these reasons, we hold the procedure in Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-187 and 19.2-187.1, to the extent that procedure is before us in this appeal, adequately protects a defendant\u2019s Confrontation Clause rights. Because appellant waived that right by failing to invoke it in advance of trial, we hold the trial court\u2019s admission of the challenged certificates was not error on these facts, and we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b204-10\">. We do not consider the constitutionality of the order of proof allowed by Code \u00a7 19.2-187.1 because that issue is not properly before us in this appeal. <em>See infra </em>text accompanying note 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b204-11\">. Appellant also moved to exclude a certificate of DNA analysis involving a firearm, but the admission of that certificate is not at issue in this appeal.

The Court held that \"the constitutional rights of a defendant cannot be waived by his counsel <em>under such circumstances.\" Id. </em>(emphasis added). The Court noted its ongoing recognition of the principle \u201cthat counsel may, under some conditions, where the circumstances are not 'exceptional, preclude the accused from asserting constitutional claims,\u2019 \u201d but it held that this principle did not allow an attorney to \"override his client\u2019s desire <em>expressed in open court </em>to plead not guilty.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 7-8, 86 S.Ct. at 1248-49, 16 L.Ed.2d at 319 (quoting <em>Henry v.
