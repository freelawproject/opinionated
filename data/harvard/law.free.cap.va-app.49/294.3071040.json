He argues the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained during an investigatory stop of his vehicle, based solely on an observation by the arresting officer that an otherwise valid inspection sticker was partially \u201cpeeling\u201d away from the vehicle\u2019s \u2022windshield. For the following reasons, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b343-14\">When we review a trial court\u2019s denial of a suppression motion, \u201c[w]e view the evidence in a light most favorable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>to ... the prevailing party below, and we grant all reasonable inferences fairly deducible from that evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Grimstead, </em>12 Va.App. 1066, 1067, 407 S.E.2d 47, 48 (1991) (citation omitted). \u201c[W]e are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact unless \u2018plainly wrong\u2019 or without evidence to support them.\u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, 25 </em>Va.App. 198, 198, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en </em>banc) (citing <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1663, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996)). \u201cHowever, we consider <em>de novo </em>whether those facts implicate the Fourth Amendment, and if so, whether the officers unlawfully infringed upon an area protected by the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Hughes v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 447, 454, 524 S.E.2d 155, 159 (2000) <em>(en </em>banc) (citing <em>McGee, 25 </em>Va.App. at 198, 487 S.E.2d at 261).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">At 3:30 p.m. on February 15, 2005, Officer Bryan of the Henrico County Police Department was sitting in a marked police vehicle parked in a grocery store parking lot, facing Cool Lane, \u201ca foot or two off the roadway.\u201d Officer Bryan saw a white 2001 Ford drive past his position, some five feet away. He observed that a portion of a valid inspection sticker<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on the Ford\u2019s windshield was partially peeling from the windshield. Officer Bryan testified that based on his experience, an inspection sticker not fully attached to a vehicle\u2019s windshield often \u201cdid not belong on that car.\u201d He initiated a traffic stop of the vehicle to further investigate the inspection sticker.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Prior to initiating the traffic stop of the Ford, Officer Bryan \u201cran\u201d the vehicle\u2019s license plates and learned that the vehicle was a rental car with valid plates and registration. He testified that the sole reason he stopped the vehicle was because the valid inspection sticker was partially peeling from the windshield. When he approached the vehicle to speak with its driver, he smelled marijuana emanating from the vehicle\u2019s interior. Appellant, the Ford\u2019s driver, admitted he had been smoking marijuana in the vehicle. During his subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>quent search of the vehicle, Officer Bryan recovered marijuana, cocaine, heroin, digital scales, and an operable firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">At a pretrial hearing, appellant moved to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of the stop, contending the stop violated his Fourth Amendment rights because the manner by which the valid inspection sticker was affixed to the windshield did not give rise to a reasonable articulable suspicion that the sticker on the Ford was not validly on that car. Officer Bryan testified that he had stopped <em>approximately </em>50 cars within the previous six months for improper inspection stickers and <em>30 to 35 </em>of those vehicles possessed invalid inspection stickers. He explained the nature of those stops during cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aynl\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: So basically in your testimony, you said in the last six months you stopped approximately fifty cars and you said that thirty to thirty-five per cent of the cars had\u2014the inspection stickers may have been from another vehicle? Is that what you\u2019re saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\">OFFICER BRYAN: No, sir. Thirty to thirty-five of the vehicles, out of the fifty, had bad inspection stickers. DEFENSE COUNSEL: All right. That were valid or invalid?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-7\">OFFICER BRYAN: Invalid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-8\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Now\u2014so in other words, that would be sixty to seventy per cent of the cars?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-9\">OFFICER BRYAN: Approximately.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-10\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: And the other thirty\u2014thirty to forty per cent had valid stickers. They had just\u2014the glue had come loose?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-11\">OFFICER BRYAN: Yes, sir.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-12\">When asked how many vehicles he stopped during the past twelve to eighteen months, he responded that he <em>\u201cguess[ed] </em>it would be a hundred vehicles\u201d and that the <em>\u201cmajority\u201d </em>of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>stops turned out to be for inspection sticker related infractions.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">The trial court overruled appellant\u2019s motion to suppress, finding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-5\">the [inspection] sticker was peeling off, and the officer having had the experience that he had, would subjectively raise an appropriate suspicion in his mind, that this sticker could have been stolen or otherwise inappropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Appellant subsequently entered conditional pleas of guilty for possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute and possession of a firearm after having been convicted of a felony, preserving his right to appeal the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of the investigatory stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Appellant asserts the investigatory stop violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure because it was \u201cneither supported by probable cause that a traffic violation had occurred or reasonable articulable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot.\u201d Specifically, he contends Officer Bryan\u2019s observation that the vehicle\u2019s inspection sticker \u201cwas not <em>totally </em>affixed to the windshield\u201d amounted to no more than a mere \u201chunch that there might be a problem with the vehicle[\u2019s] inspection sticker.\u201d Such a hunch, he argues, does not justify the stop of a motor vehicle. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">\u201cThe Fourth Amendment prohibits \u2018unreasonable searches and seizures\u2019 by the Government, and its protections extend to brief investigatory stops of persons or vehicles that fall short of traditional arrest.\u201d <em>United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 273, 122 S.Ct. 744, 750, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002) (citing <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 9, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1873, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968); <em>United States v. Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 417, 101 S.Ct. 690, 694-95, 66 L.Ed.2d 621 (1981)). \u201cBecause the \u2018balance between the public interest and the individual\u2019s right to personal security,\u2019 <em>United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, </em>422 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>U.S. 873, 878, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 2579, 45 L.Ed.2d 607 (1975), tilts in favor of a standard less than probable cause in such cases, the Fourth Amendment is satisfied if the officer\u2019s action is supported by reasonable suspicion to believe that criminal activity \u2018may be afoot.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. 1, 7, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 1585, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989)). Thus, \u201c[a] police officer may conduct an investigatory stop of a motor vehicle if he has at least \u2018articulable and reasonable suspicion\u2019 that the operator is unlicensed, the vehicle is unregistered, or the vehicle or an occupant is otherwise subject to seizure for violating the law.\u201d <em>Reel v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 262, 265-66, 522 S.E.2d 881, 883 (2000) (citing <em>Delaware v. Prouse, </em>440 U.S. 648, 663, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 1401, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979); <em>Murphy v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 139, 143, 384 S.E.2d 125, 127 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">\u201cReasonable suspicion, like probable cause, is dependent upon both the content of information possessed by police and its degree of reliability.\u201d <em>Alabama v. White, </em>496 U.S. 325, 330, 110 S.Ct. 2412, 2416, 110 L.Ed.2d 301 (1990). \u201cThere are no bright line rules to follow when determining whether a reasonable and articulable suspicion exists to justify an investigatory stop.\u201d <em>Reel, </em>31 Va.App. at 266, 522 S.E.2d at 883. Instead, courts \u201cmust look at the \u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019 of each case to see whether the detaining officer ha[d] a \u2018particularized and objective basis\u2019 for suspecting legal wrongdoing.\u201d <em>Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. at 273, 122 S.Ct. at 750 (quoting <em>Cortez, </em>449 U.S. at 417-18, 101 S.Ct. at 695). While this standard \u201callows officers to draw on their own experience and specialized training to make inferences from and deductions about the cumulative information available to them that \u2018might well elude an untrained person,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Cortez, </em>449 U.S. at 418, 101 S.Ct. at 695), \u201c[i]f the officer\u2019s suspicion amounts merely to an \u2018inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or \u201chunch[,]\u201d ... [rather] than a fair inference in the light of his experience, [it] is simply too slender a reed to support the seizure\u2019 under the [F]ourth and [F]ourteenth [A]mendments of the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>Murphy, </em>9 Va.App. at 144, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>384 S.E.2d at 128 (quoting <em>Reid v. Georgia, </em>448 U.S. 438, 441, 100 S.Ct. 2752, 2754, 65 L.Ed.2d 890 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Here, Officer Bryan concedes he stopped appellant\u2019s vehicle <em>solely </em>because of his brief observation that a portion of the vehicle\u2019s otherwise valid inspection sticker was not completely affixed to the windshield.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As part of its highway safety program, Virginia requires motor vehicles registered in the Commonwealth to be inspected annually for mechanical and equipment defects at an official inspection station. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-1157, 46.2-1158. If no mechanical or equipment defects are discovered, the official inspection station must place an approval sticker on the windshield of the vehicle.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Code \u00a7 46.2-1163. Failure to comply with the annual inspection requirement constitutes a traffic infraction. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-1157, 46.2-1163. Additionally, it is unlawful to display an official state inspection sticker that was issued for another vehicle or is known to be counterfeit. Code \u00a7 46.2-1173.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">In <em>Prouse, </em>440 U.S. 648, 99 S.Ct. 1391, the United States Supreme Court recognized the states\u2019 vital interest in ensuring that motor vehicles are fit for safe operation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, it noted that \u201c[t]he \u2018grave danger\u2019 of abuse of discretion does not disappear simply because the automobile is subject to state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>regulation resulting in numerous instances of police-citizen contact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 662, 99 S.Ct. at 1400 (citations omitted). Thus, the Court held that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">marginal contribution to roadway safety possibly resulting from a system of spot checks cannot justify subjecting every occupant of every vehicle on the roads to a seizure\u2014limited in magnitude compared to other intrusions but nonetheless constitutionally cognizable\u2014at the <em>unbridled discretion </em>of law enforcement officials. To insist neither upon an appropriate factual basis for suspicion directed at a particular automobile nor upon some other substantial and objective standard or rule to govern the exercise of discretion \u201cwould invite intrusions upon constitutionally guaranteed rights based on nothing more substantial than inarticulate hunches....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 661, 99 S.Ct. at 1400 (quoting <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 22, 88 S.Ct. at 1880) (emphasis added). Accordingly, the Court determined that because many violations of minimum vehicle-safety requirements are immediately observable, it is unnecessary to stop vehicles <em>merely </em>to ascertain compliance with a state\u2019s registration and vehicle-safety requirements. <em>Id. </em>at 660, 99 S.Ct. at 1399 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Our holdings in <em>Reel </em>and <em>Commonwealth v. Spencer, </em>21 Va.App. 156, 462 S.E.2d 899 (1995), illustrate the principles articulated in <em>Prouse. </em>In <em>Reel, </em>we concluded that, under the totality of the circumstances, observation of a rejection sticker is sufficiently specific and objective to provide a reasonable and articulable suspicion of legal wrongdoing. 31 Va.App. at 268, 522 S.E.2d at 885. We reasoned that, \u201cwhen an officer sees a vehicle being operated with a rejection sticker, he [immediately] knows the vehicle has been determined to have defective equipment, and this knowledge provides reasonable suspicion for the officer to conduct an investigatory stop to determine whether the defective equipment has been repaired.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">In <em>Spencer, </em>we held that \u201cthe lack of a city or county decal, without more, was insufficient to justify [an investigatory] stop <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>of [a] vehicle.\u201d 21 Va.App. at 160, 462 S.E.2d at 901. There, we found that, because the officers knew other jurisdictions in the state did not require decals, the absence of a city or county decal, standing alone, did not constitute a specific and objective fact indicating that the vehicle was in violation of a local ordinance. We noted that, had the officers confirmed that the vehicle in question was registered in a jurisdiction requiring a decal prior to initiating the stop, the officers would have had a specific and objective basis for stopping the vehicle. We concluded, therefore, that the \u201cbenefit gained from stopping individual vehicles without decals is marginal when compared to the constitutional rights of drivers and their passengers who are seized.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Similar to the officers in <em>Reel </em>and <em>Spencer, </em>Officer Bryan relied on a single factor to justify stopping appellant\u2019s vehicle\u2014his brief observation of a partially peeling, but otherwise valid, inspection sticker. Unlike the rejection sticker in <em>Reel, </em>however, the appearance of appellant\u2019s partially peeling, but otherwise valid inspection sticker did not immediately identify the vehicle as being in violation of a vehicle-safety requirement or Code \u00a7 46.2-1173. Virginia\u2019s vehicle-safety regulations prescribe the location on the windshield inspection stickers must be affixed. However, we find no specifications in these regulations as to the manner in which such stickers must be attached. The only requirement is that the expiration date of the sticker must be clearly visible. Because the inspection sticker was lawful on its face, our holding in <em>Spencer </em>mandates that more information was required in order for Officer Bryan to formulate a particularized and objective suspicion that the sticker had been unlawfully transferred or was counterfeit in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-1173.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Furthermore, Code \u00a7 46.2-1164 provides that a valid inspection sticker may be removed from a vehicle\u2019s broken windshield and reattached to the vehicle\u2019s new windshield without submitting the vehicle to re-inspection. This provision is also silent as to the means by which an inspection sticker is to be re-attached to a vehicle\u2019s new windshield. A logical consequence of such a legislatively sanctioned transfer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>is that the inspection sticker\u2019s glue may not fully affix to the new windshield, causing the sticker to appear to be \u201cpeeling\u201d from the windshield.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Accordingly, because there is no requirement that an inspection sticker must be completely affixed to a vehicle\u2019s windshield, we conclude that a \u201cpeeling\u201d inspection sticker is not, in and of itself, unlawful. Nor does it, standing alone, constitute a particularized and objective fact that gives rise to a reasonable articulable suspicion that the sticker has unlawfully been transferred from another vehicle or is otherwise counterfeit in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-1173.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">We recognize that \u201cthe mere fact that particular conduct may be susceptible of an innocent explanation does not [automatically] establish a lack of reasonable suspicion.\u201d <em>United States v. Perkins, </em>363 F.3d 317, 326 (4th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>543 U.S. 1056, 125 S.Ct. 867, 160 L.Ed.2d 781 (2005). <em>See also Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. at 277, 122 S.Ct. at 753 (\u201cA determination that reasonable suspicion exists[ ] [ ] need not rule out the possibility of innocent conduct.\u201d (citing <em>Illinois v. Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. 119, 125, 120 S.Ct. 673, 676-77, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000))). However, where particular conduct is, on its face, lawful or at least susceptible to a legitimate explanation, the Fourth Amendment requires the presence of additional factors that, under the totality of the circumstances, objectively point to legal wrongdoing. <em>See Spencer, </em>21 Va.App. 156, 462 S.E.2d 899. <em>See also Brignoni-Ponce, </em>422 U.S. 873, 95 S.Ct. 2574 (apparent Mexican ancestry of vehicle\u2019s occupants, standing alone, insufficient to furnish border patrol agent with a reasonable articulable suspicion that occupants were illegal aliens because \u201c[l]arge numbers of native-born and naturalized citizens have the physical characteristics identified with Mexican ancestry\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">In <em>Brignoni-Ponce, </em>the United States Supreme Court noted that there are \u201c[a]ny number of factors [that] may be taken into account in deciding whether there is a reasonable suspicion to stop a car in the border area,\u201d including the fact that a person appears to be of Mexican ancestry. <em>Id. </em>at 884, 95 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>at 2582. However, it held that while \u201c[t]he likelihood that any given person of Mexican ancestry is an alien is high enough to make Mexican appearance a <em>relevant factor, </em>[ ] standing alone it does not justify stopping all Mexican-Americans to ask if they are aliens.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 886-87, 95 S.Ct. at 2583 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The same can be said of partially peeling inspection stickers. It is unquestionable that the \u201cpeeling\u201d appearance of a valid inspection sticker is a relevant factor in determining whether the sticker was unlawfully transferred from another vehicle. However, because a partially peeling inspection sticker is not unlawful, it does not justify, without some additional indicia of legal wrongdoing, stopping all vehicles displaying valid inspections stickers that are not completely affixed to their windshields. Trial courts must consider the totality of <em>all </em>of the circumstances surrounding a stop of a vehicle, including whether a relevant factor may have a legitimate explanation, when determining whether an officer had a reasonable articulable suspicion, based on particularized and objective facts, to stop a vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">In this case, Officer Bryan relied on a single factor to justify stopping appellant\u2019s vehicle\u2014the vehicle\u2019s partially peeling, but otherwise valid, inspection sticker. He testified that he suspected appellant\u2019s partially peeling inspection sticker could belong to another car because he had stopped approximately 50 vehicles within the previous six months and approximately 30 to 35 of those vehicles had invalid, as opposed to valid and partially peeling, inspection stickers.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">After considering Officer Bryan\u2019s testimony, the trial court ruled that his experience with inspection sticker violations \u201csubjectively raise[d] an appropriate suspicion in his mind[ ] that th[e] [peeling] sticker could have been stolen or otherwise inappropriate.\u201d In so doing, the trial court ignored the prescriptions of <em>Spencer </em>and <em>Brignoni-Ponce </em>that a single factor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>lawful in and of itself, is insufficient to furnish reasonable articulable suspicion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, the record reflects that Officer Bryan\u2019s experience with both invalid and partially peeling, but otherwise valid, inspection stickers \u201cdid not attach with any particularity\u201d to appellant\u2019s partially peeling, but otherwise valid inspection sticker or to appellant himself. <em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 407, 416, 551 S.E.2d 606, 611 (2001).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Under the record presented to us in this case, Officer Bryan\u2019s observation of appellant\u2019s partially peeling inspection sticker, without more, amounted to nothing more than an inchoate and unparticularized \u201chunch\u201d that the inspection sticker did not belong to appellant\u2019s vehicle. Such a \u201chunch\u201d is too slender a reed to justify an investigatory stop under the Fourth Amendment. <em>Murphy, </em>9 Va.App. at 144, 384 S.E.2d at 128. \u201cUpholding a stop on these facts would permit [ ] [law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>enforcement] to make a random, suspicionless stop of any car with a [partially peeling inspection sticker]. The Fourth Amendment does not afford the police such unbridled discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>205 F.3d 720, 724 (4th Cir. 2000) (citing <em>Prouse, </em>440 U.S. at 663, 99 S.Ct. at 1401).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence seized during the investigatory stop of his vehicle, and remand for further proceedings if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b344-7\">.

Commonwealth, </em>270 Va. 414, 420-21, 620 S.E.2d 760, 763 (2005). There, the Court determined the trial court had erroneously denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence because, upon consideration of the totality of the circumstances, the investigating officer\u2019s observation of the defendant sleeping in a parked car with a hand-rolled cigarette in his hand was insufficient by itself to establish probable cause to arrest him for possession of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">Although reasonable suspicion imposes a less stringent requirement to effect a Fourth Amendment seizure than does probable cause, we find the principles articulated in <em>Brown </em>persuasive because both legal standards require reviewing courts to objectively consider the \"totality of the circumstances.\" <em>See Taylor </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 816, 820-21, 284 S.E.2d 833, 836 (1981) (whether probable cause exists depends upon \"what the totality of the circumstances means to police officers trained in analyzing the observed conduct for purposes of crime control\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b353-10\">. Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that Officer Biyan was suspicious that the otherwise valid inspection sticker did not belong on the vehicle appellant was driving, surely that suspicion would have dissipated when, prior to initiating the traffic stop, he learned from his computer check that the vehicle was a validly licensed and registered rental car.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b354-7\">McCLANAHAN, J., dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">I disagree that Officer Bryan had no \u201c \u2018particularized and objective basis\u2019 for suspecting legal wrongdoing\u201d to justify the investigatory traffic stop. <em>United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 273, 122 S.Ct. 744, 750, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002). In my opinion, reasonable articulable suspicion was established by evidence of both the officer\u2019s observation of the peeling inspection sticker and \u201c[his] own experience and specialized training to make inferences from and deductions about [that] information available to [him] that \u2018might well elude an untrained person.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v: Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 418, 101 S.Ct. 690, 695, 66 L.Ed.2d 621 (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">I do not read the applicable case law as holding that the presence or absence of reasonable articulable suspicion may be determined by counting the number of \u201cfactors\u201d presented for justifying the stop. There are \u201cno [such] bright line rules to follow\u201d when making that determination. <em>Reel v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 262, 266, 522 S.E.2d 881, 883 (2000). Nevertheless, Officer Bryan did not rely only on a single factor to justify stopping appellant\u2019s vehicle\u2014the partially peeling inspection sticker. The officer also articulated in detail why he was suspicious based on his recent experience.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See Logan v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 437, 442, 452 S.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>364, 368 (1994) (\u201c[W]e agree with the Commonwealth that if a broken window is suggestive of a prior theft, it is just as suggestive of what the officers suspected it might be in this case, a theft in progress.\u201d). Indeed, in light of that experience, it was <em>more likely than not </em>that the peeling inspection sticker was not lawfully attached to appellant\u2019s vehicle\u2014the officer having found the same violation in 30 to 35 out of approximately 50 vehicles he had stopped in the previous six months.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The officer\u2019s testimony on this issue does not pertain to something other than peeling stickers located on the wrong vehicles. The import of the officer\u2019s entire testimony, in context, was that he found such to be the case with each of those 30 to 35 vehicles. As the trial court explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOe\">what he\u2019s telling me is that [in the instant case] he felt it was a problem, because he had stopped many cars before, that have had <em>stickers coming off, </em>and in the majority of those <em>he\u2019s found that the sticker didn\u2019t go to that car. </em>So it goes to the issue of whether or not there\u2019s reasonable suspicion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"As8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">In <em>Delaware v. Prouse, </em>440 U.S. 648, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979), the United States Supreme Court held a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>police officer\u2019s random traffic stop of a vehicle and detention of the driver for the sole purpose of checking his driver\u2019s license and vehicle registration, without first observing \u201cany suspicious activity,\u201d whatsoever, was an unreasonable seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 650, 99 S.Ct. at 1394. In doing so, the Court recognized that licensing, registration, and vehicle inspection requirements \u201care essential elements in a highway safety program,\u201d through which a state may ensure that the drivers on its highways are qualified and that their vehicles are fit to operate. <em>Id. </em>at 658, 99 S.Ct. at 1398-99. The question, however, as framed by the Court, was \u201cwhether in the service of these important ends the discretionary spot check is a sufficiently productive mechanism to justify the intrusion upon Fourth Amendment interests which such stops entail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 659, 99 S.Ct. at 1399. Deciding it was not, the Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">It seems common sense that the percentage of all drivers on the road who are driving without a license is very small and that the number of licensed drivers who will be stopped in order to find one unlicensed operator will be very large <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>indeed. The contribution to highway safety made by discretionary stops selected from drivers generally will therefore be marginal at best.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 659-60, 99 S.Ct. at 1399. The Court thus concluded that, \u201c[i]n terms of actually discovering unlicensed drivers or deterring them from driving, the [random, discretionary] spot check does not appear sufficiently productive to qualify as a reasonable law enforcement practice under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 660, 99 S.Ct. at 1399.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">In contrast, the stop in the instant case was particularized by the officer\u2019s observation of the peeling sticker on the windshield, and in light of his recent experience he was likely to discover an inspection sticker violation upon making the stop. Thus, the stop was not \u201crandom,\u201d \u201csuspicionless\u201d or an exercise in \u201cunbridled discretion\u201d in violation of appellant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">For these reasons, I would affirm the decision of the trial court denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress. Therefore, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b354-10\">. It is important to note that \u201can investigatory stop under <em>Terry </em>'anticipates that some innocent people may be stopped.\u2019 Nevertheless, it is a lawful stop designed to permit an officer with reasonable suspicion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>criminal activity to quickly confirm or dispel that suspicion.\u201d <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>35 Va.App. 533, 539, 546 S.E.2d 252, 255 (2001) (citing <em>Illinois v. Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. 119, 126, 120 S.Ct. 673, 677, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000)); <em>see Shiflett v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 141, 146, 622 S.E.2d 758, 760 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b355-7\">. Given the likelihood that the stop would reveal unlawful activity, it certainly meets a reasonable articulable suspicion standard when it may very well meet a heightened probable cause standard. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Limares, </em>269 F.3d 794, 798 (7th Cir.2001) (holding that probable cause was clearly established when the record showed that the drug sniffing dog had been right sixty-two percent of the time); <em>see generally, </em>Ronald J. Bacigal, <em>Making the Right Gamble: the Odds on Probable Cause, </em>74 Miss. L.J. 279, 313 (2004\u201405) (In analyzing the level of certainly required for probable cause under the Fourth Amendment, Professor Bacigal concludes that \"statistical evidence is readily available in many cases and should be utilized whenever it exists.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b355-8\">. On direct examination, the officer testified that he was concerned when he saw the peeling inspection sticker on Moore\u2019s vehicle, thinking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>\"it was possibly an improper inspection sticker, that did not belong on that car.\u201d That was because, \"[biased on [his] experience, [he had] stopped numerous vehicles for this offense and found a great majority of the time that the inspection sticker, <em>that will be peeling off the window, </em>does not belong on that vehicle.\u201d (Emphasis added.) He proceeded to explain that in the previous six months, he had stopped approximately 50 vehicles for that type of violation and 30 to 35 \"resulted in finding a sticker that was not supposed to be with the car [he] stopped.\u201d The officer further explained that \"[a] new sticker typically does not peel off of a windshield on its own.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">In the limited exchange on cross-examination addressing this issue, quoted by the majority, defense counsel misstates the officer's testimony on direct, when counsel asks, \"So basically in your testimony, you said in the last six months you stopped approximately fifty cars and you said that thirty to thirty-five per cent of the cars had-the inspection stickers may have been from another vehicle? Is that what you\u2019re saying?\u201d The officer responded, \"No, sir. Thirty to thirty-five of the vehicles, out of the fifty, had bad inspection stickers\u201d and thus the stickers were \"invalid.\u201d Counsel then confirmed with the officer that, \"in other words,\u201d he was stating that \"sixty to seventy per cent of the cars\u201d had inspection stickers from other vehicles and that <em>\"the glue had [just] come loose\u2019 on the other ... thirty to forty per cent [that turned out to have] valid stickers.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
