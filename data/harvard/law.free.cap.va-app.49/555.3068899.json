McCLANAHAN, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b603-13\">Victoria Ipsen (wife) appeals the circuit court\u2019s decision that Nathan Roger Moxley (husband) owes her no duty of child or spousal support. Wife contends the trial court erred in finding: (1) that a juvenile and domestic relations district court order awarding child and spousal support was nullified by a subsequent <em>pendente lite </em>support order entered in husband\u2019s suit for divorce, which he later voluntarily nonsuited; and (2) that laches barred husband\u2019s claim that he owes no support. For the following reasons, we reverse the judgment of the circuit court, and remand for a determination of the child and spousal support that is owed to wife. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">On appeal, we view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to husband. <em>See Martin v. Bales, </em>7 Va.App. 141, 142, 371 S.E.2d 823, 824 (1988). The parties married in 1980, had three children (born in 1982, 1984 and 1993), and separated in 1997. On April 13, 1998, the district court awarded wife child and spousal support. The parties did not appeal this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">In October 1998, husband filed an action for divorce in the circuit court for the County of Chesterfield. On July 23,1999, the circuit court granted wife\u2019s request for <em>pendente lite </em>child and spousal support effective as of February 1, 1999.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Husband subsequently moved for a voluntary nonsuit of the action, which the circuit court granted by order dated January 8, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Later in 2000, wife filed her own suit for divorce. The parties were divorced by final decree dated February 21, 2002. The decree noted, \u201c[t]his Court takes no jurisdiction of the matters of child custody, child support, or spousal support as those matters are being resolved in the Chesterfield Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court.\u201d The parties endorsed the decree without exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">Following the nonsuit of husband\u2019s divorce action in 2000, the parties continued to appear before the district court to amend or enforce the district court\u2019s April 13, 1998 support order. Husband sought to reduce or abate his obligations while wife sought to enforce the order. Husband filed three separate motions to amend his support obligations under the order: March 30, 2001 (abate child support), June 9, 2001 (abate child support and recalculate remaining child support and spousal support), and October 21, 2002 (abate child support). The district court held various hearings on the motions and continued the case numerous times. At a show cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>hearing on August 20, 2001, the district court found that husband ceased making support payments as of November 1, 2000, and was four months in arrears on those payments. On October 29, 2001, the district court again ruled that husband was in arrears on his support obligations. On December 23, 2003, the district court ultimately denied husband\u2019s pending motions to amend his support obligations and ordered the matter stricken from the docket, except with respect to the show cause against husband for failure to pay support. Husband appealed this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">On appeal to the circuit court, husband argued that the circuit court\u2019s 1999 <em>pendente lite </em>support order nullified the district court\u2019s 1998 support order and divested that court of jurisdiction pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-79.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court agreed, ruling that husband owed wife no child or spousal support. The court reasoned that, by entering the <em>pendente lite </em>support order, the circuit court \u201cassumed full jurisdiction over the issues of child and spousal support and [its order] irrevocably superseded all previous district court orders.\u201d The court further stated that husband\u2019s subsequent nonsuit of the divorce action \u201cterminat[ed] the efficacy of any [o]rder in place during the pendency of the matter\u201d and no statute \u201cpermits a court to rehabilitate a superseded order.\u201d The court thus held that there was no support order in effect after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>the nonsuit and that, accordingly, husband had paid to wife all of the support the law required. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Wife does not dispute that the circuit court\u2019s <em>pendente lite </em>support order divested the district court of jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 20-79. Wife argues, however, that husband\u2019s nonsuit of the circuit court divorce proceeding, in which that temporary order was entered, effectively restored the authority of the district court\u2019s 1998 support order. Wife contends the circuit court therefore erred in holding husband owed her no duty of child or spousal support. We agree.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">This case presents a question of law involving the interpretation and application of Code \u00a7 20-79. We thus \u201creview the trial court\u2019s judgment <em>de novo.\u201d Colbert v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 390, 394, 624 S.E.2d 108, 110 (2006); <em>see Rollins v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 73, 79, 554 S.E.2d 99, 102 (2001) (\u201c[W]e review the trial court\u2019s statutory interpretations and legal conclusions <em>de novo.\u201d </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">Pursuant to the express terms of Code \u00a7 20-79, the district court\u2019s jurisdiction did \u201ccease\u201d and its 1998 support order became \u201cinoperative\u201d upon entry of the circuit court\u2019s <em>pendente lite </em>support order. The dispositive issue in this case, however, is whether the district court\u2019s jurisdiction over support, and the operation of its support order, ended <em>permanently </em>with the entry of the circuit court\u2019s <em>pendente lite </em>order, or rather ended only <em>temporarily, </em>having been revived by the subsequent nonsuit of the divorce proceeding. Given the temporary nature of a <em>pendente lite </em>support order, the effect of a voluntary nonsuit in returning the parties to status quo, and the discernible legislative intent, we conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>district court\u2019s jurisdiction and the operation of its support order automatically resumed, by operation of law, upon the termination of the divorce proceeding by the nonsuit order.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Code \u00a7 20-79 does not define the term \u201ccease,\u201d or the term \u201cinoperative.\u201d Nor does the statute otherwise set forth in specific terms the duration that the district court\u2019s jurisdiction over support shall \u201ccease,\u201d or the duration that its existing support orders are to remain \u201cinoperative,\u201d upon entry of a circuit court decree providing for support in a divorce proceeding. We thus turn to settled principles of statutory construction for guidance. \u2018We give the words of a statute \u2018their common, ordinary and accepted meaning,\u2019 absent an indication by the legislature to the contrary....\u201d <em>Germek v.Germek, </em>34 Va.App. 1, 8, 537 S.E.2d 596, 600 (2000) (quoting <em>Gen. Trading Corp. v. Motor Vehicle Dealer Bd., </em>28 Va.App. 264, 268, 503 S.E.2d 809, 811 (1998)). We are also required to \u201cview the entire body of legislation and the statutory scheme to determine the true intention of each part. In interpreting a statute, the Code of Virginia constitutes a single body of law, and other sections can be looked to where the same phraseology is employed.\u201d <em>M.G. v. Albemarle County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>41 Va.App. 170, 181-82, 583 S.E.2d 761, 766-67 (2003) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Under a similar principle, \u201c \u2018[statutes which are not inconsistent with one another, and which relate to the same subject matter, are <em>in pari materia, </em>and should be construed together; and effect should be given to them all, although they contain no reference to one another, and were passed at different times.\u2019 \u201d <em>Prillaman v. Commonwealth, </em>199 Va. 401, 406, 100 S.E.2d 4, 7 (1957) (quoting <em>Mitchell v. Witt, </em>98 Va. 459, 461, 36 S.E. 528, 528 (1900)).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Ultimately, \u201c \u2018[t]he proper course [in] all [statutory construction] cases is to search out and follow the true intent of the legislature, and to adopt that sense of the words which harmonizes best with the context, and promotes in the fullest manner the apparent policy and objectives of the legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Colbert, </em>47 Va.App. at 394-95, 624 S.E.2d at 110 (quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number><em>Jones v. Rhea, </em>130 Va. 345, 372, 107 S.E. 814, 823 (1921)). In doing so, \u201cwe must, as far as possible, place ourselves in the light that [the legislature] enjoyed, looking at things as they appeared to it, and discover its purpose from the language used in connection with attending circumstances.\u201d <em>Franklin and Pittsylvania Ry. Co. v. Shoemaker, </em>156 Va. 619, 623, 159 S.E. 100, 102 (1931) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Under generally accepted definitions of the two subject terms, both may be used in reference to either a temporary or permanent duration. The word \u201ccease\u201d means \u201c[t]o stop,\u201d \u201csuspend,\u201d or \u201cbring to an end.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>237 (8th ed. 2004); <em>see also American Heritage College Dictionary </em>224 (3d ed. 1997) (defining \u201ccease\u201d to include \u201cpause\u201d); <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>367 (1993) (defining \u201ccessation\u201d as \u201ca temporary or final ceasing or discontinuance\u201d). The word \u201cinoperative\u201d is defined as \u201c[h]aving no force or effect,\u201d or \u201cnot operative.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, supra, </em>at 806.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">In other parts of the Code, the word \u201ccease\u201d is used in a wide variety of contexts, many of which are descriptive of temporary conditions or requirements, as well as, to a lesser extent, those that are permanent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The word \u201cinoperative,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>on the other hand, is not widely used in the Code. Where it is used, however, the context is generally one in which an \u201cinoperative\u201d object may again become operative.

Accordingly, district court support orders may be modified by circuit court <em>pendente lite </em>support decrees in divorce proceedings, as presented in the instant case. Upon such modification, the district court\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction ... shall cease and its orders become inoperative\u201d regarding the issue of support. Code \u00a7 20-79(a). However, modification of a district court support order by a circuit court\u2019s subsequent <em>pendente lite </em>support decree is fundamentally different than modification effected by a circuit court\u2019s final decree on the merits. Unlike provisions providing for child or spousal support in a final divorce decree, support under a <em>pendente lite </em>decree, pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-103, is only temporary. As this Court explained in <em>Smith v. Smith, </em>4 Va.App. 148, 151, 354 S.E.2d 816, 818 (1987), \u201cCode \u00a7 20-103 provides authority for the court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>provide for spousal support \u2018during the pendency of the suit.\u2019 We interpret this grant of authority to be limited to the right to make such award only for the period the action is pending____\u201d In addition, subsection E of Code \u00a7 20-103 provides that \u201c[a]n order entered pursuant to this section shall have no presumptive effect and shall not be determinative when adjudicating the underlying cause.\u201d <em>See Pinkard v. Pinkard, </em>12 Va.App. 848, 851, 407 S.E.2d 339, 341 (1991) (\u201c[A]n award of <em>pendente lite </em>support in a suit between parties is an interlocutory order that does not adjudicate the principles of a cause and is therefore not appealable.\u201d (citing <em>Beatty v. Beatty, </em>105 Va. 213, 53 S.E. 2 (1906))).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Here, the circuit court did not adjudicate the underlying support issues in husband\u2019s divorce action because he took a voluntary nonsuit, ending the pendency of that suit. At that time the <em>pendente lite </em>support decree also terminated as it was only temporary\u2014a decree made for the period the action was pending without adjudicating the underlying cause. <em>See Smith, </em>4 Va.App. at 151, 354 S.E.2d at 818 (explaining that \u201cthe order of dismissal by operation of law terminated [appellant\u2019s] right to further <em>pendente lite </em>support\u201d). Moreover, the effect of husband exercising his right, pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-380, to voluntarily nonsuit the divorce action was to \u201cleave[ ] the situation as if the suit had never been filed.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> R.P. Davis, Annotation, <em>Effect of Nonsuit, Dismissal, or Discontinuance of Action on Previous Orders, </em>11 A.L.R.2d 1407 at *3 (2004). <em>See Ford Motor Co. v. Jones, </em>266 Va. 404, 406, 587 S.E.2d 579, 580 (2003) (explaining that \u201cCode \u00a7 8.01-380 permits a plaintiff to take one nonsuit as a matter of right\u201d if the provisions of the statute are met).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As stated in <em>James v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number><em>James, </em>263 Va. 474, 562 S.E.2d 133 (2002), \u201cwhen a court enters a nonsuit order, the case becomes \u2018concluded as to all claims and parties,\u2019 and \u2018nothing remains to be done.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 481, 562 S.E.2d at 137 (quoting <em>Dalloul v. Agbey, </em>255 Va. 511, 515, 499 S.E.2d 279, 282 (1998)).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">This Court has already recognized that this statutory scheme contemplates the resumption of the district court\u2019s jurisdiction over matters of support after being \u201clost\u201d to the circuit court. <em>Calfee v. Calfee, </em>29 Va.App. 88, 94, 509 S.E.2d 552, 555 (1999). In <em>Calfee, </em>we explained that \u201cjurisdiction <em>lost </em>by the J &amp; D court to the circuit court \u2018in any suit for divorce\u2019 may be <em>resumed </em>by \u2018transfer to the J &amp; D court\u2019 by the circuit court for \u2018enforcement of its orders\u2019 or \u2018after the entry of a decree of divorce\u2019 for any other matters pertaining to support\u2019 pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-79(c).\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). We conclude the same is true where, as here, the district court exercised its jurisdiction over the support issues and \u201clost\u201d it only upon the entry of a temporary support order in a proceeding that ended in a nonsuit, which placed the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>back to where they were before the suit was filed. For the same reasons, we conclude that the district court\u2019s support order also automatically resumed upon entry of the nonsuit order. In other words, the operative terms of Code \u00a7 20-79, as applied in this case, effected only a temporary suspension of the district court\u2019s jurisdiction over support and the operation of its support order. The suspension ended automatically by entry of the nonsuit order, though it would have become permanent had the circuit court support order been made permanent, rather than only temporary (by virtue of the <em>pendente lite </em>order).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Our construction of Code \u00a7 20-79 in this case is consistent with what we discern to be the legislative intent embodied in the applicable statutory scheme. First, it is consistent with the subject terms \u201ccease\u201d and \u201cinoperative\u201d as defined generally, and as actually used in other parts of the Code. More specifically, these terms may be used to impose either a temporary or permanent effect, depending upon the particular context in which they are being applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Second, under the applicable statutes, the General Assembly has seen fit to grant concurrent jurisdiction to the district and circuit courts over matters of both child and spousal support. The jurisdiction becomes exclusive to the circuit court when such matters are before that court, which is for obvious reasons\u2014to avoid conflicting decisions and to establish finality. And, once the circuit court renders a final decision, the district court cannot subsequently alter or modify that decision without the consent of the circuit court. Otherwise, the potential for conflict would continue. The same policy considerations do not apply in the instant case, however, where the circuit court has done no more than enter a temporary support order that is terminated without any final determination by the circuit court regarding support. Except for the period of time during which the <em>pendente lite </em>support order was in effect, this case is no different than one in which the district court enters a support order, and then, in the subsequent divorce proceeding, no issue of support is addressed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>circuit court in its final decree. In such a case, the district court\u2019s jurisdiction over support and its support order remain in effect at the conclusion of the case in circuit court. <em>See Martin, </em>7 Va.App. at 145-46, 371 S.E.2d at 826 (circuit court divorce decree silent on support does not affect validity of district court support order).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Third, the General Assembly has imposed a clearly expressed limitation on the effect of a <em>pendente lite </em>order under Code \u00a7 20-103, in providing that \u201c[a]n order entered pursuant to this section shall have no presumptive effect and shall not be determinative when adjudicating the underlying cause.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-103(E). To hold the entry of the <em>pendente lite </em>support order in the instant case had the effect of \u201cirrevocably supersed[ing]\u201d the district court\u2019s 1998 support order, as the trial court reasoned, would be contrary to the limited purpose of this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Fourth, the General Assembly was presumptively aware that the effect of granting a voluntary nonsuit, pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-380, is to return the parties to status quo, and chose the subject terms used in Code \u00a7 20-79 with that principle in mind. We find that its choice of those terms is most consistent with our holding that a district court\u2019s jurisdiction which \u201ccease[s]\u201d and its support orders which \u201cbecome inoperative,\u201d because of a <em>pendente lite </em>support order entered in a subsequent divorce proceeding, are rendered operative again by a voluntary nonsuit of that proceeding. Code \u00a7 20-79(a). Had the General Assembly intended otherwise, it undoubtedly would have provided in express terms that the jurisdiction and support orders of the district court are to be permanently terminated upon the entry of any support order in a subsequent divorce proceeding, whether that support be for the pendency of that proceeding only, or made permanent in a final decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Finally, through various civil and criminal statutes,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the General Assembly has established a policy making child and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>spousal support payments a paramount obligation. To allow a parent or spouse, on the facts here presented, to use a voluntary nonsuit as a way to terminate his or her support obligations and require the other party to go back to district court and start over would greatly undermine that policy.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Such a scenario would promote neither consistency in the provision of support nor efficiency in the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">For these reasons, we reverse the judgment of the circuit court, and remand for a determination of the child and spousal support owed to appellant under the 1998 district court support order, both before the circuit court\u2019s July 28, 1999 <em>pendente lite </em>support order, effective February 1, 1999, and after January 8, 2000, the date of the nonsuit order. Because the parties were temporarily subject to the circuit court\u2019s jurisdiction over the support matters during the pendency of the circuit court\u2019s <em>pendente lite </em>support order, husband\u2019s support obligations for that period are limited to the amounts set forth in that order. Thus, husband\u2019s support obligations owed to wife under the district court\u2019s 1998 support order do not include the period governed by the circuit court\u2019s <em>pendente lite </em>support order.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b604-9\">. The district court awarded wife child support of $1,830 per month and spousal support of $1,070 per month.
