McGinniss\u2019 (\u201chusband\u201d) federal Civil Service Retirement System (\u201cCSRS\u201d) pension benefits. Specifically, she argues that the trial court erred in entering its Court Order Acceptable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>for Processing (\u201cCOAP\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> limiting her marital share of husband\u2019s CSRS pension to a fixed amount calculated as if husband retired on the date of separation, July 10, 2001, rather than when he actually retired and became eligible to receive his pension; in failing to award her the survivor annuity benefit under husband\u2019s CSRS pension; and in failing to \u201cre-refer the issue of the Commissioner in Chancery\u2019s failure to recommend or address ... [appellant\u2019s] survivor annuity benefit request\u201d from husband\u2019s CSRS pension. Both parties request attorney\u2019s fees on appeal. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">On appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to husband, the prevailing party below. <em>Congdon v. Congdon, </em>40 Va.App. 255, 258, 578 S.E.2d 883, 835 (2003). So viewed, the record reflects that husband was employed by the United States government and entered the CSRS pension system in May 1966. Husband and wife were married in 1969, separated in 2001, and divorced in February 2006, after 37 years of marriage. At the time the parties separated, wife was 52 years old. Husband was 56 years old and was a GS-12 on the federal pay-scale, earning $65,588 annually. While husband traveled for extended periods of time in his employment, wife \u201ctook care of [their] children, their school work, everything.\u201d Wife also worked outside the home throughout the marriage, operating a small beauty parlor. The parties owned a Southern Farm Bureau IRA Annuity issued to wife. Wife owned no other separate retirement plan or funds, but was eligible for Social Security Benefits. Husband\u2019s enrollment in CSRS precluded his eligibility for Social Security Benefits. Following the parties\u2019 separation, husband changed the beneficiary of his Federal Employee Group Life Insurance (\u201cFEGLI\u201d) policy from wife to the parties\u2019 son.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>The trial court referred matters related to equitable distribution of the parties\u2019\u2022 assets to a commissioner in chancery (\u201ccommissioner\u201d). At the commissioner\u2019s hearing, both parties presented evidence and subsequently filed memoranda of law outlining their respective positions. Wife\u2019s memorandum asserted that \u201c[i]t seems clear that after 32 years of marriage and with no security for her future, [she] is entitled to 50% of the marital share of [husband\u2019s CSRS] pension, <em>if as[',] and when he collects it.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). She requested the court award her a marital share of husband\u2019s CSRS pension benefits pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-107.3(G)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">In his report to the trial court, the commissioner reported that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">Calculations relating to Mr. McGinniss\u2019 defined benefit plan, the annuity plan purchased for Ms. McGinniss and her social security report are in evidence. Although not necessary for the purpose of this report, the present value calculation of the marital share of his [CSRS pension] is $619,000. The computed value of the annuity purchased for her retirement, and still being funded by the parties at $75.00 per month, is $26,707 at her age 62 and $32,905 at her age 65. She is eligible for social security benefits, as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">Upon consideration of the section 20-107.3(E) factors ... she is awarded 50% of the marital share of his [CSRS pension], and the annuity is allocated and is to be transferred to her; she will be responsible for the remaining monthly payments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">In her exceptions to the commissioner\u2019s report, wife asserted that the commissioner failed to address her request for survivor annuity benefits under husband\u2019s CSRS pension. Following a hearing on the exceptions, the trial court affirmed the commissioner\u2019s report as presented. Wife then filed a \u201cMotion to Reconsider or Re-Refer For Commissioner in Chancery to Clarify Recommendations\u201d related to the survivor annuity benefit under husband\u2019s CSRS pension. After a hearing, the trial court denied wife\u2019s motion. Thereafter, each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>party presented a draft COAP to the trial court. In its final decree, the trial court adopted and entered the COAP provided by husband. That COAP did \u201cnot award the [wife] any entitlement in the [CSRS pension] Survivor Annuity,\u201d and determined wife\u2019s marital share of husband\u2019s CSRS pension to be 50% of the marital share of husband\u2019s gross monthly annuity benefit <em>\u201cas if [husband] retired on July 10, 2001, the separation date of the parties.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Wife noted her exceptions to the COAP entered by the trial court. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">On appeal, \u201c[a] decision regarding equitable distribution rests within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed unless it is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Holden v. Holden, </em>31 Va.App. 24, 26, 520 S.E.2d 842, 844 (1999) (citing <em>McDavid v. McDavid, </em>19 Va.App. 406, 407-08, 451 S.E.2d 713, 715 (1994)). \u201cUnless it appears from the record that the trial judge has not considered or has misapplied one of the statutory mandates, this Court will not reverse on appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27, 520 S.E.2d at 844.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">Wife contends that pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-107.3(G)(l) and <em>Primm v. Primm, </em>12 Va.App. 1036, 407 S.E.2d 45 (1991), the trial court was required to apply the deferred distribution approach to calculate her marital share of husband\u2019s CSRS pension. She asserts that the trial court erred as a matter of law by excluding the increase in value of husband\u2019s CSRS pension in the years following the parties\u2019 July 10, 2001 separation. Husband argues that any post-separation increase in the value of his CSRS pension would be based solely on his personal efforts, and is his separate property not subject to equitable distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">\u201cPensions constitute an \u2018unusual type of property in that, in most cases, the pension benefits are \u201cfuture oriented\u201d \u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>and not \u2018readily susceptible to valuation or distribution at the time of an evidentiary hearing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Banagan v. Banagan, </em>17 Va.App. 321, 324, 437 S.E.2d 229, 231 (1993) (quoting <em>Gamble v. Gamble, </em>14 Va.App. 558, 565-66, 421 S.E.2d 635, 640 (1992)). Code \u00a7 20-107.3(G)(l) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\">The court may direct payment of a percentage of the marital share of any pension, profit-sharing or deferred compensation plan or retirement benefits ... whether payable in a lump sum or over a period of time.... However, the court shall only direct that payment be made as such benefits are payable.... <em>\u201cMarital share\u201d means that portion of the total interest, </em>the right to which was earned during the marriage and before the last separation of the parties....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">(Emphasis added). We have interpreted Code \u00a7 20-107.3\u2019s language to be</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">mandatory and ... implemented through the use of a simple formula. The number of years that the spouse was in the pension plan while in the marriage serves as the numerator and the total number of years in the pension plan serves as the denominator. This fraction establishes the marital share of the pension as defined by the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACZ\"><em>Mosley v. Mosley, </em>19 Va.App. 192, 198, 450 S.E.2d 161, 165 (1994) (citing <em>Primm, </em>12 Va.App. at 1037, 407 S.E.2d at 46). However, \u201cthe trial court may not direct that pension benefits be paid prior to the time they are actually received by the party against whom the judgment is rendered.\u201d <em>Gamble, </em>14 Va.App. at 585, 421 S.E.2d at 651 (citing <em>Primm, </em>12 Va.App. at 1037, 407 S.E.2d at 46).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">\u2018We have recognized two methods for valuing and dividing a defined benefit plan....\u201d <em>Torian v. Torian, </em>38 Va.App. 167, 176, 562 S.E.2d 355, 360 (2002). Under the \u201c \u2018immediate offset approach,\u2019 \u201d the trial court determines the present value of the marital share of the benefits and considers this value in making the monetary award. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gamer v. Gamer, </em>16 Va.App. 335, 342-43, 429 S.E.2d 618, 624 (1993)). Under the \u201cdeferred distribution approach,\u201d the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>court awards \u201ca percentage of the marital share of the pension, in which case <em>payment is to be made only as retirement benefits are paid.\u201d Gamer, </em>16 Va.App. at 342-43, 429 S.E.2d at 624 (emphasis added). \u201cIf a trial court orders deferred distribution of the marital share of the pension, it need not determine the pension\u2019s present value.\u201d <em>Torian, </em>38 Va.App. at 177, 562 S.E.2d at 360. Furthermore, we have previously \u201crejected limitation of a pension award, payable in the future, to a \u2018present value calculation\u2019 because it denied the benefit of \u2018future earnings and adjustments that are attributable to the ... deferred share\u2019 and its \u2018future appreciation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Banagan, </em>17 Va.App. at 325, 437 S.E.2d at 231 (quoting <em>Zipf v. Zipf, </em>8 Va.App. 387, 397, 382 S.E.2d 263, 268-69 (1989)). \u201cIt is only fair that both parties share in the increased value of the pension. There can be no justification for [husband] receiving the increase in value of his ... share as well as any increase in [wife\u2019s] ... share.\u201d <em>Primm, </em>12 Va.App. at 1038, 407 S.E.2d at 47.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-5\">Under Virginia law, it is well established that the marital portion of a defined benefit plan is distinguished from the separate portion by the application of a fraction, the numerator of which represents the total time the pensioner is employed dining the parties\u2019 marriage, and the denominator of which represents the total time the pensioner is employed through the date of retirement. The fraction diminishes the marital share in relation to the number of years that pre- and post-marital contributions are made. Thus, as applied, the fraction effectively excludes from the marital share the income earned by pre-and post-marital contributions to the pension.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-6\"><em>Mann v. Mann, </em>22 Va.App. 459, 464-65, 470 S.E.2d 605, 607-08 (1996) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">While the trial court \u201cmust be given flexibility to determine which method of distribution to utilize in a given case,\u201d <em>Gamble, </em>14 Va.App. at 585, 421 S.E.2d at 651 (citing L. Golden, <em>Equitable Distribution of Property </em>\u00a7 6.16 (1983 &amp; Supp. 1991)), <em>\u201c[a] present value calculation is of direct use only where payment of the portion of the monetary award </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number><em>attributable to the pension is to occur immediately rather than over a period of time.\u201d Zipf, </em>8 Va.App. at 397, 382 S.E.2d at 268 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">In adopting husband\u2019s COAP, the trial court limited wife\u2019s marital share award to 50% of the present value as if husband retired on the date of separation, plus periodic cost of living increases. Wife\u2019s expert established the present value of husband\u2019s CSRS pension as of July 2002 to be $672,472.08, and the \u201cmarital share\u201d to be $619,010.55.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The commissioner noted in his recommendations that a present value calculation was \u201cnot necessary for the purpose of [his] report.\u201d He recommended to the trial court that wife be awarded \u201c50% of the marital share of [husband\u2019s] retirement plan.\u201d The COAP entered by the trial court applied a fractional formula that determined the numerator to be the \u201ctotal number of months of creditable service earned under the CSRS during the marriage (from March 5, 1969 to July 10, 2001),\u201d and the denominator to be the \u201ctotal number of months of [husband\u2019s] creditable service accrued under the [CSRS] as of July 10, 2001.\u201d The order specifically provided that \u201cany salary adjustments that occur after July 10, 2001, shall not be incorporated into the calculation of [wife\u2019s] share of the employee annuity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">We conclude that the trial court erred in entering the COAP because that order limited wife\u2019s marital share of husband\u2019s pension to a present value calculation. <em>See Gamer, </em>16 Va.App. at 342-43, 429 S.E.2d at 624; <em>Primm, </em>12 Va.App. at 1038, 407 S.E.2d at 46-47. We have previously determined a present value calculation is of \u201cdirect use only where payment of the portion of the monetary award attributable to the pension is to occur immediately rather than over a period of time.\u201d <em>Zipf, 8 </em>Va.App. at 397, 382 S.E.2d at 268 (citations omitted). It is uncontested that any pre-marital or post-separation contributions to the pension by husband would be his separate proper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>ty. However, the delay in payment to wife of her marital share of husband\u2019s pension until he retired and became eligible to receive his pension \u201cdiminishes the marital share in relation to the number of years that pre-and post-marital contributions are made\u201d and effectively \u201cexcludes from the marital share the income earned by pre-and post-marital contributions to the pension.\u201d <em>Mann, </em>22 Va.App. at 465, 470 S.E.2d at 607-08.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Here, the trial court erred by valuing wife\u2019s marital share of husband\u2019s pension as if husband retired on the date of the parties\u2019 separation, even though husband was not eligible to receive pension payment on that date, and he made no lump sum payment to wife of the present value of the marital share. Accordingly, we find that the trial court abused its discretion by limiting wife\u2019s share of husband\u2019s pension to 50% of the present value calculation as if husband had retired on the date of separation. <em>See Banagan, </em>17 Va.App. at 325, 437 S.E.2d at 231 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Wife also contends the trial court erred in failing to award her the survivor annuity benefit under husband\u2019s CSRS pension and in failing to \u201cre-refer\u201d the commissioner\u2019s failure to address wife\u2019s request for that survivor annuity benefit. On this record, we find no error on the part of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">In its award to wife, the trial court stated that \u201cthe annuity is allocated and is to be transferred to her; she will be responsible for the remaining monthly payments.\u201d Wife contends that this language in the commissioner\u2019s report, adopted by the trial court, impliedly referred to the CSRS pension survivor annuity that \u201cwould be awarded to [wife] but at her cost.\u201d Husband contends that the trial court\u2019s language referred to the Southern Farm Bureau IRA Annuity, and not to the survivor annuity benefit under the CSRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">Code \u00a7 20-107.3(G)(2) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-10\">To the extent permitted by federal or other applicable law, the court <em>may </em>order a party to designate a spouse or former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>spouse as irrevocable beneficiary during the lifetime of the beneficiary of all or a portion of any survivor benefit or annuity plan of whatsoever nature, but not to include a life insurance policy. The court, in its discretion, shall determine as between the parties, who shall bear the costs of maintaining such plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">(Emphasis added). Wife argues that husband represented to the commissioner that \u201c[tjhere is no need for a life insurance policy on Husband as Wife will have survivor annuity on his CSRS\u201d and that \u201caccordingly, he should not be permitted to take a contrary position on the issue from that clearly set forth in his memo to the commissioner.\u201d However, no evidence was presented to the commissioner related to the CSRS survivor annuity benefit. No evidence was presented as to its costs, how those costs were to be paid, or any details as to when that annuity would be paid to wife. On the other hand, the record contains clear reference to the Southern Farm Bureau IRA Annuity owned jointly by the parties, requiring a $75 monthly premium payment, and valued at $26,707 at wife\u2019s age 62 and $32,905 at wife\u2019s age 65. In his report, the commissioner stated that \u201cthe annuity is allocated and is to be transferred to her; she will be responsible for the <em>remaining </em>monthly payments.\u201d (Emphasis added). The commissioner\u2019s language was a clear reference to the Southern Farm Bureau IRA Annuity, awarded to wife, who would be required to assume the remaining monthly payments to maintain that annuity. On this record, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s failure to award wife the CSRS survivor annuity benefit, and in not re-referring that issue to the commissioner for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Both husband and wife seek attorney\u2019s fees and costs on appeal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-8\">The rationale for the appellate court being the proper forum to determine the propriety of an award of attorney\u2019s fees for efforts expended on appeal is clear. The appellate court has the opportunity to view the record in its entirety and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>determine whether the appeal is frivolous or whether other reasons exist for requiring additional payment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-5\"><em>O\u2019Loughlin v. O\u2019Loughlin, </em>23 Va.App. 690, 695, 479 S.E.2d 98, 100 (1996). In this context, and on consideration of the record before us, we hold neither party is entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred in this appeal. \u201c[W]e find the litigation addressed appropriate and substantial issues. ...\u201d <em>Estate of Hackler v. Hackler, </em>44 Va.App. 51, 75, 602 S.E.2d 426, 438 (2004). Therefore, each party\u2019s request for an award of fees and costs on appeal is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">On this record, we find that the trial court abused its discretion in limiting wife\u2019s marital share of husband\u2019s CSRS pension benefits to a fixed amount as if husband had retired on the date of separation. We affirm the trial court\u2019s decision awarding the Southern Farm Bureau IRA Annuity to wife and not awarding wife the survivor annuity benefit under husband\u2019s CSRS pension plan. We deny both parties\u2019 request for an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">We remand to the trial court for redetermination of wife\u2019s marital share of husband\u2019s pension benefits consistent with Code \u00a7 20-107.3(G), and any redetermination of its equitable distribution award as may then be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b229-7\">.
