Allegedly entered without his knowledge, that order authorized the adoption of his child by the biological mother\u2019s husband. In the trial court, McCallum claimed the mother committed extrinsic fraud during the adoption proceeding by misleading the court into believing McCallum could not be located and thus could be given constructive notice by publication service. Without ruling on the factual merits of McCallum\u2019s claim, the trial court dismissed the amended petition on the ground that Code \u00a7 63.2-1216 barred the claim as untimely. We reverse and remand the case for farther factfinding by the trial court consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">In July 1999, the trial court entered a final adoption order permitting the husband (Gilberto Salazar, Jr.) of the child\u2019s mother (Kathleen Salazar) to adopt her then four-year-old child. The order recited that McCallum, the noncustodial, biological father of the child, received only constructive notice of the adoption proceeding by order of publication. The court proceeded by publication notice in reliance on a report by the Department of Social Services that recited the mother\u2019s representation that she did not know MeCallum\u2019s whereabouts.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">Five years later, McCallum filed a petition to vacate the final adoption order as void. In his petition, McCallum alleged that the child\u2019s mother perpetrated a fraud on the court by deliberately misrepresenting that she did not know his whereabouts. McCallum also claimed he knew nothing about the adoption until October 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">The Salazars filed a demurrer and a separate special plea seeking a dismissal of the petition under Code \u00a7 63.2-1216, which requires all such petitions to be filed within six months of the final adoption order. The trial court granted the demurrer but did not specifically address the special plea. In response, McCallum filed an amended petition that included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>additional allegations concerning his efforts at maintaining a relationship with the child prior to the adoption. Raising again the time bar of Code \u00a7 63.2-1216, the Salazars filed a demurrer and a separate special plea to the amended petition. The trial court entered an order overruling the second demurrer and granting leave to the Salazars to file responsive pleadings within twenty-one days. Once again, however, the order did not address the pending special plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">At trial, McCallum asked the court to find the Salazars in default for not filing an answer to the amended petition. After the Salazars pointed out that their special plea was still pending, the court denied the default request. McCallum then presented evidence in support of his claim that Kathleen Salazar committed extrinsic fraud that prevented him from receiving actual notice of the adoption proceeding. McCallum also offered evidence seeking to establish his <em>bona fide </em>interest in the child as well as his prior efforts at accepting parental responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">At the close of McCallum\u2019s case in chief, the trial court reviewed \u201cthe evidence in the light most favorable to the father\u201d and found that McCallum first discovered the alleged fraud in October 2002. The trial court then found that \u201ceven if\u2014and the court doesn\u2019t find\u2014even if the mother had committed actual fraud, extrinsic or intrinsic,\u201d McCallum filed his initial petition to vacate more than six months after first learning of the alleged fraud.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Relying on Code \u00a7 63.2-1216\u2019s statutory bar, the trial court granted the Salazars\u2019 motion to strike and dismissed the amended petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">On appeal, McCallum raises two issues.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He first argues that the trial court erred in not holding the Salazars in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>default and thereafter treating as conceded all factual allegations in the amended petition to vacate. Second, McCallum contends the trial court\u2019s application of Code \u00a7 63.2-1216\u2019s time bar at the motion to strike stage cannot be reconciled with <em>F.E. v. G.F.M., </em>35 Va.App. 648, 547 S.E.2d 531 (2001) <em>(en </em>banc). We disagree with McCallum on his first argument but agree with him on his second.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">A. <em>Responsive Pleadings &amp; Defaults</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ab\">[2-4] McCallum claims that the Salazars were in default by not filing a responsive pleading after the trial court overruled their demurrer. This argument overlooks the fact that their special plea to the amended petition was still pending at the time of trial. Under Virginia law, a special \u201cplea, whether at law or in equity, is a discrete form of defensive pleading.\u201d <em>Nelms v. Nelms, </em>236 Va. 281, 289, 374 S.E.2d 4, 9 (1988). A special plea asserts \u201ca single state of facts or circumstances\u201d that, if proven, \u201cconstitutes an absolute defense to the claim.\u201d Id.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court, therefore, correctly denied McCallum\u2019s request for an entry of default and properly refused to treat the factual allegations in the amended petition as admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">B. <em>The Six-Month Bar of Code \u00a7 63.2-1216</em></p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\"><em>F.E. </em>held that \u201cnothing in Code \u00a7 63.1-237 [now Code \u00a7 63.2-1216] implies that the statute of limitation is to begin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>running on the date on which the fraud was or should have been discovered.\u201d <em>F.E., </em>35 Va.App. at 669, 547 S.E.2d at 541. \u201cRather, the statute expressly refers to the \u2018expiration of six months from the date of entry of any final order of adoption from which no appeal has been taken.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Code \u00a7 63.1-237). \u201cThe General Assembly was free to create a discovery rule when it drafted the statute, but it did not do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Applying the statute this way, <em>F.E. </em>reasoned, \u201cwould actually serve to rewrite the statute to impose an additional requirement to bar claims in a way which could not reasonably have been foreseen by those to whom it purportedly applies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 669, n. 7, 547 S.E.2d at 542, n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The trial court erred in holding that Code \u00a7 63.2-1216 barred claims filed more than six months from the discovery of the alleged fi-aud. This erroneous holding, therefore, did not moot the necessity of the trial court deciding (i) whether McCallum asserted a viable extrinsic fraud claim justifying a collateral attack on the adoption order, or (ii) whether the intended application of Code \u00a7 63.2-1216, as applied to McCailum\u2019s fraud claim, violated his procedural due process rights. The first issue requires the trial court to determine if McCallum proved extrinsic fraud by clear and convincing evidence, <em>see Gulfstream Bldg. Assocs. v. Britt, </em>239 Va. 178, 183, 387 S.E.2d 488, 491 (1990), and satisfied all other requirements for the equitable remedy he seeks, <em>see generally Ryland v. Manor Care, Inc., </em>266 Va. 503, 508-09, 587 S.E.2d 515, 518-19 (2003).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The second issue, McCallum\u2019s as-applied due process challenge to Code \u00a7 63.2-1216, depends on a threshold showing that he had an \u201cactual relationship of parental responsibility\u201d with the child, not just a \u201cmere biological relationship.\u201d <em>F.E., </em>35 Va.App. at 663, 547 S.E.2d at 538 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>(quoting <em>Lehr v. Robertson, </em>463 U.S. 248, 259-60, 103 S.Ct. 2985, 2992, 77 L.Ed.2d 614 (1983)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because the record reveals no factual findings on these issues, we remand the case for the trial court to address them.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">The trial court correctly refused to find the Salazars in default and to treat the allegations in McCallum\u2019s amended petition as conclusively admitted. The trial court, however, erred in dismissing McCallum\u2019s amended petition on the ground that Code \u00a7 63.2-1216 barred claims filed more than six months after discovery of the alleged fraud. For these reasons, we reverse and remand the case for further factfinding consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b101-9\">. Clarifying this ruling, McCallum's counsel confirmed that the trial court had \"made no finding as to whether there was extrinsic fraud or not\u201d based on the evidence presented.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b101-10\">. In his questions presented, McCallum\u2019s appellate brief also asserts that the trial court erroneously sustained an objection to evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>settlement discussions between the parties a few months before the <em>ore terms </em>hearing in the trial court. McCallum\u2019s argument section of his brief, however, includes only a single sentence mentioning this point. Rule 5A:20(e) requires an appellant\u2019s brief to include, among other things, the \"principles of law, the argument, and the authorities relating to each question presented.\u201d \"Statements unsupported by \u2018argument, authority, or citations to the record' do not merit appellate consideration.\u201d <em>Boyd v.
