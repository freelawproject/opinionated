He argues (1) that the evidence was insufficient to support his larceny conviction, and (2) that the evidence was insufficient to support the burglary conviction, because the evidence did not prove that the offense occurred \u201cin the nighttime.\u201d We disagree with his first contention and agree with his second. Therefore, we affirm the trial court\u2019s decision with regard to the larceny conviction, and reverse the judgment of the trial court with regard to the conviction for common law burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">When the sufficiency of the evidence is challenged on appeal in a criminal case, the appellate court reviews the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the Commonwealth,\u201d as the prevailing party below, giving \u201cit all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Higginbotham, v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 349, 352, 218 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1975). So viewed, the evidence proved that on May 6, 2004, Winfred Isgatt (\u201cIsgatt\u201d) arrived at his cottage in Bratton\u2019s Run. Upon entering, he found the back door open, and realized that one or more people had burglarized his home. The apparent point of entry was through a window that Isgatt left open. Missing from his cottage were money, eight cases of beer, four bottles of wine, food, tools, vacuum cleaners, a thermometer, and other items.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Investigator Steve Funkhouser (\u201cFunkhouser\u201d) took a report from Isgatt. His investigation led him to Kimberly Gum (\u201cGum\u201d), who admitted her involvement in the burglary.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She also implicated Wright, as well as his girlfriend, Robin Sweringen (\u201cSweringen\u201d). Both Wright and Sweringen denied involvement in the incident. Gum indicated that she went by Wright\u2019s and Sweringen\u2019s trailer early on the morning of the incident. The three left in Gum\u2019s car, and stopped on the side of the road by Isgatt\u2019s cottage because the car was beginning to run out of gas. They saw what looked like a gas can nearby, so they approached the house. Once they reached the house, Gum decided to go inside, and Wright helped her through the window.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Gum, in turn, unlocked the door, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>let Wright in to the cottage. Wright opened the refrigerator, and began to take various items. Gum took wine and the vacuum cleaners.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A grand jury indicted Wright on one count of common law burglary, and one count of petit larceny third or subsequent offense. Wright pled not guilty, and chose to be tried by the court. After the close of all the evidence, Wright moved to strike, arguing that the Commonwealth failed to prove that the offense occurred during the nighttime. In fact, Wright argued, the sum of the testimony indicated that the offense occurred during the daytime. Wright conceded that as to the sufficiency of the remaining evidence, the only issue was the credibility of the witnesses, specifically Gum.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The trial court ruled that proof of the breaking occurring during the nighttime was not necessary for a conviction of common law burglary and, therefore denied the motion. Finding Gum\u2019s testimony credible and Wright\u2019s incredible, the trial court convicted Wright of common law burglary and petit larceny third or subsequent offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Wright argues on appeal that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of common law burglary and petit larceny third or subsequent offense. He argues that his conviction was based mostly on Gum\u2019s testimony, which is inherently incredible. He also asserts that the evidence did not prove that the burglary occurred dining the nighttime. We reject the first argument and agree with the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">I. <em>The Sufficiency of the Evidence Generally</em></p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">In addressing the sufficiency of the evidence in a criminal case, the proper standard of review requires an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>appellate court to \u201cpresume the judgment of the trial court to be correct,\u201d and to reverse such decision only if the trial court\u2019s decision is \u201cplainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 96, 99, 570 S.E.2d 875, 876-77 (2002). Therefore, an appellate court does not \u201csubstitute [its] judgment for that of the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Wactor v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 375, 380, 564 S.E.2d 160, 162 (2002). \u201cInstead, the relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). \u201cThis familiar standard gives full play to the responsibility of the trier of fact fairly to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Wright contends that the evidence is insufficient to support his convictions because of Gum\u2019s mental state at the time of the offense. Wright argues that Gum, who was the only witness that implicated Wright in the crime, had been up all night doing \u201ccrank\u201d and had problems \u201cremembering either her motivation or the specifics of her crimes.\u201d Wright therefore reasons that the evidence was not established beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Wright, in essence, is asking this Court to act as a finder of fact, and judge Gum\u2019s credibility for ourselves. This we may not do. \u201cIt is the province of the [trial court], rather than an appellate court, to weigh the facts and to judge the credibility of the various lay and expert witnesses.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Presley, </em>256 Va. 465, 470, 507 S.E.2d 72, 75 (1998). The trial court stated that it found Gum\u2019s testimony to be credible, and convicted Wright accordingly.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In fact, when announcing its decision, the trial court specifically said it \u201cjust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>[does not] think [Wright\u2019s] story [is] credible.\u201d As there was evidence to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion, we will not \u201c \u2018substitute [our] own judgment for that of the [trial court], even if [we] might have reached a different conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Presley, </em>256 Va. at 466, 507 S.E.2d at 72 (quoting <em>Commonwealth v. Jenkins, </em>255 Va. 516, 520, 499 S.E.2d 263, 265 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">II. <em>Whether the Offense Must Occur \u201cIn the Nighttime\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Wright also argues that the Commonwealth never proved that the burglary occurred during the nighttime, as required by Code \u00a7 18.2-89, and thus the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. Because this is a question of law involving the construction and application of Code \u00a7 18.2-89, we review the trial court\u2019s determination <em>de novo. See Ainslie v. Inman, </em>265 Va. 347, 352, 577 S.E.2d 246, 248 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">The principle is well established that \u201cwords in a statute are to be construed according to their ordinary meaning, given the context in which they are used.\u201d <em>Grant v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 680, 684, 292 S.E.2d 348, 350 (1982). We also heed the fundamental principle of statutory construction <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius, </em>or \u201c \u2018where a statute speaks in specific terms, an implication arises that omitted terms were not intended to be included within the scope of the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Conkling v. Commonwealth, </em>45 Va.App. 518, 522, 612 S.E.2d 235, 237 (2005) (quoting <em>Commonwealth v. Brown, </em>259 Va. 697, 704-05, 529 S.E.2d 96, 100 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Code \u00a7 18.2-89 provides, in pertinent part: \u201cIf any person break and enter the dwelling house of another <em>in the nighttime </em>with intent to commit a felony or any larceny therein, he shall be guilty of burglary.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The common law definition of \u201cnight\u201d was \u201cthat time after sunset and before sunrise when it is so dark that a man\u2019s face cannot be identified except by artificial light or moonlight.\u201d 13 Am. Jur.2d <em>Burglary </em>\u00a7 22 (2006). Presently, however, \u201cnight\u201d is generally defined as \u201cthe time from sunset to sunrise.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1071 (8th ed. 2004). As the statute clearly mentions \u201cnighttime,\u201d and not the words \u201cdaytime,\u201d we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>hold that the General Assembly did not intend for any time other than the hours from sunset to sunrise to be included within the scope of the statute. <em>See Conkling, </em>45 Va.App. at 522, 612 S.E.2d at 237. In this case, Gum testified that the offense occurred during the day. Furthermore, the Commonwealth concedes that the trial court committed reversible error. Thus, we hold that the evidence was insufficient to convict Wright of common law burglary, and we vacate that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">However, the Commonwealth submits that statutory burglary is a lesser-included offense of common law burglary and that the case should be remanded for a new trial on this charge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">We will first address whether statutory burglary is a lesser-included offense of common law burglary, as defined in Code \u00a7 18.2-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">\u201cA lesser included offense is an offense which is composed entirely of elements that are also elements of the greater offense.\u201d <em>Kauffmann v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 400, 409, 382 S.E.2d 279, 283 (1989) (citing <em>Sansone v. United States, </em>380 U.S. 343, 349-50, 85 S.Ct. 1004, 1009, 13 L.Ed.2d 882 (1963)).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cThus, in order for one crime to be a lesser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>included offense of another crime, every commission of the greater offense must also be a commission of the lesser offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Applying this test, we hold that statutory burglary is a lesser-included offense of common law burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-91 states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">If any person [in the nighttime enters without breaking or in the daytime breaks and enters ... a dwelling house ... or at any time breaks and enters ... any building permanently affixed to realty] with intent to commit larceny, he shall be guilty of statutory burglary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">We have held that a building permanently affixed to realty \u201cnecessarily includes any such structure used as a dwelling.\u201d <em>Griffin v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 409, 412, 412 S.E.2d 709, 711 (1991) (citing <em>Graybeal v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 736, 740, 324 S.E.2d 698, 700 (1985)). \u201cThus, whenever there is a breaking and entering of a dwelling with a larcenous intent, the timing of the offense is not an essential element of the offense [of statutory burglary].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">In contrast, as discussed above, nighttime is an essential element of common law burglary. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-89. The additional element requiring that the offense take place in the nighttime is therefore the only distinction between the two forms of burglary. In other words, to prove common law burglary, the Commonwealth must prove one additional element\u2014that the offense occurred in the nighttime. Accordingly, the elements of statutory burglary are a subset of the elements of common law burglary and, thus, statutory burglary is a lesser-included offense of common law burglary.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Therefore, because we hold that the evidence was insufficient to establish common law burglary, and because we hold that statutory burglary is a lesser-included offense of common law burglary, we vacate Wright\u2019s conviction on common law burglary, and remand this case to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">As noted above, the Commonwealth asks us to remand the case for retrial on the lesser-included offense of statutory burglary. However, pursuant to the Supreme Court of Virginia\u2019s recent decision in <em>Commonwealth v. South, </em>272 Va. 1, 630 S.E.2d 318 (2006), the elements of the lesser-included offense of statutory burglary having already been proven beyond a reasonable doubt in the trial court, we instead remand solely for a new <em>sentencing proceeding </em>on the offense of statutory burglary.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under the holding in <em>South, </em>we now conclude that to be the appropriate remedy in such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Because the evidence is sufficient to support his conviction, we affirm Wright\u2019s conviction for petit larceny third or subsequent offense. However, because the evidence was insufficient to support Wright\u2019s conviction for common law burglary, we reverse that conviction and remand the case for a new sentencing proceeding on the lesser-included offense of statutory burglary. We also remand the larceny charge for a new sentencing proceeding, as the trial court sentenced Wright to ten years imprisonment for burglary, and a concurrent term of five years for larceny. The trial court then suspended six years of the total sentence. As the Commonwealth notes, the larceny sentence could either be interpreted as five years with one suspended, or fully suspended, hence we remand for the trial court to clarify the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b361-7\">. In addition, Gum provided Funkhouser with two vacuum cleaners that were missing from the house.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b361-8\">. Wright testified that he went with Gum to the Isgatt cottage, but never left the car. He said he went with Gum in order to buy beer and cigarettes in nearby Goshen, and was just \"along for the ride.\u201d When Gum pulled over beside the Isgatt cottage, Gum \u201cjust jumped out the car [sic] real quick, and said I\u2019ll be back in just a second.\u201d Wright admitted that he saw Gum come back to the car with a \"box or two of beer\u201d before they left. Because the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, any discrepancies between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>Wright\u2019s and Gum\u2019s testimony must be resolved in favor of the Commonwealth. <em>See Higginbotham, </em>216 Va. at 352, 218 S.E.2d at 537.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b362-11\">. She acknowledged that she was under the influence of methamphetamine, or \"crank,\u201d when she went into the house. She also acknowledged that she had already pleaded guilty to burglary stemming from this incident, but had not yet been sentenced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b363-7\">. In finding Wright guilty, the trial court also mentioned Wright's inconsistencies between his statement to Funkhouser and his testimony in court, as well as Wright\u2019s overall lack of credibility with regard to his testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b365-8\">. We held in <em>Crowder </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 658, 666, 588 S.E.2d 384, 388 (2003) that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-9\">[w]hen an appellant successfully challenges the sufficiency of the evidence on some (but not all) aspects of his conviction, we must determine if the proven elements of the original charge qualify as a lesser-included offense. If so, the appropriate remedy on appeal is a reversal of the conviction on the greater charge and a remand of the lesser charge for retrial-assuming the Commonwealth, in its prosecutorial discretion, chooses to go forward on the lesser charge. <em>See generally Gorham v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 673, 678, 426 S.E.2d 493, 496 (1993) (observing that the \"consistent practice in Virginia, when the evidence is found insufficient to sustain a felony conviction on appeal, but sufficient to sustain a conviction on a lesser-included misdemeanor offense, has been to remand the case for retrial on the lesser-included offense\").</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b365-10\">. <em>See also Commonwealth v.

In the present case, we hold that statutory burglary is a lesser-included offense of <em>common law burglary, </em>which requires the proof of only one additional element, namely that the offense occurred during the nighttime.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b367-9\">.
