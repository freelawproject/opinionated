HALEY, JR., Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">Code \u00a7 18.2-137 prohibits the destruction of, <em>inter alia, </em>a motor vehicle \u201cnot his own\u201d by an individual.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Code \u00a7 18.2-102 prohibits the unauthorized use of, <em>inter alia, </em>a motor vehicle \u201cnot his own, without the consent of the owner\u201d by an individual.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Armel S. McDuffie (\u201cappellant\u201d) maintains his conviction under both statutes is error, because, since he had a \u201cmarital interest\u201d in the property of the motor vehicle titled in his wife\u2019s name, pursuant to the equitable distribution provisions of Code \u00a7 20-107.3, that vehicle cannot as a matter of law be characterized as \u201cnot his own.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">Appellant further challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to show he acted intentionally and to show the value of the vehicle destroyed. We find these contentions waived pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>to Rule 5A:18 and not amenable to the \u201cends of justice\u201d exception to that Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">\n<em>Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">On December 5, 2004, appellant and his wife, Keesha McDuffie (\u201cwife\u201d), had been married for approximately one and one-half years. The uncontested testimony shows that appellant subjected wife to extended mental abuse that morning, and despite prior refusals to do so, finally left and went to a neighbor\u2019s home. Several hours later he returned, demanding keys to the Land Rover, the vehicle he usually drove. Wife refused to give appellant the keys to the Land Rover.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thereafter, wife had locked herself in a bedroom closet with her purse and cell phone. Appellant broke down the bedroom door, forced his way into the closet, assaulted and battered wife, broke her cell phone, by force grabbed her purse, removed from the purse the keys to the Acura and, using them, drove off in that car. Wife usually drove the Acura, but acknowledged that appellant \u201cdrove it sometimes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Wife called the police, went to the police station, and returned home. During the afternoon appellant called several times, distraught and threatening suicide, and wanted to exchange the Acura for the Land Rover, a request that was refused. Wife\u2019s mother, Margarite Smith, her aunt, Maggie Mitchell, and a friend, Jonathan Green, had arrived at the home. These three were standing on the front porch. They saw appellant in the Acura, on the street, four or five houses away. Appellant \u201crevved up\u201d the engine, accelerated to 55 to 60 miles per hour, jumped a curb, went airborne, drove through the yards of the adjoining houses, hit Ms. Mitchell\u2019s Camry, which was parked in their driveway, and finally crashed into the front porch. As Margarite Smith testified, \u201cWe all kind of jumped at the same time to get out of the way.\u201d Ms. Mitchell testified her car was \u201ctotaled\u201d and at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>time of its destruction she owed \u201cover $3,000\u201d on it. The Commonwealth also offered into evidence three photographs documenting significant damage to the Camry.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Appellant had income from the United States Navy, a portion of which by allotment was paid into an account in wife\u2019s name that was used to pay household bills. Wife also had income that was placed into the same account. Wife testified that she purchased the Acura \u201cright after\u201d the parties were married, it cost $28,500, and was titled in her name alone. Appellant drove the Acura \u201csometimes,\u201d but mainly used the Land Rover. Payments were made on the Acura from the account to which both appellant and wife contributed. Appellant did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">At the time of the incident, there is no evidence appellant and wife were separated, were not living together, or that divorce proceedings had been initiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Appellant was indicted for three counts of attempted murder, two counts of felony destruction of property (Ms. Mitchell\u2019s Camry and the Acura), one count of unauthorized use of the Acura, and one count of assault and battery on wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">A. Property \u201cnot his own\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">The premise of appellant\u2019s defense to the charges involving his wife\u2019s car is that he had a vested property interest in the Acura, pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-107.3, at the time he took and subsequently destroyed the same and that accordingly, the car cannot be, in some proportion, \u201cnot his own\u201d as set forth in Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-102 and 18.2-137. That premise is without foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">The owner of an automobile is the party who has legal title to it. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-100; <em>First Va. Bank v. Sutherland, </em>217 Va. 588, 593, 231 S.E.2d 706, 709 (1977) (decided under predecessor to Code \u00a7 46.2-100); <em>Hall, Inc. v. Empire Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>248 Va. 307, 309, 448 S.E.2d 633, 635 (1994). A certificate of title serves not only as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>substitute recording system but also as evidence of ownership. <em>See Travelers Indem. Co. v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>227 F.Supp. 958, 963 (W.D.Va.1964); <em>Bolden v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 488, 492-93, 507 S.E.2d 84, 86 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">It is well established, pursuant to the Married Women\u2019s Act first codified in 1877, that \u201cmarriage [does not] give[ ] a husband any legal interest in his wife\u2019s tangible personal property.\u201d <em>Stewart v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 887, 889, 252 S.E.2d 329, 331 (1979). Thus, a husband \u201cmay be prosecuted as any other thief for the larceny of [his wife\u2019s] property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 891, 252 S.E.2d at 332. If a husband may be guilty of larceny of his wife\u2019s car, which requires proof that the car \u201cbelonged] to another,\u201d <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 295, 300, 349 S.E.2d 414, 418 (1986), and, thus, was \u201cnot his own,\u201d it follows that the car belonging to his wife also was \u201cnot his own\u201d for purposes of prosecution for unauthorized use in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-102 and for destruction of property in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-137.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Contrary to appellant\u2019s argument, Virginia\u2019s equitable distribution statutes do not change the result under the facts of this case. First, to the extent they give a court the authority to classify, value, and divide the separate, marital, and hybrid property of the spouses, the law is also clear that \u201cno decree of equitable distribution can be made <em>before </em>the parties are divorced.\u201d <em>Parra v. Parra, </em>1 Va.App. 118, 124, 336 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1985). Although</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHv\">community property system[s] ... treat[ ] marital property rights as vested legal title interests acquired during the marriage[,] ... in equitable distribution systems, marital property rights are initially unvested. If the marriage ends in death rather than divorce, [for example,] the marital property rights never vest and distribution is made under the law of decedent\u2019s estates.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">1 Brett R. Turner, <em>Equitable Distribution of Property </em>\u00a7 2:7 (3d ed. 2005). Under Virginia law, then, any interest a spouse may have in marital property is an inchoate right that becomes vested only upon entry of a decree of equitable distribu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>tion in a divorce proceeding. Because no divorce proceeding was pending and, thus, no decree of equitable distribution had been entered with respect to the relative property interests of appellant and wife, appellant had only an inchoate and unvested interest, if any, in wife\u2019s automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold the Acura was property \u201cnot [appellant\u2019s] own\u201d for purposes of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-102 and 18.2-137 and, thus, that appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">B. Other Assignments of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">As noted above, appellant hit Mitchell\u2019s Camry, parked in the driveway, before he rammed into the side of the house. Appellant maintains the evidence was insufficient to prove he intentionally damaged the Camry and that its value or the damage to it was more than $1,000. Both the intent and amount render the crime a felony, rather than a misdemeanor. On brief, appellant concedes both issues were \u201cnot addressed to the trial court\u201d but argues that this Court should address them under the \u201cends of justice\u201d exception to Rule 5A:18. We find neither issue appropriate to apply that exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">Rule 5A:18 states, \u201cNo ruling of the trial court ... will be considered as a basis for reversal unless the objection was stated together with the grounds therefor at the time of the ruling----\u201d In order to preserve an issue for appeal, \u201can objection must be timely made and the grounds stated with specificity.\u201d <em>Marlowe v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 619, 621, 347 S.E.2d 167, 168 (1986). The prevailing purpose behind this rule is \u201cto enable the trial court to prevent error, to cure alleged error with prompt and decisive instruction, and to prevent compounding any harmful consequences by dwelling on irrelevant matters.\u201d <em>Harward v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 468, 473-74, 364 S.E.2d 511, 513 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">Rule 5A:18 also provides, however, that issues not preserved may still be considered on appeal where \u201cgood cause [is] shown or to enable the Court of Appeals to attain the ends of justice.\u201d This \u201cends of justice\u201d exception may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>invoked only where a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d would otherwise result. <em>See Redman v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 215, 221-22, 487 S.E.2d 269, 273 (1997). As we explained in <em>Redman:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsK\">In order to invoke the ends of justice exception when sufficiency of the evidence has been raised for the first time on appeal, an appellant must do more than show that the Commonwealth failed to prove an element or elements of the offense. Otherwise, we would be required under the ends of justice exception to address the merits of every case where a defendant has failed to move to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence as being insufficient to prove an element of the offense. Such a rule would obviate the requirement for making an adequate motion to strike or a contemporaneous objection that the evidence was insufficient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 221, 487 S.E.2d at 272. Therefore, \u201cit is a rare case in which, rather than invoke [Rule 5A:18], we rely upon the exception and consider an assignment of error not preserved at trial. . . .\u201d <em>Jimenez v. Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 244, 249, 402 S.E.2d 678, 680 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">Moreover, the mere possibility of a miscarriage of justice is insufficient grounds to invoke the ends of justice exception. <em>Mounce v. Commonwealth </em>4 Va.App. 433, 436, 357 S.E.2d 742, 744 (1987). \u201c[T]he \u2018ends of justice\u2019 provision may be used when the record affirmatively shows that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, <em>not when it merely </em>shows that a miscarriage <em>might </em>have occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To evaluate the evidence for a miscarriage of justice, we must determine whether an error occurred that involved \u201csubstantial rights\u201d and \u201cclearly had an effect upon the outcome of the case.\u201d <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 126, 131, 380 S.E.2d 8, 10 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">On the issue of appellant\u2019s intent to damage the Camry, the Commonwealth offered evidence that, after he assaulted and battered wife and took the keys by force, appellant \u201crevved up\u201d his engine on the street outside the house. He then circled the block. Appellant returned moments later to reach a speed of 55 or 60 miles per hour, hopped the curb in front of the house, and became airborne <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>before crashing into the parked Camry. The force moved the Camry several feet and \u201cspun it totally around.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence of appellant\u2019s conduct on December 5, 2004, is sufficient to show he acted with intent to support a conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-137(B). Moreover, the record contains no evidence affirmatively rebutting this intent. Thus, the record fails to show a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">On the issue of the Canny\u2019s value, to support a felony conviction the statute requires that the value of or damage to the property equals $1,000 or more. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-137(B)(ii). Mitchell testified that she owned the Camry and owed \u201cover $3,000\u201d on the car when it was destroyed. When asked what happened to her vehicle, Mitchell responded, \u201cIt got totaled.\u201d The Commonwealth also offered three photographs documenting extensive damage to the Camry. Because the record contains no affirmative evidence to show that the value of the Camry was less than $1,000, it does not affirmatively show a miscarriage of justice, and the ends of justice exception does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">On brief, appellant attempts to compare this case to our decision in <em>Crowder v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 658, 588 S.E.2d 384 (2003), in which the witness similarly did not express an opinion on value. Appellant is correct that we held the appellant in <em>Crowder </em>did not impliedly accept the dollar value mentioned by the prosecutor. In <em>Crowder, </em>however, we found that the appellant had \u201cproperly preserved this issue for appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 665 n. 6, 588 S.E.2d at 388 n. 6. That distinction sets <em>Crowder </em>apart from the case at hand, in which appellant failed to raise any objection concerning the value of the Camry before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">For the above reasons, we reject appellant\u2019s \u201cends of justice\u201d arguments on the questions of the Canny\u2019s value and his intent to destroy it.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b219-11\">. \"If any person unlawfully destroys, defaces, damages or removes without the intent to steal any property, real or personal, not his own ... he shall be guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-137(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b219-12\">.
