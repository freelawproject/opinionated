McCLANAHAN, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">Earl Eugene Askew appeals the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for bail pending the appeal of his underlying conviction for possession of a firearm as a convicted felon. Askew contends the court erred in ruling it was divested of jurisdiction to consider the motion because Askew filed the motion subsequent to filing his notice of appeal on the firearm conviction. For the following reasons, we reverse the trial court and remand for its consideration of the motion for bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">Upon his conviction for unlawful possession of a firearm as a convicted felon in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, Askew was sentenced on July 27, 2005 to three years imprisonment, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>one year suspended. On August 11, 2005, Askew filed a notice of appeal. On August 17, 2005, Askew filed a motion for bail pending the appeal, pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-319. On August 31, 2005, the trial court, citing <em>Walton v. Commonwealth, </em>256 Va. 85, 501 S.E.2d 134 (1998), ruled it \u201cwas divested of jurisdiction [to act on the motion] because the notice of appeal has been filed\u201d in this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This appeal followed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Code \u00a7 19.2-319 is the statutory basis upon which a trial court entertains a defendant\u2019s request for post-conviction bail. <em>Commonwealth v. Smith, </em>230 Va. 354, 362, 337 S.E.2d 278, 282 (1985). Because this case presents \u201ca question of law ... involv[ing] the interpretation and application\u201d of this statute, \u201cwe review the trial court\u2019s judgment <em>de novo.\u201d Colbert v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 390, 394, 624 S.E.2d 108, 110 (2006); <em>see Rollins v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 73, 79, 554 S.E.2d 99, 102 (2001) (\u201c[W]e review the trial court\u2019s statutory interpretations and legal conclusions <em>de novo.\u201d </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">Code \u00a7 19.2-319 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-8\">If a person sentenced by a circuit court to death or confinement in the state correctional facility indicates an intention to apply for a writ of error, the circuit court shall postpone the execution of such sentence for such time as it may deem proper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-9\">In any case after conviction if the sentence, or the execution thereof, is suspended in accordance with this section, or for any other cause, the court, or the judge thereof, may ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>set bail in such penalty and for appearance at such time as the nature of the case may require....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-5\">... A writ of error from the Court of Appeals shall lie to any such judgment refusing bail or requiring excessive bail____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Askew argues that the trial court retained ancillary jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 19.2-319 to consider his motion for bail after he filed the notice of appeal on his underlying conviction and that the court misapplied <em>Walton </em>as authority for its ruling to the contrary. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">The Commonwealth concedes the trial court\u2019s reasoning for denying Askew\u2019s motion for bail, based on <em>Walton, </em>was erroneous. In <em>Walton, </em>the Supreme Court held \u201cthe trial court was divested of jurisdiction once the defendant filed his notices of appeal.\u201d <em>Walton, </em>256 Va. at 95, 501 S.E.2d at 140.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That holding, however, as the Commonwealth points out, was limited to an issue regarding a Supreme Court appeal of a defendant\u2019s death sentences following his capital murder convictions, which was governed by Rule 5:22\u2014unlike criminal appeals in non-death penalty cases. <em>See </em>Rule 5:22 (a \u201cSpecial Rule Applicable to Cases in Which Sentence of Death Has Been Imposed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">The Commonwealth contends, instead, that the trial court is not completely divested of its jurisdiction in a non-death penalty case until the petition for appeal is filed,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>not occurred at the time of the trial court\u2019s ruling on the motion for post-conviction bail in the instant case. Nevertheless, as the Commonwealth further contends, pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-319, the trial court must suspend execution of the sentence before it can set post-conviction bail. Further, the Commonwealth asserts the trial court may not order such suspension after the sentence becomes final in twenty-one days under Rule 1:1. Absent such suspension, the court loses jurisdiction to grant post-conviction bail under Code \u00a7 19.2-319, as occurred here. Thus, the Commonwealth concludes the trial court reached the right result in this case, albeit for the wrong reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">We agree that under the express terms of Code \u00a7 19.2-319 postponement or suspension of execution of the sentence is a pre-condition for setting post-conviction bail. However, we further conclude (i) that regardless of the finality of the sentence the trial court is required under Code \u00a7 19.2-319 to suspend execution of the sentence, upon a defendant\u2019s timely request, when made for the purpose of preparing a petition for appeal; (ii) that, as an ancillary matter, the trial court may otherwise suspend execution of the sentence at any time during the pendency of the appeal, pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-322.1<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>; and (iii) that, as an ancillary matter, the trial court may set bail at any time during the pendency of the appeal after it has suspended execution of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">A. Suspension of Execution of Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Code \u00a7 19.2-319 provides, in paragraph one, that when a convicted defendant \u201cindicates an intention to apply for a writ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>of error\u201d the trial court \u201cshall postpone the execution of [defendant\u2019s] sentence for such time as it may deem proper.\u201d First, under basic principles of statutory construction, this part of the statute must be read in conjunction with Code \u00a7 19.2-325 and Rule 5A:6(a), granting a defendant thirty days to file a notice of appeal with the trial court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See Colbert, </em>47 Va.App. at 395, 624 S.E.2d at 110 (\u201c[Statutes <em>in pari materia </em>must be considered together in construing their various material provisions.\u201d); <em>Austin v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 33, 40, 590 S.E.2d 68, 72 (2003) (\u201c[C]losely related statutes must be read as being consistent with one another.\u201d); <em>Hulcher v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 601, 605, 575 S.E.2d 579, 581 (2003) (\u201c[P]roper construction seeks to harmonize the provisions of a statute ... in relation to other statutes.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); <em>Cilman v. Va. State Bar, </em>266 Va. 66, 71, 580 S.E.2d 830, 833 (2003) (\u201cWhen a statute and a rule of [the Supreme] Court address the same or a related subject matter, the proper construction ... avoids any conflict between rule and statute and permits the two to work alongside each other in ... a harmonious manner.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Guided by these principles, we hold that under Code \u00a7 19.2-319 a defendant has a co-equal period of thirty days to so indicate his \u201cintention to apply for a writ of error,\u201d regardless of the finality of the sentence under Rule 1:1, after which execution of the sentence is subject to suspension under the statute. <em>See Peterson v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 289, 297, 302 S.E.2d 520, 525-26 (1983) (suspension of execution of the sentence does not affect the finality of the judgment (citing Code \u00a7 19.2-319; <em>Hirschkop v. Commonwealth, </em>209 Va. 678, 166 S.E.2d 322 (1969))). This construction of Code \u00a7 19.2-319 is not in conflict with Rule 1:1, however, but rather is consistent with its express terms.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Second, the Code \u00a7 19.2-319 requirement that the trial court suspend execution of a defendant\u2019s sentence is limited to a request for such suspension made specifically for the purpose of preparing defendant\u2019s petition for appeal. <em>Ramey v. Commonwealth, </em>145 Va. 848, 851-52, 133 S.E. 755, 756 (1926); <em>Strohecker v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 242, 251, 475 S.E.2d 844, 849-50 (1996). In <em>Ramey, </em>the trial court refused to suspend execution of the defendant\u2019s sentence and \u201cput[] it into immediate execution.\u201d <em>Ramey, </em>145 Va. at 852, 133 S.E. at 756. The Supreme Court reversed the trial court, holding that the court\u2019s action \u201cwas a refusal of the right to apply for a writ of error, and was error\u201d under the provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-319\u2019s predecessor. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court explained, \u201c[the trial court] need not suspend the judgment for any specific length of time, but it should, upon request, suspend it for such length of time as, under all the circumstances, will enable the accused to obtain a copy of the record and present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>his petition for a writ of error....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 851-52, 133 S.E. at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">In <em>Strohecker, </em>the defendant filed a motion with the trial court requesting that \u201cexecution of [his] sentence be postponed pending action by the Court of Appeals\u201d on the appeal of his conviction. <em>Strohecker, </em>23 Va.App. at 250, 475 S.E.2d at 848. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, this Court, relying on <em>Ramey, </em>affirmed the trial court. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">Code \u00a7 19.2-319 provides for the postponement of the execution of a sentence in order to give \u201ca fair opportunity to apply for a writ of error.\u201d <em>Ramey, </em>[145 Va.] at 851, 133 S.E. at 756. Here, appellant made no assertion to the trial court that he needed additional time to prepare his petition for appeal; rather, from appellant\u2019s motion it appears that he misconstrued the statute, requesting that execution of his sentence be postponed \u201cpending action by the Court of Appeals.... \u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-319 provides for no such relief. We [thus] find no prejudice to appellant by the trial court\u2019s refusal to suspend execution of this sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-7\"><em>Strohecker, </em>23 Va.App. at 251, 475 S.E.2d at 848.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">In contrast, Code \u00a7 19.2-322.1 gives the trial court the discretionary authority, as a matter of its ancillary jurisdiction, to suspend the execution of a sentence by expressly providing that execution of such judgment <em>\u201cmay </em>be suspended <em>during </em>an appeal.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>See Smith, </em>230 Va. at 357, 337 S.E.2d at 279 (explaining that, because a \u201c[post-conviction] bail proceeding is not an integral part of the guilt-innocence determination,\u201d the proceeding \u201cis ancillary to the criminal prosecution\u201d); <em>Kusay v. United States, </em>62 F.3d 192, 194 (7th Cir.1995) (noting a trial court retains jurisdiction over \u201cancillary questions\u201d during an appeal). In other words, pursuant to this statute, any suspension of the execution of a sentence apart from or in addition to the time needed for preparation of a defendant\u2019s petition for appeal is not mandatory\u2014as under Code \u00a7 19.2-319\u2014but rather discretionary, at whatever stage of the appeal it may be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>B. Post-Conviction Bail</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Rule 1:1 also does not govern the time frame during which the trial court may set bail pending appeal. Instead, it is governed by Code \u00a7 19.2-319, which places no limit on when the trial court may consider post-conviction bail, other than the condition that such bail may be set only upon the postponement or suspension of the execution of sentence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Therefore, we hold that post-conviction bail may be set at any time during the pendency of the appeal, subject to the aforesaid condition, regardless of the finality of the sentence under Rule 1:1. A contrary construction of Code \u00a7 19.2-319, as urged by the Commonwealth, would \u201cresult in internally conflicting statutory provisions amounting to a manifest absurdity.\u201d <em>Dairyland Ins. Co. v. Sylva, </em>242 Va. 191, 194, 409 S.E.2d 127, 129 (1991). And \u201c[wjhere a particular construction of a statute will result in an absurdity, some other reasonable construction which will not produce the absurdity will be found.\u201d <em>Colbert, </em>47 Va.App. at 402-03, 624 S.E.2d at 114 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The Commonwealth\u2019s construction would also read limits into the statute that the General Assembly chose not to impose upon the trial court in its consideration of post-conviction bail. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Gonzalez v. Fairfax Hosp. Sys., Inc., </em>239 Va. 307, 310-11, 389 S.E.2d 458, 460 (1990) (citation omitted), we are \u201cinvite[d] ... to read the [statute] more narrowly than it is written. We decline the invitation. When there is a claim that the language employed in a statute is too broad in its scope, the fault, if any, should be corrected by the General Assembly, not by this Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Furthermore, our construction of Code \u00a7 19.2-319 does not conflict with the appellate court\u2019s jurisdiction over a criminal case upon appeal, or, more specifically, the principle set forth in <em>Walton </em>that upon the appellate court acquiring jurisdiction of a case the jurisdiction of the trial court from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>which the appeal was taken must end, in the interest of \u201corderly administration of justice.\u201d <em>Walton, </em>256 Va. at 95, 501 S.E.2d at 140 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Once again, an appeal does not divest the trial court of jurisdiction over ancillary matters reserved to it by statute. <em>See Tyson v. State, </em>593 N.E.2d 175, 179-80 (Ind.1992) (\u201cWhether or not [the criminal defendant] receives bail pending his appeal does not involve this Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction over the merits of [defendant\u2019s] appeal in chief.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">In this case, the trial court\u2019s ongoing authority over issues pertaining to bail pending appeal, including issues of bail violation and revocation, is merely an exercise of the trial court\u2019s ancillary jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 19.2-319, separate and apart from the appellate court\u2019s jurisdiction \u201cover those aspects of the [defendant\u2019s criminal] case involved in the appeal.\u201d <em>Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., </em>459 U.S. 56, 58, 103 S.Ct. 400, 402, 74 L.Ed.2d 225 (1982); <em>see Smith, </em>230 Va. at 357, 337 S.E.2d at 279 (post-conviction bail is ancillary to the criminal prosecution); <em>cf. Greene v. Greene, </em>223 Va. 210, 212, 288 S.E.2d 447, 448 (1982), and <em>Lamb v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 161, 165, 279 S.E.2d 389, 392 (1981) (each addressing the appellate court\u2019s jurisdiction acquired over matters directly related to the appeal) <em>(see supra </em>note 4). In <em>Smith, </em>in the context of holding that the Commonwealth was entitled to appeal a decision granting post-conviction bail, the Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">The analysis first must take into account the specific nature of a post-conviction bail proceeding and the extent of its link to the criminal prosecution itself. Upon close examination, several obvious aspects of the bail question point to the conclusion that the proceeding is somewhat separate and distinct from the main criminal prosecution. For example, the most striking factor differentiating the proceedings is that guilt or innocence of the accused is not at issue in the bail proceeding. Also, the ultimate burden of proof on entitlement to bail is upon the prisoner and not the Commonwealth. And, from a practical standpoint, appellate issues relating to bail routinely are handled separately from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>the issues in the criminal prosecution and often are the subject of separate petitions for appeal. Thus, a bail proceeding is not an integral part of the guilt-innocence determination. Rather, it is <em>ancillary </em>to the criminal prosecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Smith, 230 Va. at 357, 337 S.E.2d at 279 (emphasis added); <em>see United States v. Meyers, </em>95 F.3d 1475, 1489 n. 6 (10th Cir.1996) (noting an appeal in a criminal case does not divest the trial court of statutory authority to decide whether a convicted defendant is to be released pending appeal (citing <em>United States v. Affleck, </em>765 F.2d 944, 954 (10th Cir.1985); Fed. R.App. P. 9)); <em>United States v. Queen, </em>847 F.2d 346, 350 (7th Cir.1988) (holding the trial court retains limited jurisdiction to take certain post-appeal actions in criminal cases, including authority to enforce its own judgment concerning a defendant\u2019s violation of a post-conviction release condition).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Finally, while the precise issue on appeal in this case appears to be one of first impression for a Virginia appellate court, we note our holding is consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s granting of a writ of error and supersedeas in <em>Wampler v. Norton, </em>134 Va. 606, 612, 113 S.E. 733, 735 (1922). The defendants in <em>Wampler </em>moved the trial court for bail pending appeal, which was denied. Defendants challenged the ruling on appeal, in conjunction with the appeal of their convictions. In disposing of the bail issue, the <em>Wampler </em>Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">The writ of error and suspersedeas was granted by one of the judges of this court in vacation by the following endorsement on the petition: \u201cWrit of error and supersedeas awarded. No bond. The supersedeas not to operate to discharge the prisoners from custody if in custody nor to release their bail if out on bail, <em>but they may again apply for bail to the circuit court </em>.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-8\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The full Court, however, did not address the trial court\u2019s initial denial of bail on the merits because it was \u201cadmitted by counsel that as soon as the writ of error was granted both defendants again applied for and were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>allowed bail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court thus deemed it \u201cunnecessary to further notice this assignment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">For these reasons, we reverse the trial court and remand this case for consideration of Askew\u2019s motion for bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b176-10\">.
