FELTON, JR., Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">TBC Corporation and Ace American Insurance (collectively \u201cemployer\u201d) appeal a Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (\u201ccommission\u201d) decision awarding medical benefits to Gregory Stephens (\u201cclaimant\u201d) for an ankle injury he sustained on March 11, 2005. Employer argues that the commission erred in finding that claimant sustained a compensable injury arising out of his employment when he fell while discussing work-related matters with his supervisor at his place of employment. Because we conclude that the commission erred in finding that claimant\u2019s injury arose out of his employment, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b699-11\">Well-established principles require us to view the evidence in the record in the light most favorable to the claimant, the prevailing party below. <em>Boys and Girls Club of Virginia v. Marshall, </em>37 Va.App. 83, 85, 554 S.E.2d 104, 105 (2001). So viewed, the evidence established that claimant, an automobile service technician, sustained an injury to his left ankle when he fell backward, after being touched by a fellow employee while he was talking with his supervisor about work-related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>matters. During the conversation, claimant crossed his left leg over his right leg and leaned against a counter for support. A co-worker, David Robles (\u201cRobles\u201d), approached him from behind and, while placing his hand on claimant\u2019s shoulder, unintentionally \u201cmade contact with\u201d the back of claimant\u2019s left knee with his leg. As a result of the contact to his knee, claimant fell backwards to the floor. He immediately felt pain in his left ankle, which was caught under the bottom of the counter.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Claimant filed a claim with his employer for workers\u2019 compensation benefits as a result of his ankle injury. He sought temporary total disability benefits from March 14 through April 4, 2005, and medical benefits for as long as necessary. Employer denied the claim on the grounds that claimant did not describe \u201can \u2018injury by accident\u2019 as defined in the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cAct\u201d) while \u2018in the course and scope of [ ] employment\u2019.... \u201d Claimant appealed employer\u2019s denial of benefits to the commission. Following an evidentiary hearing, a deputy commissioner found that the claimant sustained a \u201csprained ankle that arose out of and in the course of his employment\u201d and awarded lifetime medical benefits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The deputy commissioner specifically found that there was \u201cnot substantial horseplay in which [claimant] was engaged and that there has been no allegation of an assault at work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">The deputy commissioner granted employer\u2019s request for reconsideration to address its defense that claimant\u2019s injury was caused by a \u201cfriendly greeting\u201d and that claimant\u2019s injury, therefore, did not arise out of his employment. On reconsideration, the deputy commissioner determined that the incident was not a \u201cfriendly greeting,\u201d and affirmed its earlier decision that the incident could not be classified as horseplay or assault. The deputy commissioner concluded that claimant\u2019s injury occurred when he was touched unexpectedly by a fellow employee and again found that claimant\u2019s injury occurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>while he was \u201cin the course of his employment discussing automobile parts with his supervisor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">On review before the full commission, employer argued that \u201cclaimant failed to prove that a work related hazard caused his injury.\u201d Claimant argued that the deputy commissioner\u2019s \u201cultimate factual determination is consistent with a finding <em>that the injury resulted from a unilateral act of horseplay,\" </em>thereby entitling him to benefits. (Emphasis added). The full commission affirmed the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision that \u201cimpliedly found\u201d that the fellow employee\u2019s contact with claimant\u2019s knee was \u201caccidental, not intentional\u201d and, that \u201c[a]s the act was not intentional, and the claimant was discussing work-related matters when the accidental touching occurred, ... [claimant] proved that the injury arose out of the employment.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">The sole issue on appeal is whether claimant\u2019s injury arose out of his employment. Under the Act, claimant must prove that he \u201c \u2018suffered an injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Virginia Employment Commission/Commonwealth v. Hale, </em>43 Va.App. 379, 384, 598 S.E.2d 327, 329 (2004) (quoting Code \u00a7 65.2-101). \u201cArising out of\u2019 and \u201cin the course of\u2019 are separate and distinct requirements. <em>Bassett-Walker, Inc. v. Wyatt, </em>26 Va. App. 87, 92, 493 S.E.2d 384, 387 (1997) (en banc). Claimant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he has satisfied each requirement. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe phrase \u2018in the course of refers to the time, place and circumstances under which the accident occurred.\u201d <em>County of Chesterfield v. Johnson, </em>237 Va. 180, 183, 376 S.E.2d 73, 74 (1989). Neither party disputes that claimant sustained an injury in the course of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">\u201cThe phrase arising \u2018out of refers to the origin or cause of the injury.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>237 Va. at 183, 376 S.E.2d at 74. To determine whether the cause of the injury is work-related, we apply the actual risk test, \u201cmeaning that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>employment must expose the employee to the particular danger causing the injury notwithstanding the public exposure to similar risks.\u201d <em>Combs v. Virginia Electric &amp; Power Co., </em>259 Va. 503, 510, 525 S.E.2d 278, 282 (2000) (citing <em>Lucas v. Lucas, </em>212 Va. 561, 563, 186 S.E.2d 63, 64 (1972)). Thus, the actual risk test \u201cexcludes an injury which cannot fairly be traced to the employment as a contributing proximate cause and which comes from a hazard to which the workmen would have been equally exposed apart from employment.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 509, 525 S.E.2d 278, 525 S.E.2d at 282. Whether an employee\u2019s work-related injury arises out of his employment \u201cinvolves a mixed question of law and fact, which we review <em>de novo </em>on appeal.\u201d <em>Blaustein v. Mitre Corp., </em>36 Va.App. 344, 348, 550 S.E.2d 336, 338 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The characterization of an injury as resulting from an \u201caccident,\u201d \u201cassault,\u201d \u201chorseplay,\u201d \u201cfriendly greeting,\u201d or \u201cgoosing,\u201d without more, does not prove that an injury \u201carose out of\u2019 the employment. <em>Combs, </em>259 Va. at 509, 525 S.E.2d at 282 (citing <em>In re Employers\u2019 Liab. Assur. Corp., Ltd., </em>215 Mass. 497, 102 N.E. 697, 697 (1913)). Claimant must prove that the injury was the result of an actual risk of the employment. <em>See Butler v. Southern States Coop., Inc., </em>270 Va. 459, 466, 620 S.E.2d 768, 772-73 (2005) (non-compensable injury resulting when an assault on employee was personal and not directed against her as an employee or because of her employment); <em>Farmers\u2019 Mfg. Co. v. Warfel, </em>144 Va. 98, 100, 131 S.E. 240, 240 (1926) (compensable injury where assault stemmed from argument between co-workers about the performance of work-related duties); <em>Dublin Garment Co. v. Jones, </em>2 Va.App. 165, 168, 342 S.E.2d 638, 639 (1986) (compensable injury resulting from \u201cthe unilateral act of a co-worker upon a nonparticipating claimant\u201d where lengthy overtime work session was determined to be motivation for co-worker\u2019s conduct); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number><em>Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Hazelwood, </em>249 Va. 369, 375, 457 S.E.2d 56, 59 (1995) (psychological condition resulting from repeated \u201cgoosing\u201d not compensable as \u201cgoosing\u201d was of a personal nature and not directed against claimant as an employee or in furtherance of employer\u2019s business). An injury that results from an accidental or unintentional touching by a fellow employee, without proof that the injury resulted from an actual risk of the employment, does not arise out of the workplace. <em>See Combs, </em>259 Va. at 509, 525 S.E.2d at 282 (citing <em>In re Employers\u2019 Liab. Assur. Corp., Ltd., </em>215 Mass. 497, 102 N.E. 697).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">In all proceedings before the commission, claimant argued that his fellow employee, Robles, intentionally caused him to fall backwards and to injure his ankle, which was caught under the counter as he fell. He specifically argued to the full commission that the deputy commissioner\u2019s \u201cultimate factual determination [was] consistent with a finding that the injury resulted from a unilateral act of horseplay.\u201d He made no argument to the commission that the design of the counter was a unique risk of the workplace. On review by the full commission, claimant relied solely on his \u201cunilateral act of horseplay\u201d argument despite the deputy commissioner\u2019s finding that \u201cthere was not substantial horseplay\u201d and that \u201c[n]othing in the testimony of either witness gives me cause for a finding of either horseplay or assault____\u201d While the commission found that claimant\u2019s injury resulted from his ankle being caught under the counter as he fell backwards, the record contains no finding by it that the design of the counter was a risk peculiar to the workplace, nor did claimant request that it do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">For the first time on appeal to this Court, claimant argues that his injury resulted from a condition of the workplace, the design of the counter. He argues, \u201chad [claimant\u2019s] foot not been caught under the edge of the counter, his ankle would not have been exposed to the unusual position and force that caused the injury\u201d and that the general public is \u201cnot exposed to the risk of getting a foot caught under the edge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>the counter where claimant worked.\u201d In his written statements to the commission opposing employer\u2019s request for review, claimant did not argue that his injury was compensable because it resulted from a condition of the workplace. In failing to present that theory to the commission, claimant denied the commission the opportunity to determine whether the counter was an actual risk of his employment. Claimant is now barred from arguing an alternate theory for the first time to this Court on appeal. <em>Southwest Architectural Products, Inc. v. Smith, </em>4 Va.App. 474, 478, 358 S.E.2d 745, 747 (1987) (\u201cAlthough Rule 5A:21 allows an appellee to raise additional issues on brief, it does not dispense with the requirement of Rule 5A:18 that only those issues properly preserved for appellate review will be considered.\u201d); <em>Boys and Girls Club of Virginia, </em>37 Va.App. at 85 n. 1, 554 S.E.2d at 105 n. 1 (\u201c[IJssues which were not properly preserved before the commission cannot be raised on appeal.\u201d (citing <em>Overhead Door. Co. of Norfolk v. Lewis, </em>29 Va.App. 52, 62, 509 S.E.2d 535, 539 (1999))).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Claimant also requests that we apply the \u201cright result, wrong reason\u201d rationale to affirm the commission\u2019s award of benefits in this case. We decline to do so. An appellate court may not affirm a decision of the commission \u2018\u201cwhere, because the [commission] has rejected the right reason or confined its decision to a specific ground, further factual resolution is needed before the right reason may be assigned to support the [commission\u2019s] decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 670, 676, 576 S.E.2d 228, 231 (2003) (quoting <em>Driscoll v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 449, 452, 417 S.E.2d 312, 313 (1992)). Concluding that the commission reached the right result in this case would require additional fact-finding by the commission to determine whether the design of the counter posed a risk unique to claimant\u2019s workplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">We conclude that the commission erred in finding that claimant\u2019s injury arose out of his employment. It found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>the injury did not result from an intentional act by claimant\u2019s co-worker or any type of horseplay, and it made no finding that claimant\u2019s injury following the accidental touching by a co-worker arose out of a condition peculiar to the workplace. It simply found that, because claimant was injured when he fell after being accidentally touched by a fellow employee while discussing work-related business, the injury was compensable. The record supports a finding that claimant\u2019s injury occurred in the course of his employment, but fails to support the commission\u2019s finding that the claimant proved his injury resulted from an actual risk arising out of his employment. We, therefore, reverse the commission\u2019s award of medical benefits to claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b700-7\">. The deputy commissioner denied temporary total disability compensation benefits, finding the evidence insufficient to support that claim. Claimant did not appeal that decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b702-6\">. Virginia has expressly rejected the \"positional risk\u201d test used in other jurisdictions \"where simply being injured at work is sufficient to establish compensability.\u201d <em>Butler v.
