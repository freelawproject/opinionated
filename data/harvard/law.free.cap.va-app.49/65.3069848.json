FRANK, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">Immanuel Cyprus Perry, appellant, was convicted in a bench trial of common nuisance, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-258, possession of ecstasy, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-250, possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248.1, and possession of a firearm while in possession of ecstasy, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4. On appeal, appellant contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence recovered pursuant to a search warrant, arguing the police officers serving the warrant failed to knock and announce their presence before entering his residence. For the reasons stated, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">The facts of this case are not in dispute. On January 4, 2003, Investigator David Barber of the Norfolk Police Department obtained a search warrant for appellant\u2019s residence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">Barber testified that, based on the information he had regarding appellant\u2019s prior gun possessions and the presence of a camera mounted above appellant\u2019s door, he made the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>decision to make a \u201cno-knock entry\u201d into appellant\u2019s home. When executing the search warrant on January 4, 2003, officers rammed the front door of appellant\u2019s residence and entered without knocking and announcing their presence. Officers recovered ecstasy, marijuana, drug packaging material, $4,900 in U.S. currency, and a firearm from appellant\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Appellant filed a motion to suppress the evidence found in his home based on the officers\u2019 violation of the \u201cknock-and-announce\u201d rule. He argued below, as he does on appeal, that the information relied upon by Investigator Barber in deciding to effect a \u201cno-knock entry\u201d was either \u201ctoo generalized\u201d or too \u201cstale\u201d to justify such an entry. The trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">On appeal, appellant contends that the facts contained in the affidavit were not sufficient to justify a \u201cno-knock entry\u201d into appellant\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">We do not address whether officers violated the knock-and-announee rule, as the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Hudson v. Michigan, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2159, 165 L.Ed.2d 56 (2006), directs that the remedy for such a violation is not the suppression of the evidence recovered from appellant\u2019s residence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he knock-and-announce rule has never protected ... one\u2019s interest in preventing the government from seeing or taking evidence described in a warrant.\u201d <em>Hudson, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 126 S.Ct. at 2165.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-12\">Instead, the rule was developed (1) to protect against violence raised in self-defense by a resident surprised by an unannounced-entry, <em>id., </em>(2) to give individuals \u201c \u2018the opportunity to comply with the law and to avoid the destruction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>property occasioned by a forcible entry,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Richards v. Wisconsin, </em>520 U.S. 385, 393 n. 5, 117 S.Ct. 1416, 1421 n. 5, 137 L.Ed.2d 615 (1997)), and (3) to give \u201cresidents the \u2018opportunity to prepare themselves for\u2019 the entry of the police,\u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Richards, </em>520 U.S. at 393 n. 5, 117 S.Ct. at 1421 n. 5). Since these interests \u201chave nothing to do with the seizure of the evidence, the exclusionary rule is inapplicable.\u201d <em>Hudson, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 126 S.Ct. at 2165. As such, the trial court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b112-13\">. Appellant does not challenge the validity of the search warrant or the sufficiency of the affidavit to supply probable cause for the search warrant. On appeal, he challenges only the method of executing the search warrant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b113-13\">. This appeal was granted before the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Hudson.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
