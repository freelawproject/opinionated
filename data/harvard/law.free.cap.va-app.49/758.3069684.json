BEALES, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b807-12\">Louis Latour, Inc. (\u201cLatour\u201d) appeals a decision of the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond, which affirmed a decision of the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board (\u201cBoard\u201d). Specifically, Latour contends that the circuit court erred in failing to apply a <em>de novo </em>standard of review, and in finding that Latour (1) unilaterally amended its agreement with The Country Vintner, Inc. (\u201cVintner\u201d or \u201cTCV\u201d) without good cause; (2) discriminated among its wholesalers in viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>tion of the Virginia Wine Franchise Act (\u201cVWFA\u201d); and (3) acted in bad faith in its dealings with Vintner. For the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">\u201cOn appeal, we will review the evidence, and all reasonable inferences deducible therefrom, in the light most favorable to [Vintner], the party prevailing below.\u201d <em>The Country Vintner, Inc. v. Rosemount Estates, Inc., </em>35 Va.App. 56, 60, 542 S.E.2d 797, 799 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"AJD\">A. <em>Factual History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">On December 10,1990, Latour entered into a wine distribution agreement with The Country Vintner, Inc. According to the agreement, Vintner would sell Latour\u2019s wine throughout the Commonwealth with a primary area of responsibility in Surry and Gloucester Counties.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It was understood that Vintner was selling, and intended to continue selling, Latour wine in Northern, Central, and Eastern Virginia.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Between December 1990 and April 2003, Latour permitted Vintner to order as much wine as it could sell throughout the Commonwealth. And, from November 5,1999 to April 3, 2003, Vintner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>was the only wholesale distributor of Latour wines in the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">In 2002, Latour sought to change its marketing strategy, and with the help of Charles Ducker (\u201cDucker\u201d), Latour\u2019s new Southeast Manager of Sales, attempted to create a network of regionally based distributors. Specifically, Latour decided to appoint new distributors with primary areas of responsibility outside of Surry and Gloucester Counties. Latour planned to mail distribution agreements to three new distributors,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> receive them back, and file the new territory appointments with the Board. Latour made these plans without alerting Vintner.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Latour entered into written distribution agreements with three new wholesalers, and on April 3, 2003, filed the appropriate forms with the Board. On April 18, 2003, Latour sent Vintner a new proposed distribution agreement. The proposed agreement designated Vintner\u2019s primary area of responsibility as Surry and Gloucester Counties and required certain performance measures. For example, it required Vintner to maintain, and file with Latour, detailed stock depletion reports.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In essence, Latour intended for this written agreement to replace the existing franchise agreement which existed \u201cby virtue of prior designations, actions, understandings, and course of dealings\u201d between Vintner and Latour.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Vintner refused to sign the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">In response, Latour sent Vintner a Requirements Announcement (\u201cannouncement\u201d), stating that it was \u201cprepared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>as a unilateral amendment to the commercial relationship.\u201d The announcement incorporated all aspects of the proposed agreement and declared that it would become effective ninety-one days after its receipt by Vintner. The announcement defined Vintner\u2019s sales territory as Surry and Gloucester Counties, and stated that Latour had no obligation to \u201csupport in any way\u201d sales activities of Vintner related to retailers located outside of the defined territory. It further provided that Latour could \u201cin its sole discretion allocate the Latour wines among distributors in any manner\u201d that it deemed in the best interests of Latour. Vintner objected to all aspects of this announcement and, subsequently, filed a complaint with the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">After Vintner refused to sign the agreement, Latour began offering price discounts and marketing incentives to the new distributors, Select Wines and Virginia Distributing, and ceased offering any such opportunities to Vintner.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Latour gave the new distributors access to Vintner\u2019s confidential business records in order to facilitate the new distributors\u2019 marketing efforts. Latour also deliberately delayed the processing of Vintner\u2019s purchase orders, while almost immediately filling those from the new distributors, and, moreover, never filled two purchase orders submitted by Vintner.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">B. <em>Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">On August 6, 2003, Vintner filed an original complaint with the Board against Latour. The complaint alleged that Latour violated the VWFA by creating dual distributorships and by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>attempting to impose specific performance requirements on Vintner without good cause. On February 11, 2004, Vintner filed an amended complaint with the Board alleging that Latour acted in bad faith and unilaterally amended its franchise agreement without good cause. A Hearing Panel (\u201cPanel\u201d) heard the case over a seven-day period, and on March 21, 2005, issued an opinion finding that Latour: (1) violated the VWFA\u2019s dual distributorship provisions; (2) unilaterally amended Vintner\u2019s agreement with Latour without good cause because the \u201cmodification [of the agreement was] in direct contravention of the Act\u201d; (3) discriminated among its wholesalers, in violation of the VWFA; and (4) acted in bad faith in its dealings with Vintner.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">Latour appealed, and on November 29, 2005, the Board affirmed all but one portion of the Panel\u2019s decision. Specifically, \u201cThe Board concurred] with the analysis and findings of the hearing panel on the issue of Latour\u2019s unilateral amendment of its agreement with TCV. It likewise concurred] with the hearing panel on the issues involving unlawful discrimination between wholesalers and bad faith on the part of Latour.\u201d However, the Board reversed the Panel\u2019s decision with regard to Latour\u2019s alleged creation of a dual distributorship. The Board found that Vintner\u2019s \u201cprimary area of responsibility [was] Surry and Gloucester Counties, and therefore, Latour [had] not entered into a dual distributorship situation in [Vintner\u2019s] territory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Latour appealed the Board\u2019s decision to the Circuit Court for the City of Richmond. On June 28, 2006, the circuit court affirmed the Board\u2019s final order, stating that it was \u201cwithout error.\u201d Latour timely appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">In reviewing the decisions of a regulatory agency, the agency\u2019s findings of fact are conclusive if supported by the evidence. <em>Rosemount, </em>35 Va.App. at 62-63, 542 S.E.2d at 799; <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7 4.1-410 (\u201cAll proceedings under this chapter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>and any judicial review thereof shall be held in accordance with the Virginia Administrative Process Act (\u00a7 2.2-4000 et seq.).\u201d). Accordingly, \u201c[t]he reviewing court may reject the agency\u2019s findings of fact only if, considering the record as a whole, a reasonable mind would necessarily come to a different conclusion.\u201d <em>Johnston-Willis, Ltd. v. Kenley, </em>6 Va.App. 231, 242, 369 S.E.2d 1, 7 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">However, \u201c[ajlthough decisions by administrative agencies regarding matters within their specialized competence are \u2018entitled to special weight in the courts,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 244, 369 S.E.2d at 8, decisions which involve issues of statutory interpretation require \u201clittle deference\u201d because the issue falls outside the agency\u2019s specialized competence, <em>Sims Wholesale Co. v. Brown-Forman Corp., </em>251 Va. 398, 404, 468 S.E.2d 905, 908 (1996); <em>see also Va. Imports, Ltd. v. Kirin Brew, of Am., LLC, </em>41 Va.App. 806, 821, 589 S.E.2d 470, 477 (2003). Said differently, \u201cpure statutory interpretation is the prerogative of the judiciary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, we review an issue of statutory construction <em>de novo. See Mattaponi Indian Tribe v. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Quality ex rel. State Water Control Bd., </em>43 Va.App. 690, 707, 601 S.E.2d 667, 675 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">A. <em>The Circuit Court and the Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">Latour argues that the circuit court erred in failing to apply the <em>de novo </em>standard of review in reviewing the Board\u2019s final order. Specifically, Latour argues that issues of statutory construction and the meaning of terms found in the VWFA are questions \u201cwhich [fall] squarely [within] the province of the courts.\u201d We agree with the proposition that these issues are subject to <em>de novo </em>review by the courts, but we find that the record does not support Latour\u2019s contention that the circuit court faded to apply this standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">We have long held that, \u201c[ajbsent clear evidence to the contrary in the record, the judgment of a trial court comes to us on appeal with a presumption that the law was correctly applied to the facts.\u201d <em>Yarborough v. Commonwealth, </em>217 <em>Va. </em>971, 978, 234 S.E.2d 286, 291 (1977); <em>Shenk v. Shenk, </em>39 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>Va.App. 161, 169, 571 S.E.2d 896, 900 (2002) (\u201cA trial court is presumed to apply the law correctly.\u201d); <em>Oliver v. Commonwealth, </em>35 Va.App. 286, 297, 544 S.E.2d 870, 875 (2001) (\u201cThe trial court\u2019s judgment is presumed to be correct.\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">Here, the circuit court held, \u201cHaving reviewed and considered the record before the Board, this court is of the opinion that the decision of the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board is without error.\u201d Even though the circuit court did not explicitly set forth the standard of review in its holding, on appeal, we presume that in reviewing and considering the record, the circuit court used the appropriate standard of review. Moreover, during discussion with trial counsel, the circuit court acknowledged that it was \u201cbound\u201d by the facts as found by the Board. However, the circuit court also noted that such a deferential standard of review is \u201cnot true with regard to questions of law.\u201d Therefore, because the record does not contain \u201cclear evidence to the contrary,\u201d we cannot say that the circuit court applied an incorrect standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">B. <em>Dual Distributorships</em></p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Neither party appeals the Board\u2019s finding that Vintner\u2019s \u201cprimary area of responsibility [was] Surry and Gloucester Counties, and therefore, Latour [had] not entered into a dual distributorship situation in [Vintner\u2019s] territory.\u201d Instead, the parties disagree regarding the impact of this finding. Specifically, Latour argues that the Board\u2019s determination that \u201cLat-our lawfully appointed new wholesalers ... is legally irreconcilable with the Board\u2019s adoption of the Hearing Panel\u2019s holdings that Latour nevertheless violated the WFA by engaging in unilateral amendment, bad faith, and discrimination.\u201d In contrast, Vintner and the Commonwealth argue that the Board recognized \u201cthat the other findings do not depend upon the primary area of responsibility\u201d and that those findings are \u201clegally unassailable\u201d in light of the Board\u2019s holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>Because neither party presents the issue of Vintner\u2019s \u201cprimary area of responsibility\u201d on appeal, we will not address it. Accordingly, we are bound by the Board\u2019s decision that Latour had not created a dual distributorship, in violation of the VWFA, and that, according to the parties\u2019 agreement, Vintner\u2019s primary area of responsibility was Surry and Gloucester Counties. Therefore, we will approach the other issues on appeal in light of these uncontested facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">C. <em>Unilateral Amendment and Good Cause</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Latour contends that the circuit court erred in finding that it unilaterally amended its franchise agreement with Vintner without good cause, thereby violating Code \u00a7 4.1-406. Vintner responds that the evidence supports the finding that Latour unilaterally amended the franchise agreement without good cause, and the fact that Code \u00a7 4.1-404\u2019s prohibition of the establishment of dual distributorships was not violated does not contradict that finding. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the circuit court on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">1. Unilateral Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">Initially, we note that the VWFA does not preclude a winery from proposing changes to the contractual relationship with its distributors, and we would certainly not uphold the imposition of any sanctions on a winery for solely proposing changes to its contractual relationship with its distributor. To do so would be contrary to the VWFA. In the absence of an agreed upon change (i.e., a bilateral amendment), however, the VWFA also provides a framework for unilaterally amending an existing agreement. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 4.1-406 and 4.1-407. According to that framework, a winery may not unilaterally amend a contract without good cause. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">In this case, the Panel explicitly concluded that Latour\u2019s actions \u201cconstituted a unilateral change or modification of an agreement without good cause.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In reaching this conclusion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>the Panel noted that Vintner \u201cobjected to <em>all </em>aspects of the Requirements Announcement. Consequently, it was not implemented by Louis Latour as to TCV.\u201d Latour contends this sentence constitutes a finding that the amendment was not actually implemented and that, therefore, \u201cthe issue of the propriety\u201d of the announcement \u201chas been rendered moot.\u201d This claim, however, completely overlooks the Panel\u2019s other numerous findings and explanations that Latour had indeed unilaterally amended the franchise agreement, emphasizing one phrase over the vast majority of the Panel\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">The Panel, after noting that Latour did not implement the proposal \u201cas to\u201d Vintner, immediately then, however, found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARs\">However, Louis Latour <em>delayed orders placed by [Vintner] </em>and assisted the other distributors by granting them price breaks and other incentives not offered to [Vintner] in order to enable them to compete against [Vintner]----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-5\">[The new distributors] had already been told by Mr. Duck-er [Latour\u2019s Southeast Manager of Sales] that Louis Latour <em>intended to limit [Vintner\u2019s] supply of wine in order to restrict [Vintner\u2019s] distribution of Latour wine to Surry and Gloucester Counties. </em>Mr. Retornaz also testified that this was Louis Latour\u2019s <em>intention. </em>This is directly contrary to the provisions of Section 404 of the Act in that such a scheme restricted the sales of Latour wine by [Vintner] to retailers located within Surry and Gloucester Counties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-6\">In the case herein, Louis Latour\u2019s primary objective, in attempting to force [Vintner\u2019s] signing of the Distribution Agreement and complying with the Requirements Announcement, was <em>to limit [Vintner] from selling Latour </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number><em>wines outside of what Louis Latour considered [Vintner\u2019s] primary area of responsibility. </em>This is in direct contravention of Section 404 of the Act and makes this case easily distinguishable from <em>Schiejfelin. </em>If anything, <em>Schiejfelin </em>supports [Vintner\u2019s] contentions in this case. [Vintner] had been the sole distributor for Latour wines in Virginia from 1999 to April 2003. The plan or scheme conceived by Louis Latour was to enable other distributors to distribute Latour wines in areas of Virginia formerly serviced by [Vintner] pursuant to a longstanding agreement and <em>to limit [Vintner\u2019s] distribution to Surry and Gloucester Counties. </em>This, <em>in the Hearing Panel\u2019s view, constitutes a unilateral change or modification of an agreement without good cause. </em>Good cause cannot exist when the unilateral change or modification is in direct contravention of the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq-\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Latour clearly could not implement <em>all </em>of the provisions of the requirements announcement because it was impossible for them to implement the provisions that required Vintner to act. Latour could not unilaterally have Vintner furnish the depletion reports\u2014only Vintner could perform that provision. Moreover, the requirements announcement, i.e., the unilateral amendment, contained more provisions than just the requirement for depletion reports. Paragraph 1 of the requirements announcement stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-5\">Retail licensees located in such Primary Area of responsibility shall be considered by Supplier and Distributor as the target market to which Distributor\u2019s obligation under this contract shall be focused; moreover, Supplier shall have no obligation to facilitate or support in any way ... any activities in which Distributor chooses to engage relating to retail licensees located outside the Territory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">Latour implemented as much of this provision as it possibly could unilaterally. For example, Latour limited Vintner\u2019s ability to sell outside of Surry and Gloucester Counties\u2014in parts of Virginia that were not part of the other distributors\u2019 primary areas of responsibility where Vintner had previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>been distributing wine\u2014by refusing to follow previous shipping arrangements that were part of the existing franchise agreement between Latour and Vintner. This is exactly the type of behavior that Code \u00a7 4.1-406 was enacted to prevent. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 4.1-400(3), (4).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">To find that Latour proposed, but did not implement the amendment would provide suppliers with an easy loophole to Code \u00a7 4.1-406. A supplier could propose an amendment that includes a part that can only be implemented by the distributor, such as depletion reporting, and then implement whatever other provisions it sees fit without violating the statute, since the entire proposal has not been implemented. We find such an interpretation contrary to the purpose of Code \u00a7 4.1-406. Therefore, while the Panel\u2019s <em>preliminary finding </em>that Latour did not implement the proposed amendment to the agreement \u201cas to\u201d Vintner is accurate (if martfully worded), so also is the Panel\u2019s <em>conclusion </em>that Latour actually unilaterally implemented the portions of the announcement that it could\u2014on its own\u2014unilaterally implement.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Finally, the text of the announcement itself states that Latour\u2019s requirements announcement was, in fact, a unilateral amendment to the existing agreement. The announcement reads,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>The enclosed \u201cRequirements Announcement\u201d has been prepared as a <em>unilateral amendment </em>to the commercial relationship between Louis Latour Inc. and The Country Vintner Inc. It essentially incorporates all of the performance aspects of the proposed contract, those relating to the distributor\u2019s performance and those relating to Louis Lat-our Inc.\u2019s performance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">(Emphasis added.) The announcement also states, \u201cThe effective date of the amendments contained in the Requirements Announcement is the 91st day following the date of receipt by The Country Vintner, Inc.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Consequently, Latour makes clear that it is unilaterally amending the existing franchise agreement via the requirements announcement, which notes that the unilateral amendment takes effect on \u201cthe 91st day following the date of receipt by The Country Vintner, Inc.\u201d Therefore, we affirm the finding that Latour unilaterally amended the parties\u2019 contract, and, in accordance with Code \u00a7 4.1-406, Latour must demonstrate that good cause existed for such a unilateral amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">2. Good Cause</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">We now turn to whether the record supports the finding that Latour unilaterally amended the parties\u2019 agreement without good cause, in violation of Code \u00a7 4.1-406.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">Under the VWFA, a winery is permitted to impose requirements on a wholesaler by unilateral amendment, so long as the winery complies with the requirements set forth in the VWFA. Code \u00a7 4.1-406; Code \u00a7 4.1-407. Specifically, Code \u00a7 4.1-406 requires that \u201cthe winery first compl[y] with \u00a7 4.1-407 <em>and </em>good cause [must] exist[] for amendment, termination, cancellation, nonrenewal, noncontinuance or causing a resignation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Code \u00a7 4.1406 delineates the parameters of \u201cgood cause\u201d as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b819-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>Good cause shall not include the sale or purchase of a \u2022winery. Good cause shall include, but is not limited to the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">1. Revocation of the wholesaler\u2019s license to do business in the Commonwealth;</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">2. Bankruptcy or receivership of the wholesaler;</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">3. Assignment for the benefit of creditors or similar disposition of the assets of the wholesaler, other than the creation of a security interest in the assets of a wholesaler for the purpose of securing financing in the ordinary course of business; or</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">4. Failure by the wholesaler to substantially comply, without reasonable cause or justification, with any reasonable and material requirement imposed upon him in writing by the winery including, but not limited to, a substantial failure by a wine wholesaler to (i) maintain a sales volume or trend of his winery\u2019s brand or brands comparable to that of other distributors of that brand in the Commonwealth similarly situated or (ii) render services comparable in quality, quantity or volume to the services rendered by other wholesalers of the same brand or brands within the Commonwealth similarly situated. In any determination as to whether a wholesaler has failed to substantially comply, without reasonable excuse or justification, with any reasonable and material requirement imposed upon him by the winery, consideration shall be given to the relative size, population, geographical location, number of retail outlets and demand for the products applicable to the territory of the wholesaler in question and to comparable territories. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a winery from proposing or effecting an amendment to a contract with a wine wholesaler in the Commonwealth provided that such amendment is not inconsistent with this chapter.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">Good cause shall not be construed to exist without a finding of a material deficiency for which the wholesaler is responsible in any case in which good cause is alleged to exist based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>on circumstances not specifically set forth in subdivisions 1 through 4 of this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">Upon review, \u201cthe issue of whether a winery had \u2018good cause\u2019 to [unilaterally amend] a franchise agreement with a wholesaler is a mixed question of fact and law.\u201d <em>Rosemount, </em>35 Va.App. at 63, 542 S.E.2d at 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Latour argues that the unilateral amendment avoided dual distributorships, which are prohibited by Code \u00a7 4.1-404, and that, therefore, \u201cLatour\u2019s amendment was in \u2018good faith\u2019 as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As previously stated, we review issues of statutory construction <em>de novo. See Mattaponi, </em>43 Va.App. at 707, 601 S.E.2d at 675. Code \u00a7 4.1-404 states that \u201c[e]ach winery which enters into an agreement with a wine wholesaler shall designate a sales territory as the primary area of responsibility of that wholesaler which is applicable to the agreement.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> However, Code \u00a7 4.1-404 also states that \u201cthe term \u2018primary area of responsibility<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> shall not be construed as restricting sales or sales efforts by a wine wholesaler exclusively to retailers located within the designated sales territory, and any agreement to the contrary shall be void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">The plain language of the statute commands that the winery \u201cshall\u201d designate a \u201cprimary area of responsibility\u201d for the wholesaler. Furthermore, the statute contemplates that, pursuant to the franchise agreement, the winery may not <em>restrict </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>the wholesaler\u2019s sales to that \u201carea of responsibility.\u201d Code \u00a7 4.1-404. In other words, the winery may not limit the wholesaler to selling solely within its primary area of responsibility, nor may the winery qualify the wholesaler\u2019s sales territory as solely limited to that primary area of responsibility. <em>See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1317 (7th ed. 1999) (defining restriction as \u201ca limitation or a qualification\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">Of course, the statute does not require that the winery assist a wholesaler in its effort to distribute outside of the wholesaler\u2019s \u201cprimary area of responsibility.\u201d However, in this case, the parties\u2019 franchise agreement did require Latour to assist Vintner outside of Surry and Gloucester Counties, and such assistance had taken place throughout the parties\u2019 course of dealing. In other words, while Code \u00a7 4.H04 does not require that Latour assist Vintner with sales outside of its primary area of responsibility, the parties\u2019 existing contract did. Code \u00a7 4.1-404, rather than precluding such a contract provision, provides for such assistance by including the provision, \u201cThe term \u2018primary area of responsibility* shall not be construed as restricting sales or sales efforts by a wine wholesaler exclusively to retailers located within the designated sales territory, and any agreement to the contrary shall be void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Here, Latour admitted before the Panel that it intended to limit Vintner to Surry and Gloucester Counties. Assisting new distributors, with whom they had recently signed contracts, in the areas outside each of the distributors\u2019 primary areas of responsibility (i.e., in areas of Virginia not assigned to any distributor and which were formerly serviced by Vintner), while disregarding Vintner\u2019s orders for sales in these same areas outside of any distributors\u2019 primary area of responsibility, were all attempts to limit Vintner\u2019s sales to only Surry and Gloucester Counties. While Latour is not <em>required </em>by statute to assist Vintner outside its primary area of responsibility and, in fact, cannot assist Vintner within another distributor\u2019s primary area of responsibility, Latour cannot <em>impede </em>Vintner\u2019s efforts and ability to sell outside its primary area of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>responsibility (while assisting other distributors in this \u201cunclaimed territory\u201d), which Latour clearly did.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">Latour\u2019s unilateral amendment was, therefore, intended to limit Vintner to its primary area of responsibility, in violation of Code \u00a7 4.1-404. Specifically, Latour intended to use the depletion reports from Vintner to limit its supply of wine and, therefore, its distribution territory. In addition, as the Panel noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-5\">Latour delayed orders placed by [Vintner] and assisted the other distributors by granting them price breaks and other incentives not offered to [Vintner] in order to enable them to compete against [Vintner]. Louis Latour also gave the new distributors a letter of authorization to take to the retailers, in areas formerly serviced by [Vintner], announcing a change in the distribution network....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">In short, not only did Latour act without good cause, it also acted in bad faith as discussed <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">Latour\u2019s actions towards Vintner both before and after Vintner\u2019s rejection of the proposed written amendment to their contract further establishes that Latour attempted to unilaterally amend the agreement with Vintner without good cause. Although Latour argues that the VWFA \u201canticipates and permits wineries to impose sales volume requirements and to make comparisons of product demand among sales territories\u201d and \u201conly by requiring depletion reports of their wholesalers can wineries make such comparisons,\u201d Latour does not offer evidence of any \u201cmaterial deficiency for which the wholesaler is responsible\u201d nor does Latour argue that any of the examples of good cause enumerated in Code \u00a7 4.1-406 applies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>in this case. We thus affirm the finding of the Panel, the Board, and the circuit court on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">D. <em>Discrimination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Latour contends that because the issue of discrimination is \u201chopelessly intertwined with the Hearing Panel\u2019s decision regarding the scope of Vintner\u2019s territory,\u201d the circuit court erred in finding that Latour discriminated against Vintner, in violation of Code \u00a7 4.1-415. For the following reasons, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">Code \u00a7 4.1-415 provides that \u201c[n]o winery shall discriminate among its wholesalers in any business dealings including, but not limited to, the price of wine sold to the wholesaler, unless the classification among its wholesalers is based upon reasonable grounds.\u201d In general, discrimination is defined as \u201cdifferential treatment; esp. a failure to treat all persons equally when no reasonable distinction can be found between those favored and those not favored.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, supra </em>at 479. Thus, according to Code \u00a7 4.1-415, no winery may treat its wholesalers differently unless the winery has reasonable grounds to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">In this case, the record reflects that Latour offered direct import pricing, depletion allowances, and marketing activities to Select Wines and Virginia Distributing. However, the record gives no indication that the same direct import pricing, depletion allowances, or marketing activities were offered to Vintner. In essence, Latour allowed the new distributors to purchase the same wine at lesser prices, <em>compensated the new distributors following the sale of the wine, </em>and offered free wine to the new distributors. After April 2003, none of these incentives were offered to Vintner. Moreover, Latour made a conscious decision to immediately process the purchase orders from Select Wines and Virginia Distributing, while delaying or simply not fulfilling the purchase orders from Vintner, in order to allow the new distributors to sell more wine. Thus, the record provides ample support for the Board\u2019s finding that Latour discriminated against Vintner in favor of other distributors. Accordingly, we affirm the circuit court on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>E. <em>Good Faith</em></p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">Latour argues that the circuit court erred in affirming the Board\u2019s finding that Latour failed to act in good faith, in violation of the VWFA. For the following reasons, we disagree with this argument as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">\u201cGood faith\u201d is a legal term of art, and thus on appeal whether a party acted in good faith is a mixed question of law and fact. Again, we give deference to the factual findings of the Board and the Panel, but review the application of those facts to the law <em>de novo. See generally Rosemount, </em>35 Va.App. at 63, 542 S.E.2d at 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">The VWFA requires that, \u201c[e]very agreement entered into under this chapter shall impose on the parties the obligation to act in good faith.\u201d Code \u00a7 4.1-418. Although good faith is not defined under the VWFA, it is generally defined as \u201c[a] state of mind consisting in (1) honesty and belief in purpose, (2) faithfulness to one\u2019s duty or obligation, (3) observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in a given trade or business, or (4) absence of intent to defraud or to seek unconscionable advantage.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, supra </em>at 701.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">In this case, Latour discriminated against Vintner, in favor of other distributors, in violation of the VWFA. Moreover, Latour provided confidential business information to the new wholesalers so that they could compete more effectively with Vintner in territories outside of Vintner\u2019s and their own primary areas of responsibility. Latour acknowledged that disclosing the information was wrong and that it did not condone such business practices. Regardless, Latour argues that because under Code \u00a7 4.1-404 a winery is not obligated to facilitate the wholesaler\u2019s activities outside of the primary area of responsibility, Latour\u2019s actions cannot, as a matter of law, constitute bad faith. This argument, however, ignores <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>the fact that Latour\u2019s actions\u2014delaying and not filling purchase orders, offering incentives to all wholesalers except Vintner, and disclosing confidential business documents\u2014went far beyond simply not facilitating sales outside Vintner\u2019s primary area of responsibility. These actions applied to Vintner\u2019s entire business and affected its entire operation. Stated another way, Latour frustrated Vintner\u2019s ability to sell wine <em>anywhere </em>to <em>anyone </em>so that Latour\u2019s new distributors could gain a competitive advantage and, consequently, increase their market share.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">Because Code \u00a7 4.1-418 requires that \u201c[e]very agreement entered into under this chapter ... imposes on the parties the obligation to act in good faith\u201d and Latour clearly violated this obligation, we affirm the circuit court on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">F. <em>Remedies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">1. Compensation under Code \u00a7 4.1-409</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">Latour argues that the circuit court erred in granting Vintner compensation in the form of the value of the agreement, pursuant to Code \u00a7 4.1-409, because \u201cLatour had every right under the WFA to propose amendments without incurring liability,\u201d i.e., Latour had good cause to amend the parties\u2019 distribution agreement. We disagree.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-8\">Code \u00a7 4.1^09 provides that,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-9\">in any case in which a winery is found to have attempted or accomplished an amendment, termination, cancellation, or refusal to continue or renew an agreement <em>without good cause </em>as defined in \u00a7 4.1-406, the Board shall, upon the request of the wholesaler involved, enter an order requiring that (i) the agreement remain in effect or be reinstated or (ii) the winery pay the wholesaler reasonable compensation for the value of this agreement as determined pursuant to subsection B.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-10\">(Emphasis added.) As we have held <em>supra, </em>Latour did not demonstrate good cause to amend the parties\u2019 agreement. Consequently, the remedy awarded pursuant to Code \u00a7 4.1-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>409 was appropriate, and we affirm the circuit court on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">2. Attorney\u2019s fees</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">Latour contends that because the circuit court erred in finding that Latour acted in bad faith, the circuit court also erred in awarding Vintner attorneys\u2019 fees, pursuant to Code \u00a7 4.1-410. According to Code \u00a7 4.1-410, \u201c[t]he Board may, if it finds that the winery or wine wholesaler has acted in bad faith <em>in violating any provision of this chapter </em>or in seeking relief pursuant to this chapter, award reasonable costs and attorneys\u2019 fees to the prevailing party.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Because we find that Latour acted in bad faith in violation of Code \u00a7 4.1-418,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and because Code \u00a7 4.1-410 allows for attorneys\u2019 fees when a party acts in bad faith in violation of <em>any </em>provision of this chapter, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s decision to award attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the circuit court did not err in applying the appropriate standard of review, in finding that Latour unilaterally amended the parties\u2019 agreement without good cause, in finding that Latour discriminated against Vintner, in finding that Latour acted in bad faith, in fashioning an appropriate remedy under Code \u00a7 4.1-409, and in awarding attorney\u2019s fees. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b808-10\">. The original agreement was never distilled to writing. However, forms filed with the Board in 1990 and 1997 indicate that Vintner's territory designation was Surry and Gloucester Counties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b808-11\">. In 1990, two other distributors had written agreements to distribute Latour wines in Virginia. Specifically, King &amp; Roberts was authorized to distribute Latour wine in Charlottesville, and Virginia Imports had an agreement to distribute Latour wine in Northern Virginia. In 1996, Virginia Imports and Vintner entered into a brand swap, and thus. Vintner acquired the Northern Virginia Territory. Subsequently, King \u25a0 &amp; Roberts sold its business to Broudy-Kantor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b809-7\">.

By acquiring agreements with the new distributors, Latour hoped to pressure Vintner into signing the new franchise agreement. The new distributors were subject to a written agreement, which included, among other things, the requirement for filing depletion reports. As such, Latour hoped to push Vintner into signing the agreement by indicating that the other wholesalers in the Commonwealth were subject to the same terms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b810-7\">. We note that the record is unclear as to whether Latour failed to offer these price discounts and marketing incentives to Vintner in general, or just in relation to its sales outside of its primary area of responsibility. When questioned at oral argument, Latour\u2019s counsel could only indicate that Latour offered wine tasting events to the new wholesalers within their primary area of responsibility and that Latour did not offer Vintner the same events outside of its primary area of responsibility. However, the record does not contain any indication that Latour offered these services to Vintner within its primary area of responsibility. Based upon our standard of review, we will view this in the light most favorable to Vintner, the prevailing party below. <em>See Rosemount, </em>35 Va.App. at 60, 542 S.E.2d at 799.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b813-7\">. Although in cases such as this, the circuit court functions as an appellate court rather than a trial court, the principle remains applicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b814-9\">. While the dissent questions our examining Latour\u2019s actions subsequent to Vintner\u2019s receipt of the requirements announcement (i.e., the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>unilateral amendment), we nonetheless find it necessary to address those actions given the Board\u2019s factual findings, which Latour challenges on appeal. With that in mind, we feel we must address Latour\u2019s question presented of whether or not Latour unilaterally amended, without good cause, its existing agreement with Vintner by imposing the requirements announcement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b817-6\">. We expressly do not hold, as the dissent seems to state (and as we discuss <em>infra), </em>that the statute requires a winery, such as Latour, to assist a wholesaler in its efforts to distribute the winery's product in another wholesaler's primary area of responsibility. Such a requirement would create dual distributorships and would violate the statute\u2019s express prohibition against creating dual distributorships. The statute also does not require a winery to assist a wholesaler outside the wholesaler\u2019s own primary area of responsibility. However, as noted, the statute expressly allows a wholesaler to sell the winery\u2019s product outside of the wholesaler\u2019s primary area of responsibility (and prevents a winery from restricting the wholesaler to its primary area of responsibility). Furthermore, in this case, the existing franchise agreement required Latour to assist Vintner in selling outside of Vintner's primary area of responsibility. It is Latour\u2019s unilateral implementation of that proposed change to the existing franchise agreement with Vintner that violates the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b818-8\">. Code \u00a7 4.1-407(A) states, in pertinent part, \"a winery shall provide a wholesaler at least ninety days' prior written notice of any intention to amend, terminate, cancel or not renew any agreement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b820-7\">. Code \u00a7 4.1-406 delineates the parameters of \"good cause\u201d to cancel or amend an existing agreement. Appellant, however, uses the term \"good faith\u201d in its argument on this issue. The Virginia Supreme Court has explicitly noted the difference in the two terms as contemplated by that section. <em>See Sims Wholesale Co., </em>251 Va. at 405, 468 S.E.2d at 909. Therefore, we will address the concept of \"good cause\u201d in this section and discuss the VWFA\u2019s provision that requires good faith in all dealings <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b820-8\">. Here, Latour designated Surry and Gloucester Counties as the primary area of responsibility for Vintner, certain cities and counties in Northern Virginia as the primary area of responsibility for Select Wines, and certain cities and counties in the Roanoke area, Central Virginia, and Eastern Virginia as the primary area of responsibility for Virginia Distributing Company. No other areas of Virginia were designated as any wholesaler\u2019s primary area of responsibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b822-8\">. The Board\u2019s finding that Latour did not violate the prohibition on dual distributorships contained in Code \u00a7 4.1-404, <em>see supra, </em>does not contradict this finding. Code \u00a7 4.1-404 contains more than one provision. It both precludes wineries from assigning the same primary area of responsibility to two distributors <em>and </em>prevents wineries from limiting those distributors to their primaiy areas of responsibility. While Lat-our did not violate the first provision, it violated the second provision by its unilateral amendments to the contract with Vintner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b824-8\">. The Panel relied upon the Uniform Commercial Code, which defines good faith as \"honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.3A-103; <em>see Johnston v.

However, for the reasons that follow, I respectfully dissent from the analysis and holding of subsection C with regard to whether Latour attempted a unilateral amendment to the franchise agreement without good cause, in violation of Code \u00a7 4.1-404. Furthermore, because I would reverse the circuit court and the Board on that issue, I also partially dissent from the analysis and holding in subsection F(l) of section III of the majority opinion, and would remand to the circuit court with direction to remand to the Board to reconsider the issue of the appropriate sanction limited to the remaining issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">I. <em>Unilateral Amendment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">The primary point of my disagreement with the majority is with respect to the issue of whether Latour violated Code \u00a7 4.1-406 by attempting to amend its agreement with Vintner through the Requirements Announcement without good cause. The hearing panel found that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-7\">Latour\u2019s primary objective, in attempting to force [Vintner\u2019s] signing of the Distribution Agreement and complying with the Requirements Announcement, was to limit [Vintner] from selling Latour wines outside of what Louis Latour considered [Vintner\u2019s] primary area of responsibility. This is in direct contravention of Section 404 of the Act----The plan or scheme conceived by Louis Latour was to enable other distributors to distribute Latour wines in areas of Virginia formerly serviced by [Vintner] pursuant to a longstanding agreement and to limit [Vintner\u2019s] distribution to Surry and Gloucester Counties. This in the Hearing Panel\u2019s view, constitutes a unilateral change or modification of an agreement without good cause. Good cause cannot exist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>when the unilateral change or modification is in direct contravention of the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">The majority affirms this decision holding that because Latour implemented as much of the requirements announcement that it could on its own\u2014for example, refusing to follow \u201cprevious shipping arrangements\u201d\u2014Latour unilaterally amended the parties\u2019 agreement for which Latour must demonstrate good cause. And because Latour\u2019s professed intention behind the requirements announcement was to limit Vintner to its primary area of responsibility, the attempted unilateral amendment to the agreement was done without good cause. I disagree with the majority and would reverse the Board on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">Initially, I note that the majority has conflated the issue of Latour acting in bad faith with respect to its obligations under the <em>existing </em>agreement with the issue at hand. While acknowledging the Board\u2019s factual finding that \u201cLatour did not implement the proposal \u2018as to\u2019 Vintner,\u201d the majority then promptly ignores that explicit finding, and holds that \u201cIt is Latour\u2019s unilateral implementation of the proposed change to the existing franchise agreement with Vintner that violates the statute.\u201d <em>See </em>Footnote 9. Moreover, contrary to the apparent view of the majority, the question before us is not whether the Board erred in holding that Latour\u2019s <em>actions subsequent </em>to Vintner\u2019s refusal to accept the requirements announcement constituted a unilateral amendment to the existing agreement without good cause. Instead, the question presented is whether the Board erred in holding that the <em>proposed requirements announcement </em>constituted a unilateral amendment to the existing agreement without good cause.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In my view, it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>Latour\u2019s announcement stated that, (1) \u201c[rjetail licensees located in such Primary Area of responsibility shall be considered by Supplier and Distributor as the target market to which Distributor\u2019s obligation under this contract shall be focused;\u201d (2) \u201cSupplier shall have no obligation to facilitate or support in any way ... any activities in which Distributor chooses to engage relating to retail licensees located outside the Territory\u201d; and (3) \u201cDistributor shall furnish monthly depletion and inventory reports for the Latour Wines to Supplier.\u201d The requirements announcement also contained a provision stating, \u201cSupplier shall supply the Latour Wines to Distributor in sufficient quantities to meet the demand for Latour Wines in the Territory. If however, supply of any Latour Wines in [sic] limited, Supplier may, in its sole discretion, allocate the Latour Wines ... in any manner that it determines to be in the best interest of Latour Wines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Asq\">Vintner argues, and the Board found, that these terms, when considered <em>in light of the course of dealings </em>between Vintner and Latour, amount to restricting Vintner to selling solely to retailers within the primary area of responsibility, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>violation of Code \u00a7 4.1-404. And because in the Board\u2019s view, the requirements announcement illegally restricted Vintner to its primary area of responsibility, the Board held that, \u201cGood cause cannot exist when the unilateral change or modification is in direct contravention of the Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">However, in affirming the circuit court and the Board on this point, the majority reaches a different issue from the one presented to us. As the majority acknowledges, the Virginia Wine Franchise Act (\u2018VWFA\u201d) clearly does not forbid a winery from merely proposing changes to the contractual relationship with its distributors, as long as such changes are not unilaterally implemented except in compliance with the VWFA. Indeed, the VWFA specifically provides for such amendments, and the Board found\u2014as a fact binding on this Court\u2014that no unilateral implementation of the proposed amendments had occurred. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 4.1-406 and 4.1-407.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">In any event, Latour\u2019s announcement to Vintner proposing amendments to the existing agreement does not forbid Vintner from selling Latour products outside of Surry and Gloucester Counties, and in fact, would have been void had it done so. Rather, it simply relieves Latour from any responsibility to actively participate in or promote Vintner\u2019s efforts to sell outside of Vintner\u2019s primary area of responsibility. Moreover, it allows the winery to allocate its resources among distributors when quantities of a particular product may be low. Thus, in answer to the issue actually presented to us, I would hold that the proposed announcement, standing alone, did not violate Code \u00a7 4.1-404.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">It seems to me that the chilling effect of the majority\u2019s approval of the Board\u2019s imposition of sanctions for merely proposing changes in a contractual relationship between a winery and its distributors, as distinguished from the sanctions that were appropriately imposed for the actions of Latour with respect to its existing agreement, frustrates rather than furthers the legislative intent of the statute. Specifically, Code \u00a7 4.1-400 clearly indicates that the legislative intent behind the VWFA was, in part, \u201cTo provide for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>system of designation and registration of franchise agreements between wineries and wholesalers with the Board as an aid to Board regulation of the distribution of wine by wholesalers.\u201d By requiring a winery to facilitate a wholesaler outside of its designated primary area of responsibility, even pursuant to an existing franchise agreement, the majority runs afoul of the clear legislative intent to create a territorial system through which the Board can more easily regulate the distribution of wine throughout the Commonwealth. Moreover, by doing so, the majority has in effect encouraged the <em>de facto </em>creation of a dual distributorship, in direct contravention of the VWFA. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 4.1\u2014104 (\u201cNo winery shall enter into any agreement with more than one wholesaler for the purpose of establishing more than one agreement for its brands of wine in any territory.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">II. <em>Good Cause</em></p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">In light of the fact that I believe that the announcement did not violate Code \u00a7 4.1-404, I now turn to whether the remaining facts support the conclusion that Latour\u2019s attempted unilateral amendment to the agreement was without good cause, in violation of Code \u00a7 4.1\u2014406.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>Under the VWFA, a winery is permitted to impose requirements on a wholesaler by unilateral amendment, so long as it complies with the procedural requirements set forth in the VWFA. Code \u00a7 4.1-406; <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 4.1-407.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Specifically, Code \u00a7 4.1-406 requires that in order to impose a unilateral amendment upon the wholesaler, \u201cthe winery [must] first compl[y] with \u00a7 4.1-407 <em>and </em>good cause [must] exist[] for amendment, termination, cancellation, nonrenewal, noncontinuance or causing a resignation.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">Here, the Board found that Latour complied with the notice requirements as set forth in Code \u00a7 4.1-407. The Board also found that although the proposed agreement was never implemented, the proposed unilateral amendment to the existing agreement was intended to limit Vintner to its primary area, in violation of Code \u00a7 4.1-404. Thus, because the provisions violated the VWFA, Latour necessarily could not prove good cause existed to amend the agreement. Because the Board did not make any other factual findings with respect to its determination of good cause, and because I would hold that the proposed unilateral amendments alone did not violate the VWFA, I would reverse on this issue, and remand to the circuit court with instructions to remand to the Board for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>review of the remedy consistent with this holding and the results of any further proceedings before the Board.</p>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b828-7\">. The majority characterizes the hearing panel\u2019s factual finding that Latour did not implement the proposed amendment to the agreement \"as to\u201d Vintner as nothing more than a <em>\"preliminary finding.\u201d </em>The majority then asserts that the panel's \"final conclusion\u201d was that \u201cLatour actually unilaterally implemented the portions of the announcement that it could\u2014on its own\u2014unilaterally implement.\u201d Characterizing an explicit finding of fact as \u201cpreliminary,\u201d and then substi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>tuting its own factual conclusion, is utterly revisionist on the part of the majority. In point of fact, the plain language used by the hearing panel, and later adopted by the Board and the circuit court, was that \"Latour\u2019s primary objective, in attempting to force [Vintner\u2019s] signing of the Distribution Agreement and complying with the Requirements. Announcement, was to limit [Vintner] from selling Latour wines outside of what Louis Latour considered [Vintner\u2019s] primary area of responsibility. ... <em>This in the Hearing Panel\u2019s view, constitutes a unilateral change or modification of an agreement without good cause.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) In other words, and contrary to the characterization of the majority, the hearing panel found that Latour, <em>through the provisions in the announcement, </em>was attempting to limit Vintner to its primary area of responsibility, in direct contravention of the Code. And although the panel acknowledged that Latour had delayed price orders and given the other distributors price incentives, <em>the panel never tied these facts to its finding regarding the unilateral amendment without good cause. </em>And although I agree with the majority that we must \u201caddress those actions,\u201d in my view, they are more properly addressed in the context of discrimination and good faith with regard to compliance with the existing agreement. They are not, however, properly addressed when determining whether the requirements announcement, <em>in and of itself, </em>constituted a unilateral amendment to the agreement without good cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b831-6\">.
