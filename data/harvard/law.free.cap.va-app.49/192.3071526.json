Rice, Sr. and Kathleen W. Rice, paternal grandparents, appeal the denial of their petition for visitation with their granddaughter. The grandparents present the following issues: 1) they argue that the trial court erred in its \u201capplication of [Code] \u00a7 20-124.3:1 [by] not allowing the testimony of Wendy Hall, LCSW\u201d; 2) they claim that the trial court abused its discretion \u201cin not ordering visitation [by the grandparents with their grandchild] to be in the best interest of the child\u201d; and 3) they argue that the trial court erred in its \u201capplication of the best interests [of the child] standard in denying appellants\u2019 petition for visitation.\u201d Cameille Cromer, mother, cross-appeals the trial court\u2019s use of \u201cthe best interests of the child standard rather than the actual harm to the child test.\u201d Each party asks this Court for attorneys\u2019 fees associated with the appeal. For the following reasons, we affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling and, consequently, decline to rule on mother\u2019s cross-appeal issue. We deny each party\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">The child is the daughter of V. Cameille Cromer and Benjamin H. Rice, Jr. Mother and father had been previously granted a final divorce. A portion of the divorce proceedings involved the cessation of father\u2019s visitation and overall contact with the child due to allegations of sexual abuse of the child by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>her father. In an administrative hearing, father was found to have committed a level 1 sexual abuse act against the child in the grandparents\u2019 home. That finding was subsequently affirmed in two administrative appeals, and the matter was pending in circuit court when this appeal was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">On February 9, 2004, grandparents filed a petition for visitation with the child. They were granted supervised visitation by a Consent Order on October 29, 2004. Thereafter, the juvenile court granted the grandparents visitation every other weekend for a period of eight hours. Mother appealed the decision to the Prince George Circuit Court, which held a <em>de novo </em>visitation hearing on October 25, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">As a preliminary matter, the trial court heard argument on whether or not to grant mother\u2019s motion <em>in limine, </em>which moved to exclude the testimony of the child\u2019s former therapist, Wendy Hall. Mother argued that Code \u00a7 20-124.3:1 barred testimony by a therapist on behalf of or against a parent without written consent of the parent, which neither mother nor father here had given. The guardian <em>ad litem </em>argued against granting the motion <em>in limine, </em>proffering that Hall\u2019s testimony would consist of \u201cimpressions about [the] child and statements that may have been made by the parent.\u201d The trial court sustained the motion, noting that Hall was brought in to testify by and for a party to the suit (grandparents) and thus could \u201cnot testify on behalf or against a parent or any of the parent\u2019s adult relatives, if she is called as a mental health provider.\u201d The trial court also restricted the testimony of another therapist, Cara Campanella, who was called to testify by the mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Next, the parties presented argument on which legal standard the trial court should employ in its analysis of the visitation petition: the best interests of the child standard found in Code \u00a7 20-124.3 or the actual harm standard articulated in <em>Williams v. Williams, </em>256 Va. 19, 501 S.E.2d 417 (1998), and <em>Griffin v. Griffin, </em>41 Va.App. 77, 581 S.E.2d 899 (2003). The trial court held the best interests of the child standard applied under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Testimony from paternal grandmother, from mother, and from experts dealt with the child\u2019s tendency to twitch and \u201cself-masturbate,\u201d which was also termed \u201cself-stimulating behavior.\u201d This behavior intensified and resulted in distraction at school and the inability to complete homework.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Mother explained that the level of masturbation would \u201cget[ ] better\u201d in the period between the visits with grandparents, \u201cbut usually the Sunday or Monday afterwards, she becomes completely dysfunctional again____You can\u2019t even ... get her to sit still and do her homework.\u201d The child stopped the behavior completely during a four-week period when the grandparents were out of town, but, according to mother, she immediately resumed the behavior when the visitation resumed. Grandmother stated that she initially noticed the behavior in spring 2003, but she did not advise mother of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Dr. Leigh Hagan, an expert in forensic psychology, observed and tested the child, noting that the psychological testing used \u201cmeasures that are well-recognized, they\u2019re accepted in the field and they have been subject to peer review.\u201d Hagan opined that the child \u201cis a psychologically healthy child, with the exception being the encapsulated area of family pathology, family maladjustment, which ... derives from the original trauma which gave rise to the founded complaint.\u201d Hagan further stated that, as a result of the father\u2019s alleged abuse, certain stimuli associated with the grandparents\u2019 visits caused the child to resume the self-stimulating behavior, and \u201cthe stimuli ... associated with that original trauma will more likely than not be reawakened for her if there is Court-ordered visitation.\u201d Hagan concluded that any loss or separation the child might feel from not visiting the grandparents would be counter-balanced by \u201cprotection or insulation from situations that are the same or similar to that resembling those factors surrounding the original trauma.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">Don Wilhelm, a clinical social worker, had been previously ordered by the court to perform an assessment on the child and was accordingly admitted \u201cas an expert in the area of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>attachment.\u201d The assessment was performed at Wilhelm\u2019s home, with the child and both maternal and paternal grandparents present. Wilhelm did not observe \u201cany excessive anxiety [n]or [did] the child attempt[ ] to present a false sense of self,\u201d leading him to conclude that no \u201cred flags\u201d were present.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Willie Cromer, Jr., the maternal grandfather, recounted that the child\u2019s meeting with Mr. Wilhelm \u201cwas supposed to be an hour.\u201d He explained that Wilhelm only spent between twenty to twenty-five minutes with the child, that Wilhelm twice excused himself to eat during the session, and that Wilhelm spent ten minutes in the front yard conversing with his wife while waiting for a child to arrive on the school bus. He estimated the entire session lasted less than one hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The parties stipulated that the father supports the grandparents\u2019 petition for visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">The trial court denied grandparents\u2019 petition, noting its decision was based on the statutory best interest \u201cfactors and all the evidence and all the comments.\u201d In support of its ruling, the trial court made extensive findings, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-8\">In this case, we have one parent, who definitely says I don\u2019t want to be ordered to let my child visit the grandparents, I fully intend for them to have a relationship with the paternal grandparents, but I want to be able to do it when I think it is appropriate and proper, as opposed to the grandparents who say the child gets along well with us, there is no problem when the child is with us, and I have no question about that. I feel certain the child does get along well. I am very impressed with the grandmother, she makes a very good witness, she is very brief in her answers and very straight and direct, she comes right to the point, and I think in probably dealing with problems, child rearing problems, she is very competent and capable of responding appropriately, as one of the witnesses pointed out, to problems of dealing with child\u2019s behavior.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>But does that mean that they should be allowed to demand from the mother, who is the custodian of this child at this time, the sole custodian, I mean insofar as the father has no visitation or contact, should they be allowed to demand that the mother, over her objection and against her best judgment, to have this child come and visit them. That\u2019s what is before me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The trial judge also found \u201csome evidence that, after th[e] visitation, there is some exacerbation in the child\u2019s problem behavior,\u201d which was an increased level of masturbation. Therefore, and noting the fact that \u201cthis child is suffering at this time and has problems and difficulties,\u201d the court held that \u201cthe mother has the right to make the decision about how things are handled with this child.\u201d Also, the judge stated that he \u201cthought Dr. Hagan\u2019s testimony was helpful ... very well spoken and a man with impressive credentials,\u201d but continued, \u201cI was not impressed with Mr. Wilhelm ... not so much with the description that Reverend Cromer ... gave, but with Mr. Wilhelm\u2019s own testimony, he seemed not to know a lot, which are things we would like for him to be able to give answers to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The trial judge also held that he was not denying all contact between the grandparents and the child. The judge specifically stated that he would enter an order, if necessary, which would allow cards, letters, and phone calls between the child and her grandparents. Mother was also required to give information and notice to the grandparents so that they could attend the child\u2019s \u201cevents, soccer games, school plays or whatever might come about.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">Grandparents assert the trial court erred in interpreting Code \u00a7 20-124.3:1 and in not allowing therapist Wendy Hall to testify. On brief, they \u201ccontend that impressions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>how therapy has gone, completion of goals, treatment, over-all mental health, emotional needs or observations of the child are not barred ... because statements of that nature may not necessarily enure to the benefit or detriment of either parent or his or her relatives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Code \u00a7 20-124.3:l(B) states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-6\">In any case in which custody or visitation of a minor child is at issue pursuant to \u00a7 20-124.2, whether in a circuit or district court, a mental health care provider licensed in the Commonwealth may not be required to testify on behalf of or against a parent or any of the parent\u2019s adult relatives, and may do so only with the advance written consent of the parent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">In <em>Schwartz v. Schwartz, </em>46 Va.App. 145, 616 S.E.2d 59 (2005), where the therapist was \u201ca mental health care provider for the children,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 149, 616 S.E.2d at 61, we interpreted the language and legislative history of Code \u00a7 20-124.3:1. There, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-8\">The language in Code \u00a7 20-124.3:1 is plain____Subsection (B) provides that the mental health care provider \u201cmay not be required to testify on behalf of or against <em>a parent </em>or any of the parent\u2019s adult relatives\u201d without \u201cthe advance written consent of <em>the parent. </em>\u201d ... In addition, Code \u00a7 20-124.3:1 provides no exception permitting the trial court to order disclosure for the broad purpose of determining the best interests of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 156-58, 616 S.E.2d at 65-66 (quoting Code \u00a7 20-124.3:1) (emphasis in original). We also noted that \u201c[n]othing in the language of Code \u00a7 20-124.3:1 <em>as enacted </em>requires that the parent must have been a patient in order to invoke the privilege.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 156, 616 S.E.2d at 65 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">While we recognize that the mother in <em>Schwartz </em>desired to specifically exclude \u201ctestimony about her[self],\u201d we hold that the rationale of that case and this Court\u2019s interpretation of the plain language in Code \u00a7 20-124.3:1 still apply to this matter. In this case, the mental health therapist (Hall), who was hired by the mother and called to testify by the grandparents, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>necessarily testifying \u201con behalf of or against\u201d one or both of the parents or an adult relative of either parent (i.e., the grandparents), since they are all parties to this dispute. Moreover, a portion of the guardian <em>ad litem\u2019s </em>proffer\u2014that the therapist would testify as to \u201cimpressions about [the] child and statements that may have been made by the parent\u201d\u2014 suggests that some of Hall\u2019s testimony would, in fact, directly relate to a parent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Here, the trial court did not err in its interpretation of the statute and its subsequent ruling on the motion <em>in limine. </em>In fact, the trial judge, in articulating his decision, quoted verbatim the language of the statute that compels his holding. The trial court noted that grandparents offered Hall\u2019s testimony, and that fact made it likely that the substance of the testimony would be adverse to mother\u2019s position in the case. Thus, we hold the trial court did not err in restricting Hall\u2019s testimony; both our decision in <em>Schwartz </em>and the plain meaning of Code \u00a7 20-124.3:1 compel this result.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Questions 2 and 3, as phrased by appellants, are: 2) did the trial court abuse its discretion \u201cin not ordering visitation [by the grandparents with their grandchild] to be in the best interest of the child\u201d; and 3) did the trial court err in its \u201capplication of the best interests [of the child] standard in denying appellants\u2019 petition for visitation.\u201d Both questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>present substantially the same issue. Thus, we address the two together, noting specific arguments that appellants make within each.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">i.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">For purposes of this section, we assume without deciding that the trial court applied the proper legal standard, the best interests of the child. Code \u00a7 20-124.3 lists ten factors that a trial court \u201cshall consider\u201d when \u201cdetermining best interests of a child for purposes of determining custody or visitation arrangements.\u201d \u201cAlthough the trial court must examine all factors set out in Code \u00a7 20-124.3, \u2018it is not required to quantify or elaborate exactly what weight or consideration it has given to each of the statutory factors.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brown v. Brown, </em>30 Va.App. 532, 538, 518 S.E.2d 336, 338 (1999) (quoting <em>Sargent v. Sargent, </em>20 Va.App. 694, 702, 460 S.E.2d 596, 599 (1995)) (additional citation omitted). \u201cAs long as evidence in the record supports the trial court\u2019s ruling and the trial court has not abused its discretion, its ruling must be affirmed on appeal.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">\u201cWhere, as here, a court hears evidence <em>ore tenus, </em>its findings are entitled to the weight of a jury verdict, and they will not be disturbed on appeal unless plainly wrong or \u2022without evidence to support them.\u201d <em>Gray v. Gray, </em>228 Va. 696, 699, 324 S.E.2d 677, 678 (1985). <em>See also Denise v. Tencer, </em>46 Va.App. 372, 397, 617 S.E.2d 413, 426 (2005). Moreover, it is well established that \u201c[o]n appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, granting that party the benefit of any reasonable inferences.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">In reaching a decision in this matter, the trial court specifically discussed his evaluation of the experts\u2019 testimony. For example, the judge found Dr. Hagan \u201chelpful,\u201d while noting that Mr. Wilhelm \u201cseemed not to know a lot.\u201d Such an evaluation rests solely with the trial judge, as \u201cthe credibility of witnesses and the weight to be accorded their testimony is a matter exclusively within the province of the trier of fact.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number><em>Yopp v. Hodges, </em>43 Va.App. 427, 439, 598 S.E.2d 760, 766 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Here, the trial court properly considered the Code \u00a7 20-124.3 factors and the evidence presented in the case. Taken in the light most favorable to mother (the party who prevailed in the trial court), and as the trial court found, there exists \u201csome evidence that, after ... visitation, there is some exacerbation in the child\u2019s problem behavior.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Consequently, the trial court determined that giving \u201cthe mother ... the right to make the decision about how things are handled with this child\u201d was in the best interests of the child because \u201ceverybody, including the guardian <em>[ad litem], </em>says the child is suffering at this time and has problems and difficulties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">We cannot say this ruling by the trial court was plainly wrong or without evidentiary support. Accordingly, and given our standard of review on this issue, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion, and we, therefore, affirm its denial of appellants\u2019 petition for visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">n.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">On brief, grandparents also argue that the trial court \u201cplace[d] too much weight, in consideration of Dr. Hagan\u2019s opinions and findings\u201d and moreover, that Hagan\u2019s \u201ctestimony should have been excluded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">After a lengthy discussion on brief about the admissibility of expert testimony, appellants clarify that argument as follows: \u201cDr. Hagan\u2019s testimony should have been excluded by the court because his opinions were founded on assumptions that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>have an insufficient factual basis and because he failed to consider all the variables that could influence his opinion.\u201d In addressing that claim, we again note \u201c \u2018that the trier of fact ascertains [an expert] witness\u2019 credibility, determines the weight to be given to their testimony, and has the discretion to accept or reject any of the witness\u2019 testimony.\u2019 \u201d <em>Piatt v. Piatt, </em>27 Va.App. 426, 435, 499 S.E.2d 567, 571 (1998) (quoting <em>Street v. Street, </em>25 Va.App. 380, 387, 488 S.E.2d 665, 668 (1997) <em>(en </em>banc) (additional citation omitted)). Thus, to the extent that appellants argue the trial court improperly weighed Dr. Hagan\u2019s testimony, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Mother maintains on cross-appeal that the trial court erred by applying the best interests of the child standard rather than the actual harm standard articulated in <em>Williams </em>and <em>Griffin. </em>However, our holding above renders a decision on that issue unnecessary because the trial court denied appellants\u2019 petition under the more lenient of the two standards. Thus, even if this Court were to determine the trial court erred by not first finding actual harm, the result in this case would not be different.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Mother, nonetheless, asks this Court to address the issue and hold any error, if found, harmless. We decline the invitation to do so, in accordance with this Court\u2019s longstanding reluctance to issue an advisory opinion. <em>See Logan v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 168, 171 n. 3, 622 S.E.2d 771, 773 n. 3 (2005) <em>(en </em>banc) (noting \u201cour reluctance to issue what amounts to an \u2018advisory opinion\u2019 on an inessential subject\u201d (quoting <em>Craddock v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 539, 551 n. 1, 580 S.E.2d 454, 461 n. 1 (2003))).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">ATTORNEYS\u2019 FEES</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">Both parties request an award of attorneys\u2019 fees. As we held in <em>O\u2019Loughlin v. O\u2019Loughlin, </em>23 Va.App. 690, 695, 479 S.E.2d 98, 100 (1996):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>The rationale for the appellate court being the proper forum to determine the propriety of an award of attorney\u2019s fees for efforts expended on appeal is clear. The appellate court has the opportunity to view the record in its entirety and determine whether the appeal is frivolous or whether other reasons exist for requiring additional payment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Here, we find no reason to award either party attorneys\u2019 fees under this standard and accordingly deny each party\u2019s request for the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed. Each party remains responsible for its attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b246-8\">. In his response to the motion <em>in limine, </em>the guardian <em>ad litem </em>argues, \u201cMs. Hall\u2019s opinions, impressions, statements regarding sessions and information relating to discussions with the respondent, Ms. Cromer, address the subject matter that is before the Court....\u201d This representation leads us to conclude that at least part of Hall\u2019s testimony would recount conversations that the mother had wished to remain confidential.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b246-9\">. Code \u00a7 20-124.3:l(B) also provides that \"the court may order a licensed mental health care provider to testify on matters specifically related and limited to suspicion of an abused or neglected child as defined in \u00a7 63.2-100 of the Code of Virginia.\u201d Neither party argued, at trial or on appeal, that this provision of the statute applies to the facts of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b248-9\">. We note that the record certainly does not establish that the grandparents were the cause of the child\u2019s masturbation. Indeed, the trial judge favorably commented upon the grandparents\u2019 child-rearing abilities and noted that the grandparents have cooperated in the mother\u2019s efforts to seek counseling for the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">We further note that the trial judge\u2019s decision in this case was made in the light of a finding in an administrative proceeding that the father, who had lived in the grandparents\u2019 residence, had sexually abused the child. That finding is the subject of an appeal to this Court in a separate proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b250-10\">CLEMENTS, J., concurring, in part, and dissenting, in part.</author>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">I concur with sections 11(B), 11(C), and III of the majority opinion. I disagree, however, with the majority\u2019s conclusion in section 11(A) that \u201cour decision in <em>Schwartz [v. Schwartz, </em>46 Va.App. 145, 616 S.E.2d 59 (2005),] and the plain meaning of Code \u00a7 20-124.3:1 compel\u201d us to affirm the trial court\u2019s decision not to permit the paternal grandparents and the guardian <em>ad litem </em>for the child to elicit testimony from Wendy Hall, the child\u2019s former therapist, regarding her observations and impressions of the child during therapy. Indeed, for the reasons that follow, I would hold that the trial court misconstrued Code \u00a7 20-124.3:1 and <em>Schwartz </em>and improperly limited Hall\u2019s testimony as a result. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from section 11(A) of the majority\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-12\">Code \u00a7 20-124.3:1 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-13\">A. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any case in which custody or visitation of a minor child is at issue pursuant to \u00a7 20-124.2, whether in a circuit or district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>court, the records concerning a parent, kept by any licensed mental health care provider and any information obtained during or from therapy shall be privileged and confidential.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">B. In any case in which custody or visitation of a minor child is at issue pursuant to \u00a7 20-124.2, whether in a circuit or district court, a mental health care provider licensed in the Commonwealth may not be required to testify on behalf of or against a parent or any of the parent\u2019s adult relatives, and may do so only with the advance written consent of the parent. If the mental health care provider testifies, such testimony shall be limited to the custody or visitation case in question, and the provider\u2019s records and notes regarding that parent shall be admissible in the court proceeding. However, the court may order a licensed mental health care provider to testify on matters specifically related and limited to suspicion of an abused or neglected child as defined in \u00a7 63.2-100 of the Code of Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">C. Nothing in this section shall supercede the provisions of \u00a7 63.2-1509 of the Code of Virginia related to the required reporting of suspicion of an abused or neglected child.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">D. This section shall not apply to mental health care providers who have conducted or are conducting an independent mental health evaluation pursuant to a court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">The parties agree that, because neither parent consented to Hall\u2019s testimony, Code \u00a7 20-124.3:l(B) applies to limit the admission of Hall\u2019s testimony in this case. They disagree, however, as to the extent of that limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">Mother contends Code \u00a7 20-124.3:l(B) precludes the admission of all of Hall\u2019s testimony. Hall\u2019s testimony, mother asserts, was offered by the grandparents and was thus \u201cintended to be favorable to [their] position.\u201d As such, mother argues, it was necessarily \u201cin derogation or against\u201d her \u201cand her opposition to grandparent visitation.\u201d Mother concludes that, because the entirety of the testimony was \u201cagainst\u201d her, the statute completely bars its admission. This interpretation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>mother asserts, is required by this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Schwartz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">Joined by the child\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem, </em>the grandparents contend Code \u00a7 20-124.3:l(B) was not intended to completely prohibit all of Hall\u2019s testimony, but only that testimony that was specifically about mother or father or their adult relatives. They argue that \u201cnothing in the language of ... Code \u00a7 20-124.3:1 or this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Schwartz </em>bars\u201d Hall\u2019s testimony about the child herself. Thus, they conclude, \u201cthe trial court should have heard ... Hall\u2019s testimony regarding her impressions and observations of [the child].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">\u201cThe admissibility of evidence is within the broad discretion of the trial court, and a ruling will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>James v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 746, 753, 446 S.E.2d 900, 904 (1994). \u201cBy definition, when the trial court makes an error of law, an abuse of discretion occurs.\u201d <em>Bass v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 373, 382, 523 S.E.2d 534, 539 (2000). The issue as to what extent Code \u00a7 20-124.3:l(B) precludes the admission of Hall\u2019s testimony in this case presents a question of law, which is to be reviewed <em>de novo. See Boynton v. Kilgore, </em>271 Va. 220, 227, 623 S.E.2d 922, 925 (2006) (holding that, \u201c[b]ecause statutory interpretation presents a pure question of law, it is subject to de novo review\u201d on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">In interpreting a statute, we endeavor \u201c \u2018to search out and follow the true intent of the legislature, and to adopt that sense of the words which harmonizes best with the context, and promotes in the fullest manner the apparent policy and objects of the legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Colbert v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 390, 394, 624 S.E.2d 108, 110 (2006) (quoting <em>Jones v. Rhea, </em>130 Va. 345, 372, 107 S.E. 814, 823 (1921)). Additionally, \u201cwe have a duty, whenever possible, \u2018to interpret the several parts of a statute as a consistent and harmonious whole so as to effectuate the legislative goal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Oraee v. Breeding, </em>270 Va. 488, 498, 621 S.E.2d 48, 52 (2005) (quoting <em>Virginia Elec. &amp; Power Co. v. Bd. of County Supervisors, </em>226 Va. 382, 387-88, 309 S.E.2d 308, 311 (1983)). In doing so, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>\u201c \u2018look to the whole body of [a statute] to determine the true intention of each part.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration in original) (quoting <em>McDaniel v. Commonwealth, </em>199 Va. 287, 292, 99 S.E.2d 623, 627 (1957)).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Moreover, \u201cwhile legislative intent \u2018must be gathered from the words used, ... unreasonable or absurd results must not be reached by too strict adherence to literal interpretation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Colbert, </em>47 Va.App. at 395, 624 S.E.2d at 110 (quoting <em>Buzzard v. Commonwealth, </em>134 Va. 641, 653, 114 S.E. 664, 667 (1922)). Thus, \u201c[a] provision of a section of a statute ought not to receive a mere literal interpretation, when it would contravene the intention of the [legislature apparent from the other sections and provisions thereof, but the words are to be expanded or qualified to effectuate the intention.\u201d <em>Tabb v. Commonwealth, </em>98 Va. 47, 56, 34 S.E. 946, 949 (1900), <em>cited with approval in Pound v. Dep\u2019t of Game and Inland Fisheries, </em>40 Va.App. 59, 68, 577 S.E.2d 533, 537 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Here, mother essentially asks this Court to assign a literal interpretation to the term \u201con behalf of or against\u201d in Code \u00a7 20-124.3:l(B) and, in so doing, set out a per se rule prohibiting the admission in a custody or visitation proceeding of all testimony by a mental health care provider engaged to counsel a child, unless the child\u2019s parents give their advance written consent to such testimony. She argues that such testimony, by virtue of the fact that it is being offered at such a proceeding, necessarily has to be either \u201con behalf of or against a parent or any of the parent\u2019s adult relatives\u201d and is thus specifically prohibited under Code \u00a7 20-124.3:l(B). I am of the opinion that, when the statute\u2019s subsections and provisions are read together, Code \u00a7 20-124.3:l(B) prohibits a mental health care provider who has been engaged to counsel a child from testifying about the child\u2019s parents and their adult relatives, but not from testifying about the child him-or herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Although not a model of legislative clarity, Code \u00a7 20-124.3:1 was clearly intended, in the context of cases like this, to protect and promote the rights and interests of Virginia\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>children by making sure those children who need mental health therapy are not deprived by their parents of the benefits of such therapy out of fear that information about the parents revealed during therapy could be used against them in a custody or visitation proceeding.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To that end, Code \u00a7 20-124.3:1(A) provides that the therapist\u2019s \u201crecords concerning a parent\u201d are \u201cprivileged and confidential.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-124.3:1(B) provides that, if the therapist is allowed to testify, his or her \u201crecords and notes regarding that parent\u201d may be admitted into evidence. Neither section of the statute makes any reference to the therapist\u2019s notes, records, or information regarding the child. Moreover, Code \u00a7 20-124.3:l(B) creates a specific exception to the statute\u2019s prohibition against evidence from the mental health therapist regarding the parents when that evidence is \u201crelated ... to suspicion of an abused or neglected child.\u201d This statutory language illustrates the legislature\u2019s intent that the statute apply to bar testimony by the child\u2019s therapist about the child\u2019s parents and the parents\u2019 adult relatives, but not about the child. Clearly, testimony by the child\u2019s therapist about the child would not have the same potential chilling effect on the parents\u2019 willingness to obtain and participate in therapy for the child as such testimony about the parents would.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Here, the child\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem </em>proffered the testimony that he and the grandparents would have elicited from Hall, the child\u2019s former therapist, had she been permitted to testify. In relevant part, Hall would have testified regarding her observation of the child\u2019s behavioral problem and the therapeutic process employed to treat that problem. Hall would have further testified that, \u201cover the term of therapy[, the child] had stabilized quite a bit,\u201d having achieved \u201c75% prog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>ress on all [therapeutic] goals.\u201d In addition, Hall would have testified that, \u201cat the time of the last [session,] no clinical criteria evidenced any severe difficulty\u201d and that \u201cprogress was made\u201d on the child\u2019s ability to identify and express her feelings regarding the past abuse she had suffered and its effect on her life. This testimony relating to the child\u2019s diagnosis and treatment and the therapist\u2019s impressions and observations of the child\u2019s therapy was strictly about the child and would not have included statements about the parents or their adult relatives.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Conversely, the testimony at issue in <em>Schwartz </em>was strictly about a parent. In that case, the children\u2019s court-appointed mental health therapist testified at the contempt proceeding that the children reported in their sessions that the children\u2019s mother denigrated the children\u2019s father in their presence at home. <em>Schwartz, </em>46 Va.App. at 149-50, 616 S.E.2d at 62. The therapist further testified that the mother denigrated the father in the presence of the children during joint therapy sessions with the children and the mother. <em>Id. </em>at 150, 616 S.E.2d at 62. Relying on that testimony, the trial court found the mother had violated the parties\u2019 consent order prohibiting such behavior. <em>Id. </em>at 150-51, 616 S.E.2d at 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">On appeal in <em>Schwartz, </em>the mother claimed the trial court erred under Code \u00a7 20-124.3:l(B) by permitting the father to offer the therapist\u2019s \u201ctestimony <em>about her.\u201d Id. </em>at 155, 616 S.E.2d at 64 (emphasis added). The father contended the statute applied \u201conly when the parent is the patient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rejecting the father\u2019s claim that \u201cthe parent must have been a patient in order to invoke the privilege,\u201d we held that the contempt proceeding was part of a \u201clarger suit ... [that] included custody and visitation\u201d and that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s admission of [the therapist\u2019s] testimony <em>about mother, </em>given without her written consent and over her express objection, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>was error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 155 n. 3, 158, 616 S.E.2d at 64 n. 3, 66 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">It is clear, therefore, notwithstanding mother\u2019s assertion to the contrary, that our decision in <em>Schwartz </em>is not inconsistent with the conclusion that Code \u00a7 20-124.3:l(B) prohibits the admission of testimony by a mental health therapist that is specifically about the parents or their adult relatives, but not testimony that is about the child. Accordingly, because the testimony at issue in this case, unlike in <em>Schwartz, </em>is about the child, and not the child\u2019s parents or their adult relatives, I would hold that its admission was not prohibited by Code \u00a7 20-124.3:l(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">To hold otherwise would result in the unreasonable and absurd situation that occurred in this case. As noted by the majority, the grandparents and the child\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem, </em>called as witnesses at the visitation proceeding on October 25, 2005, two mental health care providers who had evaluated the child. One was Hall, the child\u2019s former therapist who counseled the child from December 2003 until July 2005. All but a small portion of her testimony was excluded under Code \u00a7 20-124.3:1.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The other mental health care provider was Don Wilhelm, a licensed clinical social worker who performed a one-time assessment of the child pursuant to a court order in September 2004. As mother points out in her brief, that assessment consisted of Wilhelm observing the child with the grandparents for approximately twenty minutes. Wilhelm testified that the child did not exhibit \u201cexcessive anxiety\u201d or \u201cattempt[ ] to present a false sense of self\u2019 during that period of observation. In denying the grandparents\u2019 petition for visitation with the child, the trial judge commented that he \u201cwas not impressed with Mr. Wilhelm.\u201d Such a situation\u2014 where the court-appointed evaluator was permitted to testify about the child under Code \u00a7 20-124.3:1 but the child\u2019s longtime therapist was not\u2014reflects an interpretation of the stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>ute that, in my view, does not comport with the statute\u2019s overall remedial objective of protecting and promoting the rights and interests of children. Likewise it has the undesirable effect of hampering the court\u2019s ability, in matters of child custody and visitation, to determine and further the child\u2019s best interests. <em>See generally Kogon v. Ulerick, </em>12 Va.App. 595, 596, 405 S.E.2d 441, 442 (1991) (\u201cIn matters concerning custody and visitation, the welfare and best interests of the child are the \u2018primary, paramount, and controlling consideration[s].\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Mullen v. Mullen, </em>188 Va. 259, 269, 49 S.E.2d 349, 354 (1948))); <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Gray v. Johnson, </em>7 Va.App. 614, 617-18, 376 S.E.2d 787, 788 (1989) (\u201cThe strong public policy of this Commonwealth posits that the paramount concern where children are concerned are their best interests.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">For these reasons, I would reverse the trial court\u2019s decision excluding Hall\u2019s testimony about the child and remand for reconsideration.</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b254-6\">. Plainly, the statute was also enacted to allow parents with mental health concerns to obtain therapy from a mental health care provider without fear that the information learned about them during therapy would be used against them in a custody or visitation proceeding. The statute also protects parents in visitation or custody proceedings from having to defend themselves against claims made about them during therapy by their children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b255-7\">.
