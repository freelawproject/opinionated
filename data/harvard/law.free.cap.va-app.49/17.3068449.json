ARTHUR KELSEY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">On appeal, Albert Tynes argues that his convictions for robbery, abduction, and felonious use of a firearm should be vacated and the case retried because the trial court erroneously restricted his cross-examination of a prosecution witness. Finding Tynes\u2019s proffers of the rejected testimony inadequate to demonstrate error, much less prejudicial error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">At Tynes\u2019s bench trial, the Commonwealth presented evidence that Tynes and two others robbed Quentin Matthews and Jeffrey Scott at gunpoint. In his cross-examination of Scott, Tynes\u2019s counsel asked: \u201cAs you were walking with Mr. Matthews ... just before this incident were you discussing with him your plans for the evening?\u201d &lt;rWe already knew what our plans was,\u201d Scott answered. Counsel continued: \u201cYeah, but you were talking back and forth; were you not?\u201d At that point, the prosecutor objected on relevance and hearsay grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">The trial court sustained the objection and invited Tynes\u2019s counsel to make a proffer for the record. Tynes\u2019s counsel stated that he wanted \u201cto explore this line of questioning\u201d and intended \u201cto show through other evidence that [Scott] had gone down there, he had made statements to others that he was going to hang for awhile, that he was going to get a cab home later and that he had a little bit on him.\u201d This evidence, counsel suggested, would corroborate Tynes\u2019s claim that the incident involved a disputed drug transaction, not a robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">After hearing the proffer, the trial court stated counsel could \u201cask the witness if he had any illegal contraband or substance on him at the time that he was robbed.\u201d Instead of asking this question, however, Tynes\u2019s counsel sought leave to ask whether Scott found \u201cdrug paraphernalia\u201d when he went \u201cback to the scene\u201d after the alleged robbery. The trial court refused that question, finding it irrelevant \u201cwhat happened later on after the alleged robbery, what may or may not have been found.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>In response to this ruling, Tynes\u2019s counsel proffered that \u201ccontraband was found among the personal effects and also found at the scene of the incident.\u201d The trial court noted, \u2018You have your objection on the record. Next question.\u201d At that point, counsel abandoned any further cross-examination of Scott with the statement, \u201cI have no further questions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">\u201cGiven the \u2018broad discretion\u2019 of a trial judge over evidentiary matters, we apply a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard of appellate review.\u201d <em>Seaton v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 739, 752, 595 S.E.2d 9, 15 (2004) (citation omitted). The abuse-of-discretion standard, \u201cif nothing else, means that the trial judge\u2019s \u2018ruling will not be reversed simply because an appellate court disagrees.\u2019\u201d <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 741, 753, 607 S.E.2d 738, 743 (quoting Henry J. Friendly, <em>Indiscretion About Discretion, </em>31 Emory L.J. 747, 754 (1982)), <em>adopted upon reh\u2019g en banc, </em>45 Va.App. 811, 613 S.E.2d 870 (2005). \u201cOnly when reasonable jurists could not differ can we say an abuse of discretion has occurred.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">When an appellant claims a trial court abused its discretion in excluding evidence, we cannot competently determine error\u2014much less reversible error\u2014without \u201ca proper showing of what that testimony would have been.\u201d <em>Holles v. Sunrise Terrace, Inc., </em>257 Va. 131, 135, 509 S.E.2d 494, 497 (1999). Such a proffer allows us to examine both the \u201cadmissibility of the proposed testimony,\u201d and whether, even if admissible, its exclusion \u201cprejudiced\u201d the proffering party. <em>Molina v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 338, 368, 624 S.E.2d 83, 97 (2006) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">We can perform this examination only when the proponent proffers the \u201ctestimony he expected to elicit,\u201d <em>Clagett v. Commonwealth, </em>252 Va. 79, 95, 472 S.E.2d 263, 272 (1996), rather than merely his theory of the case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cThe failure to proffer the <em>expected testimony </em>is fatal to his claim on appeal.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number><em>Molina, </em>47 Va.App. at 367-68, 624 S.E.2d at 97 (emphasis added). To be sure, even when \u201cwe are not totally in the dark concerning the nature of the evidence,\u201d we still must \u201cknow enough about the specifics\u201d to be able to \u201csay with assurance\u201d that the lower court committed prejudicial error. <em>Smith v. Hylton, </em>14 Va.App. 354, 358, 416 S.E.2d 712, 715 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">In this case, Tynes argues that the trial court committed prejudicial error by disallowing two questions he wanted to ask Scott during cross-examination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because we cannot \u201cspeculate what the answer might have been to these questions,\u201d <em>O\u2019Dell v. Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 672, 697, 364 S.E.2d 491, 505 (1988), we look solely to the proffers made by Tynes in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">(a) <em>The Disallowed \u201cBack and Forth\u201d Question</em></p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">The first disallowed question asked Scott whether he and Matthews talked \u201cback and forth\u201d about their plans. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Counsel never proffered what Scott\u2019s likely response to this question would have been. Nor did counsel explain how a statement made in a conversation between Scott and Matthews (prior to the alleged robbery) would have survived the prosecutor\u2019s relevance and hearsay objections. Instead, counsel said only that he wanted to \u201cexplore\u201d the subject with Scott because \u201cother evidence\u201d would show Scott had \u201ca little bit on him\u201d and planned to participate in some sort of a drug deal. In other words, rather than disclosing what Scott\u2019s \u201ctestimony would have been\u201d on this subject, <em>Lockhart v. Commonwealth, </em>34 Va.App. 329, 340, 542 S.E.2d 1, 6 (2001), counsel merely repeated his theory of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Consequently, we have no way of knowing whether Scott\u2019s answer to the disallowed \u201cback and forth\u201d question would have been admissible\u2014thus rendering its exclusion error. All the more, the inadequacy of Tynes\u2019s proffer precludes us from knowing whether any such alleged error would be considered prejudicial under harmless error principles.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> What we do know is that the trial court permitted Scott to be asked whether \u201che had any illegal contraband or substance on him at the time that he was robbed.\u201d Tynes\u2019s counsel, however, never followed up with this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">(b) <em>The \u201cDrug Paraphernalia\u201d Question</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">The second disallowed question would have asked Scott if he saw \u201cdrug paraphernalia\u201d at the scene after the alleged robbery incident. The trial court ruled that \u201cwhat happened later\u201d (after the robbery) was not relevant. The court had already ruled Scott could be questioned about possessing drugs at the time of the robbery\u2014but Tynes never asked that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>question. Instead, counsel relied solely on his general proffer that \u201ccontraband was found among the personal effects and also found at the scene of the incident.\u201d Counsel did not say Scott would have testified to this fact. Nor did counsel suggest how the disallowed question (drug paraphernalia found by Scott after the alleged robbery) would have elicited testimony materially different from the allowed question (Scott\u2019s possession of drugs during the alleged robbery).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">At oral argument on appeal, Tynes\u2019s counsel added to his proffer by suggesting that Scott\u2019s likely testimony would have been that <em>Matthews </em>possessed drug paraphernalia at the time of the robbery which fell to the ground during a fight over a disputed drug transaction. Counsel admitted he did not give this specific proffer at trial, but contended he could not do so because the trial judge abruptly \u201ccut off\u2019 the discussion. The record, however, suggests only that the trial judge acknowledged the objection and instructed counsel to ask the next question. Because \u201cthe record does not reflect that any proffer was refused,\u201d <em>Kemph v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 335, 342, 437 S.E.2d 210, 214 (1993), counsel was not relieved of his obligation to make one.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">In sum, Tynes failed to make an adequate proffer in support of the two questions disallowed by the trial court and failed to ask the one question (equally consistent with his theory of the case) specifically allowed by the trial court. For these reasons, Tynes has shown no basis to support his assertion that the trial court abused its discretion in making these evidentiary rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b67-9\">. This specificity principle\u2014requiring the proffer to show what the \"testimony would have been\u201d\u2014has been a settled feature of appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>practice in Virginia. <em>Lockhart v.
