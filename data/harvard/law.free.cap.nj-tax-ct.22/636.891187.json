Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>21 <em>N.J. Tax </em>200, 203 (Tax 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Defendant, Director of the Division of Taxation, appeals from an order of January 9, 2004, entering judgment for plaintiff taxpayer \u201csince it does not have a taxable nexus in the State which would subject it to New Jersey\u2019s Corporate Business Tax.\u201d Plaintiff, which licenses intellectual property (trademarks, trade names and service marks) to Lane Bryant, a clothing retailer, has no real or personal property or personnel in the State, and the Tax Court, in a published opinion, held that because plaintiff was not physically present in New Jersey, subjecting it to the tax would violate the Commerce Clause of the federal constitution. <em>Lanco, supra, </em>21 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 214. On this appeal the Director argues that Lanco derived receipts from sources in the State, thereby making it subject to the tax, and that \u201cthere are no constitutional impediments to application of the corporation business tax to plaintiff given its substantial nexus to New Jersey\u201d because there was no violation of the due process clause (which is not contested before us)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or the Commerce Clause (which is the critical issue contested on the appeal). Thus, the critical issue is whether the taxpayer must have a physical presence in the state in order to constitute the required \u201csubstantial nexus\u201d necessary to satisfy the Commerce Clause under <em>Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, </em>504 <em>U.S. </em>298, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>1904, 119 L.Ed.2d 91 (1992), which applied that test and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>held physical presence was necessary in the context of a sales and use tax.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-6\">The Tax Court succinctly stated the relevant facts as follows: Plaintiff Lanco, Inc., (\u201cLanco\u201d) is a Delaware corporation that owns certain intangible property (trademarks, trade names and service marks). The parties have stipulated that Lanco has no offices, employees, or real or tangible property in New Jersey. Lanco licenses Lane Bryant, Inc., (\u201cLane Bryant\u201d) to utilize the intangible property in the conduct of Lane Bryant\u2019s retail operations, including those in New Jersey, and in return receives royalty payments from Lane Bryant. Lanco and Lane Bryant are affiliated corporations, but the common ownership is not material to the constitutional issue concerning the determination by the defendant, Director of the Division of Taxation (\u201cDirector\u201d), that activity under the license agreement makes Lanco subject to taxation in New Jersey. It is the determination that Lanco is obliged to file under the CBT, rather than the calculation of tax claimed to be due, that is contested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-7\"><em>[Lanco, supra, </em>21 <em>N.J. Tax </em>at 203 (footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">In <em>Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, </em>504 <em>U.S. </em>298, 301, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>1904, 1907, 119 L.Ed.2d 91, 99 (1992), the State of North Dakota sought to impose a duty to collect a use tax on \u201can out-of-state mail-order house that ha[d] neither outlets nor sales representatives in the State.\u201d Quill sold office furniture by mail order catalogue and advertising, and delivered it by mail or common carrier. The Court held that, while the Due Process Clause \u201cminimum contacts\u201d jurisprudence did not bar the state from requiring Quill, as the seller, to collect a use tax, there was an insufficient nexus under the Commerce Clause to permit such a tax. <em>Quill, supra, </em>504 <em>U.S. </em>at 313, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1913-14, 119 L.Ed.2d at 101. According to Justice Stevens, \u201c[t]he two standards are animated by different constitutional concerns and policies\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-9\">Due process centrally concerns the fundamental fairness of governmental activity. Thus, at the most general level, the due process nexus analysis requires that we ask whether an individual\u2019s connections with a State are substantial enough to legitimate the State\u2019s exercise of power over him. We have, therefore, often identified \u201cnotice\u201d or \u201cfair warning\u201d as the analytic touchstone of due process nexus analysis. In contrast, the Commerce Clause and its nexus requirement are informed not so much by concerns about fairness for the individual defendant as by structural concerns about the effects of state regulation on the national economy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ5k\"><em>[Quill, supra, </em>504 <em>U.S. </em>at 312, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1913, 119 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 106.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">The Court discussed the four factors it first enunciated in <em>Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, </em>430 <em>U.S. </em>274, 279, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>1076, 1079, 51 L.Ed.2d 326, 331 (1977), to determine whether a state tax will withstand a commerce clause challenge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-5\">Under <em>Complete </em>Auto\u2019s four-part test, we will sustain a tax against a Commerce Clause challenge so long as the \u201ctax [1] is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State, [2] is fairly apportioned, [3] does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and [4] is fairly related to the services provided by the State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-6\"><em>[Quill, supra, </em>504 <em>U.S. </em>at 811, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1912, 119 L.Ed.2d at 105.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">In discussing the four factors the <em>Quill </em>Court explained that \u201c[t]he second and third parts of that analysis, which require fair apportionment and non-discrimination, prohibit taxes that pass an unfair share of the tax burden onto interstate commerce.\u201d <em>Quill, supra, </em>504 <em>U.S. </em>at 313, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1913, 119 L.Ed.2d at 107. \u201cThe first and fourth prongs, which require a substantial nexus and a relationship between the tax and state-provided services, limit the reach of state taxing authority so as to ensure that state taxation does not unduly burden interstate commerce.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-8\">Thus, the \u201csubstantial nexus\u201d requirement is not, like due process\u2019 \u201cminimum contacts\u201d requirement, a proxy for notice, but rather a means for limiting state burdens on interstate commerce. Accordingly, ... a corporation may have the \u201cminimum contacts\u201d with a taxing State as required by the Due Process Clause, and yet lack the \u201csubstantial nexus\u201d with that State as required by the Commerce Clause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-9\"><em>[Quill, supra, </em>504 <em>U.S. </em>at 313, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1913-14, 119 L.Ed.2d at 107 (footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">Accordingly, for purposes of the Commerce Clause, the <em>Quill </em>court maintained the \u201cbright-line, physical-presence requirement [established by <em>National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Department of Revenue of Ill., </em>386 <em>U.S. </em>753, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>1389, 18 <em>L.Ed.2 </em>d 505 (1967), for imposition] of sales and use taxes.\u201d <em>Quill, supra, </em>504 <em>U.S. </em>at 317, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1916, 119 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 110.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-11\">The Director argues that \u201cthe rationale for abandoning a physical-presence requirement for Due Process Clause purposes recognizes that businesses engage in significant levels of commercial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>activity in a state without ever \u2018setting foot\u2019 there,\u201d and businesses foresee being subject to state tax laws as a result of commercial activity directed at a particular state. The Director further contends that \u201c[tjhere is no principled reason why the Commerce Clause should require a corporation\u2019s physical presence to justify State taxation ... provided the State can establish that the corporation derives significant benefits from continued and deliberate economic activity in the taxing State.\u201d The Director also emphasizes that <em>Quill </em>involved vendors whose only connection with customers was by common carrier or the United States mail, but here there is a long-term contractual relationship with a related corporation that operates retail-clothing outlets throughout New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Defendant further asserts that the agreement between plaintiff and Lane Bryant \u201cpromotes increased retail purchases of merchandise\u201d at stores in New Jersey, and that \u201cgrowth in retail sales burdens [New Jersey] by increasing traffic, requiring police and fire protection, and imposing demands on the labor pool.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant therefore argues that this case is distinguishable from <em>Q'uill </em>and <em>Bellas Hess, </em>on which <em>Quill </em>relied, where they merely sent mail order catalogs into a state without obtaining the benefits and protection of state services and labor which derive from its physical presence. In this case, the Director maintains that plaintiff and its related entity, Lane Bryant, enjoy numerous benefits provided by New Jersey including: (1) \u201cprotection afforded by the New Jersey judiciary to [plaintiffs] rights under the licensing agreement and its right to protect its trademarks and service marks\u201d; (2) maintenance of New Jersey\u2019s highway system and production of an \u201ceducated workforce\u201d; and (3) \u201cpolice, fire and judicial protection\u201d of the physical property upon which Lanco\u2019s trademarks are used, even if owned by Lane Bryant.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>We agree with the Director that <em>Quill </em>does not apply to taxes other than sales and use taxes, <em>Quill, supra, </em>504 <em>U.S. </em>at 314, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1914, 119 L.Ed.2d at 108 (stating \u201c[w]e have not, in our review of other types of taxes, articulated the same physical-presence requirement that <em>Bellas Hess </em>established for sales and use taxes____\u201d), and that the Corporation Business Tax may be constitutionally applied to impose a tax on plaintiffs income from licensing fees attributable to New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">In <em>Geoffrey Inc. v. South Carolina Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>313 <em>S.C. </em>15, 437 S.E.2d 13, 18, <em>cert. denied, </em>510 <em>U.S. </em>992, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>550, 126 L.Ed.2d 451 (1993), the Supreme Court of South Carolina noted the distinction between the taxes involved in <em>Quill </em>and income taxes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-8\">It is well settled that the taxpayer need not have a tangible, physical presence in a state for income to be taxable there. The presence of intangible property alone is sufficient to establish nexus. <em>Amerian Dairy Queen[ v. Tax. Rev.

Hellerstein, supra, </em>at 6.08 (any corporation that regularly exploits the markets of a state should be subject to its jurisdiction to impose an income tax even though not physically present). A taxpayer who is domiciled in one state but carries on business in another is subject to taxation measured by the value of the intangibles used in his business. <em>Curry[ v.

This is particularly true because, as the Tax Court stated, \u201cthe CBT statute is clearly intended to reach foreign corporations engaged in business activities within the state to the full extent that is constitutionally permissible.\u201d <em>Lanco, supra, </em>21 <em>N.J.

Like the plaintiffs in the case before us, the North Carolina taxpayers were related to a clothing retailer with stores in North Carolina and contended \u201cthat the presence of their intangible property in North Carolina [as a result of license fees paid for use of trademarks] is irrelevant in light of the lack of physical presence of offices, facilities, employees and real or tangible property,\u201d and that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Bellas Hess </em>required a finding that the tax sought to be imposed by North Carolina violated the Commerce Clause. <em>Id. </em>at 193. Specifically, the taxpayers asserted that \u201cthey did not have a substantial nexus with North Carolina because they have no physical presence in [the] State.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">The North Carolina Court of Appeals rejected the argument because \u201c[b]oth <em>Bellas Hess </em>and <em>Quill </em>involved attempts by a state to require out-of-state mail-order vendors to collect and pay use taxes on goods purchased within the state despite the fact that the vendors had no outlets or sales representatives in the state.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number><em>Ibid. </em>According to the North Carolina Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bellas Hess, </em>\u201c \u2018stands for the proposition that a vendor whose only contacts with the taxing State are by mail or common carrier lacks the \u2018substantial nexus\u2019 required by the Commerce Clause\u2019 \u201d to support the tax, <em>ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Quill, supra, </em>504 <em>U.S. </em>at 311, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1912, 119 L.Ed.2d at 106), and <em>Quill </em>ultimately concluded that, \u201cfor purposes of sales and use taxes assessed against vendors whose only contact with a state is by mail or common carrier, the substantial nexus prong of <em>Complete Auto </em>could appropriately be determined by a \u2018bright-line, physical presence requirement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 194, quoting <em>Quill, </em>504 <em>U.S. </em>at 317, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1916, 119 L.Ed.2d at 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">The North Carolina Court of Appeals stated three reasons for declining to adopt the broader reading of <em>Quill </em>as requiring a physical presence for income tax purposes. <em>Id. </em>at 194-95. \u201cFirst, the tone in the <em>Quill </em>opinion hardly indicates a sweeping endorsement of the bright-line test it preserved, and the Supreme Court\u2019s hesitancy to embrace the test certainly counsels against expansion of it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 194. This was because in its discussion of the Commerce Clause, the Supreme Court noted that \u201cwhile <em>Bellas Hess </em>did not conflict with recent Commerce Clause cases, \u2018contemporary Commerce Clause jurisprudence might not dictate the same result were the issue to arise for the first time today.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Quill, supra, </em>504 <em>U.S. </em>at 311, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1912, 119 L.Ed.2d at 105). Stated differently, \u201crecent Commerce Clause decisions ... signaled a \u2018retreat from the formalistic constrictions of a stringent physical presence test in favor of a more flexible substantive approach.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Quill, </em>504 <em>U.S. </em>at 314, 317, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1914, 1915, 119 L.Ed.2d at 107, 110). According to the North Carolina Court of Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-6\">The [United States Supreme] Court further observed the physical-presence test, though offset by the clarity of the rule, was \u201cartificial at its edges.\u201d <em>Quill, </em>504 <em>U.S. </em>at 315, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1914, 119 L.Ed.2d at 108. In addition, the Court twice noted that in other types of taxes, it had never articulated the same physical-presence requirement adopted in <em>Bellas Hess, </em>see <em>Quill, </em>504 <em>U.S. </em>at 314 and 317, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1914 and 1915, 119 <em>L.Ed. </em>2d at 108 and 110, but cautioned that the failure to expand the <em>Bellas Hess </em>rule established for sales and use taxes to other types of taxes did not imply that the <em>Bellas Hess </em>rule as applied to sales and use taxes was vestigial or disapproved. <em>Id. </em>Nonetheless, the Court\u2019s choice to abstain from rejecting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number><em>Bellas Hess </em>rule for sales and use taxes fails to argue persuasively that the rule should, for lack of rejection, be augmented to cover other types of tax. While the Supreme Court may ultimately choose to expand the scope of the physical-presence test reaffirmed in <em>Quill </em>beyond sales and use taxes, its equivocal reaffirmation of that test does not readily make that choice self-evident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-5\">[A <em>&amp; F Trademark, supra, </em>605 <em>S.E. </em>2d at 194.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">The North Carolina court in <em>A &amp; F Trademark </em>further stated that the retention of the <em>Bellas Hess </em>test in <em>Q'uill </em>was based on the principle of <em>stare decisis </em>and the \u201csubstantial reliance\u201d on the physical-presence test, which had \u201cbecome part of the basic framework of a sizable industry.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Quill, supra, </em>504 <em>U.S. </em>at 317, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1916, <em>119 L.Ed.2d </em>at 110). The North Carolina court concluded that it \u201cneed look no further than the language in <em>Quill </em>to summarily dispense with the possibility that <em>stare decisis </em>plays an analogous role\u201d in a case involving neither the use or sales tax because the Supreme Court had twice expressed that the bright-line, physical-presence requirement of <em>Bellas Hess </em>\u201chad not been adopted in other forms of taxation.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Furthermore, the court dismissed the possibility that analogous substantial reliance \u2014 as discussed in <em>Quill </em>\u2014 existed in the present case \u201csince the physical-presence requirement has never been established by judicial precedent for other forms of taxation,\u201d and the North Carolina form of taxation was relatively new. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">Finally, <em>A &amp; F Trademark </em>relied on Jerome R. Hellerstein, <em>Geoffrey and the Physical Presence Nexus Requirement of Qidll, </em>8 <em>State Tax Notes </em>671, 676 (1995), and found \u201cimportant distinctions between sales and use taxes [as compared to] income and franchise taxes \u2018that makes the physical presence test of the vendor use tax collection eases inappropriate as a nexus test\u2019 \u201d for taxation beyond the use and sales taxes. <em>A &amp; F Trademark, supra, </em>605 <em>S.E.2d </em>at 194-95. The court quoted the Hellerstein article to the effect that the \u201c \u2018[United States]\u2019 Supreme Court has made it clear that the presence of the recipient of income from intangible property in a state is not essential to the state\u2019s income tax on income of a nonresident.\u201d \u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 194-95 (quoting <em>Heller-stein, supra, </em>at 676).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>Thus, the North Carolina court <em>in A &amp; F Trademark </em>followed the determination in <em>Geoffrey, </em>which our Tax Court rejected, and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-6\">[W]e reject the contention that physical presence is the <em>sine qua non </em>of a state\u2019s jurisdiction to tax under the Commerce Clause for purposes of income and franchise taxes. Rather, we hold that under facts such as these where a wholly-owned subsidiary licenses trademarks to a related retail company operating stores located within North Carolina, there exists a substantial nexus with the State sufficient to satisfy the Commerce Clause. <em>Accord Geoffrey, </em>437 S.E.2d at 18 (holding that \u201cby licensing intangibles [to Toys \u2018R Us, an affiliated operating store,] for use in [South Carolina] and deriving income from them use [t]here, Geoffrey ha[d] a \u2018substantial nexus\u2019 with South Carolina\u201d); <em>Kmart [Properties, Inc. v. Taxation and Revenue Dep\u2019t of New Mexico, </em>No. 21, 140 at 13 (N.M.Ct.App. Nov. 27, 2001)] at 15 (holding that \u201cthe use of KPI\u2019s [the wholly-owned trademark holding company licensor] marks within New Mexico\u2019s economic market, for the purpose of generating substantial income for KPI, established] a sufficient nexus between that income and the legitimate interests of the state and justified] the imposition of a state income tax\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-7\"><em>[A&amp;F Trademark, supra, </em>605 S.E.2d at 195.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">Of particular interest, the court addressed this very ease and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-9\">We are also cognizant of the holding of the New Jersey Tax Court in a case involving one of the taxpayers before this Court on the same issue. <em>Lanco, Inc. v. Dir., Div. of Tax\u2019n., </em>21 <em>N.J. Tax </em>200 (2003). In that case, the New Jersey Tax Court concluded \u201cthat the physical presence of the taxpayer or its employee(s), agent(s), or tangible property in a jurisdiction has been and remains a necessary element for a finding of substantial nexus under the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>Id., </em>21 <em>N.J. Tax </em>at 214. We respectfully disagree. Summarizing the salient portions of that opinion, the New Jersey Tax Court (1) found it \u201cillogical\u201d to have a physical presence as a constitutional necessity for sales and use taxes but not for income tax, (2) opined physical presence, as a prerequisite to state taxation of income, was \u201cfully consistent with and strongly suggested by the Commerce Clause cases decided before <em>Quill\u201d </em>because the circumstances of those cases involved taxpayers who were physically present in the state attempting to impose the tax, and (3) stated \u201cother state court cases decided since <em>Quill </em>do not follow the <em>Geoffrey </em>rule.\u201d <em>Id., </em>21 <em>N.J. Tax </em>at 208-09.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-10\">Regarding the first reason given by the New Jersey Tax Court, the <em>Quill </em>opinion itself twice notes the singularity of its adoption and reaffirmation of the physical-presence test for Commerce Clause nexus in the arena of sales and use taxes. Moreover, as illustrated by our analysis herein, we disagree with the New Jersey Tax Court that there do not exist certain distinctions between the tax at issue in <em>Quill </em>and those considered in the instant case that justify divergent treatment. Regarding the second reason, we do not accord the same import to <em>pre-Quill </em>cases in which it was far more likely that a taxpayer would be required to be physically present (in the traditional commercial sense) in a state in order to earn income there. Lastly, the third reason espoused by the New Jersey Tax Court rings hollow. For example, in discussing <em>General Motors Carp. v. City of Seattle, </em>107 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number><em>Wash.App. </em>42, 26 P.3d 1022 (2001), <em>cert. den., </em>535 <em>U.S. </em>1056, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>1915, 152 L.Ed.2d 825 (2002), the New Jersey Tax Court dismisses the Washington appellate court\u2019s express declaration that it \u201cdecline! d] to extend <em>Quill\u2019s </em>physical presence requirement\u201d to a business and occupation tax on the basis that the taxpayers in that case had a physical presence in that jurisdiction. The corporation\u2019s physical presence can hardly serve to obscure the Washington Court\u2019s unequivocal choice to stand with <em>Geoffrey\u2019s </em>containment of the <em>Quill </em>physical-presence test. More importantly, any assertion that <em>Geoffrey </em>has not been, by and large, approved of in subsequent cases cannot be sustained. <em>See </em>J. Hellerstein &amp; W. Hellerstein, State Taxation, Para. 6.11[3] at 6-16 (Warren, Gorham &amp; Lamont, 3d ed. Cum.Supp. 2004) (comprehensively analyzing judicial and administrative <em>post-Geoffrey </em>developments and summarizing that, although mixed, \u201cjudicial and administrative reaction to the opinion across the country has generally supported <em>[Geoffrey\u2019s </em>] position that <em>Quill\u2019s </em>physical-presence test of Commerce Clause nexus does not extend to <em>income </em>taxes\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 195-96 (footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">Similarly, in <em>Secy, Dep\u2019t of Revenue v. GAP (Apparel), Inc., </em>886 So.2d 459, 461-62 (La.Ct.App.2004) (per curiam) (hereinafter <em>\u201cGAP </em>\u201d), the Louisiana Court of Appeals held that the state could impose a corporate income tax on Gap Apparel, a Delaware corporation, in circumstances involving intangible property almost identical to the facts before us. Apparel authorized the Gap and its affiliates to use registered trademarks, trade names and service marks for which it received \u201ca royalty based on the net sales of the licensed products.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461. The court upheld the tax despite the absence of real or personal property, employees or other presence in Louisiana and the absence of the entry of any licensing agreement there, <em>id. </em>at 462, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-8\">[I]t is clear that the marks licensed by Apparel have been used in Louisiana in such a way as to become an integral part of the licensees\u2019 businesses in this state. Numerous marks (i.e. Gap, Baby Gap, Gap Kids, Pro Fleece) have been licensed by Apparel and used by the licensees to conduct and promote their businesses in this state. Clearly, the intangibles have acquired a business situs in Louisiana and are subject to taxation in this state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-9\">[GAP, <em>supra, </em>886 So.2d at 462.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">We are satisfied that the physical presence requirement applicable to use and sales taxes is not applicable to income tax and that the New Jersey Business Corporation Tax may be constitutionally applied to income derived by plaintiff from licensing fees attributable to New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>Accordingly, we reverse'the judgment of the Tax Court and remand for further proceedings relating to the tax imposed consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b652-7\">We need not comment on the Tax Court's thorough and well-reasoned analysis of the Due Process issue, <em>see Lanco, supra, </em>21 <em>N.J. Tax </em>at 214-17, as plaintiff does not endeavor to defend the judgment on due process grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b654-12\"> As will be further developed hereinafter, a careful reading of <em>Quill </em>reflects the express limitation for sales and use taxes as a matter of <em>stare decisis </em>in light of <em>Bellas Hess, </em>even though \"the <em>Bellas Hess </em>rule appears artificial at its edges.\u201d <em>Quill, supra, </em>504 <em>U.S. </em>at 315, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1914, 119 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 108.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b655-7\"> Many facts were stipulated, and we rely on the Tax Court's recitation of facts. Because we reverse the Tax Court on the Commerce Clause holding (and merely address the fundamental issue presented), we will allow further development before that court of any remaining relevant or material factual contest which may affect the taxability, determination of apportionment of income attributable to New Jersey, or tax for any particular tax year in question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b656-11\"> In <em>Geoffrey </em>there was no commerce clause challenge based on the discrimination or unfair apportionment prongs. <em>Geoffrey </em>also rejected a due process challenge and found Geoffrey purposefully directed its activities to South Carolina by allowing the use of trademarks and intangible assets in the state. <em>Id. </em>at 17.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b662-11\"> It is unclear from the argument before us as to whether the unresolved dispute involves more than one year, <em>see Lanco, supra, </em>21 <em>N.J. Tax </em>at 203-04 n. 1, and other issues not disposed of by stipulation. As noted, <em>supra, </em>at 640 footnote 2 of this opinion, we have resolved the critical issue under review, and we remand to the Tax Court for resolution of all open issues or questions which arise in light of our judgment. However, because of the constitutional issue involved, we stay the remand if plaintiff files a timely direct appeal or, to be safe in case the Supreme Court does not consider the issue \"substantial,\u201d <em>see R. </em>2:2-1(a)(1), pending decision on a petition for certification.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
