S. Bates, architect, and made part hereof. The work to be done under the general direction of said architect and to his satisfaction. No <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>changes to be made in the plans, details or specifications without the written assent of all the parties hereto.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-5\">Upon completion of the work the architect signed and delivered to plaintiff the following certificate: \u201c This will certify that I have examined your work in the construction of the house which you contracted with the Messrs. Poor to build on the \u2018Poor\u2019 farm in Shamburg; and accept it as having been done substantially in accordance with the plans and specifications made and provided by me for your guidance.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-6\">Defendants\u2019 point, refused, was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-7\">\u201c 1. The contract between the plaintiff and defendants does not make the architect the sole judge as to whether the plaintiff has performed his part of the agreement; and the architect\u2019s acceptance of the work is not conclusive upon defendants, and defendants are entitled to show that the plaintiff did not substantially comply with his contract, and that the material he furnished was not as good in quality as called for by the contract, and that the work was not done in a workmanlike manner, as a basis to sustain any damages by the defendants, even though no fraud or collusion between the plaintiff and Bates be shown.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-8\">The court directed a verdict for plaintiff; defendants appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-9\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were, among others, above instructions, quoting them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b495-10\"><em>Robert F.

Young, 31 Pa. 306; Drhew v. Altoona, 121 Pa. 420. There is no decision which holds that a party shall be bound by the decision of an arbiter, unless by express agreement in words that cannot be understood. The language here was intended merely as instruction to plaintiff. The last sentence shows that conclusively.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b495-11\"><em>J. IT.

It is conceded that if, by the terms of the contract, the decision had been left to this defendant, his action, taken in good faith, would have been conclusive on both parties: Singerly v. Thayer, 108 Pa. 291. Then, why should not the same result follow when the decision is, by the terms of the contract, left to a stranger ? The object being the same in either case, ivhy should the selection of a stranger defeat that object? Presumably, no more suitable selection can be made than the architect who draws the plans and is to superintend the work. He is certainly more competent to determine any difficulty that might arise than a jury indifferently chosen and without the requisite information or power to acquire it: Monong. Nav. Co. v. Fenlon, 4 W. &amp; S. 205. This reference was an essential part of the contract, voluntarily entered into by the parties. There was no rule or policy of law which forbade it; and neither party is at liberty to depart from it. There having been no offer to prove that the architect had acted in bad faith, his decision must be treated as final.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">It is unnecessary to consider the specifications of error seriatim. Neither of them is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
