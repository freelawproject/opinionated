J., was to the following effect: Plaintiff had given to defendant in part</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-7\">payment of purchase money of a sawmill and other property bought of Philp &amp; Perry, a check and a note, aggregating $500, representing that he had money in the bank to meet the check and that the note would be paid at Robert\u2019s bank, where he had money or would have money to meet it. Neither note nor check was paid, the plaintiff alleged, because title to part of the property was not good. Defendant consulted counsel, F. W. Hays of Oil City, and upon his advice instituted criminal prosecution for obtaining property on false pretences. Plaintiff after being arrested was discharged by a justice of the peace of Crawford county on the ground that he had no jurisdiction, the check being given in Yenango county. A new prosecution was instituted in Yenango county but was non-prossed, at request of counsel for prosecution, on the ground that the proper jurisdiction was Crawford county, that being the county in which the property acquired by the false representation was situated. Thereupon the present action was brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-8\">Defendant asked his witness, Perry: \u201c Q.

A prosecution for the same offence was then instituted by the same prosecutor before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>a magistrate in this county; the defendant was arrested, gave bail for his appearance at the April Sessions, 1887; a true bill was found by the grand jury, when the cause was continued until the August Sessions, when, upon motion at the instance of the prosecutor, a nol pros was entered and the prosecution abandoned. Under such circumstances, we instruct you that the burden of proof showing probable cause is upon the defendant in this action.\u201d [8]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s points were as follows, among others :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-6\">\u201c 4. If the jury believe that, on the 27th of May, the payment of the five hundred dollars named in the contract was extended five days and that, in default of the payment thereof, the contract should be void and the note of two hundred dollars surrendered; and that pursuant thereto the defendants entered into the possession of the property on the 2d of June, it was a settlement of the matter and a discharge of the plaintiff\u2019s obligation to pay the first payment of five hundred dollars or any part of it, and the retention after that by the defendant of the note and check is evidence of bad faith on his part. <em>Answer: </em>Affirmed, unless the jury further find that the defendant had other good and valid reasons for retaining the same.\u201d [6]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-7\">\u201c 5. If the jury believe that the defendant kept the check after the settlement of May 27th with the object and intent of coercing the plaintiff to pay the money on other pretended claims and the criminal prosecutions were instituted for such purpose, they were malicious, and the check having been previously paid by the surrender of the property, pursuant to the agreement of May 27, 1886, said prosecutions were without probable cause and the plaintiff is entitled to recover.\u201d Affirmed. [7]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-8\">\u201c 6. Advice of counsel does not rebut the presumption of malice arising from want of probable cause; it is evidence merely for the consideration of the jury. To be of any avail to the defendant, the jury must be satisfied from all the evidence in the case that it was sought in good faith for an honest purpose ; but if counsel was sought by defendant as a mere pretext to shield from the consequence of an unfounded prosecution, it is no protection whatever.\u201d Affirmed.

Justice Sterrett,</author>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">It was incumbent on the plaintiff to show not only that there was want of probable cause for the prosecution, but also that there was malice on the part of the prosecutor. Want of probable cause and malice must concur. While the former is evidence of malice, proper to be submitted to the jury, it does not establish legal malice to be declared by the court. Malice may be inferred from the want of probable cause, but if there be probable cause, it matters not that the prosecutor was actuated by malice. Probable cause is generally defined to be a reasonable ground of suspicion, supported by circumstances sufficient to warrant an ordinarily prudent man in believing the party is guilty of the offence. The word \u201c cautious \u201d has sometimes been inadvertently substituted for the word \u201cprudent,\u201d as was done by the learned, judge in qualifying his affirmance of defendant\u2019s first point recited in the second specification of error; but as was said in McCarthy v. DeArmit, 99 Pa. 70, the substance of all definitions is a reasonable ground for belief. . . . The belief must be that of a reasonable and prudent man, .... and all that can be required of him is that he shall act as a reasonable and prudent man would be likely to act under the circumstances.\u201d There is at least a shade of difference in meaning between the words \u201c cautious \u201d and \u201c prudent.\u201d The former sometimes suggests the idea of timidity, or as Webster gives its secondary meaning \u201c over prudent, fearful, timorous.\u201d \u201c A man is cautious, chiefly as the result of timidity.\u201d We, therefore, think the word cautious should not have been employed in qualifying defendant\u2019s first point.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">The 3d and 4th specifications may be considered together. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>In defendant\u2019s seventh point, recited in the latter, the learned judge was requested to charge :</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">\u201c If at the hearing before the magistrate in Crawford county, the plaintiff, McClafferty, was discharged without an investigation into the merits of the charge, but for the reason that the justice believed he had not jurisdiction, and if a nolle prosequi was entered by leave of court, in Venango county, with the consent of the prosecutor, after he had been advised by his counsel that without reference to the truth of the charge contained in the indictment, the prosecution was likely to fail by reason of want of jurisdiction in the court, then neither the discharge by the magistrate nor by the court is a fact from which either want of probable cause or malice can be inferred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">This point was fully warranted by the evidence and should have been affirmed. According to the undisputed evidence, Mr. Hays, a reputable member of the Venango county bar, had full knowledge of all the transactions out of which the prosecution grew, and it was under his advice that it was commenced and conducted until it was ended by the nolle prosequi. There was no evidence tending to show that his advice was not sought and acted on by the defendant in good faith. Nothing i&amp; better settled than that when the prosecutor submits the facts to his attorney, who advises they are sufficient, and he acts thereon in good faith, such advice is a defence to an action for malicious prosecution. ' Strictly speaking, taking advice of counsel and acting thereon rebuts the inference of malice arising from the want of probable cause: McCarthy v. DeArmit, supra; Emerson v. Cochran, 111 Pa. 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">We think there was error in refusing to affirm the point above quoted; and for similar reasons there was error in charging as complained of in the 3d specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">It follows from what has been said that plaintiff\u2019s sixth point, recited in the 1st specification, should not have been affirmed, at least, not without qualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">The remaining specifications are not sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">Judgment reversed and a venire facias de novo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
