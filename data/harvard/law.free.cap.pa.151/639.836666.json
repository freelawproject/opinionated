In spiritual matters the church adhered to the doctrine of the Evangelical Association of North America and received as its pastors the appointees of that body. This association is a religious body divided into twenty-five annual conferences for the government of which the association had formulated rules, called the book of discipline, which are binding upon all members, churches and associations. Each annual conference is presided over by one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>three bishops elected by the general conference. It was the duty of Bishop Bowman to preside over the annual conference, styled the East Pennsylvania Conference, under whose authority the said church is and was. Bishop Bowman had been suspended from his office March 7, 1890, in accordance with the rules and discipline of the said association; i. e., three elders presented to him charges against him and requested an opportunity to examine him <em>; </em>but he refused to submit to an examination on the ground that three elders had already examined him, but without stating upon what charges he had been examined. Such examination was collusive, to defeat and evade a real examination. After notice to the said bishop the trial conference proceeded with the trial and suspended the bishop in due form and according to the rules of the association. At the fifty-second session of the East Pa. Conference, on Eeb. 26, 1891, Bishop Bowman was not allowed to preside because of his suspension, above set forth, and C. S. Hainan was elected to preside in accordance with said rules; but Bishop Bowman with twenty members of the East Pa. Conference withdrew and organized a pretended conference in another church, and by this conference defendant was appointed pastor of the Salem Church and the several other churches which were thus with-' out authority united in one preaching circuit. The Salem Church having previously been a separate congregation, one of the plaintiffs, George W. Gross, was appointed by the East Pa. Conference presided over by C. S. Haman, to' take charge of the Salem Church, aud has entered upon the performance of his office of pastor and is attended by all but thirty or forty members of the congregation. But defendant, as appointee of the alleged East Pa. Conference, is attempting to act as pastor, and withholds the records and the parsonage from said Gross, the lawfully appointed pastor. Said Gross has been recognized by the trustees as pastor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b662-5\">A preliminary injunction was asked to restrain defendant from exercising the office of pastor and from keeping possession of the records and parsonage and other relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b662-6\">The answer denied some of the statements of the bill as to Ahe discipline and government of the association, and stated that the general conference was the Supreme Court of law in the church, and should decide upon the legality of all acts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>annual conferences and upon all such cases as may arise between the annual conferences or between an}*- incorporated society of the church and its officers, or any annual conference ; and denied that Bishop Bowman was suspended in accordance with the rules and discipline of the association; and denied further the facts and circumstances of the trial of said bishop as stated in the bill; denied that the first trial was collusive; but, after setting forth the facts of the first trial and the decision of the elders, charged that the second trial which resulted in his suspension was wholly irregular and of no validity, setting forth at length the reasons therefor, namely, want of jurisdiction, failure to comply with rules of church in conducting trial, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b663-5\">The answer further alleged that the East Pa. Conference presided over by C. S. Haman was not the lawful East Pa. Conference ; that said Haman was ineligible to preside because of charges pending against him at the time of his election, that the appointment of Gross was irregular and in conflict with the discipline and laws of the association.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b663-6\">The answer further averred that the conference presided over by Haman had proceeded in a revolutionary manner, with the purpose of carrying out a scheme of schism in the denomination, and among other acts had appointed a general conference to meet in Phila., (well knowing it had been appointed to meet in Indianapolis,) so as to prevent a decision upon the respective claims of the conferences presided over by Haman and Bowman.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b663-7\">The answer denied that Bishop Bowman with twenty members withdrew from the East Pa. Conference and organized a pretended conference in another church, or that defendant was without authority placed in charge of said church, or that it was unlawful to unite Salem Church with other preaching places. It denied the facts stated in the bill as to the organization of the conference presided over by Bishop Bowman, and set forth the facts which it alleged to be the true facts of such organization.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b663-8\">Upon filing the bill, notice was given of a motion for a preliminary injunction; injunction affidavits and the answer of defendant were filed before the argument of the motion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b663-9\">At the hearing of the motion, the court granted the prayer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>of the bill and entered a final decree in favor of complainants, ordering defendant to surrender the records and parsonage, in an opinion in part as follows, by Schuyler, P. J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b664-4\">\u201c The Evangelical Association has provided its own court for the trial of all such questions, to wit, a trial conference, and by the decisions of that court we are as much bound as by the decisions of any other competent tribunal: Reformed Church v. Seibert, 3 Pa. 291. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b664-5\">\u201c The East Pennsylvania Conference, having been authoritatively advised of the action of the trial conference, was bound to take notice of it. The trial conference had the authority to depose Bishop Bowman, and they did depose him\u2014at least they passed sentence of suspension against him. If that sentence was valid it incapacitated the Rev. Bowman to preside, and to have permitted him to preside would have been a plain breach of duty. But by whom was the validity of the sentence to be determined? Clearly by a majority of the members present. The book of discipline provided no other tribunal. Besides, the decision of the question was a necessary step in the organization of the conference and consequently fell within its implied powers. Nor, as has been seen, have we any power to review the decision. The question, then, of the validity of Bishop Bowman\u2019s sentence having been decided against him by a competent ecclesiastical tribunal, over which we have no control in this proceeding, the question must be considered as settled. It follows that the pretended conference, organized by the seceders from the \u2018 Ebenezer \u2019 conference was without authority in law, and that Mr. Wieand\u2019s appointment by that pretended conference to the pastorate of the Bangor Church was null and void. It also follows that Mr. Wieand has no right to the possession of the property in controversy. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b664-6\">\u201cThe facts are not only few and simple, but they are undisputed, and there is consequently no occasion for a reference to a master. Nearly a full day was consumed in the discussion of the legal questions involved. These questions were fairly raised by the pleadings, and we were entitled to and no doubt were furnished with all the light that counsel could throw upon them. In passing upon the law I have treated the case as if it had been set down for a hearing upon the bill and answer, taking as true all the facts well pleaded in the answer.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>Further facts appear by the opinion of the Supreme Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b665-5\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were (1) entry of decree, quoting it; (2) entry of final decree awarding mandatory injunction upon argument and hearing of a motion for preliminary injunction, the cause not being then at issue or ripe for final hearing and the same not having been set down for hearing upon bill and answer or so agreed to be heard; (3) decreeing that defendant pay costs; (4) failure to dismiss the motion for preliminary injunction.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b665-6\"><em>James 8. </em>Biery, with him <em>W. 8.

Gross, claimed title to his office as preacher at Bangor by virtue of an appointment made by a body claiming to be the true East Pennsylvania Conference, presided over by Rev. Haman. The defendant, Rev. Wieand, claimed title to the same office by virtue of an appointment made by a body also claiming to be the true East Pennsylva<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>nia Conference, presided over by Bishop Bowman. The question which of these bodies was the true East Pennsylvania Conference, was a disputed question' between the litigants in this case, and neither conceded, but each denied, the right of the other. The hearing before the learned court below was upon an application for a preliminary injunction by the plaintiff. An answer was filed denying the right of the plaintiff and the validity of his title to the office, and impugning absolutely the right and title of the body presided over by Rev. Haman, to be the true East Pennsylvania Conference, and denying and disputing many other matters of fact averred in the plaintiff\u2019s bill. No replication was filed to this answer, no issue was made up between the parties, no master or examiner was appointed to take testimony or decide the case on its merits of fact and law, no testimony was taken in support of the allegations of either party and there was nothing before the court except the bill, answer and some ox parte affidavits. The learned court below, considering that there were no disputed facts in the case, entertained the cause as upon final hearing and made a final decree upon the merits in favor of the plaintiff. At the time of the decree there was an open and undecided question pending in the courts of the Evangelical Association of North America of which the Bangor church was a member, to wit, whether the body presided over by the Rev. Haman, or the one presided over by Bishop Bowman, -was the true East Pennsylvania Conference. An affidavit by Rev. Leopold is now filed stating that a general conference of the Evangelical Association of North America was held at Indianapolis on October 21, 1891, that he was chosen one of the secretaries and kept the minutes thereof, and that at said conference a resolution was adopted by which it was officially declared that the annual conference held in the year 1891 in the district of East Pennsylvania under the presidency of Bishop Bowman was the only lawful and regular annual conference of the association in that district; that the acts and doings of said annual conference and its appointments of preachers were the only regular and valid appointments for the year 1891; and that presiding elders elected at said conference were duly and lawfully elected. As this general conference of the whole church or association is alleged to be the Supreme Court of law in the church, \u201c with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>power to decide upon all cases arising between annual conferences, or between annual conferences and their officers,\u201d it would seem that the claim of the body presided over by Rev. Haman to be the true East Pennsylvania Conference has been decided adversely by its own court of last resort. If such shall prove to be the fact, upon final hearing of the ease upon its merits, the decree of the court below would have to be reversed and the plaintiff\u2019s bill dismissed. Of course it was premature to decide the case as upon final hearing, and to grant the permanent relief prayed for in the bill, upon such a state of the pleadings and in such a condition of the proofs.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">The decree of the court below is reversed at the cost of the appellees and the record is remitted for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
