Ass\u2019n v. Com., 81 Pa, 235, 2 W. N. 246. This is not the case of a church corporation or body with limited powers granting right of burial, as in Kincaid\u2019s Ap., 66 Pa. 411, where there was no right or title to the soil nor right of sepulture in any particular lot: Craig v. Church, 88 Pa. 42. Such organizations have no power to sell the fee: Vielie v. Osgood, 8 Barb. 130. The case is different with independent cemeteries: 17 Am. L. Rev. 199; 19 Am. L. Reg. N. S. 69; Brick Presbyterian Church, 3 Eds. Ch. 165; 4 S. &amp; Ch. 474; Cemetery Case, 4 Bradf. 510. A sepulture is defined as a monument or tomb, which latter is a part of the realty and the action belongs to the heir: Coke, Lit. 18 b; Sabin v. Harkness, 4 N. H. 417; Meagher v. Driscoll, 99 Mass. 281; Van Leuven v. Lyke, 1 N. Y. 515; Hall v. Hodskins, 30 How. Pr. 27; Read v. Edwards, 17 C. B., N.

Greble, 1 Ash. 138; Morris v. Phaler, 1 Watts, 389; Sill\u2019s Ap., 1 Gr. 235. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>A horizontal layer may be conveyed: Claremont Bridge v.

Johnston, 55 Pa. 167.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-5\">The conveyance here was not an easement merely, for easements are not properly assignable nor can they be inherited: Tinicum Co. v. Carter, 61 Pa. 21.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-6\">Recording the deed is a contemporaneous interpretation by the parties. Such interpretation is entitled to weight: Berridge v. Glassey, 112 Pa. 442.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-7\">The words of grant rebut the idea of an easement. Words are to receive their natural construction: Hannum v. West Chester, 70 Pa. 367.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-8\">In Bennett v. Culver, 27 Hun, 554, ejectment was sustained for cemetery lots. In Seymour v. Page, 33 Conn. 61, the grantee of premises for burial purposes was held to have a qualified fee. See also Queen v. St. Martin\u2019s, 2 Gale &amp; Dav. 434.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-9\">There is no power in the courts by an ex parte proceeding to change the use and convert burial lots into building lots: Stockton v. Mayor, 42 N. J. Eq. 531; Rousseau v. Troy, 49 How. Pr. 492; Chatham v. Brainard, 11 Conn. 66; Evergreen Cemetery v. New Haven, 43 Conn. 234; Lake View v.

Bead </em>with him, for appellee.\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9h\">The judgment in the court below was based on two grounds: (1) that plaintiff had no <em>title; </em>(2) that even if he had title he had no right to maintain ejectment. While it is true that in Pennsylvania the action of ejectment is a possessory one, it is also well settled that the right to use a lot for burial purposes is a usufructory one only\u2014a mere license, and not the subject of ejectment: Kincaid\u2019s Ap., 66 Pa. 411-420 ; affirmed in Craig v. Church, 88 Pa. 42-51.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-11\">Where the grant was of \u201c the exclusive right and privilege of boring for salt, oil, or minerals \u201d upon certain land, it was held that, under the authority of Funk v. Haldeman, 53 Pa. 229, it was not a conveyance of the mineral, but only a right to sever and take it, and the only possession to which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>grantee was entitled was such as was necessary to an exercise of that right, and therefore the'remedy for the disturbance of the right was in case and that ejectment could not be maintained: Union Pet. Co. v. Bliven Pet. Co., 72 Pa. 173-181.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-5\">The criterion established by this court has been stated as follows: \u201c In order to ascertain whether an instrument must be construed as a lease or a license, it is only necessary to determine whether the grantee had acquired by it any estate in the land, in respect of which he might bring ejectment. If the land is still to be considered in the possession of the grantor the instrument will only amount to a license : \u201d Funk v. Haldeman, 53 Pa. 229-243.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-6\">The amendment to the charter giving the company power to sell their lands for other purposes than burial purposes, is constitutional : Kincaid\u2019s Ap., 66 Pa. 411-420; Craig v. Church, 88 Pa. 42-51; Twenty-second St., 102 Pa. 108; Hare on Const. Law, 651, 652.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A6E\">October 3, 1892.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AmTg\">Mr. Justice Sterrett,</author>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">As well stated by appellant in the opening sentence of his argument, \u201c The question first presented for decision is, whether the interest conveyed, under the original deed of Tilford to Lisle, is such an interest in land as will support an action of ejectment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">The thing conveyed by the deed referred to, as the same is described therein, is \u201c the exclusive and entire right of interment or sepulture in all and every of those two hundred burial lots in the Philadelphia Cemetery, situate,\u201d etc., \u201c marked in the map or plan of said cemetery with the numbers 5, 9,\u201d etc.'; \u201c together' with all and singular the ways, avenues, passages, rights, liberties, privileges, improvements, hereditaments and appurtenances whatsoever thereunto belonging or in any wise appertaining and the reversions and remainders thereof; to have and to hold the same with the appurtenances unto the said John M. Lisle, his heirs and assigns to and for the only proper use and behoof the said John M. Lisle, his heirs and assigns forever, for the uses and purposes of sepulture only, and to and for no other use, intent or purpose whatsoever, subject to all the rules, regulations, conditions and restrictions contained and set forth in the articles of association made and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>adopted or which may hereafter be made and adopted by the corporators or managers of said cemetery for the government of lot owners or visitors to the cemetery, and the burial of the dead, and in and by any by-laws made and adopted or which may hereafter be made and adopted in pursuance of the said articles of association or of the act of assembly incorporating said company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">It thus appears by the deed, that all the vendee acquired thereunder was \u201c the right of interment or sepulture,\u201d in the lots described therein and declared to be held \u201c for the uses and purposes of sepulture only and to and for no' other use, intent or purpose whatsoever.\u201d The right, thus sharply defined and limited, is also subject to all the rules, regulations, conditions and restrictions contained and set forth in the articles of association, made and adopted, or which might thereafter be adopted by the corporators or managers of the incorporated cemetery company.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The language of the deed evidently contemplates possession and general control of the cemetery grounds, etc., by the company. The grantee in the deed acquired no such interest in the lots, nor such right of possession, as will support an action of ejectment. That action will not lie for a mere license, an incorporeal hereditament, nor for a mere right of way, nor an easement: 6 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law, 232; Adams on Ejectment, 16. As was said in Black v. Hepburne, 2 Yeates, 333 : \u201c Ejectment will only lie for things whereof possession may be delivered by the sheriff.\u201d If a recovery in ejectment,\u2014 founded on a mere right or license such as that acquired by the grantee in the deed above referred to,\u2014were permitted, how could the sheriff, under a writ of habere facias, put the plaintiff in possession, without interfering with the rights, \u2022powers and duties of the cemetery corporation? In Kincaid\u2019s Appeal, 66 Pa. 411, one of the plaintiffs held a paper certifying that he was \u201c entitled to two lots in the burying ground, .... to have and to hold the said lots for the use and purpose and subject to the conditions and regulations in the deed of trust to the trustees of said church.\u201d It was held that this was not a grant of any interest in the soil; that it was the grant of a license or privilege to make interments in the lots described, exclusive of others, so long as the ground should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>remain the burying ground of the church; that while the license continued he could perhaps maintain trespass or case for any invasion or disturbance of it, whether by the grantors or by strangers, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">That case was cited approvingly in Craig v. The Church, 88 Pa. 42, in which it was also held that the right of sepulture in the burying ground of a church is not an absolute right in the soil, but a mere license or privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">In Union Oil Co. v. Bliven Oil Co., 72 Pa. 173, the grant to the defendant was of the exclusive right and privilege of boring for oil, etc., upon a farm. Subsequently, by partition, the title became vested in another who conveyed to plaintiff. It was held that the grant was a mere incorporeal hereditament and consequently ejectment could not be maintained. Referring to the grant, which was of \u201c the exclusive right and privilege of boring for salt, oil or minerals,\u201d upon the McClintock farm, Mr. Justice Sharswood says: \u201cIt was, therefore, as in Funk v. Ilaldeman, the grant of a mere incorporeal hereditament. Indeed, we do not understand this to have been controverted in the court below, nor has it been made a question in this court. It follows that the only remedy which the the plaintiffs had for the disturbance of their right was an action on the case. Ejectment they certainly could not have maintained.\u201d Funk v. Ilaldeman, 53 Pa. 239, above cited, is substantially to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">It follows from what has been said, that the right of sepulture, etc., was not an interest in the land, such as will support an action of ejectment. It is therefore unnecessary to consider whether the court erred in directing a verdict for defendant, and in other respects, or not. If, on the case presented by the plaintiff, he had no right to recover in an action of ejectment, he was not injured by any of the alleged errors of which he complains.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
