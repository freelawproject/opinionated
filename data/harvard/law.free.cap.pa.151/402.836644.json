Having condemned the necessary land and begun active work, plaintiff filed a bill asking for an injunction to restrain defendants from obstructing the construction of the grade crossing. The court refused a prelimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>nary injunction, but allowed plaintiff, on filing a bond to secure defendants from loss, \u201cto construct a temporary crossing tobe used only for construction purposes.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that, as the Supreme Court was not satisfied that there was error in such decree, and as no irreparable mischief could be done to defendants until the case could be disposed of on final hearing, the decree would not be disturbed.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b425-3\">Argued Feb. 20, 1892.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A-4\">Appeal, No. 179, July T., 1892, by defendants from decree of C.

Subsequently plaintiffs presented a petition in which they averred that they had condemned land and were excavating, grading and laying tracks for the branches described in the bill, but that their work was retarded because they had no crossing over defendants\u2019 tracks to move construction material by means of cars. The petition prayed for an injunction restraining defendants from interfering with the construction by plaintiffs of a crossing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-8\">The court, Ermentrout, P. J., made the following order: \u201cAnd now, July 6, 1891, the foregoing petition having been presented and duly considered, the court refuse to award a preliminary injunction as prayed for, but allow the plaintiff to construct a temporary crossing, to be used only for construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>purposes, and plaintiffs to be limited to the passing and re-passing thereon of not more than two construction trains each day, the said trains to be moved at such times as not to interfere with defendants\u2019 trains and use of their road. Plaintiffs, at their own expense, to have a watchman at crossing to prevent accidents, and defendants are enjoined from in anywise interfering with the construction and use of the crossing as aforesaid. Plaintiffs, .before constructing such crossing, to file a bond in the sum of $1,000, with approved sureties, for the securing to the defendants the payment of such damages as they may be entitled to.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-4\"><em>Error assigned </em>was above order, quoting it.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b426-5\"><em>Q-eorge E. </em>Baer, <em>Jefferson Snyder </em>with him, for plaintiffs.\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1e\">The court adjudged against the claim of plaintiffs and expressly refused an injunction, thereby deciding that plaintiffs were not entitled to the relief for which they prayed, until final hearing, but, for the purpose of enabling plaintiffs cheaply and expeditiously to construct a railroad which they had no right to construct, defendants are restrained from protecting their own tracks. This action of the court is without precedent and without justification: Minnig\u2019s Ap., 82 Pa. 876; Penna. S. V. R. R. v. P. &amp; R. R. R., 7 Pa. C. C. R. 490; Phila. &amp; Erie R. R. v.
