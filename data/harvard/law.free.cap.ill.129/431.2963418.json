Statute oe Frauds\u2014os to merely equitable interests in land. The-Statute of Frauds embraces equitable as well as legal interests in land, and the execution of a contract for the sale of land vests in the purchaser an equitable interest in the lands therein described, and makes the vendor a trustee for him.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b431-12\" pgmap=\"431\">2. A sold B certain land for a sum paid and other sums thereafter to-be paid, the purchaser taking possession. A, at the request of B, conveyed the undivided half of the premises to 0, after which A and B-entered into a verbal contract, whereby the latter agreed to sell and surrender to the former the other undivided half, and surrender his possession to A, who agreed to pay B $3500. The possession of the undivided half was surrendered to A, who afterward sold and conveyed it to a third person, with B\u2019s knowledge, for $4000. B sued A for the-$3500, and the latter pleaded the Statute of Frauds: Feld, that the plea was a bar to the action.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b431-13\" pgmap=\"431\">3. Same\u2014part performance\u2014to tahe a case out of the statute\u2014the rule at law and in equity. A part performance of a verbal contract within the Statute of Frauds has no effect, at law, to take the case out of the operation of the statute. The doctrine of part performance is one of equity, and does not prevail at law.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b431-14\" pgmap=\"431\">4. Same\u2014what will constitute merely a part performance. The holder of an equitable title to land derived under a bond or written contract of sale, by a verbal contract sold back his interest to his vendor, and in a suit against the original vendor for the purchase money on the re-sale, and in which the Statute of Frauds was pleaded, the only allegation of performance was that the plaintiff surrendered the possession to his vendor. It was not alleged that the original contract was surrendered or canceled: Feld, that the pleadings failed to show a complete execution of the verbal contract, but showed merely a part performance available only in equity.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b431-15\" pgmap=\"431(73) 432(15)\">5. Rescission op contract\u2014what will amount to a rescission. Where land has been sold, a subsequent conveyance by the vendor to a third person, even with the knowledge of the original purchaser, does not operate as a rescission of the prior contract of sale. The legal effect of such conveyance, when not made with the vendee\u2019s consent, is merely to place it out of the vendor\u2019s power to perform his contract; and this is in no way affected by the vendee\u2019s knowledge that such conveyance was being made.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b432-5\" pgmap=\"432\">6. The surrender of possession of land by a purchaser to Ms vendor does not necessarily involve a rescission of the contract of sale, since such surrender may be entirely consistent with an intention on the part of the former to retain the contract and enforce it.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b432-6\" pgmap=\"432\">7. Pleading\u2014evidence\u2014rescission to be specially pleaded\u2014allegations and proofs. Where the plaintiff\u2019s right of action at law depends upon the fact of a mutual rescission of a contract for the sale of land, he must allege that fact in his declaration, or facts from which a rescission must be necessarily implied. He can not recover upon a theory not supported by Ms declaration.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b432-7\" pgmap=\"432\">8.

Crain, 10 Texas, 444; 2 Reed on Statute of Frauds, sec. 456; Broom on Statute of Frauds, see. 229.</p> <opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b437-4\" pgmap=\"437\">Mr. Justice Bailey</author> <p id=\"A5e\" pgmap=\"437\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p> <p id=\"AGq\" pgmap=\"437\">The only questions presented by this appeal are those arising upon the plea of the Statute of Frauds. It appears from the declaration that, prior to the date of the contract upon which the suit is brought, the plaintiff and defendant entered into an agreement in writing, by which the defendant, in consideration of a certain sum of money then paid to him by the plaintiff, and of certain other payments thereafter to be made, agreed to convey to the plaintiff certain lands in Vermilion county; that the plaintiff thereupon entered into possession of said lands; that while so in possession he sold an undivided half of the lands to one McCabe, the defendant conveying said undivided half to McCabe at the plaintiff\u2019s request; that after such conveyance was made and while the plaintiff was still in possession of the remaining undivided half, the plaintiff and defendant entered into a verbal agreement whereby the plaintiff agreed to sell and surrender to the defendant said undivided half still in his possession, the defendant agreeing, in consideration thereof, to pay the plaintiff the sum of $3500; that the plaintiff thereupon surrendered to the defendant the possession of said undivided half of said premises, and that the defendant retained the same in his possession, and afterwards sold and conveyed it to a third person, with the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge, for the sum of $4000. The suit is brought to recover of the defendant the consideration of said verbal agreement.</p> <p id=\"AMh\" pgmap=\"437\">The second section of the Statute of Frauds of which the defendant seeks by his plea to avail himself is as follows: \u201cNo action shall be brought to charge any person upon any contract for the sale of lands, tenements or hereditaments, or any interest in or concerning them, for a longer term than one year, unless such contract or some memorandum or note thereof shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged therewith, or some other person thereunto lawfully authorized in writing signed by such party.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b438-4\" pgmap=\"438\">The execution by the defendant to the plaintiff of the written contract of sale alleged in the declaration vested in the plaintiff an equitable interest in the lands therein described/ and there can be no doubt that such interest was an interest in or concerning lands within the meaning of said statute. That the statute of frauds embraces equitable as well as legal interests in land is well settled. Browne on Statute of Frauds, sec. 229. As said by Mr. Justice Stoby in Smith v. Bwrnham, 3 Sumner, 435, \u201cA contract for the conveyance of lands is a contract respecting an interest in lands. It creates an equitable estate in the vendee in the very lands, and makes the vendor a trustee for him. A contract for the sale of an equitable estate in lands, whether it be under a contract for the conveyance by a third- party, or otherwise, is clearly a sale of an interest in lands, within the Statute of Frauds.\u201d See also Richards v. Richards, 9 Gray, 313; Hughes v. Moore, 7 Cranch, 176; Simms v. Killian, 12 Ired. 252; Dial v. Crain, 10 Texas, 444; Catlett v. Dougherty, 21 Ill. App. 116; Jevne v. Osgood, 57 Ill. 340.</p> <p id=\"b438-5\" pgmap=\"438\">The plaintiff contends that the acts performed by him under his oral contract to sell and surrender his interest in said lands to the defendant constitute such a performance as should take the case out of the statute. The only act of performance alleged in the declaration is the delivery of possession of the premises sold to the defendant. There is no allegation of any cancellation or surrender of the defendant\u2019s contract to convey the lands to the plaintiff on payment of the purchase money, nor is the cancellation of said contract averred, either directly or inferentially. It will therefore be presumed that said contract is still held by the plaintiff as a valid and subsisting legal obligation against the defendant. The averments of the declaration therefore, as we interpret them show a partial and not a complete performance.</p> <p id=\"b438-6\" pgmap=\"438(23) 439(103)\">The doctrine of part performance is a doctrine of equity and does not prevail at law. Mr. Browne, in his Treatise on the Statute of Frauds, sec. 451, says: \u201cIt is settled by a long series of authorities, that a part execution of a verbal contract within the Statute of Frauds has no effect at law to take the case out of its provisions/\u2019 and in support of this statement a large number of cases are cited in a note. To same effect see 2 Beed on the Statute of Frauds, sec. 548, and authorities -cited in note. The same rule has been frequently announced by this court. Warner v. Hale, 65 Ill. 395; Wheeler v. Frankenthal, 78 id. 124; Creighton v. Sanders, 89 id. 543.</p> <p id=\"b439-5\" pgmap=\"439\">The plaintiff\u2019s contention is, that the facts averred in the -declaration amount to a rescission of the defendant\u2019s contract to convey, and that such rescission, coupled with a delivery of possession, should be held to be tantamount to a complete performance. The difficulty with this view is that no rescission is averred, either directly or inferentially. The only averment is that the plaintiff had surrendered the possession to the defendant who already had the legal title, and that the -defendant subsequently conveyed the land, with the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge, to a third person. A surrender of possession did not necessarily involve a rescission of the defendant\u2019s contract, since such surrender of possession may be entirely consistent with an intention on his part to retain the defendant\u2019s contract with a view of subsequently enforcing it against -him. The pleading must he construed most strongly against the pleader, and as the declaration contains no averment of a rescission or of any facts from which a rescission must be necessarily implied, it must be presumed that none was made or intended. If the plaintiff relied on the theory of a rescission he should have averred it, and not having done so, he cannot recover upon a theory not supported hy his declaration.</p> <p id=\"b439-6\" pgmap=\"439(53) 440(114)\">We are unahle to see that any special force is to he given, \u25a0in this connection, to the averment that the defendant had -conveyed the land to a third person with the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge. It might perhaps have been different if such conveyance liad been made with the plaintiff\u2019s consent and approbation. The legal effect of the conveyance, so long as it does not appear to have been made with the plaintiff\u2019s consent, is merely to place it out of the defendant\u2019s power to perform his contract to convey the land to the plaintiff, but it has no tendency to work a rescission or cancellation of the contract, or-to absolve the defendant from his liability thereon, and this, is in no way affected by the mere knowledge of the plaintiff' that the conveyance was being made. We are of the opinion that the demurrer to the defendant\u2019s plea was properly overruled. The judgment of the Appellate Court will therefore-be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b440-4\" pgmap=\"440\">Judgment affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b440-5\" pgmap=\"440\">Mr. Justice Wilkin took no part.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
