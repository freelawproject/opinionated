Description\u2014of land in a tax deed\u2014whether void for uncertainty. A tax deed described the land sold for taxes as \u201cpart of survey No. 743, claim No. 93, 3135-100 acres,\u201d but in no manner was the part of that survey designated. The proceeding under which the deed was had described the land in the same way: Held, that the tax deed and judgment and sale were void for the uncertainty in the description of the land.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b646-10\" pgmap=\"646\">2. Tax title\u2014affidavit of notice\u2014sufficiency. An affidavit of the service of notice of a tax sale, etc., relied on as showing a right to a tax deed, stated, \u201cthat this affiant served, or caused to be served, written or printed, or partly written and partly printed, notices of purchase at said tax sale, upon A B, G D and E E, the only persons in actual possession or occupancy of said piece or parcel of land or lot:\u201d Held, that the affidavit, for its great uncertainty in every essential requirement, was wholly insufficient as the basis for a tax deed. Who served the notice, in what manner it was served, whether it was written or printed or partly written and partly printed, as well as when it was served, are facts not disclosed by the affidavit, and such facts are required by section 217, chapter 120, of the Revised Statutes, to be particularly stated.</syllabus><summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-11\" pgmap=\"646\">Writ op Erbor to the Circuit Court of Monroe county; the Hon.

W. Brickey, of lawful age, being first duly sworn, doth depose and say: That at a tax sale of real estate, made in and for the county aforesaid, at the place of holding court therein, on the 10th day of June, A. D. 1884, for drainage tax due Randolph and Monroe County Drainage District No. 1, interest and costs due thereon, he purchased the following described piece or parcel of land or lot situated in the county of Monroe and State of Illinois, to-wit: Part of survey No. 743, claim No. 93, township 5, S., R. 9 west, 3d P. M., Monroe county, Illinois, containing 31^-^ acres, for which a tax sale certificate of purchase was issued at said tax sale, in the manner prescribed by law, and that he, this affiant, F. W. Brickey, is the legal owner of the same; that this affiant served, or caused to be served, written or printed, or partly written and partly printed, notices of purchase at said tax sale, upon Thomas, Patrick and William Hayden, and Frank English, the only persons in actual possession or occupancy of said piece or parcel of land or lot, and also a partly written and partly printed notice was given to D. M. Hardy and William T. Demint, the owners or parties interested in said piece or parcel of land or lot, at least three months before the expiration of the time of redemption on said sale; said notices stated when the purchaser above named purchased the said piece or parcel of land or lot, in whose name the same was taxed, the description of the said land or lot he had purchased, for what year taxed or specially assessed, and when the time of redemption would expire; that Mrs. F. Tillman, in whose name said piece or parcel of land or lot was assessed, upon diligent inquiry could not be found in said county of Monroe, and did not reside therein for any period of time from the day of said sale down to within three months before the expiration of the time of the redemption on said sale, within the knowledge or belief of this deponent; that more than three months, and less than five months, before the time for the redemption of the said land or lot above described expired, he, this affiant, caused to be published in the \u2018Waterloo Times,\u2019 a newspaper of general circulation in said county and State, printed and published in the town of Waterloo, in said county and State, a notice of the said purchase at said tax sale, which said notice was inserted and published in said newspaper three times, to-wit: on the 21st and 28th days of January, on the 4th day of February and on the 11th day of February, A. D. 1886, the first time of said insertion being not more than five months and the last time being not less than three months before the time of said redemption expired. And this affiant further says, that said land or lot has not been redeemed from the force and effect of said sale within the time and in the manner prescribed by law, and that he, this affiant, relies on the facts stated in this affidavit, and on compliance with the provisions of the constitution and laws of the State of Illinois in this behalf; and this affiant particularly says, that all the conditions of section 216 of an act of the legislature of the State of Illinois, entitled \u2018An act for the assessment of property, and for the levy and collection of taxes,\u2019 approved March 80, 1872, in full force July 1, 1872, and all amendments thereto, have been strictly complied' with, and therefore says, that he, this affiant, has caused a partly written and partly printed notice to be given to D. M. Hardy and William T. Demint, the owners or parties interested, by publication and service, of the fact of the sale of the property above described, and when the time of redemption would expire, and has complied with all the provisions of the constitution and laws of the State of Illinois to entitle him, this affiant, to a deed or deeds of conveyance, and asks that a deed or deeds of conveyance, vesting in him the title to the land or lot described in the original certificate of purchase, hereto attached, may be issued to E. W. Brickey, as provided by law. E. W.

The survey and claim contain 400 acres. The 31j3q55 acres are located somewhere in the survey and claim, but in what part no one can tell.</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b649-13\" pgmap=\"649\">In Lancey v. Brock, 110 Ill. 610, it is said: \u201cA deed described the land as 67 acres, part of claim 1096, survey 117. Survey 117 contained 130 and a fraction acres. Held, that the description was fatally defective, it failing to describe definitely any specific tract.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b649-15\" pgmap=\"649\">That the description is void for uncertainty, see Turney v. Saunders, 4 Scam. 527, and Pickering v.

In the affidavit we find this statement: \u201cThat this affiant served, or caused to be served, written or printed, or partly written and partly printed, notices,\u201d etc. From this we are left to conjecture whether Brickey served the notice, or any one else, and if any one else, who it was. The name is not given, nor the mode of service.</p><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-6\" pgmap=\"650\">This court has passed on affidavits of this sort. Price v.

English was defaulted. The case was tried by the court without the intervention of a jury, and judgment rendered in favor of defendants. Plaintiff sues out this writ of error.</p> <p id=\"b650-9\" pgmap=\"650\">The only evidence offered by plaintiff to prove title in himself, was a tax deed, and the judgment, certificate of purchase and affidavit for deed on which it was based, in each of which the description is as follows: \u201cPart of survey No. 743, claim No. 93; 31t3^ acres.\u201d The part of survey No. 743 is in no manner designated, and the deed is therefore void for uncertainty. The People v. Chicago and Alton Railroad Co. 96 Ill. 369; Lancey v. Brock, 110 id. 610.</p> <p id=\"b650-10\" pgmap=\"650\">The proceeding under which the deed was obtained was for the same reason also void. The People v. Reat, 107 Ill. 581 ; Pickering v. Lomax et al. 120 id. 297.</p> <p id=\"b651-4\" pgmap=\"651\">The affidavit on which the deed issued was fatally defective for other reasons, especially in that it failed to state the facts relied on as showing service of notice on the occupants of the lands purchased. The language of the affidavit is, \u201cthat this affiant served, or caused to be served, written or printed, or partly written and partly printed, notices of purchase at said tax sale, upon Thomas, Patrick and William Hayden and Frank English, the only persons in actual possession or occupancy of said piece or parcel of land or lot.\u201d Here is uncertainty in every essential. Who served the notice, how it was served, (whether written or printed or partly written and partly printed,) as well as when it was served, are facts upon which the affidavit furnishes no light whatever; and they are facts which, by section 217, chapter 120, of the Bevised Statutes, must be particularly stated. Price v. England, 109 Ill. 394; Davis v. Gossnell et al. 113 id. 121; Wallahan et al. v. Ingersoll, 117 id. 123; Gage et al. v. Reid et al. 118 id. 35.</p> <p id=\"b651-5\" pgmap=\"651\">The judgment of the circuit court is affirmed. The cost of additional abstract by defendants in error should be taxed to plaintiff in error.</p> <p id=\"b651-6\" pgmap=\"651\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
