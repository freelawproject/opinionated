We conclude that our opinion and holding are in error. Accordingly, we withdraw the opinion and substitute the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">Defendant Gilberto Caldera-Herrera (Caldera) appeals his conviction on four counts of unlawful departure from a designated customs facility in violation of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1459. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">Caldera was convicted following a jury trial. The evidence established that on four occasions in February 1990, Caldera, alone in a vehicle, drove from Mexico to a port of entry in El Paso, Texas, then sped away without authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-27\">Caldera was charged with four counts of failing to present himself for inspection at a port-of-entry, in violation of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1433 and 1436, and four counts of departing from a designated customs facility without authorization, in violation of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1459(d) and (g). He was convicted on all eight counts but challenges only the conviction on the four counts under section 1459.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-28\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-29\">Caldera presents only one issue for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-30\">Defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal should have been granted as to [the four counts under section 1459] because the evidence presented by the government was insufficient to establish that Defendant was either not in a vehicle, vessel, or aircraft, or only a passenger, which is an essential element of the offense under [section] 1459.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-31\">Caldera argues that he cannot be guilty both of section 1433,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which regards persons in charge of a vehicle, and section 1459,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which, Caldera asserts, concerns <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>only persons arriving at a port-of-entry other than by vehicle or other conveyance and persons who, although arriving by conveyance, are not in charge of that conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">We agree that, as the sole occupant and driver of a vehicle, Caldera could not be convicted under section 1459. While section 1433 covers the conduct of a person in charge of a vehicle, and Caldera does not appeal his conviction under that statute, section 1459 regards the conduct only of persons who are not in charge of a conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Where possible, statutes must be read in harmony with one another so as to give meaning to each provision. <em>Federal Aviation Admin. v. Robertson, </em>422 U.S. 255, 261, 95 S.Ct. 2140, 2145, 45 L.Ed.2d 164 (1975). The statutes at issue here\u2014 sections 1433 and 1459 \u2014 are <em>in pari materia </em>and thus should be construed together. <em>See United States v. Onick, </em>889 F.2d 1425, 1433 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-12\">Sections 1433 and 1459 are easily harmonized by observing their plain meaning. Section 1433(b)(2)(B) requires the \u201cperson in charge\u201d of a vehicle to present it for inspection. Caldera was convicted of violating this provision and does not appeal that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-13\">Section 1433(e) prohibits the departure of a vehicle other than in accordance with applicable regulations. Presumably, Caldera could have been accused of violating that provision; he was charged instead with violating section 1459(d), which proscribes unlawful departure by \u201cany person required to report to a designated customs facility under [section 1459(a), (b), or (c) ].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-14\">Caldera is not a person described in subsection (a), regarding persons not arriving by conveyance, or subsection (c), regarding persons arriving by <em>unreported </em>conveyance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, to be guilty of an offense under subsection (d), he must qualify as a person described in subsection (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>That subsection imposes a reporting requirement only upon \u201cpassengers and crew members.\u201d There is no suggestion that Caldera, travelling alone in an automobile, could be considered a \u201ccrew member.\u201d The word \u201cpassenger,\u201d though not defined in the subject statute, is commonly thought of \u201cas meaning any occupant of a vehicle <em>other than the person operating it.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1123 (6th ed. 1990) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Hence, Caldera, being neither a \u201cpassenger\u201d nor a \u201ccrew member,\u201d cannot be guilty of violating section 1459(d). This makes sense when sections 1433 and 1459 are read together. Section 1433(b) requires the person in charge of a vehicle to report its arrival in the United States and to present it for inspection; section 1433(e) prohibits the vehicle\u2019s unlawful departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Section 1459(b) covers not the driver and vehicle, but the passengers, requiring them to report; section 1459(d) prohibits the unauthorized departure of such passengers. Thus, read <em>in pari materia, </em>the two sections, without redundancy, require all persons to report and not to depart without authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Because Caldera was not a passenger, he cannot be criminally liable under section 1459. Accordingly, his conviction on four counts of violating that section must be, and are hereby, REVERSED.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b534-13\">.
