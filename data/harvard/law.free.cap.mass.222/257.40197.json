The facts which could have been found in favor of the plaintiff upon the evidence are stated in the opinion. At the close of the evidence the defendant asked the judge to order a verdict for it. This the judge refused to do, and submitted the case to the jury with instructions to which no exceptions were taken. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $657; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b284-7\"><em>J. T.

The seat which she took was the last empty seat in the car. At the transfer station at the City Hall, which the car reached before it came to the \u201cdepot stopping place,\u201d a number of persons got on the car. All the seats in the car being full (as we have already said) those persons had to and did stand on the running board. When the car reached the \u201cdepot stopping place\u201d the plaintiff stood up and moved across to the end of the rear seat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>in order to get off. But the people on the running board would not move although she asked them to move away and let her pass. \u201cThey kept laughing and they kept pushing toward the front and toward the rear; they kept pushing toward the back on the running board; none of them got off; they tried to push; before I vacated my seat they tried to get it; . . . the conductor was on the rear platform; he gave no signal at all; did not help me in any way.\u201d After the car had been standing for three minutes and she had failed to secure an opportunity to alight, (in the words of her testimony) she \u201cfound a small space enough that I could put my foot on, and while I was getting my foot out they kept pushing forward and backwards on the running board, and before I had my foot down that space was taken by a foot; my foot stepped on that foot, and my foot turned and I fell down; I broke my ankle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">It is the duty of \u00e1 common carrier to exercise the highest degree of care (which is consistent with its equal duty to its other passengers) to afford a passenger who wishes to alight at a stopping place at which its car has stopped a reasonable opportunity to do so. See for example <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>West End Street Railway, </em>178 Mass. 116,119; <em>McCumber </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>207 Mass. 559, 562. In the case at bar the jury were warranted in finding that the conductor who was on the rear platform saw or ought to have seen what took place as stated above. And they were warranted in making the further finding that he was negligent in not seeing to it that the plaintiff had an opportunity to step down on to the running board and from there to the ground in alighting from the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The defendant\u2019s main contention is founded on the fact that the plaintiff in her cross examination testified: \"that she did not think there was any disorder on the car; that everybody seemed to be orderly; everybody behaving themselves.\u201d And in that connection it relies upon what was said by this court in <em>McCumber </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>207 Mass. 559, 562. But that was a case in which the plaintiff was pushed off a car by other passengers and it was in that connection that this court said that \u201cthere is nothing in the evidence to indicate that the passengers inside the car were turbulent or disorderly in any respect. . . . The plaintiff does not show any conduct on the part of other passengers which would naturally have caused a careful conductor to appre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>hend violence or disorder on their part or disregard by them of the rights of the plaintiff as a fellow passenger. That there was some pushing in the effort to pass the plaintiff is not significant. It is only when done in a disorderly way that it becomes of consequence.\u201d There are somewhat similar remarks in <em>Willworth </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>188 Mass. 220, 222. What was said in <em>McCumber </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, ubi supra, </em>does not apply to the case at bar where the plaintiff, who had been blocked for three minutes by other passengers standing in her way, was forced to push her way through the block without the conductor making any effort to assist her in alighting.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">There is nothing in the other cases cited by the defendant which requires special notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The entry must be</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
