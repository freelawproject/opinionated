He further testified that on February 9, 1887, when he was living in Boston, he executed a certain document or order to the effect that in consideration of the payment of $500 the defendant released and assigned to his brothers and sisters and their issue all and whatever interest he might have as heir at law in his father\u2019s and mother\u2019s estates; that this was a subterfuge and was done for the purpose of saving his inheritance from confiscation by the Austrian Government because of his failure to render military service.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-6\">The plaintiff previously had testified that the drawing and execution of this paper was \u201ca bluff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-7\">Another statement was introduced and allowed in evidence, which was signed in Austria by the remaining children including the plaintiff, dated March 27, 1887, to the effect that notwithstanding the waiver of inheritance made by the defendant in the statement above described the brothers and sisters agreed that he still had equal inheritance rights with them in the mother\u2019s and father\u2019s estates.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-8\">A letter dated March 30, 1887, written by the plaintiff to the defendant was offered in evidence by the defendant in substance acknowledging the receipt of the assignment described above dated February 9, 1887, and enclosing the statement of the brothers and sisters dated_March 27, 1887, which also is described above. This letter was excluded against the exception of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-9\">In 1906 the father died leaving a will, dated March 12, 1897, in which the plaintiff was named a general heir so called and in which the plaintiff was left all the father\u2019s, property with instructions to pay the children two thousand florins each, amounting in United States money to about $820, with the exception of a sister Anna Wenz, who was given four thousand florins (about $1,640) and the defendant who was given three hundred florins (about $123) with the explanation that he had received his in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>heritance share for which the father had received his acknowledgment which was among his papers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-5\">The defendant offered evidence to show the value of the father\u2019s estate for the purpose of showing the defendant\u2019s proportionate share. The evidence was excluded against the defendant\u2019s exception. It appeared that the mother died in 1912, and that nothing further was done by either the plaintiff or the defendant in regard to the defendant\u2019s share in her estate and that no accounting or adjustment ever was had in regard to it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-6\">At the close of the evidence the defendant asked the judge to make the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-7\">\u201c 1. There is nothing in the letter of January 14,1907, amounting to an acknowledgment of a prior indebtedness and a clear and definite promise to pay the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-8\"><em>\u201c2. </em>There is nothing in the instrument dated November 13, 1911, amounting to an acknowledgment of a prior indebtedness and a clear and definite promise to pay the same.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-9\">\u201c4. There is nothing in the instrument dated November 16, 1911, amounting to an acknowledgment of a prior indebtedness and a clear and definite promise to pay the same.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-10\">The judge refused to make any of these rulings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-11\">In his charge to the jury the judge said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-12\">\" Counsel for the plaintiff has called my attention to one fact that I certainly had overlooked, that there is other evidence here tending to take the matter out of the statute of limitations, and that is that there was a payment made by the defendant to the suit, of $122.40, on November 16, 1911. Now that, if made with that amount of $122.40, is the share of the defendant in his father\u2019s estate, or rather, the bequest that came to him by his father\u2019s will, as I understand it; and the defendant says about that, that it ought not to be treated as a payment, because it didn\u2019t- go through his hands at all. It isn\u2019t necessary that it should go through his hands. It is necessary, however, that it should have been taken from the estate by the plaintiff with the knowledge and consent and under the direction of the defendant. If, for instance, the defendant, knowing nothing about the money having become due him, the plaintiff simply took it and held it without the knowledge or consent of the defendant, and credited it as a payment, that would not be a payment. But if simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>the defendant at that time said to him, \u2018Take that money, keep it, and credit it to me, take it as so much payment on account/ then it is a payment just as much as though he had it in his own hands and handed it over to him or sent it to him by letter. If you say there was a payment at that time, that is sufficient to take it out of the statute of limitations, whether there is anything in the letters or instruments to take it out or not.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-5\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $2,568.60, and by direction of the judge returned a verdict for the defendant on his claim in set-off in the sum of $163.19.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-6\">The defendant alleged exceptions to the refusal of the judge to allow the introduction of evidence to show the value of the father\u2019s estate for the purpose of showing the amount of the defendant\u2019s share in it, to that portion of the judge\u2019s charge referring to the payment of $122.40, to the exclusion of the letter dated March 30, 1887, and to the refusal to give the rulings requested.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b346-7\"><em>II. A. Wilson, F. Juggins &amp; T. F. Murphy, </em>for the defendant, submitted a brief.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b346-8\">J. <em>G.

The exceptions relate to the issues raised by the answers of payment and the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">1. The offer of evidence to show the value of the estate of their father properly was excluded. Even if we disregard the purpose and legal effect of the agreement by which the defendant waived his claim of inheritance, and of the declaration signed by his brothers and sisters acknowledging his equal inheritance rights notwithstanding the waiver, the offer did not purport to show that the plaintiff ever received from the estate any money to which the defendant was entitled except the legacy of three hundred gulden; and this he directed the plaintiff to keep on account of the loan. If the defendant had a further and unliquidated claim against the plaintiff, growing out of the joint executory contract, it could not be litigated in this action, under a plea of payment. See <em>Borden </em>v. <em>Sackett, </em>113 Mass. 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">The letter of the plaintiff dated March 30 was rightly excluded for the same reason, and for the further reason that it added nothing to the declaration already in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>2. It is a settled principle that in order to avoid the statute of limitations there must be either a new express promise to pay, or one which the law implies from an acknowledgment of the debt as a present indebtedness; and the promise, whether express or implied, must be unconditional, or there must be evidence that the .condition has been performed. <em>Custy </em>v. <em>Donlan, </em>159 Mass. 245. <em>Gillingham </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>178 Mass. 417. The requests for rulings call for the application of this principle to three documents signed by the defendant. R. L. c. 202, \u00a7 12. The first, which was the letter dated January 14,1907, after reciting that the defendant earlier had written \u201cthat you should keep this money and that the time will come when I will pay you the money,\u201d added \u201cwhich it is my intention to do.\u201d This was an unqualified acknowledgment of present indebtedness, sufficient to avoid the statute, even assuming that the sentence \"As soon as I do not have to give all my money at home, I will save some for myself and send it to you,\u201d should be construed as a conditional promise. The second paper, dated November 13, 1911, after authorizing the plaintiff to apply upon the debt certain moneys of the defendant, added: \u201cThe amount as claimed by Franz Wenz is 3600/46 gulden. In case there is any think [sic] left it should be served [sic] to me or if any think [sic] is short by law I will make good.\u201d This was an absolute promise to pay the debt. <em>Nathan </em>v. <em>Leland, </em>193 Mass. 576. The third document, dated November 16, 1911, after setting out the account in detail, expressly declared, \"I acknowledge the complete correctness of this statement and debt,\u201d and unconditionally promised to \u201cmake settlement\u201d of any \u201cshortage\u201d left after the plaintiff should apply on account a certain inheritance then due to the defendant. We find no error in the judge\u2019s refusal to give the three rulings requested:</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">3. The plaintiff testified that on November 16, 1911, the year after he had come to Boston, he received from the defendant a payment on account of the debt amounting to $122.40. From the testimony, and the statement of November 16, 1911, signed by the defendant, it appears to have been an unconditional payment on account of this debt. As such it was sufficient to take the debt out of the statute of limitations, irrespective of the acknowledgments in writing already referred to. <em>Gillingham </em>v. <em>Brown, ubi supra. </em>If the letter of January 14, 1907, referred to the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>money, that letter was an earlier authorization to apply it on account of the defendant\u2019s debt when the plaintiff later should receive the inheritance money. The portion of the judge\u2019s charge which dealt with the application of this money by direction of the defendant was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-3\">It follows that all the exceptions taken by the defendant must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
