The only question open is whether the decree conforms to the allegations of the bill and could lawfully be entered on the facts found. It is a simple bill under R. L. c. 159, \u00a7 3, cl. 7, as amended by St. 1910, c. 531, \u00a7 2, to establish the plaintiff\u2019s debt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>and reach and apply an interest of the principal defendant in partnership property which cannot be attached or seized on execution in an action at law. The finding establishes the debt, the decree is in accordance therewith and in appropriate terms orders the sale of the defendant\u2019s interest in the partnership property. It is too plain for discussion that there is no merit in the appeal.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b193-6\"><em>H. A.
