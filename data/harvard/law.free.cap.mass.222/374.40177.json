There are some cases of somewhat similar character; I don\u2019t remember any case just like that.\u201d Whereupon the counsel for the plaintiff said, \u201cI don\u2019t myself.\u201d The judge then said, \u201cI think that it would be safer not to ask it, but I leave that for you to decide; I don\u2019t now remember any case similar to that.\u201d Whereupon the counsel for the plaintiff said, \u201cWell, I guess as long as there is objection, I won\u2019t press it.\u201d The talk above stated was all had within the hearing of the' jury. The defendant excepted to this proceeding and to the statement of the judge above set forth, and in taking his exception stated \u201cthat the evidence was either admissible or inadmissible; that such a course of proceeding in front of the jury could not be other than prejudicial to the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>The material evidence and the other exceptions of the defendant are described in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-3\">There was a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $15,000; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b402-4\"><em>H.

The principal questions for decision are whether as matter of law there was any evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s due care, or of the defendant\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">As to the first question the jury would have been warranted in finding substantially the following facts. The plaintiff on boarding the car, having found \u201cthe place inside was thronged with folks standing having hold of those straps and hanging to the top,\u201d stood with his back \"against the door of the car that you go into off the landing\u201d until the car from the rate of speed began to lurch when he grasped \u201cthe sill of the door . . . with both hands.\u201d When the car was passing over the curve of a turnout it lurched so violently that \u201che went quick out the door down on to the turnout,\u201d suffering severe injuries. It is conceded that he was a passenger, and even if he testified that he was familiar \u201cwith the running of cars on this particular line\u201d the jury were to say <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>whether he acted carelessly. <em>Heshion </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>208 Mass. 117, 118, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">As to the second question, a rule of the defendant required that \u201cThe cars must be operated slowly and with special care over frogs, switches, crossovers and sharp curves,\u201d and the motorman called by the defendant was asked in cross-examination, \u201cYou knew the rule that in coming in and out of this turnout you knew you should run your car very slowly,\u201d replied \u201cYes, sir.\u201d It is true he also said that the car ran \u201cnot any faster than four or five miles an hour.\u201d But the plaintiff testified that the lurch was \u201can unusual one,\u201d \u201cnot an ordinary lurch that threw him off\u201d and a witness in his behalf also a passenger gave evidence, that the car \u201cspeeded up some\u201d and was going \u201cfast.\u201d The fact moreover, as the jury could find, that the plaintiff \u201cwent head first out of the door,\u201d as described by this witness, was evidence from which the inference would be warranted not only that the car was operated in violation of the rule, but also the motorman in the exercise of ordinary prudence ought to have known that the speed was so excessive that unless slackened the safety of passengers might be imperilled. The question of the defendant\u2019s negligence also was for the jury, and all the requests were rightly denied. <em>Sweetland </em>v. <em>Lynn &amp; Boston Railroad, </em>177 Mass. 574, 578. <em>Spooner </em>v. <em>Old Colony Street Railway, </em>190 Mass. 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Nor is reversible error shown in the conduct of the trial. The colloquy or discussion was within the discretion of the presiding judge whose common law powers of comment as to the reception or exclusion of evidence either offered or proposed has not been curtailed by statute. <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Wellesley &amp; Boston Street Railway, </em>197 Mass. 495, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
