Kenney, the sister of Thomas H. Kenney, deceased, as having been one of his next of kin and wholly dependent upon his earnings for support, Kenney having been at the time of his death in the employ of the city of Boston as a janitor in a building called Curtis Hall in the part of that city called Jamaica Plain, and the claim being made under St. 1913, c. 807.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-11\">The case was heard by the Industrial Accident Board upon the report of an arbitration committee, no new evidence being presented before the board. A transcript of all the material evidence presented before the arbitration committee was attached to their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>report. The committee found that Thomas H. Kenney was a janitor in the employ of the city of Boston at Curtis Hall and received the injury which resulted in his death while fixing a pump in the swimming pool of Curtis Hall on December 26,1914, that his finger was jammed in the pump and later blood poisoning set in, causing his death on January 5,1915; that the employee was unmarried and lived at home with his two sisters, one of whom, Anne U. Kenney, kept house and was wholly dependent upon him for support at the time of his death; and that the other sister, Jane E. Kenney, earned her own living. They found that the average weekly wages of the employee were $23.01. The material evidence upon the question of the dependency of Anne U. Kenney is described in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-5\">The Industrial Accident Board found that Thomas H. Kenney was a workman in the employ of the city of Boston; that while employed as a workman he received a personal injury arising out of and in the course of his employment, which resulted in his death; that his average weekly wages were $23.01; that the claimant, Anne U. Kenney, a sister of the employee, was wholly dependent upon his earnings for support at the time of his injury and was entitled to a weekly compensation of $10 for a period of four hundred weeks from the date of the injury, that is, from December 26,1914, from the city of Boston.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-6\">In the Superior Court the case was heard by <em>Morton, </em>J., who made a decree affirming the decision of the Industrial Accident Board.

Kenney was a \u201cworkman\u201d in its employ, within the scope of St. 1913, c. 807 (which provides compensation for certain public employees); and that the personal injury which resulted in his death arose out of and in the course of his employment. The controversy relates only to the finding and decision of the board that the claimant Anne U. Kenney, a sister of the employee, was wholly dependent upon his earnings for support at the time of his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">Although there is no appeal from the finding of the board upon questions of fact <em>(Diaz\u2019s Case, </em>217 Mass. 36; <em>Bentley\u2019s Case, </em>217 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Mass. 79), nevertheless, where all the evidence is reported, there is open for revision the question of law, whether there was any evidence to support the findings. There also is necessarily involved the inquiry whether the board, in applying the law to the facts, correctly interpreted the terms \u201cwholly\u201d and \u201cpartially dependent,\u201d as used in the workmen\u2019s compensation act. <em>Herrick\u2019s Case, </em>217 Mass. 111. <em>Sponatski\u2019s Case, </em>220 Mass. 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">On the issue of the claimant\u2019s dependency upon her brother, Thomas H. Kenney, the board were justified in finding the following facts: Fifteen years before his death, and under his promise to support her, the claimant was induced to remain at home and take charge of the household. The family then comprised their invalid mother (who died later), their father (who died in December, 1910), a younger sister, Jane E. Kenney, the brother Thomas H. Kenney (who died on January 5, 1915), and the claimant. The sister Jane paid $15 a month for her board. Thomas furnished all other money needed to support the household, every month giving directly to the claimant $20 in money, and $3 a week, received as rental from a house owned by the three in common. He also paid the bills for rent, gas, coal and milk. In addition, he paid for all her clothes, and gave her whatever she needed. There was no agreement in regard to wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">St. 1913, c. 807, adopted the provisions for compensation set forth in the workmen\u2019s compensation act. Accordingly, in case of fatal injury to a workman employed by a city that has accepted the provisions of the act, a certain weekly payment for a specified period is to be made to \u201cthe dependents of the employee, wholly dependent upon his earnings for support at the time of injury.\u201d If the employee leaves \u201cdependents only partially dependent upon his earnings for support at the time of his injury\u201d they are to receive a smaller payment. St. 1911, c. 751, Part II, \u00a7 6, as amended by St. 1914, c. 708, \u00a7 2. A husband, wife or child under certain circumstances is \u201cconclusively presumed to be wholly dependent for support upon a deceased employee;\u201d and \u201cIn all other cases questions of dependency, in whole or in part, shall be determined in accordance with the fact, as the fact may be at the time of the injury.\u201d Part II, \u00a7 7 of the act, as amended by St. 1914, c. 708, \u00a7 3. The word \u201cdependents,\u201d as used in the act, is therein defined as meaning \u201cmembers of the employee\u2019s family or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>next of kin who were wholly or partly dependent upon the earnings of the employee for support at the time of the injury.\u201d Part V, \u00a7 2. It is the contention of the employer that on the facts found here, there is no warrant for a finding that the claimant was a \u201c dependent,\u201d within the meaning of that word as used in the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">It has been pointed out that this statute is based on the theory of compensation. See <em>Cripps\u2019s Case, </em>216 Mass. 586; <em>Nelson\u2019s Case, </em>217 Mass. 467. In the case at bar the earnings of the employee were the chief source to which the claimant looked for her maintenance and support. Apparently his regular and substantial payments were given by him and received by her, not as a gratuity, but in recognition of a moral if not a legal obligation to support her, in accordance with the promise made when he induced her to become a non-producer. This is enough to create a relation of dependency as a basis for compensation. <em>Caliendo\u2019s Case, </em>219 Mass. 498. <em>Main Colliery Co. Ltd. </em>v. <em>Davies, </em>[1900] <em>A. </em>C. 358. <em>Houlihan </em>v. <em>Connecticut River Railroad, </em>164 Mass. 555. <em>Wilber </em>v. <em>New England Order of Protection, </em>192 Mass. 477. <em>Mehan </em>v. <em>Lowell Electric Light Corp. </em>192 Mass. 53. And, adopting what was said in <em>Herrick\u2019s Case, </em>217 Mass. 111, 113, \u201cthat but for her sense of duty, because she thought that her father [in this case brother] needed her care, she might have continued to earn enough for her own support, and to be independent of him, cannot be decisive as matter of law against her claim.\u201d <em>Howells </em>v. <em>Vivian &amp; Sons, </em>4 W. C. C. 106. The contention that the claimant was employed as a housekeeper, under a contract for wages, is disposed of by the findings of fact, fully warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">While we are of opinion that the facts warrant a finding that the claimant was \u201cdependent,\u201d we do not think there was warrant for the finding that she was \u201cwholly dependent\u201d upon the employee\u2019s earnings for support at the time of his injury. Admittedly she had $600 in a bank, and one third interest in unincumbered and productive real estate in Boston that was assessed for $1,300. This separate and independent fund of her own, available for her support, is too substantial to be ignored. In <em>Buckley\u2019s Case, </em>218 Mass. 354, the claimant was frail, and the interest she had in a piece of real estate was of little, if any, value for use or for sale. In <em>Carter\u2019s Case, </em>221 Mass. 105, also, the claimant was too ill to go out to work, and the fact that she had saved $100, of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>fifty or sixty dollars had been used since the death of the employee, was deemed to have practically no bearing upon the question of her total dependency. We do not take into consideration what has come to her as one of his heirs, because the act points to matters antecedent to the employee\u2019s death. <em>Pryce </em>v. <em>Penrikyber Navigation Colliery Co. Ltd. </em>[1902] 1 K. B. 221. But wholly aside from that, on the facts, the employer in the present case was entitled to the ruling which in substance it requested, that the claimant was not shown to be \u201cwholly dependent\u201d upon the said Thomas H. Kenney. In other respects the record discloses no error of law. That the claimant was one of the next of kin of the deceased employee is not disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">It follows from what has been said that the case should be remanded to the Industrial Accident Board for further hearing, in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">\n<em>Decree reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
