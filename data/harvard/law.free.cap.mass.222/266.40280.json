At the close of the evidence the judge refused to rule, as requested by the defendant, that upon all the evidence the plaintiff was not entitled to recover. There was a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $500; and the defendant alleged exceptions, which, by reason of the physical disability of <em>Quinn, </em>J., were allowed by <em>Jenney, </em>J.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b292-11\">P. <em>F.

At the time of the accident there were twenty or twenty-five persons on the station platform, which could accommodate between four and five thousand.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-14\">We can find no evidence in the record of previous acts at this station, from which it could be inferred that injury was likely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>to happen to the plaintiff by being crowded against an approaching car. The only evidence on this point was \u201cthat the people there were not orderly; that they almost ran to the cars,\u201d \u2014 referring to the time of the plaintiff\u2019s injury. There was nothing in this to show any previous disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">There was also evidence that on several occasions, at this particular time in the morning, passengers were seen to jump on the cars. There was no evidence that harm came to any one from this \u201cjumping;\u201d there was nothing in the manner of the crowding or pushing which made it unsafe for passengers and nothing was shown which would notify the defendant of danger or cause it to anticipate injury to the plaintiff. We think the case cannot be distinguished from <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>217 Mass. 515, and cases therein cited, and it is governed thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The defendant\u2019s exceptions are sustained, and in accordance with St. 1909, c. 236, judgment is to be entered in the Superior Court for the defendant and a rescript is to go to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
