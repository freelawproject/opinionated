It did not appear that any warning signal of the approach of the car was given, nor that there was any obstruction to the view between the place of the accident and the last stopping place of the car. <em>Held, </em>that the evidence did not warrant a submission of the case to the jury.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-12\">Tort for personal injuries received by the plaintiff, a boy ten years of age, when he was run into by an electric street car of the defendant.

It did not appear that any gong was sounded or whistle blown, nor did it appear that there was any obstruction to the view between Olive Street and the place of the accident. The testimony further warranted a finding that the car was running at the rate of twenty miles an hour, and that \u201cit stopped quickly, for what the car was going.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Under all the circumstances we are of opinion that the evidence did not warrant a submission to the jury of the issue of the defendant\u2019s negligence predicated'upon the fact that the motorman ran his car between streets at the rate of twenty miles an hour, or upon his alleged failure to sound the gong, to blow the whistle, or to anticipate that a boy of the plaintiff\u2019s age would rush suddenly and impetuously upon the track and, in the face of an oncoming and plainly visible car, stop there. The direction of the verdict for the defendant was clearly right.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
