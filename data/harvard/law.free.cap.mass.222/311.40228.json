Writ dated April 27, 1910.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-5\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Aiken, </em>C. J. The facts which appeared in evidence are stated in the opinion. The plaintiff objected to the admission of any evidence in regard to the defendant\u2019s transactions with one Van Deusen. Whereupon the defendant offered to prove that he made a contract with' Van Deusen for five car loads of hay to be delivered at Holyoke; that he paid for the five car loads, including the freight; that he had no communication, directly or indirectly, with anybody connected with the plaintiff until he handed in his bill of lading for the purpose of getting his goods; that when he handed in his bill of lading there was nothing said in regard to freight or ownership; that of those five car loads that he ordered from Van Deusen he had not been called upon by the plaintiff to pay the freight on three, and that the two in suit were the remaining ones of. the five; that in a freight bill delivered by the plaintiff to the defendant, covering a number of items and several days, the two items in issue had been included and that those two items were struck out, by whom was uncertain, it being contended on one side that the striking out was done by a representative of the plaintiff and on the other side that it was done by a representative of the defendant, the deduction at the foot of the bill being by one Rogers, the cashier of the plaintiff at Holyoke; that two of the plaintiff\u2019s representatives, Rogers, and one Boss, the freight agent of the plaintiff having charge of its business, asked Van Deusen for payment of the bills in issue before the bringing of this action; that Van Deusen was adjudicated a bankrupt on March 12, 1908, before the bringing of this action; that at the time the defendant received the goods he did not know that the plaintiff looked to him for the freight, and that the defendant refused to pay the charges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Upon this offer the Chief Justice ruled that the facts contained in the offer were insufficient as a matter of defence, and ordered a verdict for the plaintiff. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $142.18; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-3\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b339-4\"><em>T. B. O\u2019Donnell &amp; A. E. Orrell, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b339-5\"><em>W. S. Robinson &amp; E. T. Broadhurst, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b339-6\">De Courcy, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ArY\">One of the terms of both the bills of lading was: \u201cOwner or consignee shall pay freight at the rate herein stated, and all other charges accruing on said property, before delivery.\u201d The defendant, as purchaser and holder of the bills of lading, indorsed by the consignee, became the owner of the hay represented thereby; <em>Forbes </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Lowell Railroad, </em>133 Mass. 154; and his acceptance and receipt of the hay would warrant, if it did not require, a finding that he accepted the stipulations contained in the bills of lading and impliedly agreed to pay the freight. <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Central Vermont Railroad, </em>170 Mass. 129. <em>New York, New Haven, &amp; Hartford Railroad </em>v. <em>York &amp; Whitney Co. </em>215 Mass. 36, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">The defendant, admittedly the owner of the goods, contends that the evidence embraced in his offer of proof would warrant a verdict in his favor. Apparently this is on the ground that one Van Deusen, whom the defendant says he saw when first he bought the hay, was liable for the freight. But so far as the record shows the plaintiff had no knowledge or notice that Van Deusen had any interest in the hay when it waived its lien and delivered the goods to the defendant. The words \u201cNotify Jas. M. Van Deusen At Springfield Mass\u201d did not indicate that he was consignee; but on the contrary it appeared in the line above that the goods were consigned to H. W. Porter. <em>Wright &amp; Colton Wire Cloth Co. </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>177 Mass. 283. Nothing was offered to contradict the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, that before delivery of the goods to the defendant it received from Van Deusen no written or oral direction relative to such delivery; and that, after the delivery, it requested him to pay the freight only as an accommodation to and without waiving its right to collect from the defendant. In short, the evidence introduced, together with that offered, would not warrant the jury in finding that the plaintiff looked to Van <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Deusen instead of the defendant for the freight, either originally or by novation. <em>Stowell </em>v. <em>Gram, </em>184 Mass. 562. The offer to show that \u201cat the time the defendant received the goods he did not know that the plaintiff looked to him for the freight,\u201d must be considered in connection with the facts that the plaintiff had a lien on the hay for its freight charges, that it delivered the goods to the defendant without collecting freight only because he was on the railroad\u2019s credit list and paid weekly, and that the plaintiff had a right to assume that the defendant would recognize his legal liability to pay the freight under the terms of his bill of lading. In the circumstances disclosed, his ignorance of the fact that the plaintiff looked to him for the freight does not relieve him from the liability imposed on him by law, as already set forth. <em>Singer </em>v. <em>Merchants Despatch Transportation Co. </em>191 Mass. 449. <em>Pennsylvania Railroad </em>v. <em>Titus, </em>216 N. Y. 17. <em>Union Pacific Railroad </em>v. <em>American Smelting &amp; Refining Co. </em>202 Fed. Rep. 720.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">In our opinion the Chief Justice was right in ruling that the facts contained in the offer of proof were insufficient as a matter of defence.' The parties having consented that if this ruling was right judgment is to be entered for the plaintiff on the verdict, that entry must be made in accordance with the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
