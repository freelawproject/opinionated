While this application for transfer was pending the plaintiffs and the defendant executed a lease of the fixtures and furniture on the premises to which the plaintiffs wished to have their liquor license transferred. This was a lease dated April 28, 1914, for the term of one year from the first day of May, 1914. The rent stated in the lease was $350, to be paid in advance. The plaintiffs were allowed by the judge to introduce evidence that at the time when the plaintiffs signed th\u00e9 lease the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney said to the defendant, \u201cWhat if we don\u2019t get our transfer?\u201d to which the defendant answered, pointing to the lease, \u201cIf you don\u2019t get your transfer that don\u2019t go. You will get your money back.\u201d To this one of the plaintiffs said, \u201cDo we get our money back?\u201d and the defendant answered, \u201cI think you know me well enough to trust me.\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 attorney further testified that it was not suggested that the lease should be held in escrow. The lease themwas signed and delivered by the defendant to the plaintiffs and the plaintiffs paid the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>iendant the $350 which was to be paid in advance. The defendant testified that no such conversation took place. Later the selectmen refused to grant the transfer of the liquor license for which the plaintiffs had asked. Thereupon the plaintiffs asked for the repayment of the $350. On the defendant\u2019s refusal to make repayment this action was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The case was tried before a judge of the Superior Court <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> sitting without a jury. The judge \u201cfound for the defendant, and filed\u201d a \u201cmemorandum of decision,\u201d in which he found that the oral agreement testified to by the plaintiffs was in fact made but that \u201cit was not agreed that the lease was to be held in escrow, or delivered upon condition, or that the money paid thereunder was to be held upon condition.\u201d He further stated in the \u201cmemorandum\u201d that \u201cthe defendant objected to the admission of the oral testimony\u201d as to what took place at the time of the execution of the lease; \u201cbut in order to fully find the facts, I admitted said evidence subject to her exception. But upon the facts found, I rule as a matter of law that the plaintiffs cannot recover, and direct a finding for the defendant. If my ruling is erroneous, a finding for the plaintiffs is to be entered for $350 with interest from the date of the writ. It is agreed by the parties that if the oral testimony above referred to was not properly admitted, the defendant\u2019s exception to its admission is to be sustained and judgment is to be entered for the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The evidence admitted contradicted the terms of the lease. The lease by its terms provided that the defendant demised to the plaintiffs the fixtures and furniture in question for a year, to be paid for in advance. The. oral agreement provided that if the transfer of the liquor license asked for by them should not be granted the lease should terminate or not go into effect and the rent should be repaid. It is plain that this oral agreement contradicts or modifies the terms of the lease, and. that it is not an oral agreement collateral to the written agreement which does not modify or contradict the written lease. A collection of cases of that kind may be found in <em>Keith </em>v. <em>Radway, </em>221 Mass. 515, 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">It is not necessary to collect the cases on the well settled proposition that an oral agreement is not admissible to contradict or modify a written contract. For some of the recent cases see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number><em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Goding, </em>182 Mass. 231; <em>Gaston </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>208 Mass. 265; <em>Rochester Tumbler Works </em>v. <em>Mitchell Woodbury Co. </em>215 Mass. 194; <em>Goldenberg </em>v. <em>Taglino, </em>218 Mass. 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">It also is settled that where the oral testimony is admitted it does not control the written contract. <em>Butterick Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>203 Mass. 122. <em>Mears </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>199 Mass. 319. <em>Black </em>v. <em>Bachelder, </em>120 Mass. 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">We have examined all the eases cited by the plaintiffs and with the exception of a dictum in <em>Browning </em>v. <em>Haskell, </em>22 Pick. 310, 311, there is nothing in them which gives countenance to their contention. There is a dictum in <em>Browning </em>v. <em>Haskell </em>which does help the plaintiffs. That was an action for use and occupation of a farm. In defence the defendant set up a written lease of the farm and called a subscribing witness to prove its execution. The subscribing witness testified that when the lease relied upon by the defendant was executed the plaintiff at first refused to sign it because it did not conform to the previous verbal agreement; that the defendant thereupon said he could not go upon the farm unless she signed it, but if she would sign it he would bring up Colonel Kent with him in two or three days and have the lease made out according to the verbal agreement. That the plaintiff thereupon signed the lease; that the defendant came to her house in two days and then she called upon him \u201cto make the lease according as he had agreed,\u201d which he refused to do. Upon this evidence the judge at the trial ruled that the execution of the lease was not proved \u201cexcept upon a condition which had not been performed,\u201d a verdict was found for the plaintiff, and the defendant moved for a new trial. The new trial was granted on the ground that the evidence did not prove a conditional execution or delivery of the lease. Wilde, J., in delivering the opinion of this court, said: \u201cIn the present case, the paroi evidence did not prove any condition, but only that the lessor was induced to sign the lease, on a promise of the lessee which afterwards he refused to perform. He undoubtedly would be responsible, according to the evidence, in an action for the breach of that promise.\u201d The statement that the lessee \u201cundoubtedly would be responsible, according to the evidence, in an action for breach of that [the oral] promise,\u201d is not in accord with the later authorities and cannot be taken to be law now.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b231-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number><em>G.
