We are asked to hold, on a record which recites the substance of all the evidence bearing on the question, that the refusal of the trial judge<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> to rule, \"there is no evidence that the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care in operating the saw in the manner he did at the time of the accident,\u201d was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">The case is close, but we are of opinion that the ruling could not have been given. It was for the jury to say whether they believed the plaintiff\u2019s evidence. He had used the saw table occasionally for five or six weeks, and the general dangers of operating a cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>cular saw were obvious. But on the day of the accident he had been directed by the foreman to run through filler blocks which were to be sawed with \"a scallop on one side and bevel edge on the other.\u201d The saw was dull and the blocks were \u201cunusually wet\u201d requiring much pressure by the sawyer in \u201cputting them through,\u201d conditions the foreman could have been found to have known. What next befell him the jury could view in the light of the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s expert, that \"the shorter the piece the harder to handle. It makes it jump and kick around on the saw considerably unless you handle it just right, and that danger is increased if the wood is wet and the saw is dull. .. . The reason why the dull saw causes the trouble is if the saw gets dull it won\u2019t cut a slot big enough to let the saw pass through.\u201d And he further said, that \u201cthe danger in cutting short stuff when it is wet and with a dull saw is a matter known to expert sawyers alone, men who are skilled.\u201d It \u201cis not a matter that everybody knows without experience and instruction.\u201d \u201cWhen short stuff ... is cut there is danger of jumping and binding.\u201d \u201c It makes a difference which way the wood is being cut on the grain \u2014 also makes a difference whether it is being cut on the bevel or at right angles to the table.\u201d The plaintiff, although he knew the saw was dull, testified that, lacking such instructions or expe? he began to saw a piece of filler block on the \u201cbevel or and when it was half way through the back it \u201ckicked . \u201cjumped,\u201d and that, as he endeavored to hold the bloc? and in place, his hand slipped against the saw.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b384-6\">. <em>J.

The jury could find tin stood on the footing of an inexperienced workman, and th obeying the foreman\u2019s order he had no reason to apprehend , anticipate the peculiar danger to which he might be expose <em>Lavartue </em>v. <em>Ely Lumber Co. </em>213 Mass. 65, 67, and cases cite <em>Kerrigan </em>v. <em>Commercial Brewing Co. </em>216 Mass. 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The case was submitted on briefs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b383-9\"> In one of the defendant\u2019s repair shops at New Haven in the year 1912.
