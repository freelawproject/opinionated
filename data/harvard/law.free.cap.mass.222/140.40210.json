Ward, late of Clinton, having been the only child of his daughter Lottie Ward, who never was married, and further alleging that Cassius M. Ward, whose will had been filed in that court, made no provision for her in his lifetime and omitted to provide for her in his will and that the omission was unintentional and was caused by accident or mistake; praying that the plaintiff might be declared to be entitled to the same share in the estate of Cassius M. Ward which she would have taken if he had died intestate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-11\">The Probate Court made a decree that the plaintiff, Myrtle Anna King, was not entitled to receive any portion of the estate of Cassius M. Ward. The plaintiff appealed, and the case was submitted to <em>Braley, </em>J., upon an agreed statement of facts. He found' and ruled that the plaintiff was not \"the issue of a deceased child\u201d of the testator within the meaning of R. L. c. 135, \u00a7 19, and or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>dered that the decree of the Probate Court dismissing the bill be affirmed. At the request of the plaintiff the justice reported the case for determination by the full court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-5\">R. L. c. 135, \u00a7 19, is as follows: \u201cIf a testator omits to provide in his will for any of his children or for the issue of a deceased child, they shall take the same share of his estate which they would have taken if he had died intestate, unless they have been provided for by the testator in his lifetime or unless it appears that the omission was intentional and was not occasioned by accident or mistake.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b167-6\"><em>L. E. </em>Guillow, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b167-7\"><em>G. E. O\u2019Toole &amp; J. II. O\u2019Brien, </em>for the defendant, submitted a brief.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b167-8\">Pierce, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHN\">The petitioner asks that the words \u201cissue of any deceased child\u201d in Rev. Sts. c. 62, \u00a7 21, as re-enacted without other than a slight verbal change in Gen. Sts. c. 92, \u00a7 25; Pub. Sts. c. 127, \u00a7 21; R. L. c. 135, \u00a7 19, shall be read to include illegitimate issue as well as legitimate issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">Such interpretation would involve reconsideration of <em>Kent </em>v. <em>Barker, </em>2 Gray, 535, wherein the word \u201cchildren\u201d was adjudged to mean only legitimate children.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">In effect the argument is that that decision should be reversed because of change in public policy and in judicial sentiment in relation to the treatment of this kind of sociological problems. See <em>dicta, Buckley </em>v. <em>Frasier, </em>153 Mass. 525. But the question is no longer open. \u201cWhen the same Legislature, in a later statute, uses the terms of an earlier one which has received a judicial construction, that construction is to be given to the later statute. And this is manifestly right. For if it were intended to exclude any known construction of a previous statute, the legal presumption is, that its terms would be so changed as to effect that intention.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hartnett, </em>3 Gray, 450. <em>Shelton </em>v. <em>Sears, </em>187 Mass. 455, 459. Black on Interpretation of Laws, (2d ed.) \u00a7 179. <em>Douglass </em>v. <em>County of Pike, </em>101 U. S. 677.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">With the word \u201cchildren\u201d in the statute qualified by the word \u201clegitimate,\u201d it cannot be doubted upon the reasoning of <em>Kent </em>v. <em>Barker, supra, </em>that the words \u201cissue of a deceased child\u201d should be construed to mean legitimate issue of any legitimate deceased child, and we so hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>It becomes unnecessary to consider whether the omission of the petitioner from the will was intentional or was or was not due to accident or mistake. The decree of the single justice affirming the decree of the Probate Court must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
