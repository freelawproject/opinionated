The plaintiff sues her father-in-law for alienation of her husband\u2019s affections and for enticing him to leave her home whereby she lost his \u201c company, society, aid, and assistance.\u201d To entitle her to go to the jury she was required to show that the defendant\u2019s conduct was actuated by malice, and that through his efforts her husband\u2019s affections were alienated, and he was induced to separate from her. A father from parental affection may advise his son to discontinue the marital relation, and no action lies if such advice, honestly given, results in a separation. But if because of hostility and ill will to his son\u2019s wife he procures the separation, her conjugal rights are invaded, justification fails, malice is proved and damages may be recovered. <em>Geromini </em>v. Brunelle, 214 Mass. 492, and cases cited. <em>Nolin </em>v. <em>Pearson, </em>191 Mass. 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The question ordinarily is one of fact. If not expressly conceded, the following facts were uncontroverted. The plaintiff\u2019s husband, a man of mature years,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> associated in business with the defendant, married without the knowledge or assent of his father. It was not until two weeks after marriage that the husband and wife called at the defendant\u2019s home, where she was not welcomed but coldly received, the defendant being aggrieved because of his son\u2019s failure to inform him that he intended to be married. During the nine succeeding years, or until the son\u2019s death, the defendant\u2019s demeanor did not change, and he invariably treated the plaintiff with stolid indifference. He never entered her home, or voluntarily engaged her in conversation, and refused to recognize her on the street even when accompanied by her husband. The defendant was a witness at the trial, and'the jury could say from his attitude shown by argumentative replies to questions of counsel and of the court, as well as from the character of his evidence, that from the beginning he exhibited a positive dislike of the plaintiff, which as time went on seemed to have deepened into a feeling closely akin to hatred. It was within this setting that the jury could consider the evidence introduced by the plaintiff as to the defendant\u2019s purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">We shall not review the testimony in detail. It comprises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>nearly twenty-eight quarto pages. A reference to the material portions will suffice. The jury could find that for nearly six years the plaintiff and her husband dwelt in harmony and contentment. A change, however, in their relations then took place, initiated by the husband. Reproached by his wife, she testified, that \u201che told me the reason of the coldness was on account of his father; that he had to please one or the other, and that they were always nagging him to leave me, and it was not his fault; that he was between two fires; that he did not know just what to do; he did not know which one to please, the father or I.\u201d It appeared that, although there was no open matrimonial rupture, an interview with counsel purporting to act for her husband shortly followed. What then took place was for the jury. They could say that she was asked to consent to a divorce or some form of separation \u201cin order to please his father.\u201d And that at a subsequent meeting her husband, when blamed for his conduct, replied that \u201che was forced to do it by his father.\u201d Nor does it seem to have been disputed that thereafter the husband and wife occupied separate rooms, and he began to absent himself for long periods. The defendant contended that his absence became necessary because of engagements as a travelling salesman. But the jury were at liberty to believe the plaintiff who testified that, upon asking the defendant where her husband was, he replied that \u201cthat was his business and not mine;\u201d and that when in town during the last two years preceding his death he did not return to his home, but lived at his father\u2019s house where he sickened and died. It was also for the jury to determine whether after denying that his son was with him, and in response to the plaintiff\u2019s request that her husband should be sent back because \u201cwhen he is sick, his place is at home,\u201d the defendant said, \u201che is mine, and I will keep him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">We need go no further. The jury manifestly would have been warranted in finding that through the defendant\u2019s efforts, inspired by ill will toward the plaintiff, her husband\u2019s affections were alienated and that he was induced to abandon his home and to live separate and apart from her. It follows that the requests for rulings were denied properly, and that the exceptions must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b226-7\"> \u201cAt the time of the marriage, both husband and wife were about thirty-three years of age.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
