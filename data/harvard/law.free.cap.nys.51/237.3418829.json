Whether or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>not the appellant was a bona fide holder of the note in question-depended upon the credibility of witnesses, which it was peculiarly within the province of the justice below to determine. In doing so&gt; he had'the advantage, which we do not possess, of observing the manner in which their testimony was given, and their demeanor-on the witness stand. We are therefore not inclined to disturb the judgment in favor of the defendant Lascaropulos, the maker of the note in suit, dismissing the complaint as to him. It is different, however, with the defendant Weinberg, the indorser, who interposed no defense to the action, but seems, when examined as a witness, to have admitted his liability on the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The judgment is therefore reversed as to the defendant Weinberg, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide-the event, and affirmed as to the defendant Lascaropulos, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
