For a second cause of action, the plaintiff alleges the holding over and continued possession of the premises by the defendant after the expiration of his term, at 12 o\u2019clock noon,, on the 1st day of October, 1897. The defendant interposed an answer, putting in issue every material allegation of the complaint, and also setting up as a special, separate, and distinct defense the plea that the plaintiff entered upon and took possession of the demised premises on the 1st day of October, 1897, before 12 o\u2019clock noon of that day. A motion was subsequently made on the part of the plaintiff to compel the defendant to make said answer more definite and certain, which resulted in an order which required the defendant to amend his answer so as to show, among other things, \u201cwhich cause of action get forth in the complaint the separate and distinct defense purports to answer.\u201d In pursuance of that order, the amended answer was served. Thereafter another motion was made on the part of the plaintiff, to strike out from said amended answer the defendant\u2019s separate and distinct defense, upon the alleged ground \u201cthat it failed to show which cause of action set forth in the complaint it purported to answer.\u201d The motion was denied, and, from the order entered denying the same, this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-15\">The separate and distinct defense set up in the amended answer clearly and distinctly refers to the second cause of action of the complaint. The motion was based upon the alleged ground \u201cthat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>the amended answer did not comply with the aforesaid order of this court, in that it totally failed to show which cause of action set forth in the complaint th\u00e9 further separate and distinct defense purported to answer.\u201d A mere inspection of the pleadings will show that the separate and distinct defense set forth in the answer clearly and distinctly refers to the second cause of action. There is no obscurity or ambiguity about the language used. By paragraphs numbered <em>4= </em>and 5 the defendant plainly refers to and. answers the second cause of action; and by paragraph numbered 6, \u201cfor a further, separate, and distinct defense thereto,\u201d the defendant alleges that the plaintiff entered upon and took possession of said premises on the 1st day of October, 1897, before 12 o\u2019clock noon of that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The order appealed from'should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
