He testified first as to-the second cause of action, namely, Hie loan of \"$1,000, stating that it was made-by check, and that the defendant gave him no note therefor. This was his testimony: \u2018T did not get a note at this time. I did not have any note of Mr. Gordon\u2019s dated December 13, 1894. I am quite certain of that.\u201d The counsel \u2018-for 'the respondent conclusively proved the falsity of this Testimony'by putting;in evidence a note of the defendants\"'for $1,000, dated December 13,1894, which-the'plaintiff had deposited for collection, and which apparently had been taken up, as it wa-s produ ced by the defendants at the trial. It was - certainly admissible. It wa-s proper in cross-examination to weaken 1lie force of Hte plaintiff\u2019s testimony, and it Tended directly to support the-de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>fense to the second cause of action, which was that the note had been given for the loan, and was afterwards paid. It was not rendered inadmissible because the plaintiff testified that it related to anolher transaction. The jury might have disbelieved this state-men t, especially in view of the plaintiff\u2019s false testimony that lie never had any note of Gordon\u2019s dated December 13, 1894. In his charge the trial judge called the jury\u2019s attention to the misstatement, and said: \u201cAs to a witness who is disinterested, and not impeached in any way, the testimony given is mot to \"be disregarded: but where a person is interested in the outcome of his case, and gives testimony, you-are at liberty, if he has testified falsely in any material respect, to disregard his testimony.\u201d This charge was quite correct. It was, in fact, more favorable to the plaintiff than the circumstances required. Certainly, the jury are not bound to believe the testimony of an interested party when there are circumstances throwing doubt upon its truth. The glaring misstatement of the plaintiff-here upon a material point, for which it is difficult to find an adequate excuse, warranted the jury in disbelieving his uncorroborated testimony. This, too, must be borne in mind in considering the remaining questions. What has been said is enough to show that the verdict of the jury as to the second cause of action is not to be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked for the direction of a verdict upon the first cause of action. This was upon a note alleged to have been made'by the-defendants to one H. Schnitzer, \u201cwho thereafter,\u201d to quote the language of the complaint, \u201cduly indorsed and delivered the said note for value to the plaintiff, who is now the holder and owner thereof.\u201d The answer d\u00b0enies any knowledge or information sufficient 'to form a belief as to this allegation, repeating it in terms in the denial. The plaintiff contends that such a denial does not put in issue the indorsement and delivery of the note by H. Bchnitzer to the plaintiff, but only its indorsement and delivery for value. His claim is that he took title to themote by its Indorsement and delivery to him, whether he gave value or not. This latter claim is, doubtless, well founded, but it'does not solve the question. The difficulty with the plain! ill\u2019s position is that he went to trial upon the answer without objecting in any manner to the form of the denial. And, moreover, he gave evidence-in support of the averment, quite as though the denial were sufficient. Nor did he suggest upon the trial that the denial was defective. It is \"true that he asked the court to charge the jury \u201cthat [as to the first cause of action] there was no contention, and that he was entitled to recover upon that at least.\u201d But even here he failed to point nut any defect in the pleading. If he had done so. the court might -well have permitted the Avords \u201cfor value\u201d to be stricken from the denial. What the plaintiff\u2019s motion implied was that there was no contention upon the merits, not that the allegation was admitted because the denial in form amounted to negative pregnant. But, whatever remedy the plaintiff might haA7e had with regard to such , a denial prior to .the trial, it was clearly sufficient to raise'an issue calling for proof upon the trial. Thompson v. Railway Co., 45 N. Y. 468: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Wall v. Waterworks Co., 18 N. Y. 119; Hoffman v. Susemihl, 15 App. Div. 405, 44 N. Y. Supp. 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">The account stated alleged in the third cause of action seems, according to the plaintiff\u2019s rather confused testimony, to have been represented by five notes made by H. Cohen &amp; Co., and indorsed by .the defendant. These notes were not produced or proved; and the plaintiff, after making some conflicting statements, finally said that he had returned them all to the defendant. The same thing is true of this testimony as of that relating to the second cause of .action. The jury were not bound to credit it.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The remaining question is as to the refusal of the court to charge that the plaintiff\u2019s books were not evidence in Ms favor, and that \u201cif he did produce them he could not use them to support his own claim or contention.\u201d The request, under the circumstances, was too broad, and the trial judge indicated as much when he said, \u201c3 \u25a0decline to charge that as stated.\u201d The only reference made to the plaintiff\u2019s books upon the trial was in his cross-examination. He admitted that he kept books in which he entered the moneys which he paid out and the notes which he thereupon received. In view of Ms confused and conflicting statements as to whether he actually received a note for the loan specified in Ms second cause of action; in view, too, of the production by the defendants of a note apparently for the amount of that loan,\u2014it is quite conceivable that any original entry made by him on the subject might have been admissible to clear up the doubts caused by his defective memory. It was not, to say the least, absolutely certain that such original entry, made by the plaintiff himself at the time when the loan was made, would have been inadmissible. The request was doubtless aimed at the possible effect upon the-jury of the plaintiff\u2019s failure to produce such original entry, either to aid Ms memory, or, upon continued failure of memory, as original evidence. The court declined to charge the proposition \u201cas stated,\u201d and then charged that, \u201cif either party desired to have the books of the other, he might have taken the legal steps to secure their production in court.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s counsel seems to have been satisfied with this latter instruction, for he made no further exception, and the matter rested there. Upon the whole, we think the case was fairly submitted to the jury, and that the verdict should not be .disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The judgment and order denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
