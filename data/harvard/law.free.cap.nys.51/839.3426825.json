The theft of $440,000 from the Auer Incandescent Light Company by Tyndale Palmer, a former Philadelphia newspaper man, in which he was joined by a hotel keeper named Freitas, of Rio Janeiro, has just been brought to light. The company is owned solely by A. O. Granger, the president, and Ex-Senator Gazzam, the vice president. They formed the South American Welsbach Incandescent Light Company, and sent young Palmer to Rio to boom the invention. He and Freitas sold the patent rights for $510,000 in gold, and upon Palmer\u2019s return he reported the sale as having been made for $80,000, of which $10,000 was expended in his salary, expenses, and commission. The theft was not learned until two other men were sent to Brazil \u25a0on a second mission, although reports had reached the ears of the company. Palmer was sent to England to negotiate securities of one of Ex-Senator Gazzam\u2019s iron companies, and, upon demanding a higher commission, was dismissed. Palmer cannot be returned from England, but action is being taken to recover sums which he expended in buying farms for relatives. The second trip was made to Brazil to \u2018sell improvements on the original Welsbach invention, which \u2022caused the title to be changed to the Auer Company.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b863-16\">The publication of this article was admitted by the defendants in their answer, but they alleged, by way of mitigation, that the same was furnished to them by an association known as the United Press Association, which was engaged in the business of collecting and trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>mitting news by telegraph to its subscribers and patrons'; that they received the article in the regular course of business, and, in common with many other newspapers throughout the country, published the same in good faith, and in reliance upon its accuracy and truth. The issues thus joined were tried at the Erie trial term, and the trial resulted in a verdict for six cents damages in favor of the plaintiff. From the judgment entered thereon, as well as from an order denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial on the minutes, this appeal is brought.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b864-5\">Argued before HARDIN, P.

But, after careful examination of the same, we find ourselves unable to acquiesce in this contention. To our view, the most serious question which the case presents is that raised by exceptions to certain inquiries put to the plaintiff, upon his cross-examination, relative to similar actions brought by him against other newspapers for the publication of this identical article. It appears that before the present action was commenced the plaintiff demanded of the defendants that they retract the alleged libel, and compensate him for the injury which he claimed to have sustained in consequence of its publication. This demand was in the form of a letter, which was followed by several other letters written by the plaintiff and sent to the defendants, in one of which, under date of July 7, 1894, were inclosed some clippings from other newspapers, and in regard to which the plaintiff wrote as follows, viz.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-9\">\u201cI am prepared to demonstrate to you, as I already have done to the counsel of the papers which I inclose, that the charges made were absolutely baseless, and that, in addition to the ordinary injuries always arising from such false and infamous charges, my business interests received a direct injury from your publication. The financial loss to me from the publication, as a whole, was most serious. However, I do not expect any one paper to bear it all, but only its due proportion. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">This letter was offered by the defendants and received in evidence without objection during the plaintiff\u2019s cross-examination, and it was followed by inquiries to which we have already adverted, and which simply called for a statement as to the number of papers he had brought actions against for publishing this same article. The plaintiff bases his contention that the admission of this class of evidence was error, upon the assumption that it was received by way of mitigation. In this, however, he is clearly mistaken; for the learned trial court was particular to sayQ that it was admitted only by way of cross-examination, and in his charge to the jury neither this nor any other circumstance, save the absence of express malice,- and the source from which the defendants received the article, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>alluded to as mitigating in its character. The sole question, therefore, as we regard it, is, was the evidence thus objected to properly received in connection with the cross-exariiination of the plaintiff? Subject to certain well-defined limitations, the range and extent of a cross-examination are generally within the discretion of the trial judge, and a court of review ought not to interfere unless it is made to appear that this discretionary power has been abused. Foster v. Tanenbaum, 2 App. Div. 168, 37 N. Y. Supp. 722; People v. Casey, 72 N. Y. 398. That the record in this case does not disclose any such abuse of power is, ive think, perfectly apparent. In one of the letters written by the plaintiff under date of November 30, 1893, and which was introduced in evidence by him, he alludes to the fact that other papers had published the libel, and claimed that it in no wise affected his right of action against the defendants. In the subsequent letter of July 7, 1894, he not only incloses clippings from some of'those papers, but informs the defendants that all he asks of them is that they shall bear their due proportion of the pecuniary compensation he was seeking to obtain through the medium of his various actions. This last-mentioned, letter was one of a series of five written by the plaintiff to the defendants, four of which he had already read in evidence. In these circumstances, we think it was entirely proper for the defendants to complete the series by introducing the one which had been omitted, and, having done that, to cross-examine the plaintiff respecting its contents. In pursuing this course the plaintiff\u2019s attention was' directed to the statement in his letter that this particular article had been published by other papers; and, upon his conceding that such was the fact, he was asked how many papers had published it, to which he replied that he did not know. Up to this point, there certainly can be no doubt as to the propriety of the questions put to the plaintiff; and, had he answered the last one, it would perhaps have been all that the defendants were entitled to. But, inasmuch as he disclaimed any knowledge upon the subject of the inquiry, we are unable to see why it was not perfectly ligi t\u00edmate for counsel to pursue it, and, in order to refresh the recollection of the witness, ask him how many papers he had brought actions against. The answer to this question furnished some information as to the number of papers which had published the article, and while it may, as is claimed, have had a tendency to reduce the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s recovery, that circumstance does not make its reception error, provided it was competent for any purpose. As has been well said by an eminent jurist, \u201cA party who seeks to testify in his own behalf must take The risk, if there are vulnerable joints in his harness.\u201d People v. Court of Oyer and Terminer of New York Co., 83 N. Y. 461. One of the principal objects of a cross-examination is to expose these \u201cvulnerable joints,\u201d and it matters not whether they are the result of-defective character, contradictory statements, or declarations against interest; their discovery is one of the risks which a party assumes when he takes the stand as a witness in his own behalf. As has been already intimated, this is the only question which we deem it necessary to discuss; and as it, to our mind, presents no error, our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>conclusion is that the judgment and order appealed from should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">Judgment and order affirmed, with costs. All concur, except HARDIN, P. J., and FOLLETT, J., dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">In October, 1892, the defendants were owners, proprietors, and publishers of a daily newspaper known as 'the Illustrated Buffalo Express, which was published in the city of Buffalo, and had a large circulation there, and in other parts of the state. Plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleges that on the 2d of October, 1892, the defendants published in their said newspaper a certain article, \u201cin which the defendants did falsely, wickedly, and maliciously publish, and cause and procure to be published, of and concerning the plaintiff, the false, scandalous, and defamatory words or matter\u201d particularly set out in the complaint. The plaintiff avers that the said article, in so far as it stated or insinuated that the plaintiff \u201chas been or was guilty of any theft or other crime or offense, or of any infamous .or disgraceful act, either alone or in conjunction with any other person, or that he had sold the patent rights of the American Welsbacli Incandescent Light Company or the Auer Incandescent Light Company for $510,000, or for any sum other than the sum reported and accounted for by him to said Welsbach Company, to wit, the sum of $80,000, or that he was a fugitive from justice, or that he had embezzled any proceeds of said sale, or any moneys belonging to his employers or to any one else, or had improperly expended such proceeds or moneys in buying farms for relatives or otherwise, were and are utterly false, malicious, and defamatory; and plaintiff avers that he was never guilty of any of the infamous and disgraceful acts that are stated or insinuated in said article.\u201d The complaint alleges that the printing and publishing of the article has injured his good name and reputation, to his damage in the sum of $25,000. There is no averment in the complaint of special damages. The answer of the defendants admits that they are the owners, proprietors, and publishers of the newspaper stated in the complaint, and that on the 2d day of October, 1892, there was published in one edition only of the said Illustrated Buffalo Express the article set forth in the complaint. By way of mitigation of damages, the answer alleges that the defendants were subscribers to, and patrons of, the United Press, which was an association organized and existing and engaged in the collection and transmission to its patrons, and to newspapers generally throughout the United States, of the general news of the whole world. The answer also avers \u201cthat on or about the said 2d day of October, 1892, the said United Press did transmit and deliver to the editors of the defendants\u2019 paper the article or dispatch set forth in said complaint; that said dispatch was furnished and received by said editors in the regular course of business, in common with other telegraphic news; that said editors, believing in and relying upon the truth of the statements contained in said dispatch, and without any malice on their part or on the part of any one connected with said paper, did in good faith publish the same, in common with .very many other newspapers throughout the country; that said article was published in good faith, without any malice on the part of these defendants, or on the part of any of their editors or employ\u00e9s, towards the plaintiff, but in the belief of the truth of the same; that prior to the publication of the said article complained of by the said plaintiff, the same article, or articles containing the substance thereof, had been and were published by many other newspapers throughout the United States, and in the community and parts of the country where said plaintiff was known.\u201d The answer contains no other matter by way of defense, or in mitigation.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b866-7\">HARDIN, P. J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"AxZD\">Plaintiff was sworn as a witness in his own behalf, and produced and read in evidence a letter which had been written to the defendants bearing date in November, 1892\", which, when read in evidence, was marked as \u201cExhibit A.\u201d He testified that he wrote another letter to the defendants, bearing date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>.\u00a1November 30, 1893, which was read in evidence, and marked \u201cExhibit C.\u201d He also testified that he wrote' to the defendants another letter, bearing date November 4, 1894, which was read in evidence, and marked \u201cExhibit D.\u201d He further testified that on April 19, 1894, he addressed to the defendants another letter, which was read in evidence, and marked \u201cExhibit E,\u201d and he testified that be received no answer to that letter from the defendants, and that the defendants bad never made any retraction of the charge, to the knowledge of the plaintiff. During the course of the cross-examination of the plaintiff, he was shown another letter written by him to the defendants, which was dated, \u201cWashington, Iowa, 7-17-94.\u201d Among other things contained in that letter were the following words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-5\">\u201cThe financial loss to me from the publication, as a whole, was most serious. However, I do not expect any one paper to bear it all, but only its due proportion. Just and reasonable reparation, coupled with broad and unequivocal retraction, is the only basis of settlement upon which I can meet any paper. Neither one nor the other has been, can be, or will be accepted alone.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">The cross-examination continued at great length. After considerable discussion between the counsel of the respective parties and the court, the following appears in the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-7\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Counsel: We contend here that the fact that somebody else may \"have\u2014although the fact does not appear here\u2014published this same libel, or a similar one, is not competent evidence. (Question read by the stenographer, as follows: \u2018Had you read it elsewhere before?\u2019) Now, within the rule, it is no part of the cross-examination,\u2014it is not admissible,\u2014unless it Is shown that they had notice or knowledge of any previous publication. I think that is not pleaded. Defendants\u2019 Counsel: Tes. Plaintiff\u2019s Counsel: Well, it may be. I object to it certainly as not part of the cross-examination; and it should be followed, if it can be, by proof. Then the witness may be examined, perhaps, about it, if the evidence is admitted. But here and now, without further discussing the main question of its admissibility, I submit it is not competent, and not admissible. The Court: Well, Mr. Wheeler, you may pass it for the present.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">The cross-examination continued, and the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-9\">\u201cQ. And you wrote in your letter to Mr. Matthews, did you not: \u2018The financial loss to me from the publication, as a whole, was most serious. However, I do not expect any one paper to bear it all, but only its due proportion\u2019? You said that to Mr. Matthews, did you not? A. The letter speaks for itself. Q. Then you did recognize the fact, did you not, that this particular article in question had been published by a large number of other papers? Plaintiff\u2019s Counsel: That I object to. The Court: He may answer. Plaintiff\u2019s Counsel: Please note the exceptions on the grounds as before,\u2014that it is not admissible in mitigation, or for any other purpose. The Court: I think that it is a proper cross-examination as to this letter. A. The letter says so. Q. Well, what Is the fact? A. The letter states the fact. Q. The letter states the truth,\u2014that it had been published. I ask you if you did not know the fact that it had been published by a large number of other papers throughout the country? A. I did. Plaintiff\u2019s Counsel: That I object to, the same as before. The Court: Yes; you may-have the exception. Q. How many had published it? A. I do not know. Q. How many had y-ou brought suit against, at least? Plaintiff\u2019s Counsel: That I object to, as before. The Court: He may answer. Plaintiff\u2019s Counsel: Your honor said it was proper cross-examination of this letter. That letter was introduced by the defendant. The Court: This witness is the party himself, and the matter of the order of proof is not of note. Plaintiff\u2019s Counsel: You will note an exception. Q. How many had you brought suit against for its publication? A. I could not say, but I think I may- give you an idea in this way. Q. \u25a0Give us the best statement you car. make. =;\u2018 =;\u2018 * Q. In that action did you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>testify that you had brought suit against 152 or thereabouts? Plaintiff\u2019s Counsel: I object as not competent as to the bringing' of suits, and same as before. (Received, and exception taken.) A. I did not. Q. Is it not a fact, Mr. Palmer, that you have brought suits against about 150? A. It is not. I do not personally know Mr. Matthews, the defendant here, nor Mr. Austin, his partner in business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">The fact that the plaintiff had brought suits against other parties was not relative or material to the issue formed by the pleadings. Nor was it necessary to shed light upon the direct examination. Nor did it tend to impair the credibility of the witness, or impeach any portion of the evidence given by him in chief. Nor do we think the fact that the defendants had put in evidence a letter from which the quotation is made warranted the cross-examination, to the extent it was allowed to he carried. In Witcher v. Jones (Com. Pl.) 17 N. Y. Supp. 491, it was held, viz.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-5\">\u201cIn an action for libel, where exemplary damages are demanded, it is competent to prove, in mitigation, previous publications of the libelous matter by others, known to defendant at the time of Ms publications, and relied upon by him as authority. But evidence of contemporaneous publications by others does not tend to disprove malice, and is inadmissible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">In the course of the opinion delivered in that case, Pryor, J., said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-7\">\u201cIf, therefore, the defendant uttered the libel, In good faith, upon the authority of others, that circumstance manifestly tends to disprove a malicious motive in the publication; and, accordingly, in mitigation of damages the defendant may always show other publications, known to him at the time of his repetition of the defamatory matter. But obviously his motive in the publication could not liave been affected by a fact of which he was then ignorant, and lienee the palpable absurdity of admitting such fact in disproof of malice;\u201d citing Hatfield v. Lasher, 81 N. Y. 246; Willover v. Hill, 72 N. Y. 36; Morey v. Association, 123 N. Y. 207, 25 N. E. 161.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">In Van Ingen v. Publishing Co. (Com. Pl.) 35 N. Y. Supp. 842, the court was requested to charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-9\">\u201cThat the fact that the same matter, substantially, was published extensively in the morning papers of the same day is to be considered by the jury in mitigation of damages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">The court refused to make such charge, and it was held that no error was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-11\">In Folwell v. Journal Co., 37 Atl. 6, the supreme court of Rhode Island said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-12\">\u201cThe defendant\u2019s offer to show that the same article was published by other papers on tlie same day, for which other suits had been brought, was properly refused. The acts of other publishers are independent acts, which could in no. way affect the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-13\">In Smith v. Association, 5 C. C. A. 91, 55 Fed. 240, it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-14\">\u201cDefendant contends that the court erred in excluding testimony as to other suits having been brought against other newspapers. This objection is unsound. Such evidence was wholly irrelevant and immaterial. * * * That other newspapers which published similar libels had been prosecuted by the plaintiff for tlieir acts was a matter with which neither court nor jury had any concern.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-15\">The doctrine of that case seems to have been followed in Bennett v. Salisbury, 24 C. C. A. 329, 78 Fed. 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-16\">It is contended by the learned counsel for the respondents that the cross-examination for the purpose of showing how many other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>publications had been made, and how many suits had been brought by reason thereof by the plaintiff, was proper, \"to show the kind of a man the plaintiff is, by showing the attitude which he has assumed touching the subject-matter of the libel in question.\u201d We think there is no force in that view of the matter. The fact that numerous other parties had libeled the plaintiff, and that he had sought retractions from the several wrongs thus perpetrated upon him, did not tend in any way to impeach his general character, or to mitigate the offense of the defendants in publishing the article mentioned in the complaint. As was said by Kent, C. J., in Tillotson v. Cheetham, 3 Johns. 61:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-5\">\u201cThe plaintiff is entitled to his strict compensation for ever)' injury. A satisfaction for one tort is no satisfaction for another.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">Such was the rule in England (Saunders v. Mills, 6 Bing. 213; Id., 3 Moore &amp; P. 520) until 1888, when it was changed by the sixth section of chapter 64, 51 &amp; 52 Vict., which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-7\">\u201cSec. 6. At the trial of an action for a libel contained in any newspaper the defendant shall be at liberty to give in evidence in mitigation of damages that the plaintiff has already recovered (or has brought actions for) damages or has received or agreed to receive compensation in respect of a libel or libels to the same purport or effect as the libel for which such action has been brought.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">The respondents\u2019 learned counsel calls our attention to People v. Court of Oyer and Terminer of New York Co., 83 N. Y. 460, and claims that it is an authority justifying the extent to which the cross-examination was allowed. In the course of the opinion delivered in that case, it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-9\">\u201cAs a general rule, the range and extent of such an examination is within the discretion of the trial judge,-\u2014subject, however, to the limitation that it must relate to matters pertinent to the issue, cr to specific facts which tend to discredit the witness, or impeach his moral character.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">It is difficult to see that the circumstance that several other newspapers had published a libel of the plaintiff tended to discredit him, or to impeach his moral character.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-11\">From an inspection of the record, and especially upon a consideration of the amount of the verdict,\u2014six cents,-\u2014-we are not able to say that the extent to which the cross-examination was allowed in respect to the matters which we have already alluded to, did not work injury to the plaintiff. In Matson v. Buck, 5 Cow. 500, it was said that a nominal verdict is \u201cequivalent to a verdict for the defendant,\u201d and in Gilman v. Lowell, 8 Wend. 573, it was said that a nominal verdict \u201cis about equal to a verdict against him\u201d; and in Sanderson v. Caldwell, 45 N. Y. 398, it was said that a nominal verdict, where the plaintiff\u2019s character remains unimpeached, is a total denial of justice, since it, in effect, says that, though the charges were untrue, the plaintiff had no character to lose. The same -doctrine was stated by Macomber, J., in Griebel v. Printing Co., 60 Hun, 319-322, 14 N. Y. Supp. 848. An inspection of the evidence found in the record renders it difficult to understand why the . jury reached the conclusion that only nominal damages should be given, and that the plaintiff should not receive at its hands substantial damages. We are of the opinion that the order denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>the motion for a new trial, and the judgment entered upon the-verdict, should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">Judgment and order reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs - to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">FOLLETT, J., concurs in this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
