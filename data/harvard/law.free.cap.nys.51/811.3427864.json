He was tried and convicted of this offense, and sentenced to be imprisoned in the state\u2019s prison at Auburn for the term of three years. After such conviction the special county judge of Monroe county, who presided at the trial, granted a certificate of. reasonable doubt whether the conviction should stand, and which certificate the judge granting it vacated on the 17th day of February, 1898. The. counsel for the appellant, at the close of the people\u2019s case, and also at the close of the evidence, moved that the appellant be discharged, on the ground that the crime charged in the indictment had not been proved. The court denied both of these motions, to which the appellant\u2019s counsel excepted. The same question was raised upon the motion for a new trial. There was abundant evidence upon the trial to sustain the jury in convicting the defendant. On the night of the burglary, March 25, 1896, two men (Stephen Sheldon and William Terrill), about 9 o\u2019clock in the evening, applied to \u00e1 liveryman in the city of Rochester for two horses and a light pair of bob sleighs. There was a third man with them, standing at a distance. The tracks \u2022of three men were found in the snow at the place of the burglary. Early the next morning, the 26th, between 6 and 7 o\u2019clock, the team was found upon the floor of the liveryman\u2019s barn; and the stolen \u25a0chickens, and some stolen turkeys taken from another place, were found in the sleigh. In the office of the livery stable these two men, Sheldon and Terrill, were found asleep. The defendant soon appeared upon the scene, claimed the stolen property, and procured a \u25a0cartman to take the chickens and turkeys to one Lippmans, a butcher, who conducted a meat market on North Clinton street, Rochester. The defendant went to the market, and proposed to sell the poultry to Lippmans, who became suspicious that the property was stolen, and telephoned the police. The cartman wanted pay for carting the poultry to Lippmans. Lippmans refused to pay, but the defendant .agreed to pay, and went out to borrow the money for that purpose, but did not return. He was afterwards arrested, and charged with this offense, and made false statements to the police as to his being at the butcher\u2019s and on North Clinton street, and feathers were found upon his coat. Other circumstances of a suspicious nature were \u25a0established against him upon the trial by the prosecution. The defendant\u2019s evidence did not exonerate him from this charge,\u2014at least., it was for the jury to say; and we should not interfere with this conviction, upon its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">The appeal from the order vacating the' certificate of reasonable doubt remains to be considered. The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant is that, when the certificate of reasonable doubt was granted, no provision in the statutes existed for its being vacated .and set aside, and the order vacating it was without authority. The granting of certificates of reasonable doubt upon conviction in criminal cases has become by far too common. The result has been, in many \u2022cases, to create unreasonable delay, and to impede the course of justice. Defendants who have obtained the stay in such cases have often been tardy with their appeals, and the people have found many obstacles thrown in their way in bringing the cases before the appellate courts. To remedy this difficulty the legislature made an amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>to section 529 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which took effect May 14, 1897, which was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-4\">\u201cIf an appeal to the appellate division of the supreme court shall not be brought on for argument by the defendant at the next term of the appellate 'division begun not less than ten days after the granting of such certificate [the certificate of reasonable doubt], or if an appeal to the court of appeals shall not be brought on for argument by the defendant when the court of appeals shall have been in actual session for fifteen days after the granting of such certificate, the district attorney on two days\u2019 notice to the defendant may apply to the judge or justice who granted the certificate or to any judge or justice of the court in which the appeal is pending for an order vacating the certificate, and_ upon the entry of such an order, the judgment shall be executed as though a certificate had never been granted to the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Construing this amendment in the light of the purpose and the necessity of its enactment, we are of the opinion that the amendment ap* plies to criminal actions in existence when the amendment took effect, \u2014at least, to such proceedings in said actions as occurred after that amendment. In this case several terms of the appellate court at which the case could have been brought on for argument occurred after the 14th of May, 1897, and before the application to vacate the certificate, in February, 1898. The failure of the defendant to bring the case on for argument during this period gave the judge granting the certificate jurisdiction to revoke it. The legislature had authorized this judge to grant the certificate. It could withdraw or limit that authority. The granting of the certificate was a matter of procedure in the action. The amendment affected that procedure and was in no sense an ex post facto law. As we have said the amendment applied to existing action. Stokes v. People, 53 N. Y. 173, 174; People v. Turner, 117 N. Y. 233, 22 N. E. 1022. This view does not trench upon the rule relied upon by the defendant\u2019s counsel, that the statute should have prospective operation unless its terms show that the legislature intended that it should operate retrospectively. We do not give it a retrospective effect. We apply to the amendment the conditions arising after it became a law. The defendant was in default after that period, for not bringing his case on for argument, which it was his duty to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">The judgment of conviction, and the order refusing a new trial, should be affirmed, and a proper judgment remitting the case be awarded; and the order vacating the certificate of reasonable doubt should also be affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
