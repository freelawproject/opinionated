It is well settled that when the agency is disclosed, and the contract relates to the matter of the agency, and is within the authority conferred, the agent will not be personally bound, unless upon clear and explicit evidence of an intention to substitute or to superadd his personal liability for or to that of the principal. See Hall v. Lauderdale, 46 N. Y. 74. This question of disclosed agency was not specifically referred to in the charge of the trial judge, although he tells the jury that they must satisfy themselves that defendant employed plaintiffs to do the work for him; but, as the jury found in favor of plaintiffs, we must accept their verdict as conclusive on this point, if there is any evidence tending to sustain such a finding. If, however, there is no such evidence, then it was an error of law on the part of the trial judge to refuse defendant\u2019s request for the direction of. a verdict in his favor; and, upon defendant\u2019s exception to such ruling, a question of law is presented to the appellate term for consideration. All the other questions in the case were fairly submitted to the jury, and they have decided them, upon comp\u00e9tent .evidence, in favor of the plaintiffs. With this finding the appellate term cannot interfere. The questions of law raised by exceptions to the admission or exclusion of evidence are not of sufficient weight to demand discussion. The only question, therefore, for the appellate term to decide, is whether there was any .evidence to support a finding that defendant acted with an undisclosed principal, or, if the agency was disclosed, whether he acted with intention or agreement to substitute or superadd his personal liability for or to that of his principal. Hall v. Lauderdale, supra. It is not for us to weigh the evidence if conflicting; but it is our duty simply to ascertain if there is any evidence on this point to support the ruling of the trial judge on defendant\u2019s motion for the direction of a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">The plaintiffs were real-estate agents. The wife of defendant was the owner of certain property at Long Branch and at Verona. The defendant, acting as agent for his wife, placed this property in plaintiffs\u2019 hands for exchange for city real estate. After considerable negotiation, a sale, by exchange, was effected for some property in Brooklyn, owned by Mrs. Boschen. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel put the plaintiff Richters on the stand, and he testified, with regard to the question under consideration, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-5\">\u201cI entered them [the property of defendant\u2019s wife] in our books in the name of Thorndike Saunders, the defendant. I did not know anybody else as owner at that time. * * * The contract [of sale or exchange between Mrs. Saunders and Mrs. Boschen by their attorneys] was drawn up in writing. I drew it up. I presented it to Mr. Boschen for his wife\u2019s signature. He signed it. I presented it to Mr. Saunders. He signed it in my presence, \u2018Emma Saunders, by Thorndike Saunders, Attorney.\u2019 That was the first intimation that I had that anybody but Thorndike Saunders was interested in these properties in New Jersey. He said his wife owned it, and that he had power of attorney. This was the first time X was apprised that his wife was the owner. I was the subscribing witness, and saw him sign it, and I saw Mr. Boschen sign for his wife.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>This contract, which plaintiff swears he himself drew up, begins as follows: \u201cAgreement made and entered into the 21st day of November, 1894, between William 0. Boschen, attorney for Martha Boschen, of the city of Brooklyn, party of the first part, and Thorn-dike Saunders, attorney for Emma Saunders, of Asbury Park, N. J., party of the second part,\u201d etc.; and the contract clearly shows that Emma Saunders was the principal, not the defendant. On his cross-examination, by Mr. Saunders, the plaintiff swears:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-5\">\u201cI testified that I did not know that Emma Saunders was the owner of the New Jersey property until after I had seen signed, \u2018Emma Saunders, per T. Saunders, Attorney.\u2019 I- had no recollection of your mentioning Mrs. Saunders until the time of the contract. I also testified that I drew this Exhibit A [the contract in question]; and that I presented it, before I brought it to Mr. Saunders, to Mr. Boschen, and that he signed, \u2018Martha Boschen, by William 0. Boschen, Attorney in Eact;\u2019 and that then I brought it to Mr. Saunders, and he, signed it, \u2018Emma Saunders, by T. Saunders, Attorney.\u2019 Q. Then, if you drew\" this agreement before you knew that I was acting as attorney for Emma Saunders, how does it happen that you wrote into the first part of that agreement \u2018and Thorndike Saunders, attorney for Emma Saunders, of Asbury Park, N. J.\u2019? Look at it, and answer that question. A. Mr. Saunders, it was about the time the contract was drawn that I found it out. You told me, at the time you said you would make the trade, to go make the contract,\u2014to draw it that way. I would like to say this thing occurred three years ago, and I had no idea of having any trouble in the matter. We had the property on our books in your name. My recollection is that I did not know until I was informed by Mr. Saunders, when we got ready to make the contract. Q. Is it not true that, when I told you about these properties, that I told you my wife had the equity in the Long Branch property, and in the lots in Verona, and that she and I wanted to come to New York, and exchange them for a flat? A. I recollect something of that conversation, but I cannot recollect it exactly. It is so long ago. Q. Is that the fact or not? A. Not to my knowledge. Q. You won\u2019t deny positively that it is the 'fact? A. No, not positively.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">There can be no doubt that- plaintiffs were aware of defendant\u2019s agency before the contract of exchange or sale, between Mrs. Saunders and Mrs. Boschen, by their attorneys, was executed or even drawn up; but we are of opinion that there is some evidence tending to show that plaintiffs did not know of defendant\u2019s agency until after they had undertaken the employment of finding a purchaser, and had brought the transaction, practically, to a close. The subsequent disclosure of the principal came too late, for a person, contracting as agent, will be personally responsible, where, at the time of making the contract, he does not disclose the fact of his agency, but treats with the other party as being himself the principal; for in such case it follows, irresistibly, that credit is given to him on account of the contract. He must disclose the fact that he is acting only as agent, in order that the other party may determine whether he will accept the responsibility of the principal in the transaction. See Ashner v. Abenheim, 19 Misc. Rep. 288, 43 N. Y. Supp. 69; Story, Ag. \u00a7 266. As we have said, it is not for the appellate term, on an appeal from the city court, to weigh the evidence if conflicting; and, since there is some evidence to sustain the finding of the jury, their verdict will not be disturbed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">For the reasons above stated, the judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
