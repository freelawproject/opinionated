The action is one brought on a promissory note, and the defense is a general denial. The plaintiff made his proof by offering the promissory note and the notice of protest in evidence. The defendant objected generally, stating no ground of his objection. This was not sufficient, and brings up nothing for review. Plaintiff then rested, and the defendant moved to dismiss the complaint, without stating any ground, or calling the court\u2019s attention to any error or omission, which motion was properly denied. Defendant\u2019s counsel then called defendant as a witness, and attempted to show that the note was without consideration. This was objected to by plaintiff\u2019s counsel at folio 37, as follows: \u201cI object at the outset on the ground that an attempt to prove want of consideration or failure of consideration is not within the pleadings, that the defense is a general denial, and submit that the defense of want of consideration should be specifically pleaded.\u201d The objection was sustained. Defendant then moved to amend his answer and to withdraw a juror. Both 'motions were denied, and, as they were within the sound discretion of the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1124\">*1124</page-number>judge, will not be disturbed on appeal. We find nothing in the record that warrants the reversal of the judgment, and it must therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-6\">SCH\u00dcCHMAN, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
