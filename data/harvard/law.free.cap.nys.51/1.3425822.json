J.</author>\n<p id=\"AA\">The action is for damages resulting from the death of Lawrence Zimmermann, on June 1, 1894. He was riding in a wagon, and crossing defendant\u2019s street railway, when the wagon was struck by one of defendant\u2019s cars, and overturned, and Zimmermann received injuries resulting in his death, on July 5th. This is the second appeal in this action, the first being from a judgment directing the dismissal of the complaint. 3 App. Div. 219, 38 K Y. Supp. 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>The evidence shows that Zimmermann was invited by Madden, the owner and driver of a peddler\u2019s wagon, to ride with him towards the-city of New York. In the wagon were two other persons, but Madden was driving. He was somewhat unfamiliar, with the route, and' received directions, from time to time, as to the route he was to pursue. The only evidence which the defendant relies upon as showing or tending to show that he took any part in the management of the-horse or driving occurred on the cross-examination of Madden:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-5\">\u201cQ. And he told you about the tracks you would have to cross and the roads-you would have to take? A. He told me to drive right across. I knew the road to take all right to drive to Third avenue, but he said this was the shortest way to drive across when I came to Boston avenue. Q. He was giving you directions how to go while he was in the wagon? A. 1-Ie told, me once or twice-about it, but he didn\u2019t tell me no more. Q. You did not know the way back? You had not been over that route? A. No; X hadn\u2019t drove across Boston avenue. Q. And it was Mr. Lawrence Zimmermann who was giving you the directions-which way to go, was it not? A. Yes, he gave me directions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">The learned justice correctly charged that if Zimmermann, by reason of the position in which he had been placed with reference to the-danger from the approaching trolley car, was able to see and to communicate to the driver the danger which was apparent, it was his duty to-do so; but he also charged that, under the circumstances, the negligence of the driver of the wagon, if any negligence is found to exist on his part, must be imputed to the passenger, the plaintiff\u2019s intestate. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel excepted to so much of the charge as-stated that \u201cany negligence on the part of the driver must be imputed to plaintiff\u2019s intestate,\u201d and requested the court to charge that plaintiff\u2019s intestate was not chargeable with any negligence on the part of the driver, if negligent he was. This the court refused, and the plaintiff excepted. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel also excepted to so much of the charge as stated \u201cthat, in order for the plaintiff to recover, it must appear that this accident was solely due to the negligence of the defendant,\u201d and requested the court to charge \u201cthat, if the jury find' that the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was not negligent, the plaintiff may still' recover if the accident was caused by the negligence of both the defendant and the driver of the wagon.\u201d This was refused, and exception taken. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel also requested the court to charge \u201cthat the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, as a gratuitous passenger or guest off Madden, the driver, was not chargeable with the driver\u2019s negligence, if negligent he was.\u201d This was also refused, and exception taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">It seems very evident that this charge arose from the misunderstanding of the learned justice as to the evidence which had been given in relation to the control which the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was exercising-over the driving of the wagon, or that his attention was not specifically called to the evidence upon the subject. This charge and exceptions: raise the question whether the negligence of the driver, if there was-any, was imputable to the deceased. It was based upon the supposition that he-was directing, not the line of route, but the management of the horse, and was instructing the driver in this particular. If this had been the uncontroverted fact, then the negligence of the driver in carrying out Zimmermann\u2019s directions would be imputable to the-latter, but there was no evidence upon which such assumption could-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>be based. .The plaintiff was a gratuitous passenger riding with Madden, and it needs no citation of authorities that, under these circumstances, a gratuitous passenger is not chargeable with the negligence of the driver. The charge of the court in that respect was reversible error, for which a new trial should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">Judgment and order reversed, and a new trial granted. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
