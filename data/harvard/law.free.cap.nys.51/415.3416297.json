This motion is now made to dismiss the appeal on the ground that an appeal wall not lie from such an order. We think the objection is well taken. Under chapter 748 of the Laws of 1896, an appeal lies only from an order opening a default. The right to appeal to this court from the determinations of the district courts (now the municipal courts) of the city of New York rests upon statute; and, as there is no statutory authority for such an appeal as has been taken here, this court has no jurisdiction to entertain it, and the motion to dismiss must therefore be granted, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
