The complaint alleges merely that the plaintiff is engaged in business in this state, and does not allege that he is' a resident, and further .alleges that the defendant is a foreign corporation. The allegations of the complaint are insufficient to establish jurisdiction. Upon the complaint and an affidavit which sets up no other jurisdictional facts, the order was granted for the publication of the \u2022summons. We think this was error. The allegation of the transaction of business within this state is not equivalent to an allegation of residence, and the failure of the plaintiff to allege residence within the state is a fatal defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-17\">The order is. reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
