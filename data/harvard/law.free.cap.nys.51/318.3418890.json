The point, however, was not made upon the trial, nor in fact upon the argument of this appeal; and, under the peculiar provisions of section 1382 of the New York City Consolidation Act, it must be deemed to have been waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">We think, however, that the judgment dismissing the complaint should be affirmed on the ground that the appellant, irrespective of\" the jurisdictional question, has not made out a cause of action entitling him to a recovery under his complaint. He has not shown that there-has been any distribution of the assets of the estate of the deceased\" debtor, or that there has been any payment of any portion of the same to the respondent, or, indeed, that any letters of administration have ever been issued upon the estate of the deceased. At most, all that can be inferred from the testimony is that the respondent, without any legal sanction, has appropriated the entire assets of the estate teller own use. This, however, does not bring the case within the section referred to, nor entitle the appellant to a recovery under the form of action to which he has resorted. The judgment must therefore be-affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
