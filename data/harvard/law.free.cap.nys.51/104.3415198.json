A demand for the value or price of the storage is not a proper counterclaim in such an action. It does not arise-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>in the same transaction as that from which the plaintiff\u2019s claim springs. The plaintiff\u2019s cause of action is based on the sale and disposition of the property by the defendant. The defendant's claim is founded on its services in storing the property previous to the time of the alleged conversion. Plainly, the storage' of the property before it was sold and the sale of the property were different transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The interlocutory judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
