This action was brought to recover the sum of $250 and interest against this defendant and Henry E. Marshall and Charles I. Bolles. Marshall was not served with process, and Bolles defaulted. The plaintiff is the assignee of the claim of George W. Bryam, which arose \u2022out of the latter\u2019s services in organizing a stock company. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>defendant, Maybury, in his answer, denied that Bryam rendered .any services for him, or upon his employment. On the trial this \u25a0defendant duly excepted to evidence offered by the plaintiff of conversation between Bryam and other defendants when Maybury was .not present. The learned trial justice allowed such evidence on \u25a0condition that Maybury should subsequently be connected with the conversation. After plaintiff rested, this defendant moved to strike out the testimony in regard to the conversations with Marshall testified to by Bryam, on the ground.that they had not been connected in any way with this defendant, and to a denial of that motion his counsel duly excepted; and subsequently he duly moved to dismiss the complaint, and to a denial of that motion he duly excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">We think that both of these motions should have been granted. There is an absence of any proof either connecting this defendant with the conversations with Marshall testified to by Bryam or establishing any personal liability of this defendant to the plaintiff\u2019s assignor. The respondent seeks to sustain the verdict either on the theory of this defendant having constituted Marshall his agent, of which we find no legal evidence, or on the theory of a subsequent ratification and acceptance by defendant of the services of plaintiff\u2019s assignor. This latter theory finds no supoprt in the proofs. Only as an officer of the stock company and a subscriber to one share of its stock did this defendant accept of the work of plaintiff\u2019s assignor in organizing the company, and there is no evidence whatever that at that time he knew or was informed that plaintiff\u2019s assignor was expecting or claiming to hold him personally .responsible. On the contrary, he repudiated such personal responsibility when he was first informed that plaintiff\u2019s assignor claimed it against him, and that was long after the services had been performed and acted upon. It is a premise to the doctrine of liability arising out of ratification and acceptance that the party to be charged must have been informed, or have had reason to be aware, that the services which he accepts are being charged against Mm when they have been ordered by a person other than himself, and not' connected with him so as to have become his agent. Such a connection the evidence does not disclose between this defendant and either Marshall or Bolles. If an acquaintance hires a vehicle, and invites me to ride with him, it is true that I participate in the benefits of the hiring, but I am not liable therefor unless I am previously made aware that the vehicle has been hired on the faith of my credit, or unless my friend had some authority from me to hire it. \u201cA promoter is not responsible for the contracts of other promoters in the absence of evidence that he has authorized the others to contract for him, or pledge his credit.\u201d Tayl. Priv. Corp. \u00a7 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The judgment and order appealed from should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">PITZSIMONS, C.
