Miller against J. Wesley Bush, as overseer, etc. The plaintiff was nonsuited, and filed a motion for a new trial, which was denied, and costs, as on appeal, taxed in favor of defendant. A motion to retax costs was denied, and plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AQy\">Reversed.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-14\">This action is brought to recover the value of certain legal services claimed to \u25a0have been rendered on behalf of the defendant by the plaintiff\u2019s assignor. Upon the trial a nonsuit was directed, and thereupon the exceptions were ordered to be heard at the general term in the first instance. A hearing was subsequently had, which resulted in a denial of the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial, and the overruling of his exceptions; but the order of the general term did not, in terms, award costs to either party. Upon filing the decision of the general term, the clerk taxed the defendant\u2019s costs at the same rate as though there had been an appeal from a judgment. A motion was thereupon made at special term for a retaxation of costs, which was denied, and from the order denying the same this appeal is brought.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b510-15\">Argued before HARDIN, R J., and FOLLETT, ADAMS, GREEN, and WARD, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>W.

Fargo v. Helmer, 43 Hun, 17; Patterson v. Burnett, 17 Civ. Proc. R. 115, 4 N. Y. Supp. 921. In \u25a0this case, as we have seen, a trial was had, and, although a result was reached, no judgment was entered, but the exceptions were ordered to \u25a0be heard in the first instance at the general term. The hearing which followed was simply a motion for a new trial, and the only statute authorizing the allowance of costs upon the decision of such a motion is -section 323G of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides that \"costs \u25a0upon a motion in an action where the costs thereof are not specifically regulated in this act * * may be awarded \"\"\" in the \u2022discretion of the court or judge.\u201d It is apparent, therefore, that, before the prevailing party upon any motion becomes entitled to costs, \u25a0the court before which the motion is made must, in the exercise of its \u25a0discretion, specifically award them. Had the general term awarded \u25a0the defendant costs, he would undoubtedly have been entitled to the several items allowed by the taxing officer. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 3251, subd. 4. It is to be noted, however, that the section just cited does not authorize the award of costs,\u2014it simply establishes the rate at which they shall be adjusted in certain cases where they have been awarded; and, inasmuch as in this instance no costs were awarded to either party, we are unable to discover any theory upon which the order appealed from can be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">Order reversed, and taxation modified by striking out all the costs of .the general term, without costs of this appeal to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
