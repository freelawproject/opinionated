The relator is a domestic corporation organized under chapter 110 of the Laws of 1832. This corporation was organized in said year with a total authorized capital stock of $150,000. The number of shares into which its capital stock was divided was 1,500. The par value of each is $100. The capital stock was issued in payment for a certain piece of real estate known as \u201cSquaw Island,\u201d situate in the Niagara river, which has ever since remained the property of the relator, and is the only property the corporation owns. The island consists of unimproved swamp land, unoccupied, except six or seven acres taken by the International Bridge Company, the compensation for which was $8,000. The island has been assessed by the city of Buffalo at the valuation of $123,000. Under its articles this corporation had the right to purchase and hold and lease real estate, and it held it during the period for which this tax under review was assessed. The company has maintained its organization, held this property, paid taxes upon it, and collected annually about $45 for the grass crop.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b795-11\">Argued before-PARKER, P.

The learned attorney general relies upon the letter of the statute, which declares that \u201cevery corporation i;\" * organized, under any law of this state, except manufacturing * corporations * carrying on manufactures within this state * * shall be subject to and pay a tax,\u201d etc. Laws 1880, c. 542, \u00a7 3. As the relator does no manufacturing, it is not exempt upon that ground.- People v. Horn Silver-Min. Co., 105 N. Y. 82, 11 N. E. 155; People v. Campbell, 144 N. Y. 173, 38 N. E. 990. The franchise tax is imposed upon domestic corporations because of their franchise. It is based upon their capital \u201cemployed within this state,\u201d and graduated according to dividends earned. In respect to foreign corporations, we do not grant them their franchises, but we permit them to do business here; and, as we should not accord them superior advantages over domestic corporations, we try to impose the same rate of taxation upon them, and thus we tax them upon- their business upon the same basis and scale. In People v. Wemple, 150 N. Y. 46, 44 N. E. 787, it was held as to a foreign corporation that the money, whether capital or surplus, which it invested in real estate here, riot for the transaction of its ordinary business, but for rental, was not \u201cemployed within this state,\u201d within the meaning of the statute. If capital can be. invested without being employed, the case before us seems to be a fair instance of it. Of course, the statute does not contemplate that a foreign corporation shall, in this respect, be more favored than a domestic one, and hence we must hold that the relator was not liable to the franchise tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">Determination of the comptroller reversed, with $50 costs and disbursements.
