Devlin, 20 Misc. Rep. 355, 45 N. Y. Supp. 850, that the power to open a default and set aside a judgment entered thereon in a district court action was purely statutory (Laws 1896, c. 748, amending Consolidation Act, \u00a7 1367); that it must appear from the order that the statute has been complied with; and that an order which does not recite and contain the grounds therefor is fatally defective. The section of the consolidation act referred to was not included in the Greater New York charter (see Birdeye\u2019s work on-the latter subject, 44, 45). But, pursuant to section 1369 of said charter, the practice relating to the opening of defaults which obtained in district courts on the 31st day of December, 1897, applies, to, controls, and governs the same in the municipal court and the branches thereof in each district. As the provisions of said act, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>just referred to, are still in force, it follows that the principle of the decision in the last cited case is decisive of the question under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">As to the second point, I am of the opinion that the absence of the said defendant was satisfactorily explained, the same being due to the serious illness of his wife, which resulted in her death two days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The third question presented relates to the filing of an affidavit of merits. Rule 23 of the General Rules of Practice, which applies to the municipal court (Greater New York Charter, \u00a7 1377), in part provides: &lt;(Where an affidavit of merits has once been filed and served no other shall be necessary, but on making a motion such service and filing must be shown by affidavit.\u201d This is in harmony with the prevailing practice requiring an affidavit of merits in order to open a judgment taken by default (1 Enc. PL &amp; Prac. p. 352, and citations; Ludlow v. Coit, 3 N. Y. Law Bul. 102); and, not having been complied with in the present case, it follows that the order should be reversed for this reason, as well as for the defect therein heretofore pointed out.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">There remains to be considered the question of costs. This question was carefully considered by the appellate term in Colwell v. Devlin, 20 Misc. Rep. 616, 617, 46 N. Y. Supp. 450, and again in Szerlip v. Baier, 21 Misc. Rep. 692, 694, 47 N. Y. Supp. 1081; and it was held that, where the appellant succeeds in reversing the order opening a judgment, he is entitled to $30 costs. A careful examination of the authorities induced by the strong plea made upon the argument by counsel for the respondent to be relieved from the payment of full costs on appeal, because of his client\u2019s misfortune and the smallness of the amount involved, but confirms the views expressed by the court in these cases, and from which it appears that we have no discretion in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">For these reasons, to my mind, the order should be reversed, with costs, and the motion remitted to the court below for further hearing, to be brought on upon at least five days\u2019 notice, with leave to the defendant Turner to file and serve an affidavit of merits. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
