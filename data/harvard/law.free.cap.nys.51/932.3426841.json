The attachment proceedings are attacked, in behalf of the defendant, on this appeal, as having been insufficient to confer jurisdiction upon the justice\u2019s court, because the return of the officer who undertook to levy the warrant fails to show, and there is no other evidence in the record showing, that the requirements of section 2910 of the Code of Civil Procedure were complied with. That section commands the officer to serve the summons, together with the warrant of attachment and inventory, upon the defendant, if he can be found within the county; \u201cor, if he cannot be so found, by leaving a copy of each, certified by the constable, at the last place of residence of the defendant in the county, with a person of suitable age and discretion; or, if such person cannot be found there, by posting it on the outer door, and also depositing another copy in the nearest post-office, inclosed in a sealed post-paid wrapper, directed to the defendant at his residence; or, if the defendant has no place of residence in the county, by delivering it to the person in whose possession the property attached is found.\u201d The requirement to serve a copy of the inventory was not observed by the marshal to whom the warrant in the present case was delivered. . Indeed, the record does not show that the officer even made any inventory whatever, the blank provided among the attachment papers for that purpose being left unfilled; and it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>is settled by authority that a failure to serve copies of the papers prescribed by the statute is fatal to the validity of a judgment in an action in a justice\u2019s court, where the defendant has not appeared, and the summons has not been personally served upon him. Egbert v. Watson (Com. PI. Gen. Term, 1861) 21 How. Prac. 429.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">Furthermore, it would seem that the attachment was wholly ineffective, aside from any defect in the service. There was no attempt to attach anything but a chose in action; i. e. a debt from the sheriff to the defendant, growing out of the fact that the sheriff had collected on execution in another suit the amount of a judgment in that suit in the present defendant\u2019s favor. But an attachment in a justice\u2019s court does not extend to such property as this. Under a warrant issued by a justice of the peace, the officer may attach only goods and chattels, including money and bank notes. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 2909. Such is all the powTer specially conferred by the statute in this respect, and the Code itself expressly limits the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace in civil actions and special proceedings to that which is specially conferred upon him by statute. The provisions of section 2909 of the Code are substantially the same as those of the Revised Statutes (2 Rev. St. p. 231, \u00a7 31); and, commenting upon these in his well-known work on the Powers and Duties of Sheriffs, Coroners, and Constables, Mr. Crock-er says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-6\">\u201cProperty exempt from levy and sale on execution cannot he attached unless the claim is for the purchase price of such goods as in the case of executions; nor can dioses in action he attached as they may he in case of attachments issued to the sheriff from courts of record.\u201d Crock. Sber. (3d Ed.) p. 214.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">This statement of the law accords with the plain language of the statute, and is in harmony with the views of the principal text writers in this state on the practice in justices\u2019 courts. It affords as formidable an obstacle to the maintenance of the judgment before us as any of the points presented in behalf of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-8\">Judgment reversed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
