The point, however, is made, that the orders appealed from do not comply with the requirements of chapter 748 of the Laws of 1896, amending section 1867 of the consolidation act, which, among other things, provides that the order of a justice on opening a default \u201cshall recite and contain the grounds for the order.\u201d The objection is well taken, as the justice has utterly failed to comply with this requirement. This is fatal to the orders, and calls for a reversal. Colwell v. Devlin, 20 Misc. Rep. 355, 45 N. Y.
