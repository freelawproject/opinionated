The defendant Mantel alone appeared and defended the action. When the plaintiff rested, said defendant moved for a dismissal of the complaint, upon the ground \u201cthat there was no evidence as to false and fraudulent representations,\u201d- which application was granted, and the former has brought on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-16\">For the purposes of a determination upon such a motion, the testimony of the plaintiff should have been assumed to be true, and he should have been given the benefit of all legitimate inferences therefrom in his favor. There was some evidence of fraud introduced upon the trial, which, viewed in its most favorable light, was susceptible of the inference that plaintiff parted with the possession of the merchandise upon the representation made by the defendant Finer to him, that he had bought two wagons and two horses worth about $400; that such statements were false, and so known to be by the said defendant when made; that they were relied upon by the plaintiff, who would not have delivered the goods <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>but for such representation; that, upon discovering the fraud, plaintiff rescinded the contract of sale, and demanded the return of the property; and that the defendant Mantel bought the same with notice of such alleged fraud. These facts were established, not alone by the plaintiff\u2019s own testimony, but by that of two additional witnesses, and we fail to perceive upon what theory they were ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">It is argued by the said defendant that the justice discredited the plaintiff\u2019s entire testimony. This ruling, however, as we have seen, was not placed upon that ground. Moreover, the plaintiff was corroborated by two witnesses, one of whom was not connected in business with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The defendant further contends that the alleged false representations were made subsequent to the sale and delivery of the goods, but the record shows the contrary. '</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">It follows from these views that the dismissal of the complaint was error, and that the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
