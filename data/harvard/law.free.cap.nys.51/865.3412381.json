In duty, 1893, the defendant had a chattel mortgage against the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>tiff for $75. The defendant asked payment. The plaintiff told him-to take whatever of his personal property he could find at Delanson, and defendant took at Delanson the chattels here in question. They are not those mortgaged. Subsequently they had other dealings; and' on July 22, 1895, the plaintiff, by his agent, Mattice, settled with the defendant, by his agent,\u2014the latter paying the former $17b,\u2014where-upon the plaintiff\u2019s agent gave the defendant\u2019s agent a receipt for the-money \u201cin full for all claims, dues, and demands, and for all actions- and causes of actions, up to date,\u201d between the parties. The plaintiff\u2019s agent paid him the money, which plaintiff retained. The plaintiff makes an apparent effort to weaken the force of this situation, but,, as I think, completely fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">The judgment of the county court should be reversed, and judgment directed for the defendant, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
