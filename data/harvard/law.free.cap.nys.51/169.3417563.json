Thereafter, on the 28th day of January, 1898, plaintiff served a notice of motion to place this action on the short-cause calendar under section 791, subd. 5, Code Civ. Proc., and with said notice of motion served an affidavit in support of the same, setting forth the right of the plaintiff to a preference. The plaintiff, in order to avail herself of the right to a preference under section 791 of the Code of Civil Procedure, should have at the time of the service of the notice of trial served therewith a notice of motion in accordance with provisions of section 793, Id. The plaintiff in her notice of trial set forth an allegation \u201cthat plaintiff claims a preference for the reason that the sole plaintiff is an infant.\u201d This certainly did not cover or fulfill the requirements of section 793 in regard to serving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>a notice of motion for preference with the notice of trial, for the material part of that section on this appeal distinctly says: \u201cBut the party desiring a preference of any casase shall serve upon the opposite party with his notice of trial a notice that an application will be made to the court at the opening thereof. * * By the special rules of this court, the application can be made at the special term instead of the trial term of this court; but rule 14 of the city court rules does not purport to and can in no way override the distinct and clear provisions of section 793, which in its reservation or exception only allows the court to designate the tim\u00e9 at which, or the place where, the application can be made. It .has been held that when the notice \u25a0of trial does not contain, or is not accompanied with, the notice of motion for preference, the party desiring to move the cause on the preferred calendar thereby waives his right. Railway Co. v. Dunn, 13 Civ. Proc. R. 166; Fox v. Quinn (Com. Pl.) 12 N. Y. Supp. 725. Furthermore, the cause has no place on the short-cause calendar. That calendar is concerned with the trial of causes on action on contract that can be tried within one hour, and before placing a cause thereon it is necessary to make it appear that the same can be tried within that time. Rule 14, City Court Rules. This action is brought to recover damages for personal injuries sustained through the negligence of the defendant. The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs, and the motion denied, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
