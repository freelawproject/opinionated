Thornall v. Turner (herewith decided) 51 N. Y. Supp. 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The counsel for the respondent is in error as to the statement contained in his brief that the order was filed on the 11th day of January, 1898. An examination of the return, on the contrary, shows that it was filed on the 10th day of January, 1898, the date mentioned in the notice of appeal. The order should therefore be reversed, with costs, and the motion remitted to the court below for further hearing, to be brought on upon at least five days\u2019 notice, with leave to the defendant to file and serve an affidavit of merits. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
