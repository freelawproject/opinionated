This injunction was shortly afterwards Aracated at special term upon affidavits in behalf of the defendant, which showed that the chnrch proposed to be erected was merely a temporary building, to be used by a congregation in the city of Mt. Vernon until their permanent chnrch edifice should be completed, which would probably be within 24 months, at the expiration of which period the temporary church <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>would be removed. The defendant also proved by affidavit that upon the plaintiff\u2019s land, which was subject to the same covenant, she maintained a building within 30 feet of the front line, although the covenant forbade the erection of any dwelling or other building within that space. It is very doubtful whether a temporary or portable church, such as this was, designed for use during a period not exceeding 24 months, while a permanent church was being erected, came within the prohibition of the covenant. But, whether it did or not, the court, in the exercise of its discretion, was justified in refusing to continue the injunction pendente lite, because it appeared, without contradiction, that the plaintiff herself was maintaining on her own property a house built in violation of the very covenant one of the provisions of which she was seeking to enforce against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements to abide the final award of costs in the action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
