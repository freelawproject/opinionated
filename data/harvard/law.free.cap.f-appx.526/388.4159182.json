James (\u201cJames\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment for defendant Dallas Housing Authority (\u201cDHA\u201d) and Sheila Ann Reynolds (\u201cReynolds\u201d) in a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 suit arising from the termination of James\u2019 housing assistance. Finding no error, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">Until the events giving rise to this suit, James was the recipient of Section 8 housing assistance since June of 2007. On December 16, 2010, James was arrested and jailed on domestic assault charges and was indicted of those charges in early 2011. The indictment alleged that James \u201cintentionally, knowingly and recklessly caused bodily injury to another ... by impeding the normal breathing and circulation of the complainant\u2019s blood by applying pressure to the complainant\u2019s throat and neck and by blocking the complainant\u2019s nose and mouth with the use of [his] hands,\u201d and that James had a dating relationship with the victim and was a member of the victim\u2019s household. On March 1, 2011, DHA issued a letter notifying James that his housing assistance would be terminated because he had failed a criminal background screening. James requested an informal hearing. On March 17, 2011, DHA granted James\u2019 request for an informal hearing in a letter notifying him of his right to be represented by an attorney, to present oral and written evidence, to question witnesses deposed therein, and to argue his case prior to the hearing officer\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-16\">The hearing was held on April 20, 2011 and was presided over by Reynolds, a DHA hearing officer. The evidence against James consisted of his criminal background check, which included the factual allegations surrounding James\u2019 December 16, 2010 arrest and revealed an October 2010 domestic violence conviction and assault charges arising from a 1997 incident. James testified on his own behalf and denied the domestic violence allegations resulting in his December 16, 2010 arrest, and stated the charges were dismissed; however, he admitted to having been previously convicted of misdemeanor assault via a guilty plea in October of 2010. James further claimed that he pleaded guilty to the October 2010 assault solely in order to be released from jail. Reynolds concluded that James was not credible and, based on a preponderance of the evidence, upheld DHA\u2019s decision to terminate James\u2019 housing assistance. She issued a letter to James on May 11, 2011 reflecting her decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>James initiated this suit shortly thereafter, on May 16, 2011, naming as defendants DHA and Reynolds in her individual capacity. James alleges violations of his statutory and constitutional rights under the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437, and he asserts violations of his Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. James filed a motion for summary judgment and a motion to join the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (\u201cHUD\u201d) as a defendant under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19. The district court granted James\u2019 motion to withdraw his motion for summary judgment without referencing James\u2019 Rule 19 motion to join HUD.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting that James failed to establish the deprivation of a constitutional right, that James failed to identify a DHA policy that was the moving force behind any constitutional violation, and that Reynolds was entitled to qualified immunity. The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion, and James timely appealed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">\u201cWe review a summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard as the district court.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Jamison v. McKesson Corp., </em>649 F.3d 322, 326 (5th Cir.2011). Summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings, viewed in the light most favorable to the non-mov-ant, \u201cshow that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 247, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). A genuine issue of material fact exists \u201cif the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 249, 106 S.Ct. 2505. \u201cCon-clusional allegations and denials, speculation, improbable inferences, unsubstantiated assertions, and legalistic argumentation do not adequately substitute for specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial.\u201d <em>TIG Ins. Co. v. Sedgwick James of Washington, </em>276 F.3d 754, 759 (5th Cir.2002). To avoid summary judgment on a qualified immunity defense, the plaintiffs must show more than \u201cmere allegations.\u201d <em>Manis v. Lawson, </em>585 F.3d 839, 843 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">1. Reynolds\u2019 Qualified Immunity</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">Section 1983 provides a cause of action against an individual who, acting under color of state law, has deprived a person of a federally protected statutory or constitutional right. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Qualified immunity.protects government officials sued in their individual capacities \u201cfrom liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982); <em>see Kentucky v. Graham, </em>473 U.S. 159, 166-67, 105 S.Ct. 3099, 87 L.Ed.2d 114 (1985) (holding that offi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>ci\u00e1is in their individual capacities \u201cmay ... be able to assert personal immunity defenses,\u201d including qualified immunity, that are not available in official-capacity suits); <em>Sanders-Burns v. City of Plano, </em>594 F.3d 866, 371 (5th Cir.2010) (stating that qualified immunity is \u201ca defense that is only relevant to individual capacity claims\u201d). This court engages in a two-pronged analysis to determine whether a defendant is entitled to qualified immunity: inquiring (1) whether the plaintiff has alleged a violation of a constitutional right and, if so, (2) whether the defendant\u2019s behavior was objectively reasonable under clearly established law at the time the conduct occurred. <em>Thompson v. Upshur Cnty., </em>245 F.3d 447, 457 (5th Cir.2001). \u201cIf the plaintiff fails to state a constitutional claim or if the defendant\u2019s conduct was objectively reasonable under clearly established law, then the government official is entitled to qualified immunity.\u201d <em>Hampton v. Oktibbeha Cnty. Sheriff Dep't, </em>480 F.3d 358, 363 (5th Cir.2007). \u201cThe relevant, dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.\u201d <em>Lytle v. Bexar Cnty., Tex., </em>560 F.3d 404, 410 (5th Cir.2009). \u201cIf the answer to either question is \u2018no,\u2019 the [government official is] entitled to qualified immunity.\u201d <em>Reichle v. Howards, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 2088, 2093, 182 L.Ed.2d 985 (2012). Courts may exercise discretion in deciding which of the two qualified immunity prongs to address first. <em>Pearson v. Callahan, </em>555 U.S. 223, 231, 129 S.Ct. 808, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">The summary judgment evidence does not show a genuine issue of fact as to whether Reynolds acted unreasonably in the situation with which she was confronted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> James argues that the termination proceedings, and Reynolds\u2019 decision upholding the proceedings, violated his Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights because the defendants relied on the arrest affidavit in terminating his housing assistance and terminated his housing assistance based on a charge of domestic violence rather than a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">First, with the benefit of liberal construction, James argues that his housing termination hearing violated due process. The requirements of procedural due process are \u201cflexible and call[ ] for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.\u201d <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 481, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972). At a minimum, due process requires that notice and an opportunity to be heard \u201cbe granted at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u201d <em>Fuentes v. Shevin, </em>407 U.S. 67, 80, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 32 L.Ed.2d 556 (1972). The ultimate protection afforded to a party raising procedural due process claims depends on (1) the private interest affected, (2) the risk of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, (3) the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards, and (4) the Government\u2019s interest in fiscal and administrative efficiency. <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976); see <em>Goldberg v. Kelly, </em>397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970) (holding that procedural due process requires an evidentiary hearing prior to termination of public assistance payments to welfare recipients and that a city\u2019s benefit termination procedure was constitutionally inadequate where it failed to permit recipients to appear personally or without counsel before the deciding officer and did not permit the recipient to present oral evidence to that official or to confront or cross-examine adverse witnesses).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">Here, James was granted a pretermination hearing, was permitted to appear personally and with the option of representation by legal counsel, and was allowed to present both oral and documentary evidence. When the DHA uses a criminal record to terminate a tenant\u2019s Section 8 assistance, it must notify the tenant and give him or her \u201can opportunity to dispute the accuracy and relevance of that record.\u201d \u00a7 982.553(d)(2). James\u2019 assertion that Reynolds deprived him of his right to present documentary evidence is belied by the summary judgment evidence. Reynolds reviewed the documents James submitted, determined that they were unsigned, and accordingly declined to include them in his hearing file. The documents consisted of an unsigned affidavit, in which James asserts his innocence of the December 16, 2010 allegations, a letter from the City of Dallas stating that it would not investigate his complaint against the arresting officer, and the first page of what appears-to be an appeal of his October 2010 conviction. Reynolds reasonably could have rejected the above documents as not probative. Moreover, James was permitted to testify, and during his testimony he admitted that he pleaded no contest to the October 2010 domestic violence charge. There is no genuine issue of fact as to whether Reynolds proceeded in a manner that was objectively reasonable in conducting the hearing and making an adverse credibility determination given the foregoing facts. Reynolds is entitled to qualified immunity on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Next, James argues that Reynolds\u2019 application of \u00a7 982.553(c) deprived him of his constitutional rights. Section 982.553(c) provides that the Public Housing Authority \u201cmay terminate assistance for criminal activity by a household member ... if the PHA determines, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that the household member has engaged in the activity, regardless of whether the household member has been arrested or convicted for such activity.\u201d As an initial matter, the preponderance of the evidence standard of review is the generally prevailing standard in civil cases (including civil housing termination proceedings, as here), <em>see, e.g., CIGNA Corp. v. Amara, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 1866, 1881, 179 L.Ed.2d 843 (2011) (observing the preponderance of the evidence standard is the \u201cdefault rule for civil cases\u201d), and the Sixth Amendment rights that James invokes apply only to criminal proceedings and are therefore inapplicable here, <em>see </em>U.S. Const, amend. VI; <em>Austin v. United States, </em>509 U.S. 602, 608, 113 S.Ct. 2801, 125 L.Ed.2d 488 (1993) (\u201cThe protections provided by the Sixth Amendment are explicitly confined to \u2018criminal prosecutions.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">Liberally construed, James\u2019 pleadings and brief assert that \u00a7 982.553(c) is unconstitutional because it provides for the termination of benefits based on a charge of domestic violence rather than a full conviction. However, even assuming for the purpose of argument that the regulation is constitutionally infirm for this reason, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>still would not give rise to a \u00a7 1983 claim against Reynolds in this case. James did not cite, and research did not reveal, authority in support of his contention that \u00a7 982.558(c) is constitutionally infirm. To overcome qualified immunity, there must be evidence that \u00a7 982.553(c) or its use was unconstitutional under clearly established law, which he has not done. <em>See Cantrell v. City of Murphy, </em>666 F.3d 911, 921 (5th Cir.2012) (concluding that plaintiff failed to satisfy burden of showing officers\u2019 actions were objectively unreasonable where plaintiffs failed to cite any cases involving sufficiently similar situations that would have provided officer with notice of constitutional duty). James\u2019 bare allegation that any reasonable person in Reynolds\u2019 position would have known that such conduct was unconstitutional is insufficient to generate a material issue of fact on this point. Accordingly, the district court correctly granted Reynolds\u2019 motion for summary judgment based on her qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">II. DHA\u2019s Municipal Liability</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The district court was also correct to grant DHA\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The DHA, as a municipality, is a \u201cperson\u201d subject to suit under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 690, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). \u201c[Mjunicipal liability under \u00a7 1983 requires proof of three elements: a policymaker; an official policy; and a violation of constitutional rights whose \u2018moving force\u2019 is the policy or custom.\u201d <em>Piotrowski v. City of Houston, </em>237 F.3d 567, 578 (5th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Monell, </em>436 U.S. at 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018). Courts will not hold municipalities liable for constitutional violations of its employees under a theory of <em>respondeat superior. Id. </em>Thus, \u00a7 1983 liability attaches \u201conly where that municipality <em>itself </em>causes the constitutional violation at issue.\u201d <em>City of Canton v. Harris, </em>489 U.S. 378, 385, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (1989). Therefore, \u201c[t]he fact that a tortfeasor is an employee or an agent of a municipality is therefore, not sufficient for city liability to attach; the municipality must cause the constitutional tort, which occurs \u2018when execution of a government\u2019s policy or custom, whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may be fairly said to represent official policy, inflicts the injury.\u201d <em>Bolton v. City of Dallas, </em>541 F.3d 545, 548 (5th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Monell, </em>436 U.S. at 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">\u201cThe first requirement for imposing municipal liability is proof that an official policymaker with actual or constructive knowledge of the constitutional violation acted on behalf of the municipality.\u201d <em>Zarnow v. City of Wichita Falls, </em>614 F.3d 161, 167 (5th Cir.2010). A policymaker is \u201cone who takes the place of the governing body in a designated area of city administration.\u201d <em>Webster v. City of Houston, </em>735 F.2d 838, 841 (5th Cir.1984). He or she must \u201cdecide the goals for a particular city function and devise the means of achieving those goals.\u201d <em>Bennett v. City of Slidell, </em>728 F.2d 762, 769 (5th Cir.1984). The Court must next consider whether the allegedly unconstitutional action constitutes a \u201ccustom or policy\u201d of the municipality, which may take the form of, e.g., a policy statement formally announced by an official policymaker or a \u201cpersistent widespread practice of city officials or employees, which, although not authorized by officially adopted and promulgated policy, is so common and well-settled as to constitute a custom that fairly represents municipal policy.\u201d <em>Webster, </em>735 F.2d at 841.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">To the extent that James\u2019 claims relate to Reynolds\u2019 decision to uphold DHA\u2019s termination of benefits, he has failed to identify an official policymaker. The summary judgment evidence does not reveal that Reynolds possesses any authority to establish municipal policy in any regard; rath<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>er, it establishes that Reynolds has no authority to establish rules or policy for DHA. Even if the policymaker prong had been met, the evidence does not reveal a genuine issue of fact as to a municipal \u201ccustom or policy.\u201d Construed liberally, James\u2019 allegations center around two distinct actions: (1) DHA\u2019s initial decision to terminate James\u2019 benefits using a preponderance of the evidence standard to determine whether James had engaged in criminal activity, and (2) Reynolds\u2019 decision to uphold the DHA termination. With regard to Reynolds\u2019 decision to uphold the DHA decision, Reynolds is not a policymaker, and the evidence does not show any official or widespread policy with respect to Reynolds\u2019 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">With regard to the DHA\u2019s initial decision to terminate his housing assistance, James points only to DHA\u2019s application of 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.553(c) as the moving force behind DHA\u2019s alleged violation of his rights. However, DHA cannot be held liable for a policy that is not attributable to it; that regulation was promulgated by the federal government and does not give rise to DHA\u2019s liabihty as a municipality under \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Accordingly, the district court properly granted summary judgment to DHA as the requirements for \u00a7 1983 liability have not been met.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b410-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Circuit Rule 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b411-7\">. \"Under these circumstances, the motion ... was impliedly denied.\u201d <em>Davis v.

In addition to asserting qualified immunity, Reynolds asserts she is entitled to \u201cabsolute immunity,\u201d but does not brief this contention on the merits. <em>Cf. Butz v.

Any contention regarding Rey-nold\u2019s absolute immunity is therefore waived. <em>See, e.g., </em>Fed.

With regard to the federal government\u2019s role, James states in his questions presented that the district court erred by failing to rule on his motion to join HUD as a defendant.
