In his application and testimony Kalaj asserted that he was a Catholic who had built a church in a small village in Albania, and as a result, Islamic fundamentalists began targeting him. Kalaj challenges the denial of his asylum applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>tion on the basis that the IJ and the BIA: (1) erred in determining that he failed to demonstrate past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution; and (2) erred by relying excessively on U.S. Department of State Country Reports on Human Rights Practices in Albania (\u201cCountry Reports\u201d), despite his expert witness\u2019s testimony that they are unreliable. After thorough review, we dismiss the petition in part and deny the petition in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">We review only the BIA\u2019s decision unless the BIA expressly adopts or agrees with the IJ\u2019s decision, in which case we review both the BIA and the IJ\u2019s decisions. <em>Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1350 (11th Cir.2009). We lack jurisdiction to consider an argument that the petitioner failed to exhaust by raising it before the BIA. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250-51 (11th Cir.2006). We review legal determinations <em>de novo, </em>and factual findings under the \u201chighly deferential\u201d substantial evidence test, which requires us to affirm the decision if it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1350-51 (quotation omitted). We \u201cmay not re-weigh the evidence from scratch\u201d and will only reverse if the record compels reversal. <em>Id. </em>at 1351 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">First, we are unpersuaded by Kalaj\u2019s claim that the IJ and BIA erred in determining that he failed to demonstrate past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. An alien who is present in the United States may apply for asylum. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security has the discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets his burden of proving his status as a \u201crefugee.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a); <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). A \u201crefugee\u201d is, in relevant part, any person outside the country of his nationality, who is \u201cunable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself ... of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of\u2019 a protected ground, including religion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">An asylum applicant must establish either: \u201c(1) past persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground or (2) a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Li Shan Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>672 F.3d 961, 964 (11th Cir.2011) (quotation omitted). We have explained that persecution \u201cis an extreme concept that does not include every sort of treatment our society regards as offensive .... Persecution requires more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, unaccompanied by any physical punishment, infliction of harm, or significant deprivation of liberty.\u201d <em>Shi v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>707 F.3d 1231, 1235 (11th Cir.2013) (citation and quotations omitted). We must consider the cumulative effect of any alleged harms. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">To show a well-founded fear of future persecution, an applicant must establish that his fear is \u201csubjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. In most cases, the objective prong can be fulfilled either by establishing past persecution or that the alien has a \u201cgood reason to fear future persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). If an asylum applicant alleges persecution by a private actor, he must prove that \u201chis home country is unable or unwilling to protect him.\u201d <em>Ayala v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>605 F.3d 941, 950 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-9\">For starters, Kalaj argues for the first time on appeal that the IJ and the BIA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>erred in determining that he failed to establish past persecution, and he challenges their factual finding that the shooting incident did not occur. Kalaj conceded in his appeal to the BIA that he had not demonstrated past persecution. Moreover, Kalaj specifically accepted the IJ\u2019s factual findings. As a result, Kalaj failed to exhaust his administrative remedies by raising those issues before the BIA and we lack jurisdiction to consider them. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250-51. Accordingly, we dismiss Kalaj\u2019s petition to the extent that he challenges the IJ\u2019s determination that the shooting incident did not occur and that he failed to establish past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">As for Kalaj\u2019s challenge to the IJ and the BIA\u2019s determination that he failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution, the BIA specifically agreed with the IJ\u2019s reasoning in reaching this conclusion, and we therefore review both the BIA\u2019s opinion and the IJ\u2019s order. <em>Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1350. Here, the IJ and the BIA determined that Kalaj\u2019s fear of future persecution was not well-founded, because (1) Kalaj\u2019s parents remained safely in Albania despite being identified as contributors to the church; (2) the church itself continued to operate without problems; and (3) various reports on Albanian country conditions indicated that Albania allowed religious freedom, that peaceful inter-faith coexistence in Albania was not under threat, and that foreign extremists\u2019 attempts to import fundamentalism had been resisted.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">Based on these findings, which are supported by substantial evidence, the record does not compel reversal. <em>See id. </em>at 1350-51, 1353. Indeed, as the record shows, Kalaj testified that his parents remained safe in Albania and that the church that he built continues to operate. Furthermore, various reports about Albanian country conditions indicated that freedom of religion and peaceful inter-faith coexistence were strong in Albania.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">As for Kalaj\u2019s argument that the IJ and the BIA erred in relying on the fact that Kalaj\u2019s parents remain safe and that the church continues to operate, we are unpersuaded. Kalaj\u2019s explanation \u2014 that his parents and the church remained safe because Kalaj, viewed as an \u201cactivist\u201d by fundamentalists, was the principal target \u2014 does not compel the conclusion that the IJ or the BIA erred in concluding that his fear was not objectively reasonable. As we see it, Kalaj has failed to allege anything else even close to persecution. <em>See Shi, </em>707 F.3d at 1235. Accordingly, we deny Ka-laj\u2019s petition to the extent that he challenges the IJ and the BIA\u2019s conclusion that his fear of future persecution was not well-founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-9\">We likewise find no merit to Kalaj\u2019s claim that the IJ and BIA erred by relying excessively on the Country Reports. The IJ and the BIA \u201cmust consider all evidence introduced by the applicant,\u201d but are not required to discuss every piece of evidence presented if they have given \u201creasoned consideration\u201d to the application. <em>Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1351 (quotations omitted). Rather, they must \u201cconsider the issues raised and announce [the] decision in terms sufficient to enable a reviewing court to perceive that [they have] heard and thought and not merely reacted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). The IJ and the BIA \u201care entitled to rely heavily upon State Department [C]ountry [R]eports,\u201d but they must also analyze the \u201cunique facts of each applicant\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Xiu Ying Wu v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>712 F.3d 486, 495 (11th Cir.2013) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-10\">Here, Kalaj argues that he presented an expert witness who testified that Kalaj\u2019s claims were consistent with Albanian country conditions and that the Country Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>ports were unreliable, and that the IJ and the BIA failed to provide an individualized analysis explaining why they afforded so little weight to the expert testimony. But Kalaj\u2019s arguments are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">First, the IJ and the BIA did consider the expert witness\u2019s testimony. The IJ specifically stated that she had reviewed all of the background documents and she discussed in detail the expert witness\u2019s testimony that the Country Reports were unreliable. The BIA determined that the IJ had considered the expert testimony and that she \u201ccarefully assessed\u201d the reliability of the reports before using them. Accordingly, the IJ and the BIA considered all the evidence and the issues raised, and gave \u201creasoned consideration\u201d to Ka-laj\u2019s application. <em>See Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1351-</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">Second, Kalaj fails to point to any binding precedent for the proposition that the IJ and the BIA must provide an individualized explanation for their reliance on each piece of evidence. Even if such a rule existed, the IJ expressly stated that the expert witness\u2019s testimony supported the accuracy of the Country Reports. The IJ further stated that another report, which Kalaj himself submitted to bolster the expert witness\u2019s testimony that fundamentalism in Albania was on the rise, also supported the conclusion that \u201cpeaceful interfaith co-existence\u201d in Albania continued. The BIA determined that the IJ had \u201ccarefully assessed\u201d the Country Report before relying on it, and noted that the IJ had evaluated the expert witness\u2019s testimony regarding Albanian country conditions. The IJ and the BIA were entitled to rely on the Country Reports, because they had also considered the \u201cunique facts\u201d of Ka-laj\u2019s claim. <em>See Xiu Ying Wu, </em>712 F.3d at 495. Accordingly, we deny Kalaj\u2019s petition to the extent that he challenges the IJ and the BIA\u2019s reliance on the Country Reports and the 2009 International Religious Freedom Report from the United States Department of State.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-7\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART; DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
