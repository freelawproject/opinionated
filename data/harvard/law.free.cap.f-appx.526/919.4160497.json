The BIA denied the motion, which was untimely and number-barred, because the petitioners failed to show changed country conditions to qualify for an exception to the time and number limits applicable to motions to reopen. After reviewing the record and considering the parties\u2019 arguments, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-23\">The petitioners came to the United States in 2002 and, claiming persecution on the basis of political opinion, applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (CAT). They argued that the National Liberation Army (ELN) had targeted them because they were closely associated with Mr. Ramirez-Moreno\u2019s sister, who had opposed the ELN\u2019s efforts to recruit students from a school at which she taught. The petitioners asserted that, after Mr. Ramirez-Moreno\u2019s sister moved to the United States to escape ELN persecution, members of that group twice threatened to kill them if Mr. Ramirez-Moreno did not provide his sister\u2019s contact infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>mation and money he had earned while working in Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">Despite finding Mr. Ramirez-Moreno\u2019s testimony credible, the immigration judge denied the application for relief because the petitioners failed to show any nexus between the threats of harm they had suffered and a protected ground. The IJ found that the ELN\u2019s interest in the petitioners stemmed from the group\u2019s desire for information about Mr. Ramirez-Moreno\u2019s sister and for money, not from the petitioners\u2019 political opinion. The petitioners therefore had not been persecuted as required to be eligible for the relief they sought. The BIA agreed with the IJ and dismissed the petitioners\u2019 appeal in 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">In 2010, the petitioners filed their first motion to reopen, which was based on changed country conditions. The BIA determined that the motion was untimely and that the petitioners had failed to show the changed country conditions required to excuse its lateness. Specifically, the BIA concluded that the petitioners had not submitted objective evidence that conditions in Colombia were materially different than they were when the IJ considered their application. The BIA also noted that even the subjective evidence the petitioners submitted \u2014 statements from relatives who had been menaced by unidentified people looking for Mr. Ramirez-Moreno \u2014 failed to show a nexus between the feared harm and the petitioners\u2019 political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">The petitioners filed a second motion to reopen \u2014 the one that is the subject of this appeal \u2014 in 2011. As it did with the petitioners\u2019 first motion, the BIA determined that their second motion was untimely and that they had not shown materially changed conditions in Colombia. The BIA also concluded that the petitioners\u2019 motion was number-barred and that, although the petitioners\u2019 relatives attested that they still received threats directed at Mr. Ramirez-Moreno and could now identify those making the threats as ELN members, there remained no nexus between the feared harm and a statutory basis for relief. Finding that the petitioners had failed to establish an exception to the time and number limits on motions to reopen, the BIA denied their second motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b941-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-11\">We review the denial of a motion to reopen removal proceedings for abuse of discretion, determining only whether the BIA exercised its discretion in an arbitrary or capricious manner. <em>See Jiang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1252, 1256 (11th Cir.2009). A party is generally limited to filing one motion to reopen, and that motion must be filed within ninety days of the BIA\u2019s final order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. 1229a(e)(7). <em>Cf. Ruiz-Turcios v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>717 F.3d 847, 848-50 (11th Cir.2013) (noting that time limits on motions to reopen are subject to equitable tolling because they are non jurisdictional and suggesting that the same is true of number limits). But the ninety-day deadline does not apply to motions.based on evidence of \u201cchanged circumstances arising in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>ed or presented at the previous hearing.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii). Unlike a change in country conditions, a change in personal circumstances cannot authorize untimely motions to reopen. <em>See Jiang, </em>568 F.3d at 1258.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">The petitioners argue that they have established an exception to the time and number limits on motions to reopen because they submitted evidence to the BIA that was unavailable at the time of the IJ\u2019s decision. Although we agree with the petitioners that the events described by their relatives occurred after the IJ\u2019s initial denial of relief \u2014 and that their family members\u2019 recitations of those events is therefore new evidence \u2014 we do not agree that the evidence shows changed country conditions in Colombia as a whole. At most the evidence shows that, as the petitioners describe it, their \u201cenemies are still looking for\u201d them, and are doing so with an increased intensity.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">The fact that the ELN has stepped up its surveillance efforts regarding the petitioners is certainly a change in their personal circumstances, but it does not rise to the level of changed country conditions. And despite citing to the U.S. Department of State\u2019s country report on Colombia in their brief, the petitioners did not present that report \u2014 or any other objective evidence \u2014 to the BIA in support of their assertion that conditions in their home country had materially changed. Because changed personal circumstances alone cannot excuse a late motion to reopen, <em>see Jiang, </em>568 F.3d at 1258, the BIA did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that no exception to the filing deadline applied to the petitioners\u2019 motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The untimely and number-barred motion was therefore properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b941-8\">. The BIA also found the petitioners ineligible for CAT relief because the threats against them were not made by a public official; the petitioners have waived any challenge to that finding by failing to argue the issue to us. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005). The BIA opted not to use its <em>sua sponte </em>power to reopen, and we lack subject matter jurisdiction to review that decision. <em>See Lenis v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 1291, 1294 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b942-7\">. The petitioners also argue that the BIA erred in ''discrediting]'' their \"documents and credibility,\u201d but the record demonstrates that the BIA expressed no opinion at all about the credibility of the petitioners' evidence or their testimony. The only credibility finding ever made in this case came from the IJ at the petitioners' initial hearing in 2003, and that finding was in the petitioners\u2019 favor. As a result, we consider this argument to be without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
