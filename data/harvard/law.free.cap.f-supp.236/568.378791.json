As required by \u00a7\u00a7 2325 and 2284 of Title 28 U.S.C.A., the cause was heard by a three-judge court.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-25\">The underlying administrative proceedings before an examiner were on submission of undisputed facts and briefs. By its final order, rendered on August 2, 1961, and reported as No. MC-C-2977, Kenosha Auto Transport Corporation \u2014 Investigation and Revocation of Certificate, 89 M.C.C. 550, Division 1 of the Commission affirmed and adopted the examiner\u2019s statement of facts, conclusions and findings as its own, and ordered Kenosha to cease and desist from the operations therein found unlawful. The effective date of the order has been postponed pending further or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>der of the Commission in view of the commencement of this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">The operations found unauthorized in violation of \u00a7 206(a) of the Interstate Commerce Act, \u00a7 306(a), Title 49 U.S. C.A., and the purported grants of authority relied on by Kenosha are as follows: Kenosha receives new trucks at Whiting, Indiana, and at St. Louis, Missouri, under authority set forth in paragraph (D) of its lead certificate<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and in Sub. No. 224 of its certificate No. MC-30837,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> respectively, which trucks were transported in initial movements from Allentown, Pennsylvania, by Dealers Transit, Inc. The shipments are interlined by Kenosha at either Whiting or St. Louis for ultimate delivery to points in numerous western states including Utah, Nebraska, Wisconsin, Texas, Kansas, Colorado, Oklahoma, Michigan, Iowa, Minnesota, California, and New Mexico pursuant to authority of paragraph (A) of its lead certificate which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-5\">\u201cNew trucks, in secondary movements (other than those performed as a connecting carrier) in drive-away service, between points in Arizona, California, Colorado, * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-6\">\u201cRestriction: The authority described immediately above cannot be combined with any authority of another carrier, * * * for the purpose of rendering a through service.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-17\">The combination, or tacking, of its separate grant of authority under paragraph (A) for the purpose of providing a through service purportedly is authorized by the following provision of paragraph (D) of Kenosha\u2019s lead certificate which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-18\">\u201cIn addition to the authorities granted above, except as otherwise restricted herein, the carrier may combine any initial authority and any secondary authority, and any two or more secondary authorities, for the purpose of performing a through service, * * *.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-19\">In the investigation proceedings, the examiner found that the operations were not authorized because of the parenthetical restriction against the performance of services as a connecting carrier and the express restriction against combination of the authority with that of any other carrier, which restrictions are stated in paragraph (A) of the lead certificate. These restrictions, he concluded, were adopted by the tacking proviso of paragraph (D) of the same certificate in view of the phrase \u201cexcept as otherwise restricted herein.\u201d Rejecting Kenosha\u2019s contention that the tacking was not precluded since the restricted authority under paragraph (A) was not directly joined to that of another carrier because of the interposition of Kenosha\u2019s own authorities under paragraph (D) and Sub. No. 224, the examiner inter-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>p.reted the word \u201ccombine\u201d of the tacking proviso as comprehending any joinder of authority, directly or indirectly, in the performance of a through service.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">Kenosha challenges this construction of its certificate, and particularly the interpretation of the word \u201ccombine,\" as clearly erroneous and unreasonable. It offers the following definition of the word \u201ccombine\u201d from Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2d ed., unabridged, 1934), p. 533: \u201cTo unite or join; to link closely together; to bring into harmonious union.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The common meaning of this word, as found in Webster\u2019s, does not preclude the interpretation reached by the examiner. It does not necessarily require a direct, actual linkage in chain fashion of the units sought to be combined. An indirect linkage may also serve to unite or join and to bring into harmonious union the grants of operational authority necessary for the performance of the whole of a transportation through service.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">It has been the position of the Commission that the word \u201cjoin,\u201d or its synonyms which would include the word \u201ccombine,\u201d when used in connection with combination or tacking of authorities, does not require the qualifying words of \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d to preclude the tacking of restricted authority for the purpose of performance of a through service even though the interposition of an unrestricted authority serves to bridge the joinder of the restricted grant. Alterman Transport Lines, Inc. v. Watkins Motor Lines, Inc., 64 M.C.C. 735, 737 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">In view of the dispute concerning the interpretation of the word \u201ccombine,\u201d reference by the Commission to its antecedent decisions in the case to attest to the soundness and consistency of its construction as precluding operation by Kenosha as a connecting carrier is not improper. Cf. Andrew G. Nelson, Inc. v. United States, 355 U.S. 554, n. 558, 78 S.Ct. 496, 2 L.Ed.2d 484 (1958); Sims Motor Transport Lines, Inc. v. United States, 183 F.Supp. 113, 117 (N.D.Ill. 1959), aff\u2019d 362 U.S. 637, 80 S.Ct. 1076, 4 L.Ed.2d 1019.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">The word \u201ccombine,\u201d absent further qualification, is susceptible of the meaning ascribed to it by the examiner and by Commission usage. In light of this meaning, the examiner\u2019s construction of Kenosha\u2019s certificate is not clearly unreasonable, and the affirmance of his conclusions by the Commission is not arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">As a basis for a further challenge to the validity of the Commission\u2019s order, Kenosha contends that the Commission erred as a matter of law in that it failed in the administrative proceedings to accord proper consideration to accepted principles governing the construction of its right to tack or combine separate grants of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">The authorities cited by Kenosha do not require that restrictions embodied in operational grants must yield to a broad right to combine separate restricted grants for the performance of a through service. The Commission has approved the tacking of <em>unrestricted </em>authorities as, for example, in Aetna Freight Lines, Inc., Interpretation of Certificate, 48 M.C.C. 610, 7 C.C.H. Federal Carriers Cases, \u00a7 31,529 (Div. 5, 1948). It has granted authority to tack where there was no showing of a need of limitation as in Eldon Miller, Inc., Extension, 78 M.C.C. 113, 13 C.C.H. Federal Carriers Cases, \u00a7 34,437 (Div. 1, 1958), and, further, has approved combination of authorities where there was no showing of need of the service as in Convoy Company v. United States, 200 F.Supp. 10 (D.Ore.1961). Where, as here, the carrier seeks to join with other authority a separate, restricted grant, the restrictions have not been waived in favor of the right to combine authorities. M. I. O\u2019Boyle &amp; Son, Inc. v. E. Brooke Matlack, Inc., 81 M.C.C. 201, 202, 203 (1959) ; and Bilyeu Refrigerated Transport Corporation Extension, 92 M.C.C. 633, 640 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-13\">\u25a0 Kenosha\u2019s argument concerning the proper construction of the right to com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>bine grants of authority was presented to the Commission. Kenosha has not shown that consideration of this argument would have required a different conclusion than that reached by the examiner. The Commission did not err as a matter of law in its adoption and affirmance of the examiner\u2019s conclusions under these circumstances. See North American Van Lines, Inc. v. United States, 217 F.Supp. 837, 842 (N.D.Ind.1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">It is well settled that the Commission\u2019s construction of its certificates is controlling on the courts unless arbitrary or clearly erroneous. Andrew G. Nelson, Inc. v. United States, 355 U.S. 554, 558, n. 4, 78 S.Ct. 496, 2 L.Ed.2d 484 <em>(1958); </em>J. H. Nowinsky Trucking Company v. United States, 195 F.Supp. 748, 752 (W.D.Wis.1961). There is no showing in this case of clear lack of rationality, arbitrariness, or error in law. The complaint must be and it is hereby dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b630-8\">.
