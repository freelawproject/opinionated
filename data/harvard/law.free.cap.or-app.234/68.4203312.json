J.</author>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">In this workers\u2019 compensation case, the issue is whether an employer may, in a notice of closure, reduce a worker\u2019s benefits because of the worker\u2019s failure to comply with a prescribed program of physical therapy. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Board (board) concluded that the appropriate procedure for reducing benefits because of a failure to follow medical advice is for the employer to request the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services (director) to modify the worker\u2019s benefits, not to simply reduce the benefits in the notice of closure. Employer seeks review, arguing that the director and the board have authority, when reviewing a notice of closure, to permit a reduction in benefits because of a worker\u2019s failure to follow medical advice. We conclude that the board did not err and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">We begin with a brief description of the relevant statutory context for the parties\u2019 dispute. At claim closure, an employer is required to determine the amount of benefits, if any, for a worker\u2019s permanent partial disability. ORS 656.214(l)(c) defines \u201cpermanent partial disability\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-6\">\u201c(A) Permanent impairment resulting from the compensable industrial injury or occupational disease; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-7\">\u201c(B) Permanent impairment and work disability resulting from the compensable industrial injury or occupational disease.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">ORS 656.214(l)(a) defines \u201cimpairment\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-9\">\u201cthe loss of use or function of a body part or system due to the compensable industrial injury or occupational disease determined in accordance with the standards provided under ORS 656.726, expressed as a percentage of the whole person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">ORS 656.214(l)(e) defines \u201cwork disability\u201d as \u201cimpairment modified by age, education and adaptability to perform a given job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">ORS 656.214(2) describes the components of a permanent partial disability award:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>\u201cWhen permanent partial disability results from a compensable injury or occupational disease, benefits shall be awarded as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-4\">\u201c(a) If the worker has been released to regular work * * * or has returned to regular work at the job held at the time of injury, the award shall be for impairment only. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-7\">\u201c(b) If the worker has not been released to regular work * * * or has not returned to regular work at the job held at the time of injury, the award shall be for impairment and work disability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">\u201cRegular work\u201d means \u201cthe job the worker held at injury.\u201d ORS 656.214(l)(d). Pursuant to ORS 656.214(2), an award of permanent disability to a worker who has been released to or returned to \u201cregular work\u201d includes benefits \u201cfor impairment only.\u201d An award to a worker who has <em>not </em>been released to regular work includes benefits for impairment <em>and </em>work disability. Thus, only a worker who, after claim closure, remains disabled from regular work is entitled to benefits for work disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">At the pertinent time, ORS 656.726(4)(f)(D)(i) (2003) provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-10\">\u201c[Ilmpairment is the only factor to be considered in evaluation of the worker\u2019s disability under ORS 656.214(5) if</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-11\">\u201c(i) The worker returns to regular work at the j ob held at the time of injury; [or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-12\">\u201c(ii) The attending physician * * * releases the worker to regular work at the job held at the time of injury and the job is available but the worker fails or refuses to return to that job.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-13\">ORS 656.726(4)(f)(D)(i) (2003) emphasizes that, when the worker has either returned to or been released for regular work, impairment is the only factor to be considered in evaluating the worker\u2019s disability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>With the foregoing in mind, we turn to the facts of this case, which are not in dispute. Claimant, a choker setter, was injured at work in January 2005, when he was struck by a log. SAIF accepted a claim for minimally displaced fractures of the LI, L2, L3, and L4 transverse processes and left flank subcutaneous contusion. In February 2005, at claimant\u2019s own request, his attending physician, Dr. McCulley, released him to regular work; after two weeks on the job, however, claimant returned to McCulley with low back pain, and the doctor took him off work.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">In April 2005, claimant began treating with Dr. French. French prescribed physical therapy and progressive rehabilitation designed to facilitate claimant\u2019s return to regular work. Claimant, however, repeatedly failed to attend his physical therapy sessions. He was placed on an attendance contract and was ultimately discharged from therapy for failure to attend. On September 8, 2005, French released claimant for regular work. His report stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-5\">\u201cAt this time, I do not believe he will harm himself by returning to work, but it would be prudent to do a progressive work release due to his deconditioning, but again as noted, his fracture should be stable. I would not anticipate problems from that standpoint. I will see him for follow-up on a p.r.n. basis. He is medically stationary at this time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Claimant\u2019s work duties involved occasionally lifting chokers, blocks, ropes, and haywire coils up to 51 - 100 pounds, and fell within the base functional capacity category of \u201cvery heavy.\u201d After a closing examination on December 29, 2005, French found that claimant had demonstrated an ability to lift 50 pounds, but that he had not demonstrated the ability to occasionally lift and carry 100 pounds. French opined that, if claimant had finished physical therapy, he would be able to occasionally lift and carry 100 pounds. He opined that claimant\u2019s limitations were \u201cdue to noncompliance, rather than a permanent residual from his work injury.\u201d In releasing claimant to work, French restricted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>claimant to lifting up to 65 pounds occasionally and provided a return to work form that specified medium capacity work.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Based on French\u2019s evaluation of claimant\u2019s disability, SAIF issued a notice of closure awarding claimant 19 percent \u201cwhole person impairment,\u201d but no value for \u201cwork disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">SAIF\u2019s notice of closure worksheet contains sections for calculating impairment and work disability. For claimant\u2019s injury, the impairment section of SAIF\u2019s worksheet included calculations for impairment and a benefit of 19 percent for the whole person. The worksheet included no calculation or benefit for work disability. SAIF closed the claim with an award of 19 percent loss of the whole person for impairment to the low back. SAIF\u2019s award did not include a value for work disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Claimant requested reconsideration by the director pursuant to ORS 656.268,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> asserting that he was entitled to a value for work disability. In upholding the notice of closure, the director\u2019s appellate reviewer explained that \u201c[t]here is not a preponderance of medical opinion which establishes a different level of impairment\u201d from that determined by French. The director rejected claimant\u2019s request for a value for work disability, reasoning that French had given claimant a release to regular work due to the accepted conditions, but that claimant had failed to return to that job.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Claimant requested a hearing, contending that the appellate reviewer had erred in not awarding a value for work disability. Specifically, claimant asserted that, contrary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>to the director\u2019s determination, French had not released him for regular work.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Citing ORS 656.726(4)(f)(D)(i) and (ii) (2003), the administrative law judge (ALJ) affirmed the director\u2019s order on reconsideration, finding that claimant had actually returned to his regular work for a brief period of time pursuant to McCulley\u2019s release. The ALJ further explained that subsequent work limitations imposed by French were due to claimant\u2019s noncompliance with treatment rather than a permanent residual from his work injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Claimant appealed to the board. In response, SAIF contended that claimant had been released for regular work that had been made available to him and therefore was not entitled to an award for work disability. SAIF further asserted that any inability to return to work had been caused by claimant\u2019s failure to comply with French\u2019s treatment recommendation; accordingly, his inability to return to work was not due to the accepted conditions, and his failure to comply with treatment \u201camounted to a constructive refusal to return to his regular work.\u201d Under those circumstances, SAIF contended, claimant\u2019s disability award should be limited to impairment only.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">The board reversed the ALJ, rejecting her conclusion that claimant had been released for regular work. The board explained that, in light of subsequent work limitations imposed by McCulley and French, claimant\u2019s brief release for regular work by McCulley did not disqualify him from receiving benefits for work disability. In determining that claimant was entitled to a value for work disability, the board found that claimant\u2019s disability resulted from his compensable injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">The board further rejected the ALJ\u2019s rationale that claimant\u2019s failure to comply with French\u2019s prescription of physical therapy disqualified him from receiving work disability. Citing ORS 656.325, the board explained that, although the failure to participate in a program of physical rehabilitation <em>can </em>result in a suspension of temporary benefits or a reduction in permanent benefits, that can occur only by means of a separate process. According to the board, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>employer or insurer must first request a reduction in benefits, complying with the procedural requirements of ORS 656.325(4)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and OAR 436-060-0105(14).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The board concluded that, independent of such a request for reduction, neither the board nor the director has authority, on review of a claim closure under ORS 656.268, to reduce benefits below the amount required by the standards on the ground of noncompliance. The board explained that the only issue before it on review of an order on reconsideration of a notice of claim closure pursuant to ORS 656.268 is whether the disability resulted from the compensable injury. Having found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>claimant\u2019s disability was a result of his compensable injury, the board determined that claimant was entitled to work disability. Accordingly, the board ordered that claimant\u2019s benefits be adjusted to include a value of 31 percent for work disability.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>\u201cWhen the employer of an injured worker, or the employer\u2019s insurer determines that the injured worker has failed to follow medical advice from the attending physician or nurse practitioner authorized to provide compensable medical services under ORS 656.245 or has failed to participate in or complete physical restoration or vocational rehabilitation programs prescribed for the worker pursuant to this chapter, the employer or insurer may petition the director for reduction of any benefits awarded the worker. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if the director finds that the worker has failed to accept treatment as provided in this subsection, the director may reduce any benefits awarded the worker by such amount as the director considers appropriate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>In a motion for reconsideration of the board\u2019s order, SAIF conceded that ORS 656.325(4) was not directly applicable. It asserted, however, that that statute expresses the legislative policy that a worker must make reasonable efforts to reduce disability, and that a worker\u2019s benefits may be reduced if the worker fails to do so. SAIF contended that a worker\u2019s unreasonable noncompliance with treatment recommendations breaks the chain of causation between the injury and the claimant\u2019s disability, and that claimant therefore was not entitled to an award for \u201cwork disability.\u201d SAIF further argued that, under <em>Nelson v. EBI Companies, </em>296 Or 246, 252, 674 P2d 596 (1984), the board has general authority \u2014apart from ORS 656.325 \u2014 to reduce an award of permanent partial disability below the amount required by the standards when a worker unreasonably refuses medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">In its order on reconsideration, the board further addressed ORS 656.325(4) and OAR 436-060-0105, holding that they are inapplicable to the present case. As the board interpreted ORS 656.325(4), in the absence of a request to the director, the board was not authorized to reduce a claimant\u2019s benefits at the time of claim closure because of a failure to participate in physical rehabilitation. The board explained that the director\u2019s administrative rule, OAR 436-060-0105, addresses when a permanent partial disability award maybe reduced because of an injured worker\u2019s failure to follow medical advice or participate in physical rehabilitation, and that rule requires that the request for such a reduction be initiated after claim closure by the filing of a petition with the director pursuant to OAR 436-060-0105(14).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Finally, the board rejected SAIF\u2019s contention that it has general authority to reduce an award of permanent partial disability below the amount required by the standards when a worker unreasonably refuses medical treatment. Distinguishing <em>Nelson, </em>the board explained that, when the disability results from the compensable injury \u2014 as opposed to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>preexisting condition \u2014 the employer\u2019s only remedy for a claimant\u2019s failure to comply with treatment recommendations is to request a reduction in benefits pursuant to ORS 656.325(4) and OAR 436-060-0105(14). Having concluded that claimant\u2019s disability was caused by his compensable injury and that SAIF had not filed a request with the director seeking a reduction in claimant\u2019s benefits, the board adhered to its determination that claimant was entitled to an award of permanent partial disability that included a value for work disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">SAIF now petitions for judicial review, contending that the board erred in failing to affirm the director\u2019s order on reconsideration upholding the reduced award due to claimant\u2019s failure to comply with French\u2019s physical therapy regimen. SAIF now contends \u2014 contrary to the position that it took before the board \u2014 that ORS 656.325(4) <em>is </em>applicable and that it expressly provides the director with authority to reduce permanent partial disability benefits on review of a notice of closure, even in the absence of a request from the insurer or employer. Further, SAIF contends, to the extent that ORS 656.325(4) and the director\u2019s administrative rule, OAR 436-060-0105(14), permit the filing of a request by the employer or insurer for a reduction in benefits, those provisions are not inconsistent with the director\u2019s general authority to reduce disability benefits. Finally, SAIF contends, apart from any statutory provision, the director and board have general authority to reduce compensation for disability caused by a claimant\u2019s failure to mitigate his own disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">At the outset, we decline to consider SAIF\u2019s argument that the director has general authority under ORS 656.325(4) and OAR 436-060-0105(14), on review of a notice of closure, to reduce an award because of a claimant\u2019s failure to comply with a physician\u2019s treatment recommendations. In its argument to the board requesting reconsideration of the board\u2019s order, SAIF conceded that ORS 656.325(4) was inapplicable. The board reached that same conclusion. SAIF cannot be heard now to contend the opposite.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>SAIF contends that the director and the board have authority, independent of ORS 656.325(4), to reduce a claimant\u2019s benefits below the amount calculated under the standards when the claimant unreasonably fails to comply with recommended treatment. SAIF relies on <em>Nelson, </em>in which the Supreme Court upheld a reduction in the rating of permanent disability because of the claimant\u2019s failure to comply with recommended treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\"><em>Nelson </em>is distinguishable from this case, however. In that case, the question was whether the board, in making an initial determination of the extent of the claimant\u2019s disability for a low back injury, could consider the claimant\u2019s failure to mitigate her disability by not following her doctor\u2019s advice to lose weight. The evidence showed that the claimant\u2019s disability was partially attributable to her excessive weight, which was a preexisting condition. 296 Or at 252. This court approved of the board\u2019s statement that, although ORS 656.325(4) was not directly applicable, because the claimant had not received an award of permanent disability, the statute is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-4\">\u201can application to specific circumstances of the general principles, applicable to the circumstances of this case, that an injured party has a duty to mitigate damages and that the worker\u2019s compensation system is generally not liable for pre-existing, nonindustrial conditions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">64 Or App at 23. We applied those general principles to justify the reduced award. Of significance to this court in <em>Nelson </em>were the facts that the condition \u2014 excessive weight \u2014 (1) was causing the disability and (2) was preexisting and nonindustrial. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court affirmed. 296 Or at 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">In this case, in contrast, the board expressly found that, \u201cdespite his noncompliance with the treatment recommendations, the record establishes that claimant\u2019s inability to return to regular work remained the result of his compensable injury.\u201d Furthermore, the board found that claimant\u2019s condition was not preexisting. Substantial evidence supports those findings. For those reasons, we agree with the board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>that <em>Nelson </em>is distinguishable and does not guide the outcome in this case. Accordingly, we conclude that the board did not err in requiring an award for work disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b93-14\"> Similarly, OAR 436-035-0009(3) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-15\">\"Only permanent impairment is rated for those workers with a date of injury prior to January 1, 2006 and who:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-16\">\u201c(a) Return to and are working at their regular work on the date of issuance; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AY7E\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>\u201c(b) The attending physician or authorized nurse practitioner releases to regular work and the work is available, but the worker fails or refuses to return to that job[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b95-7\"> French\u2019s December 29,2005, report stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-8\">\u201cFunctionally, he has demonstrated a 50-pound lift.

I believe he would have demonstrated job-at-injury at time he was medically stationary September 8, had he complied with treatment regimen.
