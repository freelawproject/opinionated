J.</author>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">In this post-conviction relief case, petitioner alleges that his counsel was inadequate for failing to move for a mistrial after the trial court refused to remove a specific juror. That juror had prior personal knowledge of a man, Harding, who was with petitioner during the shooting for which petitioner was convicted. Although Harding\u2019s name was not on the witness lists read to the jury during <em>voir dire </em>and Harding did not testify at trial, reference to his name was made at trial. Thereafter, the juror notified the court that she knew Harding. Subsequently, trial counsel moved to replace that juror with an alternate, and the trial court denied that motion. Trial counsel did not move for a mistrial, and appellate counsel did not assign error on direct appeal to the denial of the motion to replace the juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Petitioner alleged in his petition for post-conviction relief that, among other claims, he was denied constitutionally adequate counsel for those omissions by his trial and appellate counsel. The post-conviction court denied his petition, and petitioner appeals from that judgment. We review the post-conviction court\u2019s judgment for errors of law and for evidence to support its findings, <em>Stroup v. Hill, </em>196 Or App 565, 568, 103 P3d 1157 (2004), <em>rev den, </em>338 Or 432 (2005), and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The following facts are undisputed. Petitioner shot another man, Williams, with a firearm. That shooting followed an earlier dispute in which petitioner and Williams agreed to meet to fight each other. At that time, petitioner was visiting Harding at his home. Harding gave petitioner a gun and accompanied petitioner on a walk. While petitioner and Harding were walking, they encountered Williams, who was accompanied by two other men. During that encounter, petitioner shot Williams. According to petitioner, Harding stood off to the side and was not really involved in the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Petitioner was indicted for attempted murder with a firearm, ORS 161.405, ORS 161.610 and ORS 163.115; first-degree assault with a firearm, ORS 161.610 and ORS 163.185; unlawful use of a weapon, ORS 166.220; and felon in possession of a weapon, ORS 166.270. At the trial, petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>admitted that he shot Williams, but asserted that he did so in self-defense, to try \u201cto stop [Williams] from coming at me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-3\">Harding was not on the witness list and did not testify at trial. However, during the second day of trial, one of the jurors approached the court clerk. The clerk reported to the court and the attorneys:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-4\">\u201cShe came to me and said that when yon gave the list of witnesses she didn\u2019t hear Jeremy Harding listed and she knows him, and she stated, I know him only too well and it\u2019s coloring my perception of things.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel suggested that the court give some kind of curative instruction to the juror or, in the alternative, allow an inquiry to gain more specific information. The state countered that there was no basis for the court to conduct any further inquiry of that juror. The court instructed the clerk to inform the juror that \u201cHarding was not on the witness list and will not be a witness.\u201d The court did not specifically address trial counsel\u2019s request for a further inquiry of the juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Trial counsel subsequently requested that the court remove the juror and seat the alternate in order to ensure the fairness of the trial and to protect petitioner\u2019s due process rights. The trial court replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">\u201cThe only communication we had from [the juror] was to the extent that she was apparently apprehensive or worried that this person was going to be a witness. * * * [B]ecause she thought that person was going to be a witness, apparently that\u2019s the reason she communicated, but there is no misconduct because this person, Mr. Harding, is not a witness and nobody inquired of the jury as to whether or not they would be affected if that name was mentioned. * * * [W]e find ourselves in an unusual position: now that she knows he is not a witness, I don\u2019t know what, if anything, that would have in terms of an impact on her.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">The trial court then clarified its understanding that the juror had concerns about impartiality only \u201cbecause she thought [Harding] was going to be a witness.\u201d The trial court then stated, \u201cI don\u2019t know if she has any additional concerns once she was told that that person is not a witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Trial counsel again requested, at the close of the evidence, that the juror be replaced with an alternate juror because the juror\u2019s statement to the clerk \u201csupports an inference that she is actually biased.\u201d The court denied \u201cthe motion to replace that juror because I don\u2019t find at this point that there has been any misconduct * * * based on the evidence before the Court.\u201d However, the court indicated that it would, and later did, provide the standard instruction to the jury not to \u201callow bias, sympathy or prejudice any place in [its] deliberations\u201d and not to \u201cdecide this case on guesswork, conjecture or speculation.\u201d Ultimately, the jury acquitted petitioner on the attempted murder count and convicted petitioner on the remaining counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">Petitioner appealed his convictions but did not assign error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion that the juror be replaced with an alternate. We affirmed without opinion. <em>State v. Monahan, </em>203 Or App 808, 129 P3d 803, <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 308 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\"> Petitioner then filed this petition for post-conviction relief, alleging that he had been denied effective assistance of counsel in contravention of his rights under Article I, section II, of the Oregon Constitution and the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. In a post-conviction proceeding, a petitioner is entitled to relief on a claim for ineffective assistance of <em>trial </em>counsel pursuant to Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution, only if the petitioner shows by the preponderance of the evidence that (1) criminal trial counsel failed to exercise reasonable professional skill and judgment, and (2) petitioner suffered prejudice as a result of that failure.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Cunningham v. Thompson, </em>186 Or App 221, 225, 62 P3d 823, <em>modified and adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>188 Or App 289, 71 P3d 110 (2003), <em>rev den, </em>337 Or 327 (2004); <em>see also Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 US 668, 688, 694, 104 S Ct 2052, 80 L Ed 2d 674 (1984) (providing similar standard under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution). For a claim for ineffective assistance of <em>appellate </em>counsel, a petitioner must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>show that competent appellate counsel would have raised that claimed error and that, if the claimed error had been raised, \u201cit is more probable than not that the result would have been different.\u201d <em>Guinn v. Cupp, </em>304 Or 488, 496, 747 P2d 984 (1987); <em>see also Smith v. Robbins, </em>528 US 259, 285, 120 S Ct 746, 145 L Ed 2d 756 (2000) (stating similar standard under the federal constitution).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Specifically, petitioner alleged that his trial counsel was inadequate for failing to move for a mistrial where a juror knew Harding and that his appellate counsel was inadequate for failing to appeal the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to exclude the juror and seat an alternate. The post-conviction court denied the petition, finding that the trial court had determined that \u201cthere was no reason to believe that the juror would be biased.\u201d Petitioner renews his arguments on appeal. On review, we conclude that petitioner did not demonstrate prejudice, and we affirm on that basis without reaching the issue of inadequate representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">We turn first to petitioner\u2019s assignment of error relating to his trial counsel\u2019s failure to move for mistrial. In order to prove that any failure of trial counsel caused prejudice of a constitutional magnitude under Article I, section 11, a petitioner must show that counsel\u2019s advice, acts, or omissions had \u201ca tendency to affect the result of the prosecution.\u201d <em>Stevens v. State of Oregon, </em>322 Or 101, 110, 902 P2d 1137 (1995) (emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cWhether a petitioner has demonstrated prejudice is a question of law that, in turn, may depend on the post-conviction court\u2019s findings of fact.\u201d <em>Wyatt v. Czerniak, </em>223 Or App 307, 311, 195 P3d 912 (2008). We are bound by the post-conviction court\u2019s factual findings if they are supported by evidence in the record. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Accordingly, we consider whether trial counsel\u2019s failure to move for a mistrial had a tendency to affect the result of the prosecution. \u201cIn ruling on a motion for a mistrial, a trial court must decide whether to grant the motion, to cure the effect of inappropriate conduct or testimony by giving a proper instruction instead, or to do nothing at all.\u201d <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number><em>Evans, </em>211 Or App 162, 166, 154 P3d 166 (2007), <em>aff'd, </em>344 Or 358, 182 P3d 175 (2008). Thus, petitioner could show prejudice if, had trial counsel moved for a mistrial, that motion would have had a tendency to cause the court to either grant the motion or to give a curative instruction that would have had a tendency to affect the prosecution in the underlying criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"> Here, the post-conviction court found that the trial court determined \u201cthat there was no reason to believe that the juror would be biased.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That finding is supported by the evidence that the trial court had denied defendant\u2019s request to replace the juror with an alternate. As noted, the juror\u2019s statement, at most, indicated a bias against Harding, who was not called as a witness. Where the trial court had no reason to believe that the juror was biased against defendant, the trial court had no reason to have issued a curative instruction or grant a mistrial. Thus, petitioner did not demonstrate that he was prejudiced by his trial counsel\u2019s failure to move for a mistrial. For that reason, the post-conviction court did not err in concluding that petitioner was not denied adequate trial counsel in contravention of his rights under Article I, section 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\"> Similarly, under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a petitioner seeking post-conviction relief must show \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 US at 694. For the same reasons that we conclude that the post-conviction court did not err in denying petitioner\u2019s claim regarding his trial counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>under the state constitution, we also conclude that the post-conviction court did not err in denying petitioner\u2019s claim under the federal constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-3\">We next address petitioner\u2019s assignment of error relating to his appellate counsel\u2019s failure to assign error to the trial court\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s motion to replace the juror with an alternate juror. Under Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution, petitioner must show that, had the claimed error been raised, \u201cit is more probable than not that the result would have been different.\u201d <em>Guinn, </em>304 Or at 496. Similarly, under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, petitioner must show a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that the petitioner \u201cwould have prevailed on appeal\u201d but for any unreasonable failure by appellate counsel to raise an error. <em>Smith, </em>528 US at 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Accordingly, it was petitioner\u2019s burden before the post-conviction court to establish that there was a reasonable probability that petitioner would have prevailed on direct appeal had appellate counsel assigned error to the trial court\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s motion to replace the juror with an alternate. After a trial commences, a trial court must dismiss a juror only if the \u201cjuror dies or is unable to perform the duty because of illness or other cause which the court <em>deems sufficient.\u201d </em>ORS 136.280 (emphasis added); <em>see </em>ORS 136.240 (allowing a court to permit a challenge for good cause shown \u201cbefore the jury is completed and sworn\u201d). Thus, petitioner\u2019s burden at the post-conviction court was to show that it is at least reasonably probable that this court, or the Supreme Court, would have found that the trial court erroneously concluded that the juror was able to perform her duties by failing to \u201cdeem sufficient\u201d petitioner\u2019s allegation of juror bias as cause for dismissal of the juror. Under that test, a trial court has discretion to \u201cdeem sufficient\u201d such an allegation of juror bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">For context, we observe that the trial court has discretion to remove a juror for actual bias during <em>voir dire. State v. Montez, </em>309 Or 564, 574-75, 789 P2d 1352 (1990). To determine whether a juror should be excused before trial, \u201cthe test is whether the prospective juror\u2019s ideas or opinions would impair substantially his or her performance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>duties of a juror to decide the case fairly and impartially on the evidence presented in court.\u201d <em>State v. Barone, </em>328 Or 68, 74, 969 P2d 1013 (1998), <em>cert den, </em>528 US 1135 (2000); <em>see also </em>ORCP 57 D(l)(g) (defining \u201cactual bias\u201d and applied to the criminal code by ORS 136.210(1)). We conclude that the standard for removing a juror <em>after </em>trial commences is at least as stringent as the standard for removal <em>before </em>trial. Accordingly, we examine whether the trial court would have abused its discretion in denying a motion to replace the juror due to a substantial impairment of the juror to decide the case fairly and impartially.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">Here, the juror told the court clerk that she knew Harding \u201conly too well\u201d and that knowledge was \u201ccoloring [her] perception of things.\u201d However, the mere fact that a juror may have preconceived ideas does not mean,per <em>se, </em>that a juror cannot be fair and impartial. <em>State v. Evans, </em>344 Or 358, 362, 182 P3d 175 (2008). Thus, although the juror\u2019s statement may indicate that the juror had formed an opinion as to Harding that was coloring her \u201cperception of things,\u201d it does not, without further inquiry, implicate any bias against petitioner: petitioner does not argue that his appellate counsel was deficient for failing to raise the trial court\u2019s refusal to inquire further and the record does not show the type of bias that would require dismissal of the juror. Under those circumstances, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the juror to remain on the jury. Accordingly, there was not a reasonable probability that petitioner would have prevailed on direct appeal if appellate counsel had assigned error to the trial court\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s motion to dismiss the juror. The post-conviction court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">In sum, the post-conviction court did not err in denying petitioner\u2019s claims for post-conviction relief on grounds that his trial or appellate counsel were constitutionally inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b121-7\"> Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution provides, in part, \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have the right * * * to be heard by * * * counsel!.]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b123-6\"> \u201cThe question whether a juror is biased is one of fact, to be determined by the trial court from all the circumstances, including the challenged juror\u2019s demeanor, apparent intelligence, and candor.\u201d <em>State v.
