On the second-degree assault conviction, defendant was sentenced to 34 months\u2019 imprisonment, to run consecutively to his 240-month sentences for murder. The court entered a judgment and then a corrected judgment that described the sentence for second-degree assault as a \u201cpresumptive\u201d sentence pursuant to grid block 8-C of the sentencing guidelines. In 2007, defendant moved, pursuant to ORS 138.083(1), to correct various errors in the corrected judgment, including (1) the failure to merge the two felony murder convictions; and (2) a violation of the \u201cshift-to-I\u201d rule<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> regarding the \u201cpresumptive\u201d 34-month prison term. After a hearing on the motion, the trial court entered a second corrected judgment that merged the two murder convictions and described the sentence for second-degree assault as a departure sentence under grid block 8-1 rather than a \u201cpresumptive\u201d sentence under grid block 8-C.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court denied him the right to allocution \u2014 that is, the right to be heard personally \u2014 at the hearing on his motion to correct the judgment. Defendant further argues that the trial court, in the process of correcting his \u201cpresumptive\u201d sentence, committed a new error by imposing a departure sentence based on its own factual findings, in violation of his Sixth Amendment rights as enunciated in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 US 296, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004). We reject both arguments and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">We begin with defendant\u2019s Blakely-based argument, because it informs our discussion of his contentions regarding allocution. As noted above, the original judgment and the first corrected judgment described defendant\u2019s sentence for second-degree assault as a \u201cpresumptive\u201d sentence based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>grid block 8-C of the sentencing guidelines. In response to defendant\u2019s contention that the sentence violated the \u201cshift-to-I\u201d rule, the trial court\u2019s second corrected judgment instead described the sentence as a \u201cdurational departure sentence\u201d under grid block 8-1, listing the reasons for the departure as \u201ctendency to engage in violent conduct,\u201d \u201cdegree of harm more substantial,\u201d and \u201con post prison supervision at time of offense.\u201d The actual term of incarceration remained the same \u2014 34 months \u2014 as did the period of post-prison supervision (36 months), and the sentence still ran consecutively to defendant\u2019s sentence for murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">Defendant\u2019s argument on appeal is that the correction regarding his sentence was more than a clerical change to the judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In his view, the original \u201cpresumptive\u201d sentence was void as a matter of law, which required the court to impose a new, lawful sentence under grid block 8-1 of the sentencing guidelines. Consequently, defendant argues, if the court was going to impose an upward departure sentence, it was required to empanel a jury to find any enhancement facts to justify the imposition of that departure sentence. <em>See </em>ORS 136.770(1); ORS 136.773; <em>Blakely, </em>542 US at 303-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">The premise of defendant\u2019s argument \u2014 that the court initially imposed a void \u201cpresumptive\u201d sentence \u2014 is incorrect. The transcript from defendant\u2019s 1996 sentencing proceedings indicates that the trial court, in fact, imposed an upward departure sentence for second-degree assault under grid block 8-1, which was then mislabeled in the judgment and the first corrected judgment as a \u201cpresumptive\u201d sentence. At the 1996 sentencing hearing, the trial court stated its intention to impose a sentence of 34 months\u2019 imprisonment under grid block 8-C, but defendant\u2019s counsel objected on the ground that the applicable grid block was 8-1. The prosecutor responded that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-6\">\u201ceven if the Court did move to the I column, consistent with defendant\u2019s objections in the Assault in the Second Degree, the Court should upward depart <em>based on the same reasons </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number><em>it would use on the Felony Murder count </em>[defendant\u2019s tendency to engage in violent conduct; the degree of harm to the victim; and the fact that defendant was on post-prison supervision at the time of the offense], and additional reason of an antisocial personality disorder to exactly the same sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">(Emphasis added.) The trial court stated, \u201cI think that [defense counsel] may be right. I do have to go to the I column.\u201d The prosecutor then reiterated his belief that \u201cit would make sense for the Court to use the same upward departure factors, and * * * the additional factor, the antisocial personality disorder found by the [presentence investigation], and <em>making those findings would accomplish the same sentence that the Court imposed.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">The trial court agreed with defendant\u2019s objection and accepted the prosecutor\u2019s recommendation, except as to finding the \u201cadditional\u201d departure factor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-6\">\u201cI think you\u2019re right, [defense counsel], I do have to go to the I column in the grid, and I thank you for bringing that to my attention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-7\">\u201cIt\u2019s an 8-C. It goes on sentencing to 8-1.1 will continue to impose the 34 months. I will do an upward durational departure, which would actually be six months more [than the 28-month presumptive sentence], <em>and do an upward departure as I did in the other cases.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">(Emphasis added.) The court, as noted above, had earlier imposed departure sentences on the felony murder convictions based on \u201cdefendant\u2019s tendency to engage in violent conduct, the degree of harm in this case, * * * and also that he was on post-prison supervision at the time\u201d \u2014 the same factors that are recited in the second corrected judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">Based on a review of the record, it is apparent that the departure sentence imposed by the court over a decade ago was simply misdescribed in the judgment and first corrected judgment as a \u201cpresumptive\u201d sentence under grid block 8-C. Thus, the second corrected judgment did not impose a different , sentence on defendant; it simply made clerical corrections to accurately reflect the sentence that had been imposed earlier, including findings that had already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>been made, as discussed above. Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, the trial court had no obligation to empanel a jury before making those clerical corrections to accurately reflect the previously imposed sentence. <em>See Mullinax and Mullinax, </em>292 Or 416, 424, 639 P2d 628 (1982) (\u201cThe purpose of an amendment correcting a \u2018clerical error\u2019 is \u2018* * * to make the record speak the truth and conform it to what actually occurred.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting <em>Hubbard v. Hubbard, </em>213 Or 482, 487, 324 P2d 469 (1958).).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">In his other assignment of error, defendant contends that the trial court violated his right to allocution by refusing to let him argue personally at the hearing rather than through counsel. Defendant relies on <em>State v. Isom, </em>201 Or App 687, 694, 120 P3d 912 (2005), in which we held that Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution guaranteed a defendant the right to allocution during a hearing to modify a judgment. According to defendant, the two cases are analogous because here, \u201c[a]s in <em>Isom, </em>\u2018in the process of correcting one error, * * * the judge at the second resentencing hearing made another error * * *. That fact alone demonstrates that defendant could have made a relevant allocution.\u2019 201 Or App at 694.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">As we have already explained, the trial court did not commit \u201canother error\u201d in the process of correcting the judgment; there was no reason for the trial court to empanel a jury before correcting the judgment. Furthermore, as we recently reiterated in <em>State v. Rickard, 225 </em>Or App 488, 491, 201 P3d 927 (2009), \u201c[t]he statutory and constitutional rights to speak at a sentence modification proceeding are not unqualified. An enforceable right extends to changes in a sentence that are \u2018substantive\u2019 as opposed to \u2018administrative\u2019 in character.\u201d <em>See also State v. Riley, </em>195 Or App 377, 384, 97 P3d 1269 (2004), <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 673 (2006) (\u201cWhen the modification is administrative as opposed to substantive, that is, when the modification involves neither disputed facts nor the exercise of judicial discretion but occurs entirely by operation of law, the defendant\u2019s absence is not prejudicial.\u201d). In this case, the trial court did not make any changes to defendant\u2019s sentences that involved disputed facts or the exercise of judicial discretion, and his rights to allocution were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b767-7\"> The \u201cshift-to-I\u201d rule applies when a defendant is sentenced for multiple felonies in the same proceeding. In that event, the defendant\u2019s true criminal history score is used in assessing the grid block for imposing sentence on the primary offense (and any other offenses for which sentences will run concurrently). OAR 213-012-0020(2)(a)(A). For additional offenses for which consecutive sentences will be imposed, the court is required to use the criminal history score \u201cI.\u201d OAR 213-012-0020(2)(a)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b768-7\"> ORS 138.083(1) allows a sentencing court \u201cto modify its judgment and sentence to correct any arithmetic or clerical errors or to delete or modify any erroneous term in the judgment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
