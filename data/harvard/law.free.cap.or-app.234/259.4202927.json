J.</author>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">Defendant, who was convicted following a jury trial of assault in the fourth degree, ORS 163.160(1),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeals. He assigns error to an instruction that the trial court gave in response to the jury\u2019s inquiry regarding the proper relationship between defendant\u2019s voluntarily intoxicated condition at the time of the incident and his defense of self-defense. We conclude that the court\u2019s instruction comported with the consensus of authority and with the dictates of ORS 161.125(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The state charged defendant with assault in the fourth degree, ORS 163.160(1). Evidence presented at trial showed that defendant was intoxicated at the time that he committed the alleged offense. Defendant did not dispute that he assaulted the victim, but he presented evidence that he acted in self-defense. Accordingly, the trial court instructed the jury on defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense using a slightly modified version of Uniform Criminal Jury Instruction 1107:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-6\">\u201cThe defense of self-defense has been raised.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-7\">\u201cA person is justified in using physical force upon another person to defend himself from what he reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of unlawful physical force. In defending, a person may only use that degree of force which he reasonably believes to be necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-8\">\u201cThe burden of proof is on the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defense does not apply.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">During deliberations, the jury submitted a question to the court, which asked, \u201cWho[se] deffinition] of reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>are we supposed to use? Our definition (jury\u2019s) or the defendant\u2019s in his impaired state as was described to us through his testimony?\u201d In response, the trial court proposed instructing the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-4\">\u2018You have asked whether the term reasonable in the definition of self-defense is to be judged according to the standpoint of the jury, or according to the standpoint of the defendant in his impaired condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-5\">\u201cVoluntary intoxication is not to be considered by you to change the standard of reasonableness. The law provides that reasonableness must be judged by the jury from the standpoint of a reasonable man in the situation of the defendant at the time under all the circumstances surrounding him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Defendant objected to the trial court\u2019s proposed instruction on the ground that it effectively told the jury that it could not consider defendant\u2019s voluntary intoxication in determining whether defendant \u201creasonably believe[d]\u201d that self-defense was justified. Specifically, defendant contended that, because the state had the burden of proving that he did not act in self-defense, ORS 161.055,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the unreasonableness of defendant\u2019s belief in the need for self-defense was, functionally, \u201can element\u201d of the state\u2019s case. Accordingly, invoking ORS 161.125(1), defendant argued that evidence of his voluntary intoxication was relevant to \u201cnegate\u201d that \u201celement\u201d of the state\u2019s case. That is, defendant contended that, in assessing the reasonableness of his belief regarding the nature of the threat presented, the jury was required to assess the totality of his circumstances, including his voluntarily intoxicated condition. Thus, according to defendant, to the extent that his intoxicated condition militated towards a determination of reasonableness, it concomitantly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>\u201cnegate[d]\u201d the state\u2019s \u201celemental\u201d disproof of his defense of self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">Ultimately, the trial court rejected defendant\u2019s argument and instructed the jury consistently with its proposed instruction. The jury subsequently convicted defendant. On appeal, defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s instruction on voluntary intoxication, reiterating and elaborating on the arguments he made at trial. We review the trial court\u2019s instruction for errors of law. <em>State v. Moore, </em>324 Or 396, 427, 927 P2d 1073 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The question of whether a defendant\u2019s voluntary intoxication is a circumstance that is relevant for assessing the reasonableness of a defendant\u2019s beliefs or conduct for the purposes of the defense of self-defense appears to be one of first impression for Oregon appellate courts. Defendant has cited no case law from jurisdictions that permits a jury to take into account a defendant\u2019s voluntary intoxication as it pertains to his or her claim of self-defense. Indeed, as far as we can ascertain, the law is uniformly to the contrary. <em>See </em>Wayne R. LaFave, 2 <em>Substantive Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 9.5(d), 51 (2d ed 2003) (where a defendant\u2019s intoxication is voluntary \u201che does not have the defense of self defense, which requires that the defendant appraise the situation as would a reasonable <em>sober </em>man\u201d (emphasis in original)). <em>See also United States v. Weise, </em>89 F3d 502, 505 (8th Cir 1996) (concluding that \u201cthe district court properly told the jury to disregard [the defendant\u2019s] intoxication when deciding if [the defendant\u2019s] belief of imminent peril was founded on reasonably perceived circumstances\u201d); <em>United States v. Yazzie, </em>660 F2d 422, 431 (10th Cir 1981), <em>cert den, </em>455 US 923 (1982) (concluding that trial court did not err in instructing the jury to disregard the defendant\u2019s intoxication as it related to his defense of self-defense).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>The apparent universal rejection of defendant\u2019s argument comports with legal and common sense. A defendant is justified in using self-defense only when he or she \u201creasonably believes\u201d that force is necessary to guard against \u201cthe use or imminent use of unlawful physical force\u201d against the defendant or a third person, and the defendant uses the \u201cdegree of force which [he or she] reasonably believes to be necessary.\u201d ORS 161.209. A defendant\u2019s subjective \u201chonest belief\u2019 that a perceived threat is great or imminent is not enough to justify his or her use of self-defense. <em>State v. Lawton, </em>4 Or App 109, 110-11, 476 P2d 821 (1970), <em>rev den </em>(1971). The defendant\u2019s belief must also be objectively reasonable, as judged \u201cfrom the standpoint of a reasonable [person] under the same circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 110. Determining a defendant\u2019s \u201creasonable belief\u2019 from the perspective of an intoxicated person would contradict the objective \u201creasonable person\u201d standard that the defense demands.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Nonetheless, defendant contends that, by its terms, ORS 161.125 permits the jury to consider evidence of defendant\u2019s voluntary intoxication in assessing the reasonableness of his beliefs or conduct in self-defense. Again, ORS 161.125(1) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-5\">\u201c[Vloluntary intoxication shall not, as such, constitute a defense to a criminal charge, but in any prosecution for an offense, evidence that the defendant * * * was intoxicated may be offered by the defendant whenever it is relevant to negative an element of the crime charged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Defendant\u2019s theory, as we understand it, proceeds as follows: (1) Because defendant raised a self-defense defense, the state has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defense does not apply. ORS 161.055. (2) To meet that burden, the state must necessarily prove that self-defense was not justified \u2014 in other words, that defendant\u2019s belief as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>necessity of that self-defense was not reasonable. (3) The unreasonableness of defendant\u2019s belief in the need for self-defense is, therefore, functionally, an \u201celement of the crime\u201d that the state is required to prove.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (4) Because evidence of defendant\u2019s voluntary intoxication is relevant to \u201cnegative\u201d that \u201celement\u201d of the state\u2019s case \u2014 that is, to establish that defendant\u2019s belief <em>was </em>reasonable, it is authorized under ORS 161.125(1). (5) Thus, the trial court\u2019s instruction violated the dictates of ORS 161.125(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">Defendant\u2019s argument so framed turns on the proper understanding of the term \u201celement of the crime charged\u201d in ORS 161.125(1). In construing that term, we adhere to the methodology set out in <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-12, 859 P2d 1143 (1993), as modified by ORS 174.020 and <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). According to that methodology, we examine the text and context of the statute, as well as any legislative history offered by the parties that, in the court\u2019s determination, is pertinent. <em>Gaines, </em>346 Or at 171-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">\u201c[E]lement of the crime\u201d is not defined in Oregon\u2019s Criminal Code. However, in ordinary usage, an \u201celement of the crime\u201d is commonly understood to refer to an element of the state\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>case, as distinct from a component of a defense. <em>See, e.g., Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>597 (9th ed 2009) (defining \u201celements of crime\u201d as \u201c[t]he constituent parts of a crime \u2014 usu. consisting of the actus reus, mens rea, and causation \u2014 that the prosecution must prove to sustain a conviction,\u201d and distinguishing the broader definition adopted by the Model Penal Code in section 1.13(9)). The text of the statute, which refers specifically to the \u201celement of the crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number><em>charged,\u201d </em>\u2014 i.e., \u201ccharged\u201d as distinct from \u201cas defended\u201d\u2014 comports with that understanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Indeed, our review of the history of the 1971 omnibus revisions of the Criminal Code discloses that the Criminal Law Revision Commission considered, but decided not to adopt, the Model Penal Code\u2019s broad definition of \u201celement of an offense,\u201d which, <em>arguably, </em>could have supported defendant\u2019s theory here. Under that definition, \u201celement of an offense\u201d includes such conduct, attendant circumstances, or results of conduct that \u201cnegatives an excuse or justification for such conduct,\u201d including the justification of self-defense. I Model Penal Code and Commentaries \u00a7 1.13(9), 209 (Official Draft and Revised Comments 1985). However, as noted, the commission decided against adopting the Model Penal Code\u2019s definition of the term. <em>See </em>Minutes, Criminal Law Revision Commission, Subcommittee No. 1, Mar 4,1969, 2.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">In sum, the trial court\u2019s instruction regarding the consideration of defendant\u2019s voluntarily intoxicated condition complied with the consensus of authority and the dictates of ORS 161.125(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b299-10\"> ORS 163.160(1) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-11\">\"A person commits the crime of assault in the fourth degree if the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-12\">\u201c(a) Intentionally, knowingly or recklessly causes physical injury to anotherf.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b299-13\"> ORS 161.125(1) prescribes when evidence of a defendant\u2019s intoxication may be used to defend against a criminal charge.

Contrary to defendant\u2019s understanding, we determined that defendant\u2019s \u201creasonable belief\u2019 was an \u201cessential element\u201d of her <em>self-defense defense </em>for the purposes of determining whether certain evidence was admissible under OEC 404(1) (providing that \u201c[e]vidence of a person\u2019s character or trait of character is admissible when it is an essential element of a charge, claim or defense\u201d). <em>Whitney-Biggs, </em>147 Or App at 527-28 (citing <em>State v.
