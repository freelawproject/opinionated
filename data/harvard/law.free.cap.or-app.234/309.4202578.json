J.</author>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">Respondents appeal stalking protective orders (SPOs) entered against them pursuant to ORS 30.866, prohibiting them from having contact with petitioner or her family. Respondents argue that the evidence is insufficient to warrant the issuance of the orders. On <em>de novo </em>review, <em>Osborne v. Fadden, </em>225 Or App 431, 433, 201 P3d 278, <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 213 (2009); <em>Hanzo v. deParrie, </em>152 Or App 525, 536-37, 953 P2d 1130 (1998), <em>rev den, </em>328 Or 418 (1999), we agree with respondents and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\"> To obtain an SPO against a person under ORS 30.866(1), a petitioner must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">\u201c(a) The person intentionally, knowingly or recklessly engages in repeated and unwanted contact with the other person or a member of that person\u2019s immediate family or household thereby alarming or coercing the other person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">\u201c(b) It is objectively reasonable for a person in the victim\u2019s situation to have been alarmed or coerced by the contact; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-8\">\u201c(c) The repeated and unwanted contact causes the victim reasonable apprehension regarding the personal safety of the victim or a member of the victim\u2019s immediate family or household.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">ORS 30.866(1) has both subjective and objective components. To satisfy the subjective component, the petitioner must show that he or she was alarmed or coerced by the contacts, and that the contacts caused apprehension regarding his or her personal safety or the personal safety of a member of his or her immediate family or household. ORS 30.866(l)(a), (c); <em>Weatherly v. Wilkie, </em>169 Or App 257, 259, 8 P3d 251 (2000). To satisfy the objective component, \u201cthe contacted person\u2019s alarm or coercion must be objectively reasonable\u201d and that person\u2019s apprehension for his or her personal safety must also be objectively reasonable. ORS 30.866(l)(b); <em>Pinkham v. Brubaker, </em>178 Or App 360, 372, 37 P3d 186 (2001); <em>Weatherly, </em>169 Or App at 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">ORS 30.866(1) also requires that the petitioner establish that the contacts that are the basis for the petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>were repeated and unwanted. \u201cRepeated\u201d contact means two or more contacts within the previous two years. ORS 30.866(6); ORS 163.730(7). The contacts may include, among other things, coming into the person\u2019s visual or physical presence; following the person; waiting outside the person\u2019s home, property, place of work, or school; speaking with the person; or sending or making written communications of any kind. ORS 163.730(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\"> If the contact involves speech, Article I, section 8, of the Oregon Constitution requires proof that the contact constitutes a threat. A threat \u201cis a communication that instills in the addressee a fear of imminent and serious personal violence from the speaker, is unequivocal, and is objectively likely to be followed by unlawful acts.\u201d <em>State v. Rangel, </em>328 Or 294, 303, 977 P2d 379 (1999). But a threat does not include \u201cthe kind of hyperbole, rhetorical excesses, and impotent expressions of anger or frustration that in some contexts can be privileged even if they alarm the addressee.\u201d <em>State v. Moyle, </em>299 Or 691, 705, 705 P2d 740 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">At issue in this case is the sufficiency of the evidence that was the basis for the issuance of an SPO against two persons, Michael and Mathew Olson, who are father and son and are neighbors of petitioner. Petitioner testified that she and her family moved into their Springfield neighborhood, next door to respondents, about two and a half years ago. Within a few weeks, respondents began bullying them. Petitioner believes that respondents are retaliating against them for complaints to animal control and the city\u2019s code enforcement officers that other neighbors have made about respondents. We describe the incidents related to each respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">We begin with the incidents involving the son, Mathew. Shortly after petitioner\u2019s family moved into the neighborhood, in approximately August 2007, respondent Mathew Olson, who is 18 years of age, pushed petitioner\u2019s 14-year-old son down to the ground, refusing to allow him to cross a park.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Petitioner testified that, in March 2008, Mathew parked his car in front of her driveway, blocking her vehicle. Petitioner\u2019s husband bumped Mathew\u2019s car out of the way with his van, causing damage to the car. Mathew came out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>and began yelling obscenities. Petitioner testified that Mathew threatened to destroy petitioner\u2019s property and told petitioner that he could have her son beat up. Petitioner\u2019s husband testified that Mathew warned him that he knows people at the son\u2019s school who will slit his throat. Petitioner and her husband testified that they went back into their house, aware that Mathew was going to call the police. Petitioner testified that she and her husband were \u201cmore than happy\u201d with that, because the police could help the parties exchange insurance information. Respondent\u2019s counsel asked petitioner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-3\">\u201cQ. Okay. So let me get this straight. You guys were completely calm and they were angry; is that what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-4\">\u201cA. Basically, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-5\">\u201cQ. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-6\">\u201cA. Because we \u2014 my husband knew that he had hit their vehicle and knew \u2014 you know, we had no reason to be angry at them other than the fact that they were yelling obscenities which is nothing unusual.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">In April 2008, shortly before the hearing in this case, Mathew cursed at petitioner\u2019s nine-year-old daughter while she was walking home from school and said that he would find someone to beat her up. She is now afraid to walk home from school.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">Petitioner also complained about contacts involving the father, Michael Olson. Petitioner testified that in August 2007, after Mathew pushed down her son, she tried to have a conversation with Michael, but that he became upset and started calling her names. Petitioner testified that, after that incident, she tried not to have contact with either Mathew or Michael.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">Petitioner testified that, on March 30, 2008, Michael \u201cand another male in his vehicle pulled in and out of our driveway revving their engine, putting their bright lights on our house late at night, and honking their horn.\u201d Petitioner testified that she called the police and that, before the police arrived, Michael and the other person in his vehicle went into Michael\u2019s house. Petitioner testified that similar incidents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>have occurred \u201cmultiple times,\u201d involving multiple vehicles. Petitioner and her husband described an incident in which Michael drove past her husband in his truck and simulated a gun firing motion while screaming obscenities.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Petitioner testified that, on the evening of the day that the SPO was issued, someone \u201cegged\u201d petitioner\u2019s house and vehicles and slashed a tire on petitioner\u2019s husband\u2019s van. Petitioner suspected respondents, but she did not see them commit those acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Petitioner did not testify that respondents\u2019 conduct caused her to feel alarm or coercion or to be fearful for her own personal safety. However, she concluded her own direct testimony by stating,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">\u201call we\u2019re asking for is just distance. I would like them not to speak to my children especially. I find it disturbing that an adult male \u2014 two adult males speak to my children and make threats to them and make them feel fearful.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">We turn to the legal sufficiency of the foregoing evidence of unwanted contacts, beginning with those involving Mathew. In short, we find the evidence insufficient to satisfy the requirements of the statute. Although there is no direct evidence that petitioner or her husband feared for their own personal safety or the safety of their children as a result of the various incidents involving Mathew, on this record we find that petitioner could reasonably be fearful for the safety of her children as a consequence of the three incidents involving the children. However, two of those incidents \u2014 the one in which Mathew threatened to have someone beat up petitioner\u2019s son or slit his throat and the one in which Mathew cursed at petitioner\u2019s nine-year-old daughter \u2014 involved only speech. Because of that, the more stringent standard required by the Oregon Constitution applies, and petitioner must establish that Mathew\u2019s communications instilled a fear of imminent and serious personal violence from Mathew, that the communication was unequivocal, and that it was objectively likely to be followed by unlawful acts. <em>Rangel, </em>328 Or at 303. On this record, the evidence falls short of establishing that either communication instilled a fear of imminent violence from Mathew. In both instances, Mathew spoke of what he would have someone else do at some point in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>future, and there is no evidence that petitioner, her husband, or her daughter feared that imminent violence from Mathew would result. In light of that finding, only one contact remains \u2014 the bullying of defendant\u2019s son in August 2007\u2014 and that is not sufficient to justify the imposition of an SPO. ORS 30.866(6); ORS 163.730 (\u201cRepeated\u201d contact means two or more contacts within the previous two years.).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">Concerning the SPO against respondent Michael Olson, we conclude that, even applying the less-stringent standard for nonexpressive contacts, the evidence falls short of establishing that Michael\u2019s conduct caused petitioner or a family member reasonable apprehension for personal safety. ORS 30.866(l)(c). Although the conduct may have been obnoxious, petitioner did not testify that either she or family members actually feared for their personal safety as a result of Michael\u2019s conduct, and there is no evidence from which that finding can be inferred. We conclude, accordingly, that the trial court erred in entering the SPO against Michael.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
