J.</author>\n<p id=\"b341-3\">Defendant, who pleaded guilty to three counts of abuse of a memorial, ORS 166.076, argues on appeal that the trial court erred in refusing to merge the three convictions. As explained below, we agree with defendant and therefore remand the case to the trial court for merger and for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">The pertinent facts are not in dispute. Defendant was charged with three counts of abuse of a memorial. Each count alleged that, on or about May 14, 2007, defendant \u201cdid unlawfully and intentionally destroy, mutilate, deface and injure * * * a monument which was placed as and designed for a memorial to the dead.\u201d One count alleged that this was done to \u201ca cement bench,\u201d another to \u201ca marble plaque,\u201d and the third to \u201cflowers in planter boxes.\u201d Most of the facts pertinent to the issues raised on appeal are procedural.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Defendant wished to plead guilty, and his lawyer recited the following stipulations into the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\">\u201c[0]n the date alleged, May 14, 2007, Lincoln County, Oregon, [defendant] did intentionally and unlawfully destroy, mutilate, deface and injure those items: with respect to Count 2, the cement bench; with respect to Count 3, the marble plaque; and with respect to Count 4, the flowers in the planter boxes, which again, were intended for ornamentation, placed or designed as a memorial to the dead.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Before the court accepted the plea, defense counsel stated on the record that he had submitted to the court a sentencing memorandum \u201con the issue of merger of the counts.\u201d The court accepted defendant\u2019s plea after explaining defendant\u2019s rights to him, including telling defendant that a \u201ctheoretical possibility remains that there could be independent, individual, separate and discrete sentences imposed on each of three counts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">Defendant asserted in his sentencing memorandum that, in light of <em>State v. White, </em>341 Or 624, 147 P3d 313 (2006), and other cases, defendant\u2019s three convictions should merge because the requirements of ORS 161.067(3), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>\u201canti-merger\u201d statute, were not satisfied.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The prosecutor\u2019s reply asserted that \u201cseparately punishable offenses\u201d for purposes of ORS 161.067(3) should be interpreted to mean that, if the criteria of that statute are not met, the crimes would \u201cbe \u2018merged\u2019 for sentencing purposes\u201d but that separate convictions should be entered. At the sentencing hearing, the parties and the court debated at length about the meaning of ORS 161.067(3) and whether it was intended to provide for merger of convictions, or \u201c \u2018merger\u2019 for sentencing purposes.\u201d The court concluded that, under ORS 161.067(3), \u201cI believe you may not be able to sentence somebody separately on these, but you can sure have separate convictions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">The state also made an offer of proof that the bench, the plaque, and the planter were 10 to 30 yards apart from one another and argued that the court therefore could infer that \u201cindeed there was a sufficient pause in the defendant\u2019s conduct\u201d between the damaging of each of those items.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The court made the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\">\u201cI find that the same conduct or criminal episode violates only one statutory provision, and [on] the record before me * * * one has to assume \u2014 there\u2019s an assumption that can be made that, in the absence of there being evidence, one has to assume but one victim. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-7\"><em>% </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-8\">\u00ab* * * But nevertheless the Court finds that it did involve repeated violations of the same statutory provision against the same victim, and according to subsection (3), there are as many separately punishable offenses as there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>are violations * * *. However, the Court is unable to conclude that each violation can be, as a matter of law, separately punishable because there is an absence of evidence from which the Court can find that each violation is separated from the other violations by a sufficient pause in the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct to afford him an opportunity to renounce criminal intent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">In short, the court concluded that the requirements of ORS 161.067(3) were not met but that it was only the \u201csentences\u201d that merged, not the \u201cconvictions.\u201d The court therefore entered judgment for three separate convictions, but imposed concurrent sentences on those convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">On appeal, defendant maintains that the court\u2019s application of ORS 161.067(3) was contrary to the explicit holding of <em>White. </em>The state does not dispute that proposition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rather, the state argues, first, that the judgment is not appealable, second, that defendant failed to preserve the asserted error, and third, that this court should affirm on an alternative basis \u2014 that the offenses were separated by pauses sufficient for defendant to renounce his criminal intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">As explained below, we reject each of the state\u2019s arguments, and therefore remand for merger and resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">We begin with the state\u2019s appealability argument. ORS 138.050(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-8\">\u201cExcept as otherwise provided in ORS 135.335 [not applicable in this case], a defendant who has pleaded guilty or no contest may take an appeal from a judgment or order described in ORS 138.053 only when the defendant makes a colorable showing that the disposition:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>\u201c(a) Exceeds the maximum allowable by law; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdC\">\u201c(b) Is unconstitutionally cruel and unusual.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">The state argues that a challenge to the court\u2019s entry of three separate convictions pursuant to ORS 161.067(3) is not an argument that the disposition exceeds the maximum allowable by law. The state acknowledges that we have held otherwise in <em>State v. Summerlin, </em>139 Or App 579, 913 P2d 340 (1996), but suggests that we limit <em>Summerlin </em>to its facts, which involved not only a failure to merge convictions, but imposition of consecutive sentences.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The state\u2019s argument does not require any extended discussion. We explained in <em>Summerlin, </em>and reiterated more recently in <em>State v. Stubbs, </em>193 Or App 595, 606, 91 P3d 774 (2004) (quoting <em>Summerlin, </em>139 Or App at 582), that \u201c <em>\u2018a disposition exceeds the maximum allowed by law if it is not imposed consistently with statutory requirements\u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.) <em>See also State v. Easton, </em>204 Or App 1, 126 P3d 1256, <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 673 (2006) (same). A disposition that includes three convictions where it should only include one conviction contains a disposition that exceeds the maximum allowable by law. <em>Accord State v. Muyingo, </em>226 Or App 327, 329, 203 P3d 365, <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 364 (2009) (under ORS 138.053, a \u201cdisposition encompasses all convictions and sentences contained in the judgment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\"> The state next argues that defendant did not adequately preserve this issue. Both parties submitted memoranda to the trial court, defendant relied on <em>White, </em>which is the controlling case, and the court considered the matter over the course of two days. The state nonetheless argues that defendant did not raise the issue in a timely manner because he \u201cwaited to raise a merger claim until after he had pleaded guilty to multiple counts.\u201d First, as a factual matter, the record reflects that defense counsel <em>did, </em>in fact, \u201craise a merger claim\u201d before the plea was accepted, noting in open court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>before the plea was taken that he had filed a memorandum in support of the merger of the three counts. The prosecutor did not suggest to the court (and the state does not suggest now) that the plea agreement precluded defendant from arguing in favor of merger. Second, as a legal matter, the time to address a merger claim is post-verdict, not at or before a plea hearing, or during trial. <em>See White, </em>341 Or at 640 (\u201calthough <em>defendant properly was charged with and even found guilty of two counts </em>of first-degree burglary, * * * the trial court could not enter two judgments of conviction\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>cf., State v. Davis/Hamilton, </em>194 Or App 382, 385, 95 P3d 230 (2004), <em>modified on recons, </em>197 Or App 1, 104 P3d 602, <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 230 (2005) (the defendant\u2019s arguments concerning how many robberies had been committed during one hold-up of multiple victims \u201cwere immaterial to the determination of the motions for judgments of acquittal and were cognizable only through a post-verdict motion pursuant to ORS 161.067, relating to merger\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">Finally, we address the state\u2019s \u201cright for the wrong reason\u201d argument. The state notes that this court \u201cmay affirm on grounds different from those on which the trial court based its decision, so long as there is evidence in the record to support the alternative grounds.\u201d <em>Kinross Copper Corp. v. State of Oregon, </em>160 Or App 513, 520, 981 P2d 833 (1999). The state then asserts that an alternative basis exists for affirming the trial court\u2019s failure to merge the convictions, because \u201c[a]t sentencing, the prosecutor offered to prove that the plaque was 10 yards away from the cement bench and the flower beds were 30 yards away from the cement bench\u201d and thus there must have been a \u201csufficient pause\u201d to justify separate convictions pursuant to ORS 161.067(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The state does not, however, cite more recent authority that sets out pertinent limitations on the \u201cright for the wrong reason\u201d doctrine. In <em>Outdoor Media Dimensions Inc. v. State of Oregon, </em>331 Or 634, 659-60, 20 P3d 180 (2001), the court explained that an appellate court may affirm on an alternative basis, but only when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\">\u201c(1) * * * the facts of record [are] sufficient to support the alternative basis for affirmance; (2) * * * the trial court\u2019s ruling [is] consistent with the view of the evidence under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>the alternative basis for affirmance; and (3) * * * the record [is] materially the same one that would have been developed had the prevailing party raised the alternative basis for affirmance below.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">In the course of the sentencing proceeding, the court made a legal ruling that the state could not present the evidence that the state now attempts to rely on. As the state recognizes, it did not present that evidence, but merely made an offer of proof (in the form of the prosecutor\u2019s representations of what the witness intended to say concerning the locations of the damaged items). The state has not cross-assigned error to the trial court\u2019s ruling that the evidence was not admissible. Accordingly, the \u201cfacts\u201d on which the state now tries to rely are not \u201cfacts of record.\u201d Moreover, the trial court\u2019s ruling is <em>not </em>\u201cconsistent with the view of the evidence under the alternative basis for affirmance,\u201d because the trial court specifically noted the absence of evidence of sufficient pause when it made its explicit findings pursuant to ORS 161.067(3). And finally, had the court actually admitted the evidence, the record might have been materially different, because defendant then would have had an opportunity to counter the state\u2019s evidence with evidence that, in fact, the distance between the damaged items did not establish a \u201csufficient pause\u201d for purposes of ORS 161.067(3). In sum, none of the three criteria that would allow this court to affirm on an alternative basis has been satisfied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The trial court erred in failing to merge the three convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Remanded with instructions to merge three counts of abuse of a memorial into one and for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b342-9\"> ORS 161.067(3) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-10\">\u201cWhen the same conduct or criminal episode violates only one statutory provision and involves only one victim, but nevertheless involves repeated violations of the same statutory provision against the same victim, there are as many separately punishable offenses as there are violations, except that each violation, to be separately punishable under this subsection, must be separated from such other violations by a sufficient pause in the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct to afford the defendant an opportunity to renounce the criminal intent.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b342-11\"> The state also argued in the trial court that the crimes had separate victims, but it does not pursue that argument on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b343-9\"> In <em>White, </em>the defendant\u2019s conduct \u201cinvolved repeated violations of the same statutory provisions within the meaning of ORS 161.067(3).\u201d 341 Or at 640. The court concluded that, \u201calthough defendant properly was charged with and even found guilty of two counts of first-degree burglary,* * * the trial court could not enter two judgments of conviction based on those verdicts. Under ORS 161.067, defendant did not commit two \u2018separately punishable\u2019 burglaries[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 640-41. The court emphasized that ORS 161.067(3) pertains to \u201cthe number of separately punishable offenses,\u201d and does not pertain to whether sentences should be imposed consecutively or concurrently. <em>Id. </em>at 636 (emphasis in original).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b344-6\"> <em>Summerlin </em>itself contains no suggestion of such a limitation. There, we first addressed the state\u2019s argument that ORS 138.050 and ORS 138.053 limited our ability to \u201creview the merger issues.\u201d 139 Or App at 581. The pertinent discussion concerned <em>only </em>the merger issues; no argument was made that the court lacked authority to address the defendant\u2019s separate assignment of error concerning the imposition of consecutive sentences. <em>See id. </em>at 588-89.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
