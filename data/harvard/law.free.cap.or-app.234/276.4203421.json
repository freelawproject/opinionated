The secretary\u2019s determination that the report was 76 days late was based on an interpretation of <em>former </em>OAR 165-012-0230(11) (Aug 1, 2005)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that required an electronic report to successfully load into the secretary\u2019s data system in order to be considered filed for purposes of meeting the filing deadline. Petitioner seeks judicial review of that order, contending that the secretary erred in interpreting OAR 165-012-0230 and thereby erred in finding that petitioner\u2019s campaign finance report data was more than two days late. We conclude that the secretary did not err in interpreting OAR 165-012-0230, and we therefore affirm the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Petitioner is a campaign committee formed to support Sam Chase\u2019s candidacy for the Oregon State Senate in the 2006 election. The committee was required by law to file periodic campaign contribution and expenditure reports with the Oregon Secretary of State. <em>Former </em>ORS 260.058 (2005), <em>repealed by </em>Or Laws 2005, ch 809, \u00a7 56.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After exceeding $50,000 in campaign contributions and expenditures, petitioner was required to electronically file campaign contribution and expenditure reports. ORS 260.159(1); OAR 165-012-0230(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">To comply with the electronic filing requirements, petitioner hired a company from a list provided by the secretary\u2019s Elections Division to format its contribution and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>expenditure report data into the required electronic file format.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The petitioner was required to electronically file a supplemental contribution and expenditure report with the secretary by September 11, 2006. ORS 260.058(2); ORS 187.010(l)(a). Petitioner first attempted to electronically file the required report as an attachment to an e-mail note that it sent to the Elections Division shortly after 5:00 p.m. on September 12, 2006. The Elections Division\u2019s e-mail system returned an automatically generated response that stated, \u2018Your filing has been received.\u201d Earlier on the day that petitioner sent its e-mail note with the attached report, the Elections Division had sent petitioner a notice informing it \u201cof the potential for a civil penalty due to the late filing[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">On September 13, 2006, the Elections Division sent an e-mail note to petitioner\u2019s campaign manager stating that petitioner\u2019s report would not load into the Elections Division\u2019s computer system because \u201cextra carriage returns [we]re in the detail records of the PC 2 and PC 3.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Throughout that day, the Elections Division and petitioner\u2019s campaign manager exchanged e-mail notes and continued to attempt to resolve the loading problem, but a modified version of the report sent by the campaign manager still would not load into the agency\u2019s database. On September 28, 2006, petitioner\u2019s campaign manager sent the Elections Division <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>another version of the report, and the agency responded that the report still would not load. The agency explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-4\">\u201cWe opened in [W]ord to review the formatting. The carriage returns should only be at the end of the field information for each line. It appears that you have paragraph returns in the middle of the data fields. So for Page 1, Line 1, it should be at the end only.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Candidate Chase first became aware of the Elections Division\u2019s difficulty loading his campaign committee\u2019s contribution and expenditure report when the Elections Division personally contacted him about it in December 2006. Ultimately, Chase resolved the formatting problem by working with an Elections Division staff member over the telephone to remove the extraneous carriage returns from the report. On December 29,2006, Chase e-mailed the modified report to the Elections Division, which was successfully loaded that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">The Elections Division subsequently sent petitioner a notice of proposed civil penalty that proposed to penalize petitioner $1,000 for filing its campaign finance report 76 days late, that is, on December 29, 2006. Petitioner requested and was granted a contested case hearing. After hearing the evidence and arguments, the hearings officer issued a proposed order that concluded that petitioner was only two days late in filing its report and, hence, should pay a penalty of $371.56.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Subsequently, the secretary issued a final order that superseded the proposed order. The secretary concluded in that order that the Elections Division correctly assessed a $1,000 penalty because, under \u201cOAR 165-012-0230(11), an electronic report is not considered filed until it will successfully load into the Elections Division\u2019s data system. Consequently, by operation of the rule, [petitioner\u2019s] supplemental report is considered filed effective December 29, 2006, making the report 76 days late.\u201d Petitioner timely sought judicial review of the secretary\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">Under ORS 183.482(8)(a), we are authorized to set aside an agency order if the agency\u2019s decision was based on an erroneous interpretation of law. We are required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>uphold an \u201cagency\u2019s plausible interpretation of its own rule [if the interpretation is not] inconsistent with the wording of the rule itself, or with the rule\u2019s context, or with any other source of law[.]\u201d <em>Don\u2019t Waste Oregon Com. v. Energy Facility Siting, </em>320 Or 132, 142, 881 P2d 119 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">As described above, petitioner was required to electronically submit a supplemental statement of campaign contributions and expenditures by a statutory deadline. ORS 260.058(2); ORS 260.159(1). The secretary\u2019s \u201celectronic filing rule,\u201d OAR 165-012-0230, established the following standards and procedures for electronic submission of campaign finance reports relevant to this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-5\">\u201c(5) Candidates and committees filing electronically must have their own software that they use to enter data. The software must be capable of generating final data for detailed contribution and expenditure reports, including forms PC 1, PC 2, PC 3, PC 4A, PC 4B, PC 5, PC 6, and PC 9. The information provided on the forms must fully comply with ORS Chapter 260 and the current Campaign Finance Manual. <em>To file reports electronically, the committee or candidate must export the data of the final contribution and expenditure report generated in its software into an ASCII tab-delimited file that is formatted with the following file format specifications. Reports not corresponding to the required file format will not be considered filed.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">\u201c(a) All reports must correspond to the required file format. (Attachment 1 to this rule);[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-7\">\u201c(b) The character set must be ASCII.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-8\">\u201c(c) Files must have been created by or be readable by an operating system that is compatible with Microsoft Windows 95 or higher.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-9\">\u201c(d) Records must end with a carriage return ASCII character (CR) followed by a line feed ASCII character (LF).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-10\">\u00ab\u00edfc \u2756 % \u2021 <em>%</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>\u201c(7) <em>Reports must be submitted in one of the following formats, </em>and must be received by 5:00 p.m. on the filing deadline <em>to be considered filed timely:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-4\">\u201c(a) 3-1/2-inch high-density MS DOS-formatted diskette; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\">\u201c(b) PC-readable CD; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">\u201c(c) Attached to an e-mail to elecfile.sos@state.or.us</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-7\">5fC ifc ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-8\">\u201c(9) <em>Electronic reports must not contain viruses. </em>The Election Division\u2019s computer system will screen and reject all reports filed electronically that are detected to contain viruses. <em>Any report rejected for this reason is considered not filed.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-9\">*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-10\">\u201c(11) Unless the committee or candidate required to file electronically is excused by the Secretary of State under subsection (3), <em>a report is not considered filed until it is successfully filed electronically. </em>Attachment 1 contains the required file format specifications for electronic filing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-12\">On review, petitioner contends that the secretary erred in finding that its campaign finance report was filed 76 days late instead of only two days late. Petitioner argues that (1) the electronic filing rule did not make \u201cfiling\u201d contingent on \u201cloading\u201d in the secretary\u2019s database, (2) the report that it submitted on September 12, 2006, satisfied all of the file format specifications prescribed in the electronic filing rule, and (3) the secretary\u2019s interpretation of subsection (11) of the rule effectively creates an additional \u201ctechnical specification\u201d for electronic filings that the agency failed to properly adopt by rule as required by ORS 260.159(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-13\">The secretary responds that the final order was not issued in error because petitioner\u2019s initial submitted report did not conform to the technical specifications in subsection (5)(d) of the rule and, thus, was not \u201csuccessfully filed electronically\u201d as required by subsection (11). The secretary further argues that the order reasonably interpreted the requirement that campaign finance reports be \u201csuccessfully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>filed electronically\u201d under subsection (11) to mean that the reports comply with the rule\u2019s technical specifications, and, therefore, be able to load into the Elections Division\u2019s database.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">Review of the secretary\u2019s final order indicates, however, that it was not based on a finding that petitioner\u2019s report failed to be \u201csuccessfully filed electronically\u201d because it violated one of the technical requirements in paragraph (d) of subsection (5). Rather, as we will explain, the secretary\u2019s finding of a violation was based solely on subsection (11).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Nowhere in the final order does it state that petitioner\u2019s initially submitted report violated the file format specifications in paragraph (d) of subsection (5), let alone make a finding that it did. To the contrary, the secretary found that petitioner\u2019s report \u201crecords ended with a carriage return ASCII character (CR) followed by a line feed ASCII character (LF),\u201d thus, restating language in subsection (5)(d) and indicating compliance with it. The secretary did note in the order that, \u201c[i]f the report is not filed with the proper file format specifications, it will not load successfully into the Elections Division electronic filing system\u201d; however, the order did not explain if or how the extraneous carriage returns in petitioner\u2019s report failed to comply with the file format specifications, causing the report to fail to load. Instead, the secretary interpreted subsection (11) to mean that \u201can electronic report is not considered filed until it will successfully load into the Elections Division\u2019s data system[,]\u201d and found that, \u201cby operation of the rule,\u201d petitioner\u2019s report was therefore 76 days late.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Furthermore, subsection (5) provided an independent basis for the secretary to deem petitioner\u2019s initially submitted campaign finance report not to have been filed on September 12. The introductory paragraph of subsection (5) specifically stated that \u201c[r]eports not corresponding to the required file format will not be considered filed.\u201d That the secretary relied on subsection (11) as the basis for the violation, instead of relying on subsection (5), confirms that the final order was not based on petitioner\u2019s failure to timely file a report conforming to the specifications identified in subsection (5). Accordingly, we conclude that the order was based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>solely on subsection (11) and not on any failure of the report to adopt the file format required by subsection (5), despite the secretary\u2019s contrary contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-3\">Our analysis in this case thus turns on whether the secretary\u2019s interpretation of subsection (11) to require campaign finance reports to load into the Elections Division\u2019s database in order to be \u201csuccessfully filed electronically\u201d is entitled to such deference as to validate the secretary\u2019s determination that petitioner\u2019s report was 76 days late. Again, the crux of that analysis requires us to determine whether the secretary\u2019s interpretation of subsection (11) was plausible and not inconsistent with the text of the rule and the rule\u2019s context. <em>Don\u2019t Waste Oregon </em>Com., 320 Or at 142. If the interpretation was plausible, then we are bound by it in our review of the secretary\u2019s order. Id.; <em>ONRC Action v. Columbia Plywood, Inc., </em>332 Or 216, 222, 26 P3d 142 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Subsection (11) stated that, if a candidate was required to file a campaign finance report electronically, the report would not be \u201cconsidered filed until it is <em>successfully </em>filed electronically.\u201d (Emphasis added.) By its terms, then, subsection (11) required something more than mere delivery of campaign finance data in order for a report to achieve filed status. Specifically, it required the satisfaction of a condition \u2014 that is, that the electronic filing be successful. The secretary has interpreted \u201csuccessfully\u201d to mean that the report was able to load into the Elections Division\u2019s data system. In contrast, petitioner contends that \u201c \u2018successfully\u2019 means complying with the requirements set forth in the Secretary\u2019s lengthy and numerous specific rules.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s interpretation, however, would render subsection (11) redundant. That is because other provisions of the rule referenced by petitioner <em>independently </em>conditioned the filed status of submitted campaign finance reports on satisfaction of their requirements. For example, subsection (5) explained that \u201c[r]eports not corresponding to the required file format [would] not be considered filed.\u201d OAR 165-012-0230(5). Likewise, subsection (9) provided that any report that contained a virus would be rejected and not considered filed. OAR 165-012-0230(9). Hence, the secretary\u2019s interpretation of subsection (11) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>avoids treating it as a redundant provision; rather, it provides specific meaning to the word \u201csuccessfully\u201d and, thus, is plausible.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">Furthermore, the secretary\u2019s interpretation of subsection (11) was consistent with the formally adopted procedures and guidelines for electronic filing prescribed in the <em>2006 Campaign Finance Manual. See </em>OAR 165-012-0005 (Dec 30, 2005) (adopting the <em>2006 Campaign Finance Manual). </em>The sections of the secretary\u2019s <em>2006 Campaign Finance Manual </em>regarding electronic filing essentially restated the requirements of the electronic filing rule. <em>See </em>Elections Division, <em>2006 Campaign Finance Manual </em>at 50-51,130-31. However, the secretary did provide the following additional advice to campaign committees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-5\">\u201cA committee intending to create its own method of filing electronically is advised to contact the Elections Division for the technical specifications for electronic filing and a set of test reporting data, or to download this information from the Division\u2019s website at www.sos.state.or.us/elections/c&amp;e/ elecfile.htm. The test data may be entered into the committee\u2019s reporting software, exported into the required format and submitted to the Division (via e[-]mail or disk) for review.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 50. The implication of that advice is that the secretary would determine and notify candidates whether their electronic filing software properly formatted the voluntarily processed test data so that it was capable of loading into the Elections Division\u2019s data system. Thus, the secretary\u2019s interpretation of subsection (11) is consistent with the guidance provided by the <em>2006 Campaign Finance Manual.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Finally, we look to the electronic filing rule\u2019s authorizing statutes for context to determine whether the secretary\u2019s interpretation of subsection (11) is inconsistent with them. <em>Abu-Adas v. Employment Dept., </em>325 Or 480, 485, 940 P2d 1219 (1997). The secretary promulgated OAR 165-012-0230 pursuant to the agency\u2019s general rulemaking authority under ORS 260.156(1)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and its specific authority over electronic filing under ORS 260.159(4), which required that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>\u201c[statements filed electronically * * * shall conform to the technical specifications for electronic filing prescribed by the Secretary of State by rule.\u201d Petitioner argues that the secretary\u2019s interpretation of subsection (11) conflicts with ORS 260.159(4) because it imposes an additional technical specification that was not expressly prescribed by rule. That argument is unavailing, however, because there is no conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">ORS 260.159(4) established a minimum condition that electronically filed campaign finance reports were required to satisfy: conformance to the technical specifications provided in the secretary\u2019s electronic filing rule. That statutory provision in no way prevented the secretary from imposing <em>additional </em>reporting obligations, as the secretary did here, consistent with the secretary\u2019s authority under ORS 260.156(1) to adopt rules for reporting campaign expenditures and contributions. The secretary\u2019s interpretation of \u201csuccessfully filed electronically\u201d did not impose a technical specification; rather, it required a result (that is, loading into the Elections Division\u2019s data system) that must be achieved by those filing campaign finance reports electronically <em>in addition </em>to compliance with the technical specifications stated in the electronic filing rule. Thus, the secretary\u2019s interpretation of subsection (11) placed the ultimate burden on those filing reports to ensure that their campaign finance data would accurately and efficiently be made available to the public,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and did so in a manner that did not conflict with either ORS 260.159(4) or ORS 260.156(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">In sum, the secretary\u2019s interpretation of OAR 165-012-0230(11) is plausible, and, thus, we are bound by it. <em>Don\u2019t Waste Oregon Com., </em>320 Or at 142. Therefore, we conclude that the secretary properly interpreted and applied that provision in determining that petitioner\u2019s supplemental contribution and expenditure report was 76 days late and subject to a $1,000 penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b316-7\"> All subsequent references to OAR 165-012-0230 are to that version of the rule, which was in effect at the time that petitioner was required to file the supplemental campaign contribution and expenditure report at issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b316-8\"> In 2005, the legislature repealed many of the election statutes involved in this case and enacted a statute requiring a new electronic filing system for campaign finance reports. <em>See </em>Or Laws 2005, ch 809, \u00a7\u00a7 14,56,57. Those provisions did not become effective until January 1, 2007, and, thus, do not apply to this case. All references to the campaign finance statutes are to the 2005 versions of them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b317-5\"> The Elections Division provided candidates with the names of known electronic filing software vendors and campaign finance reporting businesses; however, the <em>2006 Campaign Finance Manual </em>made clear that the agency was \u201cnot responsible for the quality or sufficiency of services provided by those vendors.\u201d Elections Division, Oregon Secretary of State, <em>2006 Campaign Finance Manual </em>50 (2006).
