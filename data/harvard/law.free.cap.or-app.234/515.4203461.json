J.</author>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">Defendant appeals from a judgment of conviction, following a jury trial, for one count of sexual abuse in the first degree, ORS 163.427, and one count of endangering the welfare of a minor, ORS 163.575. He asserts, among other assignments of error, that the trial court erred in admitting a medical expert\u2019s diagnosis of the child complainant as \u201chighly concerning of sexual abuse\u201d where that diagnosis was rendered in the absence of any confirming physical evidence. As explained below, and consistently with the analysis in <em>State v. Lovern, </em>234 Or App 502, 228 P3d 688 (2010), we conclude that, even assuming that the present appellate challenge to the admission of the expert\u2019s diagnosis was unpreserved, the admission of that testimony represents an \u201cerror of law apparent on the face of the record,\u201d ORAP 5.45(1),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in light of <em>State v. Southard, </em>347 Or 127, 218 P3d 104 (2009). <em>See State v. Jury, </em>185 Or App 132, 136, 57 P3d 970 (2002), <em>rev den, </em>335 Or 504 (2003) (error apparent is determined according to \u201cthe law existing at the time the appeal is decided\u201d). We further determine that it is proper for us to affirmatively exercise our discretion under <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 382, 823 P2d 956 (1991), to remedy that error. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The material circumstances for purposes of our review are uncontroverted. Defendant was indicted for criminal mistreatment in the first degree, unlawful sexual penetration in the second degree, three counts of sexual abuse in the first degree, attempted sodomy in the first degree, and two counts of endangering the welfare of a minor, based on allegations made by R, his then 14-year-old daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Specifically, in the fall of2006, R reported to her boyfriend, her mother, a school counselor, and a police officer that defendant had earlier abused her. The conduct that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>described included defendant touching her vagina with a vibrator, penetrating her vagina with his finger, touching her breasts, playing pornographic videos, and masturbating in front of her.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">After her disclosures, R was evaluated at CARES Northwest, a child abuse assessment center. Munson, a pediatric nurse practitioner, was part of the team that evaluated R at CARES. At trial, Munson testified about her training and experience in the area of child abuse, described the CARES evaluation process, and explained how child abuse diagnoses typically are made. Munson testified that, at CARES, the possible diagnoses with respect to child sexual abuse are \u201cno indication, possible, highly concerning, and diagnostic,\u201d and that, without a physical examination, \u201chighly concerning\u201d is the most definitive diagnosis that can be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Munson further testified \u2014 over defendant\u2019s objection (described below) \u2014 that her diagnosis of R was \u201chighly concerning of sexual abuse.\u201d That diagnosis was based on an interview with R, which Munson observed through a one-way mirror, and her physical examination of R. Munson also reviewed the police officer\u2019s report of his interview with R and the school counselor\u2019s report to the child abuse hotline; from that review, she concluded that the \u201ccore details\u201d of what R had reported earlier were consistent with R\u2019s disclosures during her CARES evaluation. R refused the anogenital part of the physical examination, which, in Munson\u2019s experience, is \u201crelatively common\u201d for adolescents to do, so there was no physical evidence supporting Munson\u2019s diagnosis. In any event, Munson testified that she would not necessarily have expected to have found physical evidence, given the type of sexual abuse R reported and possible physiological factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">In objecting to evidence of Munson\u2019s diagnosis, defense counsel first argued that the evidence was inadmissible because it was an improper comment on R\u2019s credibility. In response, the state cited <em>State v. Sanchez-Cruz, </em>177 Or App 332, 33 P3d 1037 (2001), <em>rev den, </em>333 Or 463 (2002), in which we held that a diagnosis of child sexual abuse met the standards for the admissibility of scientific evidence under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number><em>State v. Brown, </em>297 Or 404, 687 P2d 751 (1984), and <em>State v. O\u2019Key, </em>321 Or 285, 899 P2d 663 (1995). When the trial court subsequently overruled defendant\u2019s objection relying on <em>Sanchez-Cruz, </em>defendant argued that the cases were distinguishable because, in <em>Sanchez-Cruz, </em>there was physical evidence supporting the diagnosis. Although the court found that to be a closer question, the court adhered to its initial ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">The jury found defendant guilty of one count of sexual abuse in the first degree, ORS 163.427,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> based on defendant touching R\u2019s vaginal area, and one count of endangering the welfare of a minor, ORS 163.575.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court granted defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on another of the first-degree sexual abuse counts (based on touching R\u2019s breasts), and the jury found defendant not guilty of the remaining counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">On appeal, defendant argues, <em>inter alia, </em>that the trial court erred under <em>Southard </em>in admitting evidence of Munson\u2019s diagnosis of R as \u201chighly concerning of sexual abuse,\u201d where that diagnosis was rendered \u201cin the absence of any physical evidence of abuse.\u201d <em>Southard, </em>347 Or at 142. That assignment of error is presented in the same posture as the dispositive assignment in <em>Lovern </em>\u2014 that is, defendant\u2019s trial occurred before <em>Southard </em>was decided, and the parties dispute whether defendant adequately preserved his claim of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>error. Also as in <em>Lovern, </em>however, we need not resolve the parties\u2019 preservation dispute, because, as we explained in that case, the trial court\u2019s admission, following <em>Southard, </em>of a medical expert\u2019s diagnosis of child sexual abuse in the absence of physical evidence satisfies the requisites for \u201cplain error\u201d under ORAP 5.45 and because it is appropriate for us to exercise our discretion to correct that error. <em>Lovern, </em>234 Or App at 508-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">We do not understand the state here to raise any contentions materially different from those addressed in <em>Lovern </em>as to whether the asserted error was plain error. Thus, the only question is whether we should affirmatively exercise our discretion to remedy the plain error in this case. <em>See Ailes, </em>312 Or at 382 (even if an error meets the requisites for plain error, the appellate court \u201cmust exercise its discretion to consider or not to consider the error, and if the court chooses to consider the error, the court must articulate its reasons for doing so\u201d). Factors bearing on that inquiry include, but are not limited to, \u201cthe competing interests of the parties; the nature of the case; the gravity of the error; [and] the ends of justice in the particular case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 382 n 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The state argues against the exercise of discretion in this case, contending that, because the erroneously admitted diagnosis here was \u201chighly concerning\u201d rather than definitive for child sexual abuse, as was the case in <em>Lovern, </em>the error is not sufficiently grave to warrant correction. The state does not argue that that distinction renders <em>Southard </em>inapplicable; indeed, at oral argument, the state explicitly agreed that Munson\u2019s statement was a medical diagnosis that would have been inadmissible under <em>Southard </em>if defendant had invoked OEC 403 as a basis for exclusion. Rather, the state contends that, because the diagnosis was not conclusive for sexual abuse, defendant was better able to attack it on cross-examination and, as a result, the error was not sufficiently \u201cgrave\u201d to compel reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">We disagree for several reasons. First, we find no support in <em>Southard </em>for the distinction that the state posits. Like the definitive diagnosis at issue in <em>Southard </em>\u2014 indeed, perhaps more so \u2014 a diagnosis of \u201chighly concerning of sexual abuse\u201d without confirming physical evidence has marginal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>probative value. <em>See Southard, </em>347 Or at 140. Moreover, such a diagnosis carries with it \u201cthe expert\u2019s implicit conclusion that the [alleged] victim\u2019s reports of abuse are credible.\u201d Id. at 141. Although that implicit conclusion is, perhaps, not as pronounced as when an expert makes a definitive diagnosis of abuse, it nonetheless comes from \u201ca credentialed expert, surrounded with the hallmarks of the scientific method,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 140, and the jury was informed that the \u201chighly concerning\u201d diagnosis was the most definitive that the expert was permitted to render in the absence of a physical examination. Consequently, as in <em>Southard, </em>such a diagnosis \u201ccreate[s] a substantial risk\u201d that \u201cthe jury will not make its own credibility determination * * * but will instead defer to the expert\u2019s implicit conclusion that the victim\u2019s reports of abuse are credible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 140-41. As with a more definitive diagnosis, that risk outweighs whatever little probative value the diagnosis may have.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">Second, as in <em>Lovern, </em>the state\u2019s case was premised on the complainant\u2019s credibility. Here, other than R\u2019s own testimony, the state presented no eyewitness testimony or direct evidence that the events in question occurred. Rather \u2014 in addition to Munson\u2019s testimony \u2014 -the state\u2019s case consisted primarily of R\u2019s testimony, the videotape of her interview at CARES, and testimony from several witnesses as to what R had told them about the alleged abuse. Conversely, defendant\u2019s theory of the case was that R fabricated the accusations. Defense counsel pointed out inconsistencies in the various accounts that R gave and presented testimony from R\u2019s boyfriend and other witnesses that R had a reputation for being untruthful. The defense also presented testimony from R\u2019s former therapist that R had previously \u201cheard voices\u201d and attempted to show that R was lying on the stand. Finally, the defense posited that R made up the allegations to get attention and because she was mad at her mother for not letting her see her boyfriend.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">In short, as the prosecutor told the jury in closing argument, \u201c[T]his case has really come down to do you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>believe [R].\u201d Under those circumstances, the potential prejudice from the erroneous admission of Munson\u2019s diagnosis is patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Finally, the state suggests that the interests of the justice system in avoiding unnecessary retrials, <em>see State v. Fults, </em>343 Or 515, 523, 173 P3d 822 (2007), militate against a positive exercise of <em>Ailes </em>discretion. In the state\u2019s view, because, under <em>Southard, </em>only Munson\u2019s ultimate diagnosis (as opposed to the balance of her testimony) would be excluded on remand, the result of a retrial would be the same. We disagree. As explained above, the state\u2019s case depends on the jury\u2019s assessment of R\u2019s credibility. The risk that the jury improperly deferred to Munson\u2019s diagnosis rather than make its own determination in that regard was substantial. Thus, the result of a retrial without Munson\u2019s diagnosis is far from certain.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">In sum, the gravity of the error and the interests of justice militate conclusively in favor of us exercising our discretion to correct the error in this case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As a final point, although the parties do not actually raise it, we must consider whether that conclusion requires us to reverse and remand both of defendant\u2019s convictions. Munson diagnosed R as \u201chighly concerning of sexual abuse\u201d based on all of R\u2019s disclosures, including her statements that defendant had touched himself and masturbated in her presence \u2014 and the latter conduct, presumably, formed the basis for the endangerment charges.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, there is a substantial danger that the jury was prejudicially influenced by Munson\u2019s testimony in convicting defendant on the charge of endangering the welfare of a minor, as well as in convicting defendant of first-degree sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b567-7\"> ORAP 5.45(1) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-8\">\u201cNo matter claimed as error will be considered on appeal unless the claim of error was preserved in the lower court * * *, provided that the appellate court may consider an error of law apparent on the face of the record.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b567-9\"> Our analysis and disposition obviates any need to address defendant\u2019s other assignments of error, which pertain to purported instructional error that may not recur on remand or, at least, may be presented in a different posture.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b569-6\"> ORS 163.427 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-7\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of sexual abuse in the first degree when that person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-8\">\u201c(a) Subjects another person to sexual contact and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-9\">\u201c(A) The victim is less than 14 years of age[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b569-10\"> ORS 163.575 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-11\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of endangering the welfare of a minor if the person knowingly:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-12\">\u201c(a) Induces, causes or permits an unmarried person under 18 years of age to witness an act of sexual conduct * * <em>* </em>as defined by ORS 167.060[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-13\">ORS 167.060(10), in turn, defines \u201csexual conduct\u201d to mean</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-14\">\u201chuman masturbation, sexual intercourse, or any touching of the genitals, pubic areas or buttocks of the human male or female, or the breasts of the female, whether alone or between members of the same or opposite sex or between humans and animals in an act of apparent sexual stimulation or gratification.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b571-6\"> To the extent that the state relies on the fact that the jury acquitted defendant of other counts as support for its argument, we reject the state\u2019s logic for the reason that we rejected it in <em>Lovern.
