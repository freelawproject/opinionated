J.</author>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">Claimant seeks judicial review, pursuant to ORS 657.282 and ORS 657.290(3), of an order on reconsideration of the Employment Appeals Board (board) affirming an administrative law judge\u2019s determination that claimant is not entitled to trade readjustment allowance (TRA) benefits under 19 USC section 2291 (2006 &amp; Supp 2007).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The facts are not in dispute; thus, we review for errors of law. ORS 183.482(8)(a). Because we conclude that federal law precludes a determination that claimant is entitled to receipt of TRA benefits, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Claimant\u2019s asserted entitlement to TRA benefits implicates interlocking federal statutes and regulations. Accordingly, before describing claimant\u2019s particular circumstances, we provide an overview of that scheme. The Trade Act of 1974, <em>see </em>19 USC ch 12, created a program of trade adjustment assistance (TAA), <em>see </em>19 USC \u00a7\u00a7 2271-2322. The program was created \u201cto assist individuals, who became unemployed as a result of increased imports, [to] return to suitable employment. The TAA program provides for reemployment services and allowances for eligible individuals.\u201d 20 CFR \u00a7 617.2. Among the allowances awarded under the TAA program are TRA benefits. <em>See </em>20 CFR \u00a7 617.3(mm) (TAA refers to \u201cthe services and allowances provided for achieving reemployment of adversely affected workers, <em>including TRA, </em>training and other reemployment services, and job search allowances and relocation allowances\u201d (emphasis added)); 20 CFR \u00a7 617.3(nn) (TRA refers to \u201ca weekly allowance payable to an adversely affected worker with respect to such worker\u2019s unemployment\u201d). Apparently, as the parties in this case posit, claimant\u2019s entitlement to TRA benefits is important because, upon a determination of such eligibility, he will then qualify for a health insurance tax credit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Entitlement to TRA benefits is governed by 19 USC section 2291. As pertinent here, 19 USC section 2291(a)(5)(A)(i) and (ii) provided that one of the requirements to obtain TRA benefits is that a worker must be enrolled in training by a particular deadline, commonly known as the \u201c8/16 week deadline.\u201d In very general terms, that deadline, prescribed by 19 USC section 2291(a)(5), required that, to be eligible for TRA benefits, the worker must be enrolled within an approved training program and his or her enrollment in that program must have occurred \u201cno later than the latest of,\u201d <em>inter alia, </em>eight weeks after the issuance of a certificate of eligibility covering the worker or 16 weeks after the worker\u2019s most recent separation from qualifying employment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, and alternatively, 19 USC section 2291(c) provided for the waiver of those training requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-4\">\u201cThe Secretary may issue a written statement to an adversely affected worker waiving the requirement to be enrolled in training described in subsection (a)(5)(A) of this section if the Secretary determines that it is not feasible or appropriate for the worker, because of 1 or more of [certain enumerated reasons].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Ultimately, 20 CFR section 617.50(d) governs a state agency\u2019s determination concerning TRA entitlement. That rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-4\">\u201cIn making determinations or redeterminations under this section, or in reviewing such determinations or redeterminations under \u00a7 617.51, a State agency shall apply the regulations in this part 617. As to matters committed by this part 617 to the applicable State law, a State agency, a hearing officer, or a State court shall apply the applicable State law and regulations thereunder, including procedural requirements of such State law or regulations, except so far as such State law or regulations are inconsistent with this part 617 or the purpose of this part 617: <em>Provided, that, no provision of State law or regulations on good cause for waiver of any time limit, or for late filing of any claim, shall apply to any time limitation referred to or specified in this part 617, unless such State law or regulation is made applicable by a specific provision of this part 617.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">In light of that federal statutory and regulatory framework, we turn to the pertinent facts, which we take from the board\u2019s order as supplemented by the uncontroverted submissions in the record. Claimant was a Washington resident who worked as a manager for JR Simplot Co. in Hermiston. On June 24, 2005, after claimant\u2019s employment with his Oregon employer ended, he contacted the Oregon Employment Department (the department) to obtain information about TRA benefits. At that time, as the board found,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-7\">\u201c[c]laimant spoke to an adjudicator, Steele, who advised claimant to contact the Washington State employment agency for assistance, because claimant\u2019s address of record was in that state.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] Steele gave claimant the phone number <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>for the Washington State TAA/TRA coordinator, and advised him to speak to a TAA representative about waiver and training. Steele told claimant he needed to file for a waiver within a certain time frame or he would not be entitled to TAA benefits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-3\">Thereafter, on July 1, 2005, claimant requested a determination from the department of entitlement to TRA benefits. On July 11, 2005, the department sent a determination to claimant, stating, as pertinent to this judicial review, that to be eligible for TRA benefits, claimant needed to be enrolled in a training program or obtain a waiver no later than the sixteenth week from his most recent qualified layoff \u2014 that is, by August 6, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">After receiving the department\u2019s determination, claimant took it to the Washington TAA representative. At their meeting, the representative</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-5\">\u201ctold claimant that she understood the benefit he was seeking. She did not offer claimant a waiver form or otherwise advise him to complete a waiver form to ensure his eligibility to receive the [health insurance tax credit] benefit under the TAA program. Throughout the remainder of July and most of August, claimant continued to follow the recommendations he received from the Washington TAA representative, as he had been instructed by the Department\u2019s adjudicator, Steele.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Claimant did not obtain a waiver by the August 6 deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">However, on August 23, 2005, claimant met again with the Washington representative, who \u201crealized that claimant\u2019s 16-week deadline had passed.\u201d At that point, the Washington representative apparently purported to grant claimant a 45-day extension of the deadline requirement and approved a waiver of the training enrollment requirement. Thereafter, claimant and the Washington representative met monthly through the end of 2005 \u201cto review claimant\u2019s ongoing eligibility for the training waiver.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>In March 2006, the Washington representative spoke with an Oregon TAA representative. As a result of that conversation, the Washington representative determined that she had erroneously issued claimant the extension and waiver.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, \u201c[o]n March 13, 2006, the Washington TAA representative revoked claimant\u2019s 45-day extension, denied claimant\u2019s training waiver, and notified the Department of the revocation.\u201d Thereafter, on March 20, the department mailed to claimant a new benefit report \u201cstating that he was not entitled to benefits under the TAA/TRA programs because he had failed to meet the deadline for enrolling in approved training or obtaining a waiver.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">Claimant appealed. After a hearing before the administrative law judge (ALJ), the ALJ determined that claimant was required to be enrolled in a training program or obtain a waiver of training by August 6,2005, and that, \u201c[r]egardless of what occurred in the State of Washington, claimant failed to meet the deadline.\u201d Accordingly, the ALJ concluded that claimant was not eligible to receive TRA benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Thereafter, claimant appealed to the board. Ultimately, in its order on reconsideration that is the subject of this judicial review proceeding, the board affirmed the ALJ. The board determined that claimant \u201cremains ineligible for TRA benefits\u201d notwithstanding that (1) the department had failed in its responsibility to provide a timely waiver by August 6, 2005, and (2) \u201c[i]t appears from the record that claimant\u2019s ineligibility was the result of governmental confusion, miscommunication, and poor training, rather than any failure on claimant\u2019s part.\u201d Claimant\u2019s ineligibility was irremediable because \u201cFederal Law does not permit the Department to waive the 16-week deadline for claimant or any other potential recipient of TAA/TRA. <em>See </em>20 CFR 617.50(d).\u201d In reaching that conclusion, the board determined that it could not use the doctrine of estoppel to assist claimant. Specifically, the board reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">\u201cWe considered and rejected using the doctrine of estoppel to relieve claimant of the result in this case. Estoppel requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>findings that an agency knowingly made a false or misleading statement of an existing material fact, and an individual justifiably and detrimentally relied upon that false or misleading statement. <em>Employment Division v. Western Graphics Corporation, </em>76 Or App 608, 710 P2d 788 (1985). Because neither the Department nor its agent (the Washington TAA representative) made a false or misleading statement of an existing material fact, estoppel does not apply.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Claimant seeks judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">On review, claimant does not challenge any of the board\u2019s factual findings. Nor does claimant dispute that federal law required that he either was to have been enrolled in training or to have obtained a waiver by August 6, 2005. Instead, claimant contends that, despite the fact that he had not obtained a waiver by the deadline, \u201cthis Court should find that the Department is estopped from asserting that its own failure to make the requisite training/waiver entry should disqualify [claimant] from benefits.\u201d As support for that contention, claimant invokes <em>Employment Dept. v. Furseth, </em>140 Or App 464, 915 P2d 1043 (1996).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">As framed, claimant\u2019s estoppel argument implicates two inquiries. First, on this record, did claimant establish circumstances that, under Oregon law, would give rise to equitable estoppel against the department? Second, even if claimant proved the requisites of equitable estoppel generally, does federal law governing TRA benefits preclude the department from affording claimant the relief he seeks? That is, does federal law effectively preclude resort to principles of estoppel under Oregon law in these circumstances? For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the federal statute and regulatory scheme governing entitlement to TRA benefits precludes remedial resort to equitable estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">We begin with <em>Furseth, </em>which claimant invokes, because the material distinctions between that case and this one are, ultimately, dispositive. In <em>Furseth, </em>after learning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>that the college classes for which he had registered had been postponed, the claimant spoke with agency representatives who assured him that he would continue receiving TRA benefits. 140 Or App at 468. Relying on those assurances, the claimant did not enroll in other classes. <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, and notwithstanding its agent\u2019s representations, the department ultimately determined that the claimant was ineligible for additional TRA benefits because he was not enrolled in training. <em>Id. </em>at 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">In challenging that denial before EAB, the claimant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq9\">\u201ccontended that the Department should nonetheless provide him with the additional benefits, because its representative misled him to believe that his benefits would continue automatically while he was on a waiver of participation in training, and that his failure to qualify was caused by the Department\u2019s failure to advise him correctly concerning eligibility requirements. EAB agreed and held that the doctrine of equitable estoppel compels the state to pay additional TRA benefits to claimant[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">On review, we agreed. We held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-8\"><em>\u201capplication of the doctrine of equitable estoppel against the state does not effect a waiver of the participation-in-training </em>requirement; it merely prevents the state from withholding benefits to an individual who has failed to satisfy that requirement because of the state\u2019s failure to provide accurate advice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 470 (emphasis added). Further, we reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-10\">\u201ccontrary to the state\u2019s contention, we hold that this claim estops only the state, not the federal government. Although the state acts as the agent of the federal government in administering the TRA program, federal law is clear <em>that the state is reimbursed only for benefits that are due under the Act; if benefits are paid that are not due, the state is obligated to restore those amounts to the federal government </em>or risk the termination of its agreement with the Secretary of Labor. Accordingly, the state bears the ultimate responsibility for its own errors in administering the Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-11\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-12\">Thus, the gravamen of our holding in <em>Furseth </em>was that (1) state actors cannot be equitably estopped from acting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>in compliance with federal law; (2) although allowing a waiver of the training requirement in <em>Furseth </em>would have violated federal law, the state\u2019s payment of benefits would not violate federal law \u2014 rather, it would merely require the state to reimburse the federal government to the extent of such payments; and (3) consequently, the state could properly be estopped from withholding benefits from the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\"><em>Furseth, </em>as so understood, is materially distinguishable from this case for at least two reasons. <em>First, </em>the deadlines to enroll in training or obtain a waiver, as prescribed in 19 USC section 2291, were enacted in 2002 and, thus, were not extant when we decided <em>Furseth </em>in 1996. Consequently, in <em>Furseth, </em>we had no occasion to determine whether the application of the doctrine of equitable estoppel would contravene 20 CFR section 617.50(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\"><em>Second, </em>as noted in <em>Furseth, </em>the ultimate consequence of the equitable estoppel was that the state was obligated to make monetary payments of benefits to the claim - ant, an obligation that did not violate federal law so long as the state bore sole responsibility for those payments. Here, however, claimant does not seek monetary relief; rather, he seeks a waiver of an eligibility requirement \u2014 a waiver that cannot be granted without violating federal requirements prescribing mandatory time lines. In sum, equitable estoppel cannot operate to effectively compel the department to render an untimely determination of program eligibility in derogation of federal law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b437-6\"> Significant amendments to the pertinent federal statutes were made in 2009. Those amendments do not apply to this case. For that reason, we apply the versions of the federal statutes as contained in the 2006 United States Code and its 2007 supplement. However, amendments were not made to the pertinent federal rules; thus, our references to any federal rules are to the current versions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b437-7\"> According to the board, \u201c[c]laimant did not require training assistance, and he did not need the weekly benefits he might be eligible to receive through the TAA/ TRA programs. Claimant did, however, need the health insurance tax credit * * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>available through the TAA program.\u201d During the hearing before the administrative law judge, David Carpenter, an authorized representative for the department, testified that the health insurance tax credit that claimant sought was contingent on his entitlement to TRA benefits. On review, neither party challenges the proposition that claimant had to be entitled to TRA benefits to obtain the tax credits that he sought. Thus, we do not address that issue on review and note that, notwithstanding the board\u2019s references to TAA/TRA, the primary issue on review is claimant\u2019s entitlement to TRA benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b438-7\"> 19 USC section 2291(a)(5) provided, in part, that payment of a TRA shall be made to an adversely affected worker if certain conditions were met, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-8\">\u201cSuch worker\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-9\">\u201c(A)(i) is enrolled in a training program approved hy the Secretary under section 2296(a) of this title, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-10\">\u201c(ii) the enrollment required under clause (i) occurs no later than the latest of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-11\">\u201c(D the last day of the 16th week after the worker\u2019s most recent total separation from adversely affected employment which meets the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2),</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-12\">\u201c(II) the last day of the 8th week after the week in which the Secretary issues a certification covering the worker,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-13\">\u201c(III) 45 days after the later of the dates specified in subclause (I) or (II), if the Secretary determines there are extenuating circumstances that justify an extension in the enrollment period[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b439-8\"> As the board indicated, \u201cthe Department shared some responsibilities for claimant\u2019s case with the Employment Security Department for the State of Washington ** * Specifically, the board explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-9\">\u201cThe Department was acting on behalf of Oregon as the \u2018liable state,\u2019 and was therefore responsible for making all determinations, redeterminations, and decisions on appeals on all claims, including waivers and revocations of waivers * * *. The Employment Security Department, acting on behalf of Washington as the agent state, was merely responsible for cooperating fully with the Department and assisting it in carrying out its responsibilities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">In other words, as pertinent to this case, Oregon was the \u201cliable state\u201d \u2014 that is, Oregon was responsible for determining claimant\u2019s eligibility for TRA benefits and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>issuing any waiver. <em>See </em>20 CFR \u00a7 617.26(a). Washington, on the other hand, was the \u201cagent state\u201d \u2014 that is, with regard to an interstate worker such as claimant, Washington was responsible for \u201cproviding [him] with TAA program information and assistance\u201d and assisting Oregon in carrying out its responsibilities. <em>See </em>20 CFR \u00a7 617.26(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b441-8\"> According to the board, under the circumstances here, claimant was not entitled to the 45-day extension and the Washington representative lacked authority to approve a waiver.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b442-8\"> Claimant raises other, qualitatively different contentions in his reply brief on review. Those contentions were not raised in the opening brief on review. Accordingly, we will not consider them. <em>See Hayes Oyster Co. v. Dulcich, </em>170 Or App 219, 237 n 20, 12 P3d 507 (2000) (refusing to address argument raised for the first time in reply brief).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b444-7\"> Our analysis and disposition with respect to equitable estoppel, including the mandates of 19 USC section 2291(a)(5) and 20 CFR section 617.50(d), similarly precludes any allowance of relief under OAR 471-030-0055(2) in contravention of federal law.
