J.</author>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Defendant appeals from a judgment of conviction for 16 counts of sexual abuse in the first degree. ORS 163.427. In his first two assignments of error, he argues that the trial court erred in admitting a medical doctor\u2019s testimony regarding the \u201cprocess of disclosure\u201d and recantation by sexual abuse victims. His third assignment of error challenges the trial court\u2019s admission of the doctor\u2019s medical diagnosis that the complainant had been sexually abused. As explained below, we agree with defendant that the latter ruling was, in all events, \u201can error of law apparent on the face of the record,\u201d ORAP SASll),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> given the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>State v. Southard, </em>347 Or 127, 218 P3d 104 (2009). <em>See State v. Jury, </em>185 Or App 132, 57 P3d 970 (2002), <em>rev den, </em>335 Or 504 (2003). We further conclude that it is appropriate for us to exercise our discretion to correct that error in this case. <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 381-82, 823 P2d 956 (1991). Accordingly, we reverse and remand on the basis of defendant\u2019s third assignment of error. Because the record may develop differently on retrial, we do not address defendant\u2019s other assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The facts relevant to the issue before us on appeal are not in dispute. The complainant in this case is defendant\u2019s daughter. In May 2007, when the complainant was 12 years old, she disclosed to two of her friends at school that defendant was molesting her. At their urging, she spoke with the school counselor who, in turn, contacted the police. The complainant was then interviewed by Detective Stauder; that interview was recorded, and the school counselor and a caseworker from the Department of Human Services (DHS) were also present. The complainant told Stauder that defendant had touched her vagina, breasts, and buttocks, and that he had penetrated her bottom with his penis.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Defendant was arrested at the family home later that day. The police then brought the complainant home to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>her mother. According to the complainant\u2019s mother, immediately after the police left, the complainant said, \u201c Why are you crying, Mommy? He\u2019s out of the house. Now he has to go get a job.\u2019 \u201d When the mother explained to the complainant that \u201c \u2018[t]hat\u2019s not how this works,\u2019 \u201d and told the complainant to tell her the truth, the complainant said that she had lied to the police. A few days later, the complainant also told Stauder that she had lied earlier and that she could not remember what she had said. In response to Stauder\u2019s specific questions, she said that it was true that defendant had touched her breasts and vagina, but that her statements about defendant penetrating her bottom were not true.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">The complainant was subsequently evaluated at ABC House, a child victim assessment center. Dr. Chervenak, a physician and medical director of the ABC House who has specialized training and experience in the area of child abuse, conducted the examination. Before meeting with the complainant, Chervenak reviewed DHS\u2019s referral and a transcript of the complainant\u2019s interview with Stauder. She then obtained a medical history from the complainant\u2019s mother and from the complainant. Finally, she conducted a \u201chead-to-toe\u201d physical examination of the complainant. In describing the results of her physical examination of the complainant\u2019s vaginal area and hymen, she testified that the complainant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-5\">\u201chas what I would call a non-specifically abnormal exam, so basically in that gray zone that I can\u2019t really tell one way or the other. It wasn\u2019t perfectly normal but it wasn\u2019t specifically abnormal that I know for sure there\u2019s been an injury there. She had a couple of notches in part of her hymen. There \u2014 it\u2019s an unusual appearance to have that level of notching but it\u2019s not so specific that it indicates that there was clearly an injury there before.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">During the examination, the complainant denied that anyone had hurt her or touched her intimate parts. Instead she told Chervenak, \u201c T got mad at my dad and told a lie and it got out of control.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Defendant was charged with two counts of sodomy in the first degree; one count of attempted sodomy in the first degree; one count of incest; and 16 counts of first-degree sexual abuse, based on touching the complainant\u2019s breasts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>vaginal area. At trial, the complainant testified that she had not been sexually abused by defendant and that she had lied to her friends, the school counselor, and the police. She said that she had gotten into a fight with her father the night before and that she was angry with him for not working and not \u201cpulling his weight around the house.\u201d Defendant testified and denied that any abuse occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">The jury listened to portions of the recording of Stauder\u2019s first interview with the complainant, in which the complainant had made the allegations against defendant. In addition, the state sought to elicit testimony from Chervenak to counter the primary defense theory that the complainant had lied initially in disclosing the abuse. Over defense counsel\u2019s objection, Chervenak testified about the disclosure process for child victims of sexual abuse; she further testified that \u201cbetween six percent and 22 percent of children at this age will recant, and that is also \u2014 for some patients is part of the process.\u201d When the prosecutor asked Chervenak if she had been \u201cable to form an opinion to a medical certainty of more likely than not of whether or not [the complainant] had been sexually abused,\u201d defense counsel again objected, arguing \u201cno foundation.\u201d The court overruled the objections, and Chervenak testified that her diagnosis was \u201c[t]hat there has been sexual abuse in this patient.\u201d Chervenak stated that her diagnosis was based on the complainant\u2019s \u201cinitial detailed statements, which were spontaneous, the subsequent non-detailed recantation, her anal/genital exam, and her affect during the exam with me.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">The jury found defendant guilty of the 16 counts of first-degree sexual abuse. Defendant was acquitted on the remaining counts \u2014 that is, the sodomy, attempted sodomy, and incest charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>On appeal, defendant raises three assignments of error, challenging the admissibility of various aspects of Chervenak\u2019s testimony. Because it is dispositive, we address only defendant\u2019s third assignment, in which defendant asserts that the trial court erred in admitting Chervenak\u2019s medical diagnosis of sexual abuse.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We review whether scientific evidence is admissible for errors of law. <em>Jennings v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., </em>331 Or 285, 299-301, 14 P3d 596 (2000); <em>State v. Helgeson, </em>220 Or App 285, 185 P3d 545 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">In challenging the admissibility of Chervenak\u2019s diagnosis, defendant argues, <em>inter alia, </em>that the diagnosis should have been excluded because, as the Supreme Court explained in <em>Southard, </em>its prejudicial effect is substantially outweighed by its limited probative value. 347 Or at 141.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The parties dispute whether defendant\u2019s present contention in that regard was adequately raised and preserved below.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We need not resolve that dispute, however, because, as we explain, we agree with defendant that, in all events, the admission of the medical diagnosis was plain error under ORAP 5.45(1), and it is appropriate for us to exercise our discretion to correct the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number> Ordinarily, we will not consider a claim of error on appeal that has not been presented to the trial court. ORAP 5.45(1); <em>see generally Peeples v. Lampert, </em>345 Or 209, 219-20, 191 P3d 637 (2008) (explaining purpose behind preservation rule). However, we may reach unpreserved error if it is an \u201cerror of law apparent on the face of the record,\u201d ORAP 5.45(1), also referred to as \u201cplain error.\u201d <em>See State v. Steen, </em>346 Or 143, 206 P3d 614 (2009) (discussing plain error exception to preservation requirement generally). An error is \u201cplain\u201d for purposes of ORAP 5.45 if (1) the error is one of law; (2) the legal point is obvious \u2014 that is, \u201cnot reasonably in dispute\u201d; and (3) to reach the error, \u201c[w]e need not go outside the record or choose between competing inferences to find it.\u201d <em>State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355, 800 P2d 259 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Of particular significance here, given that defendant\u2019s trial occurred before <em>Southard </em>was decided, we determine \u201cplain error\u201d by reference to \u201cthe law existing at the time the appeal is decided,\u201d and not as of the time the allegedly erroneous ruling was rendered. <em>Jury, </em>185 Or App at 136. Finally, even if the error qualifies as plain error, we still must decide whether to affirmatively exercise our discretion to correct the error and identify the reasons for doing so. <em>Ailes, </em>312 Or at 382. We do so cautiously, given the important policies underlying the preservation rule. <em>Peeples, </em>345 Or at 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that, given <em>Southard, </em>the admission of Chervenak\u2019s diagnosis of sexual abuse constituted an \u201cerror of law apparent on the face of the record.\u201d ORAP 5.45(1). We further conclude that a variety of considerations decisively militate in favor of a positive exercise of our discretion under <em>Ailes </em>to remedy that error.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">We begin with the requisites of plain error. The operative <em>question </em>\u2014 viz., the admissibility of an expert diagnosis of sexual abuse in the absence of any physical evidence of abuse \u2014 is a question of law. Further, following <em>Southard, </em>the correct resolution of that legal question is no longer reasonably in dispute. Finally, to discern that error, we need not go outside the record or chose between or among competing inferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">In <em>Southard, </em>as in this case, the ultimately dispositive question was \u201cwhether a diagnosis of\u2018sexual <em>abuse\u2019 </em>\u2014 i.e., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>a statement from an expert that, in the expert\u2019s opinion, the child was sexually abused \u2014 is admissible in the absence of any physical evidence of abuse.\u201d 347 Or at 142. There, a physician at a child abuse assessment center diagnosed the child as having been sexually abused based on the child\u2019s statements of abuse and the child\u2019s history, gathered from his mother and foster mother, including their reports that he had exhibited sexual behaviors that concerned them. A physical examination revealed no physical evidence of sexual abuse. <em>Id. </em>at 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">The defendant was subsequently charged with two counts of sodomy involving the child. <em>Id. </em>Before trial, the defendant moved <em>in limine </em>to preclude the state from presenting evidence of the physician\u2019s diagnosis of sexual abuse. <em>Id. </em>In so moving, the defendant contended that the diagnosis was \u201cscientific evidence\u201d under OEC 702 but did not satisfy the foundational requirements for such evidence. The trial court denied that motion, and, at trial, the physician did, in fact, testify that she had diagnosed the child as having been sexually abused. <em>Id. </em>at 132. The jury convicted the defendant, and, on appeal, we affirmed the judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">On review, the Supreme Court reversed. In doing so, however, the court began by rejecting the defendant\u2019s predominant contention that, \u201cwithout physical evidence of abuse, a diagnosis of child sexual abuse is too unreliable and not sufficiently verifiable to be considered scientifically valid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 132. In rejecting that argument, the court first reiterated the well-established criteria for the admissibility of scientific evidence, namely, that it \u201cmust be relevant, OEC 401; it must possess sufficient indicia of scientific validity and be helpful to the jury, OEC 702; and its prejudicial effect must not outweigh its probative value, OEC 403.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 133 (citing <em>Marcum v. Adventist Health System/West, </em>345 Or 237, 243, 193 P3d 1 (2008), <em>and Jennings, </em>331 Or at 301).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Applying those principles, the Supreme Court then examined the specific methodologies used by the physician and the assessment center in making the diagnosis of sexual abuse and concluded that they possessed \u201csufficient indicia of scientific validity,\u201d even in the absence of physical evidence of abuse, to satisfy the second criteria for admissibility. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number><em>Southard, </em>347 Or at 137. In sum, \u201c[t]he experts were all qualified, the techniques used are generally accepted, the procedures rely on specialized literature in the field, and the procedures used are not novel. Furthermore, the [assessment center] follows numerous safeguards to enhance objectivity and increase the accuracy of the final diagnosis.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">The Supreme Court further determined that the diagnosis of child sexual abuse was relevant, reasoning, \u201c[w]hether sexual abuse has occurred is a material fact in proving a charge of sodomy, and the doctor\u2019s diagnosis that the boy had been sexually abused increased the probability of that fact\u2019s occurrence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">However, the Supreme Court ultimately concluded that the expert\u2019s diagnosis of sexual abuse was nonetheless inadmissible because, under OEC 403, the probative value of that evidence was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at 141. As the court observed, because the doctor\u2019s diagnosis \u201cdid not tell the jury anything that it was not equally capable of determining on its own,\u201d its probative value was \u201cslight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 140. Conversely, the risk of prejudice was great:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-6\">\u201cThe fact that the diagnosis came from a credentialed expert, surrounded with the hallmarks of the scientific method, created a substantial risk that the jury \u2018may be overly impressed or prejudiced by a perhaps misplaced aura of reliability or validity of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 140-41 (quoting <em>State v. Brown, </em>297 Or 404, 439, 687 P2d 751 (1984)). Moreover, because the diagnosis was based primarily on the doctor\u2019s assessment of the child\u2019s credibility, it \u201cpose[s] the risk that the jury will not make its own credibility determination, which it is fully capable of doing, but will instead defer to the expert\u2019s implicit conclusion that the victim\u2019s reports of abuse are credible.\u201d <em>Southard, </em>347 Or at 141. In those circumstances, \u201cthe risk that the jury will defer to the expert\u2019s assessment outweighs whatever probative value the diagnosis may have.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">We perceive no material legal distinction between the admissibility of the expert\u2019s diagnosis of sexual abuse in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number><em>Southard </em>and the admission of the diagnosis in this case. To be sure, here Chervenak testified that her physical examination of the complainant\u2019s vaginal area and hymen revealed an \u201cunusual appearance,\u201d due to \u201ca couple of notches in part of her hymen.\u201d However, the import of that \u201cnon-specifically abnormal exam\u201d was indeterminate. In particular, Chervenak testified that she \u201ccan\u2019t really tell one way or the other\u201d and \u201cit wasn\u2019t specifically abnormal that I know for sure there\u2019s been an injury there.\u201d Thus, by the doctor\u2019s own testimony, the physical evidence neither confirmed nor refuted a diagnosis of sexual abuse.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">In sum, as in <em>Southard, </em>the physician\u2019s diagnosis of sexual abuse in this case was based solely on the complainant\u2019s statements and history, without any physical evidence corroborative of the charged sexual abuse. Consequently, under \u201cthe law existing at the time the appeal is decided,\u201d <em>Jury, </em>185 Or App at 136, it is \u201cnot reasonably in dispute\u201d that the court erred in admitting Chervenak\u2019s diagnosis of sexual abuse, <em>Brown, </em>310 Or at 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The state does not dispute the first two prerequisites of the <em>Brown </em>plain error formulation. However, the state does contend that the asserted error does not satisfy the third, and final, criterion. In particular, the state contends that \u201ccompeting inferences\u201d can be drawn from defendant\u2019s failure to properly object to the admission of the diagnosis on OEC 403 grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">As we understand it, the state\u2019s thesis is this: It is possible that defense counsel made a conscious tactical decision to address the prejudice that \u2014 according to Southard\u2014 arises from the low probative value of the diagnosis evidence by attacking it during cross-examination and closing argument, rather than by continuing to raise objections in front of the jury. In other words, in the state\u2019s view, the defense may have made a tactical choice not to properly object to Chervenak\u2019s diagnosis so that it could use that evidence to its own advantage during cross-examination. Thus, according to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>the state, the error is not apparent because it requires us to \u201cchoose between competing inferences\u201d to find the error. <em>See Brown, </em>310 Or at 355.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">The state\u2019s argument is unavailing, regardless of whether it is more properly directed to the third plain error prerequisite or to the proper exercise of <em>Ailes </em>discretion. <em>See </em>234 Or App at 512 n 7. The premise of that <em>argument </em>\u2014 viz., that defendant actually <em>wanted </em>the diagnosis testimony to be admitted so that he could savage it \u2014 is irreconcilable with what actually occurred at trial. Bluntly, \u201ccompeting inferences,\u201d for purposes of the plain error analysis, must be plausible \u2014 and the inference that the state posits is not plausible.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">As noted, defense counsel did, in fact, object to Chervenak\u2019s diagnosis testimony, asserting that that testimony should not be admitted because of \u201cno foundation.\u201d <em>See </em>234 Or App at 506. That action completely contradicts the premise that defendant actually <em>wanted </em>to have that testimony admitted, as a foil for cross-examination. In other words, if that were defendant\u2019s strategy, defendant would not have objected at all, rather than make an incomplete or, in the state\u2019s view, incorrect objection. Thus, the tactical reason posited by the state for defendant\u2019s failure to specifically object to the diagnosis on OEC 403 grounds is implausible.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">In sum, we conclude that the requirements for plain error review have been satisfied in this case. We turn to the factors that properly bear on our exercise of our discretion to remedy the unpreserved error on appeal. Those factors include</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-7\">\u201cthe competing interests of the parties; the nature of the case; the gravity of the error; the ends of justice in the particular case; how the error came to the court\u2019s attention; and whether the policies behind the general rule requiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>preservation of error have been served in the case in another way[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-4\"><em>Ailes, </em>312 Or at 382 n 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">We determine that several considerations conclusively militate in favor of correcting the error in this case. Most importantly, as <em>Southard </em>itself makes clear, the gravity of the error is substantial. The issue of the complainant\u2019s credibility was critical to the outcome of this case. The core of the state\u2019s case was the complainant\u2019s allegations \u2014 which she later fully recanted \u2014 and Chervenak\u2019s expert diagnosis. Given the complainant\u2019s recantation, the jury was ultimately called upon to determine whether she was telling the truth, or being untruthful, when she made her initial allegations\u2014 and, conversely, whether her recantation was truthful or untruthful. Necessarily implicit in the erroneously admitted diagnosis was Chervenak\u2019s conclusion that at least some of the complainant\u2019s initial disclosures were more credible than her later recantation.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">As <em>Southard </em>warns, there is a substantial risk that the jury \u201c \u2018may be overly impressed or prejudiced by a perhaps misplaced aura of reliability or validity of the [expert] evidence\u2019 \u201d \u2014 and, thus, improperly defer to the expert\u2019s assessment of credibility rather than making its own independent determination. 347 Or at 141 (quoting <em>Brown, </em>297 Or at 439). Consequently, there was a substantial prospect in this case that the jury, in rendering its verdict, deferred improperly to Chervenak\u2019s diagnosis. <em>See, e.g., State v. Page, </em>197 Or App 72, 83, 104 P3d 616 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 673 (2006) (exercising our discretion to review unpreserved error when the erroneously admitted evidence was a crucial part of the state\u2019s case); <em>cf. State v. Ramirez, </em>343 Or 505, 513-14, 173 P3d 817 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>344 Or 195, 179 P3d 673 (2008) (\u201cends of justice\u201d would not be advanced by \u201cplain error\u201d-based remand under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 US 296, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004), where there was overwhelming evidence in support of the departure factors relied on by the trial court).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">The state disagrees, pointing to the fact that the jury acquitted defendant on <em>some </em>charges, albeit convicting on others. According to the state, the verdict thus demonstrates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>that the jury made its own credibility determinations and was not unfairly prejudiced by the admission of Chervenak\u2019s diagnosis. In other words, in the state\u2019s view, the risk articulated in <em>Southard </em>\u2014 that the jury would improperly defer to the expert evidence \u2014 was not realized in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">We reject the state\u2019s premise. Chervenak diagnosed the complainant as having been sexually abused; she did not detail the specific acts correlating to that abuse. The jury convicted defendant of 16 counts of sexual abuse. It does not follow, simply because the jury acquitted defendant of other counts \u2014 which, incidentally, were not denominated \u201csexual abuse\u201d \u2014 that the jury was not prejudicially influenced by the erroneously admitted expert opinion in convicting defendant on the sexual abuse charges.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Further, considering and correcting the error here will not undermine the \u201crecord-development\u201d function of the preservation doctrine. As explained above, defendant did object, albeit without invoking OEC 403, to the admission of the diagnosis testimony. We do not perceive how or why, even if defendant had also explicitly raised an OEC 403 objection, and had framed his argument in the terms that the Supreme Court ultimately, essentially categorically, adopted in <em>Southard, </em>the evidentiary record in this case would have developed any differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Finally, the error is not insignificant. Defendant was convicted of 16 counts of first-degree sexual abuse, a Measure 11 offense, and sentenced to 225 months of potentially unlawful incarceration. Given those consequences, and the palpable potential for improper prejudice, the \u201cends of justice\u201d favor our exercise of <em>Ailes </em>discretion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b554-7\"> ORAP 5.45(1) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-8\">\u201cNo matter claimed as error will be considered on appeal unless the claim of error was preserved in the lower court * * *, provided that the appellate court may consider an error of law apparent on the face of the record.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b556-6\"> Chervenak\u2019s testimony in that regard, including her unadorned reference to the results of the physical examination, paralleled the general protocol for conducting child abuse examinations, which she had previously described. As noted below, <em>see </em>234 Or App at 511 n 6, there is no relationship between the \u201cunusual appearance\u201d of the complainant\u2019s hymen and the type of sexual abuse charged in this case; accordingly, Chervenak\u2019s general reference to the complainant\u2019s anal/ genital examination cannot be understood to indicate reliance on that abnormality as corroborating the abuse alleged here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b557-5\"> In his first assignment of error, defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s admission of Chervenak\u2019s testimony about the disclosure process in sexual abuse victims. In his second assignment, he contends that the court erred in admitting Chervenak\u2019s testimony regarding the \u201cphenomenon of recanting\u201d by sexual abuse victims. The basis for both assignments of error is that the evidence failed to meet the heightened foundational requirements for the admission of scientific evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b557-6\"> <em>Southard, </em>was decided after briefing in this case was complete, although both parties recognized in their briefs that the admissibility of a medical diagnosis of sexual abuse without confirming physical evidence would be governed by the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in that case. We relate the parties\u2019 positions as they were framed at oral argument, which took place after <em>Southard </em>was decided.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b557-7\"> Defendant asserts that his objection to Chervenak\u2019s testimony on \u201cfoundational grounds\u201d was sufficient to preserve his argument on appeal; the state disagrees, arguing, in part, that that objection</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-8\">\u201cin no way apprised the court that defendant believed that Dr. Chervenak\u2019s medical diagnosis was not scientifically valid in the absence of physical evidence or that the probative value of such evidence was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Defendant did not reference the relevant standards of assessing the validity of scientific <em>evidence </em>\u2014 State <em>v. Brown, </em>297 Or 404, 687 P2d 751 (1984), or <em>State v. O\u2019Key, </em>321 Or 285, 899 P2d 663 (1995) \u2014 nor did he reference OEC 403, which permits a court to exclude unfairly prejudicial evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b561-8\"> In all events, given the nature of the charged conduct, which did not involve penetration of the complainant\u2019s vagina, the results of the physical examination did not corroborate the alleged abuse.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b562-8\"> The state\u2019s argument in that regard partakes of the analysis of <em>State v. Gornick, </em>340 Or 160, 169-70, 130 P3d 780 (2006) (error not apparent where the defendant expressly consented to waiver of jury and competing inferences could be drawn from the defendant\u2019s failure to object to the court\u2019s imposition of an upward departure sentence on the basis of facts neither admitted nor found by a jury). <em>But cf. State v. Fults, </em>343 Or 515, 523, 173 P3d 822 (2007) (addressing the defendant\u2019s \u201cstrategic choice not to object to the sentence\u201d as a consideration pertaining to exercise of <em>Ailes </em>discretion).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b564-8\"> As defendant suggests, it is possible that the jury convicted defendant of the sexual abuse charges, yet acquitted him of the sodomy-related and incest charges, because the complainant almost immediately recanted the latter charges, while continuing to assert that defendant engaged in the conduct forming the basis for the sexual abuse charges. It was only later that the complainant fully recanted all of the allegations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
