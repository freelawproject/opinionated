Defendant contends that the trial court erroneously admitted test results of defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content. The trial court held that the warrantless seizure of defendant\u2019s breath sample was constitutional under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution, because exigent circumstances justified the seizure and, alternatively, because defendant voluntarily consented to the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">On appeal, defendant argues that the state failed to establish an exigency sufficient to excuse any warrant requirement. The state contends that the evanescent nature of blood alcohol evidence in the human body created an exigency that, combined with probable cause to believe that defendant\u2019s breath contained evidence pertaining to the crime of driving under the influence of intoxicants, allowed the warrantless seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">In <em>State v. Machuca, </em>347 Or 644, 657, 227 P3d 729 (2010), the Supreme Court held, in circumstances similar to those in this case, that, \u201cfor purposes of the Oregon Constitution, the evanescent nature of a suspect\u2019s blood alcohol content is an exigent circumstance that will ordinarily permit a warrantless blood draw of the kind taken here.\u201d <em>Machuca </em>controls the result in this case. The breath test was justified by probable cause that it would reveal evidence of the crime of driving under the influence of intoxicants, and a warrant was excused because of exigent circumstances. Given that conclusion, we need not determine whether defendant\u2019s consent was valid to allow the seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
