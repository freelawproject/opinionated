On appeal, he argues that the second count is not supported by any facts in the record and, in any event, it should be merged into the first count.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude that defendant did not adequately preserve his claim of error. ORAP 5.45. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Defendant was convicted of several crimes in 1994. The post-conviction court vacated those convictions in 2007 and remanded the case to Marion County Circuit Court for a new trial. Before that trial, defendant requested that the court appoint a specific attorney, Simmons, to represent him; he objected to the appointment of any other attorney, stating in a November 13, 2007, letter to the court, \u201cNo Simmons, no deal. Simple as that.\u201d (Underscore in original.) The court contacted Oregon Public Defense Services on defendant\u2019s behalf. That office responded that it was unable to appoint Simmons, but would instead appoint another attorney, Lawrence. The court sent a November 15 letter to defendant notifying him of the appointment and, on November 26, entered an order appointing Lawrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">On December 11, the trial court held a pretrial hearing to consider several motions that defendant had submitted <em>pro se. </em>Lawrence appeared on defendant\u2019s behalf, engaging in colloquy with the court regarding defendant\u2019s case and referring to defendant as \u201cmy client.\u201d Defendant, however, insisted that the purpose of the hearing was to determine whether he would be represented by counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-7\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: Your Honor, we were here today to settle whether or not I was taking counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>\u201c[DEFENDANT]: So that\u2019s the first thing we\u2019re going to talk about today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-4\">\u201cTHE COURT: Great.

Misconduct in the presence of the court that interfered with a court proceeding or with the administration of justice, or that impaired the respect due the court; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-9\">\u2018XX 2. Disobedience of, resistance to, or obstruction of the court\u2019s authority, process, orders or judgments[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">The checked statements are drawn more or less verbatim from definitions of \u201ccontempt\u201d in ORS 33.015(2)(a) and (b). The court also noted that the \u201cact(s) referred to * * * specifically consisted of: Using profanity in the presence of the court and directed at the court.\u201d Defendant was sentenced to \u201c[c]onfinement in the county jail for 60 days as a punitive sanction (Not more than 30 days for each separate contempt)[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-11\">On appeal, as noted, defendant challenges the judgment to the extent that it penalized him for the second contempt, \u201cDisobedience of, resistance to, or obstruction of the court\u2019s authority, process, orders or judgments.\u201d He concedes that he did not preserve this claim of error in the trial court. He argues, however, that this case presents the rare factual scenario in which lack of preservation is not fatal to his appeal. He relies primarily on <em>State v. Gutierrez, </em>170 Or App 91, 93-96, 11 P3d 690 (2000), and <em>State v. DeCamp, </em>158 Or App 238, 241, 973 P2d 922 (1999), for the proposition that preservation of error is not required where it is not possible, and here, it was not possible because the record unambiguously demonstrates that the court summarily cut him off before he could object. In the alternative, he argues that we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>should review his claims of error as apparent on the face of the record. ORAP 5.45(6). In response, the state argues that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-4\">\u201c[a]lthough defendant is undoubtedly correct when he argues that the trial court was not willing to hear anything further from <em>him, </em>there is nothing in the record to suggest that the court would have been unwilling to hear from counsel regarding any of the issues defendant now raises on appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">(Emphasis in original.) Moreover, the state asserts, defendant\u2019s claims of error are not \u201capparent on the face of the record,\u201d because the legal points supporting those claims are \u201creasonably in dispute.\u201d <em>State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355, 800 P2d 259 (1990). For the reasons stated below, we agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">First, we conclude that defendant was represented by counsel at the hearing. ORS 9.380 provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-7\">\u201c[t]he attorney in an action, suit or proceeding may be changed, or the relationship of attorney and client terminated, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-8\">\u201c(1) Before judgment or final determination, upon the consent of the attorney filed with the clerk or entered in the appropriate record of the court; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-9\">\u201c(2) At any time, upon the order of the court or judge thereof, based on the application of the client or the attorney, for good and sufficient cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-10\">Lawrence was appointed by the court to represent defendant in an order dated November 26, 2007. Defendant did not apply to the court to have that attorney-client relationship terminated, and at no point did Lawrence file his consent to its termination. Thus, Lawrence remained the attorney of record in defendant\u2019s case at the December 11 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-11\">Second, it is beyond dispute that \u201cdefense counsel had a complete contemporaneous opportunity to bring the trial court\u2019s asserted error to the court\u2019s attention, but did not do so.\u201d <em>State v. Hammond, </em>218 Or App 574, 584, 180 P3d 137 (2008). Counsel knew that he was defendant\u2019s attorney, referring to him as \u201cmy client.\u201d Yet, at no point during or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>after the colloquy between defendant and the court did counsel interpose himself to make an objection. Although the record demonstrates that the court had no patience to hear from defendant after his \u201cwe don\u2019t have a fucking lawyer\u201d comment, nothing in the record suggests that the trial court would not have heard an objection and argument from Lawrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">Defendant\u2019s best argument that we should waive preservation is that counsel could not have known which arguments to make until after reviewing the court\u2019s written judgment, because only then did the court explain its rationale. However, the reason that he did not know the court\u2019s reasoning was because he did not ask for it or, more precisely, because he did not put the court on notice that he wanted the court to explain its reasoning so that he could object, if appropriate. In sum, preservation was required, and we cannot review defendant\u2019s assignment of error unless the error qualifies for plain error review and we exercise our discretion to review it.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\"> To qualify as plain, an asserted error must be purely legal in nature, the legal point must be beyond dispute, and \u201c[w]e need not go outside the record or choose between competing inferences to find it.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>310 Or at 355. Here, the asserted error is that the trial court\u2019s contempt conviction for \u201cdisobedience of, resistance to, or obstruction of the court\u2019s authority, process, orders or judgments,\u201d lacks a legally adequate factual foundation. That point is not obvious. Defendant\u2019s remark, \u201cSo we don\u2019t have a fucking lawyer,\u201d could plausibly be considered \u201cresistance to\u201d the court\u2019s assertion that defendant did, indeed, have a lawyer. It could also be considered resistance to the court\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\"> And in any event, even if the asserted error were plain, we would not exercise our authority to review it. In deciding whether to exercise our discretion, we must take into consideration several factors, including the nature of the case, the competing interests of the parties, the gravity of the error, and the ends of justice in the particular case. <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 382 n 6, 823 P2d 956 (1991). In this case, two facts are relevant: first, defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>has already completed the 60-day sentence for contempt,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and second, during the entire period of that incarceration, he was also incarcerated on another matter. Thus, the asserted error was not grave and the ends of justice, although not perfectly served, were not seriously damaged. Further, the state\u2019s interest in avoiding a second judicial proceeding, while not huge, nonetheless outweighs defendant\u2019s interest in having a record that shows two contempts instead of one. For all of these reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b736-10\"> In additional assignments of error, defendant contends that we must vacate both counts because the contempt statutes are unconstitutionally vague under the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution and because enforcing the statutes against him violates his freedom of expression under Article I, section 8, of the Oregon Constitution. We reject those assignments without discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b741-5\"> The state filed a notice of probable mootness with respect to the first assignment of error. ORAP 8.45. The appellate commissioner issued an order determining that the first assignment of error is not moot. Neither party sought reconsideration of that order, and, in any event, we agree with the appellate commissioner. <em>See State v. </em>Meyer, 31 Or App 775, 777 n 1, 571 P2d 550 (1977) (appeal of second of two simultaneous contempt convictions not moot despite fact that contemnor had served both sentences); <em>but see State ex rel State of Oregon v. Hawash, </em>230 Or App 427, 428, 215 P3d 124 (2009) (appeal of contempt is moot where contemnor has completed two years of probation and there are no other collateral consequences).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
