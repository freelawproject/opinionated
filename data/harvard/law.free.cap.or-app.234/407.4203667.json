J.</author>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">This is an action for fraud. Plaintiff filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim for injuries to his shoulder and back that he sustained while working for defendant. Defendant denied the claim for both injuries but later accepted plaintiffs claim for his shoulder injury. Plaintiff then filed this action seeking economic and noneconomic damages from defendant, alleging that defendant fraudulently promised to open plaintiffs back claim. Defendant moved for summary judgment on two grounds: first, that plaintiffs claim was subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board under ORS 656.018; second, that there was no genuine issue of material fact and that defendant was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on plaintiffs fraud claim. The trial court concluded that the board had exclusive jurisdiction over plaintiffs claim, granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and dismissed the case. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">On review of a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, we view the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party to determine whether there is any genuine issue of material fact and whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. ORCP 47 C; <em>Jones v. General Motors Corp., </em>325 Or 404, 420, 939 P2d 608 (1997). There is no genuine issue of material fact if the record, viewed in a manner most favorable to the adverse party, could not permit any objectively reasonable juror to return a verdict for the adverse party. ORCP 47 C. Accordingly, we state the relevant facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">THE FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Plaintiff was a lineman for defendant, an electric company. As part of plaintiffs employment, he climbed defendant\u2019s power poles. In April 2003, plaintiff fell from a power pole, injuring his back and shoulder. He filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim for those two injuries, and defendant denied the claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At that point, plaintiff had a limited time to request a hearing protesting the denial of his claim to the board. ORS 656.319(1). Instead of requesting a hearing on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>that denial, plaintiff continued to communicate with defendant regarding his injuries. Defendant repeatedly told plaintiff that, if he submitted medical records documenting his injuries from the fall, defendant would open plaintiffs claim. However, after plaintiffs right to request a hearing on the denial expired, defendant refused to open plaintiffs back claim, even though plaintiff had submitted the requested medical records.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Defendant is self-insured and self-administers its workers\u2019 compensation program. ORS 656.403(1). Janis Baumbach and Leanne Sneath are employed by defendant to administer its workers\u2019 compensation program. Plaintiff previously had been injured three times in the course of his employment with defendant, not including the injury that is the subject of litigation in this case. For each of those injuries, defendant accepted plaintiffs claims and paid workers\u2019 compensation benefits. In the course of handling those claims, Baumbach unilaterally obtained any documentation needed to approve plaintiffs claims. Before this 2003 claim, defendant never issued a written denial to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">After plaintiff suffered the back and shoulder injuries relevant to this case, he filed a written report of his fall and injuries, and later filed a written workers\u2019 compensation claim form with defendant in August 2003. Near the end of September, Baumbach called plaintiff to tell him that, if defendant did not receive plaintiffs medical records by October 6, 2003, it would \u201chave to deny the claim but that <em>we can reverse the denial and accept the claim at any </em>time.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) From that conversation, plaintiff understood that there was not a time limit for defendant to open his claim even if defendant initially had to deny the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">By that October 6 deadline, defendant had not received plaintiffs\u2019 medical records. Accordingly, defendant sent plaintiff a letter that stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-7\">\u201cUnder Oregon workers\u2019 compensation law, we must accept or deny a claim in 60 days. We have contacted you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>and your physician, David Krier, MD, in [an] attempt[ ] to obtain any related medical information concerning your claim. To date, we have not been successful in obtaining any documents from you or your physician. Therefore, at this time, we must respectfully deny your low back claim, as we do not have any medical documentation of an injury arising out of and in the course and scope of your employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-4\">\u201cWe will review your claim again for possible approval, once we receive medical documentation from your physician.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-5\">\u201cThe state of Oregon requires the following language:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-6\">\u201cIF YOU THINK THIS DENIAL IS NOT RIGHT, WITHIN 60 DAYS AFTER THE MAILING OF THIS DENIAL YOU MUST FILE A LETTER WITH THE WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION BOARD * * *. YOUR LETTER MUST STATE THAT YOU WANT A HEARING, YOUR ADDRESS AND THE DATE OF YOUR ACCIDENT IF YOU KNOW THE DATE * * * IF YOU DO NOT FILE A REQUEST WITHIN 60 DAYS, YOU WILL LOSE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO COMPENSATION UNLESS YOU CAN SHOW GOOD CAUSE FOR DELAY BEYOND 60 DAYS. AFTER 180 DAYS ALL YOUR RIGHTS WILL BE LOST.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">(Uppercase in original.) Plaintiff did not read that letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Defendant continued to investigate the claim after it sent the letter denying plaintiffs claim. On December 29, 2003, more than 60 days after the denial, Sneath asked plaintiff to have his attending physician, Dr. Krier, send plaintiffs medical records to defendant. On January 14, 2004, plaintiff called Sneath to inquire whether defendant had received plaintiffs medical reports. Sneath told plaintiff that defendant had not received plaintiffs medical records from Krier. After the call, Sneath noted in her diary, \u201cThis is a denied claim. It was denied since the doctor could not produce any records concerning treatment.\u201d Nonetheless, on January 26, 2004, Baumbach called plaintiff again, and she told plaintiff that, if Krier were to submit plaintiffs medical records, defendant would open plaintiffs claim. Accordingly, plaintiff had Krier send medical records to defendant; defendant received the records on January 27, 2004. Baumbach also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>called Krier, asked him to send plaintiffs medical records, and gave Krier defendant\u2019s fax number.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">On February 26, 2004, more than 140 days after the denial, one of defendant\u2019s claims investigators interviewed plaintiff. Plaintiff thought that the investigation was conducted to determine whether to open his back and shoulder claims. The claims investigator reported that she had received the assignment to investigate plaintiffs claims on February 2, 2004, and described plaintiffs claim for injuries to his shoulder and back.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Finally, on May 6, 2004, more than 200 days after the denial, plaintiff called defendant to get a claim number to facilitate payment of plaintiffs upcoming shoulder surgery. Plaintiff also inquired about compensation for his back injury. Defendant told plaintiff that his back injury claim was no longer at issue because plaintiff was time barred from appealing the October 6, 2003, denial. Even so, defendant encouraged plaintiff <em>not </em>to seek the advice of counsel. Baumbach told plaintiff that, even though future meetings \u201cwould likely not resolve the issue[, a meeting] might help [plaintiff] understand the issue better,\u201d and she told him that \u201cit would be better if we could meet and talk about [the denial of plaintiff s back claim] but it was his choice as to whether he pursued hiring a lawyer.\u201d Ultimately, defendant opened plaintiffs shoulder injury claim but did not open plaintiffs back injury claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">In December 2005, plaintiff filed this action in circuit court, alleging fraud and seeking economic and noneconomic damages. Plaintiff claimed that defendant never intended to open plaintiffs back injury claim but told him that it would open the claim in order to prevent plaintiff from timely requesting a hearing on the denial. Defendant moved for summary judgment, arguing that plaintiffs fraud claim was a matter concerning a workers\u2019 compensation claim and was subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the board. Alternatively, defendant argued that there was no genuine issue of material fact and that defendant was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on plaintiffs fraud claim. The trial court determined that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and dismissed the case. On appeal, the parties renew the arguments that they made to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">THE WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION ACT AS PLAINTIFF\u2019S EXCLUSIVE REMEDY</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">We first consider defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs fraud claim. We review the trial court\u2019s conclusion that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction over that claim for errors of law. <em>Spada v. Port of Portland, </em>55 Or App 148, 150, 637 P2d 229 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The jurisdictional issue turns on whether the injury for which plaintiff seeks recovery arose out of and in the course of his employment. ORS 656.018(l)(a) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-7\">\u201cThe liability of every employer * * * is exclusive and in place of all other liability arising out of injuries, diseases, symptom complexes or similar conditions <em>arising out of and in the course of employment </em>that are sustained by subject workers * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">(Emphasis added.) That exclusive remedy provision applies irrespective of whether the claimant prevails in establishing that a compensable injury or occupational disease occurred. <em>See </em>ORS 656.018(7).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>But see </em>ORS 656.019 (permitting plaintiffs to bring civil negligence claims for work-related conditions that fail to meet the burden of proof required by ORS chapter 656); <em>Smothers v. Gresham Transfer, Inc., </em>332 Or 83, 135, 23 P3d 333 (2001) (describing a potential exception to workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity under Article I, section 10, of the Oregon Constitution that applies on a case-by-case basis).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">The compensability of an injury illuminates whether an employee alleges an injury \u201carising out of and in the course of employment.\u201d A \u201ccompensable injury\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>\u201can accidental injury * * * arising out of and in the course of employment requiring medical services or resulting in disability or death * * *; an injury is accidental if the result is an accident, whether or not due to accidental means, if it is established by medical evidence supported by objective findings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">ORS 656.005(7)(a). That definition contains two prongs, which are treated as two parts of a single \u201cwork-connection\u201d analysis. The parties appear to agree that plaintiffs back and shoulder injuries are work-related compensable injuries if they are sufficiently connected to plaintiffs employment. <em>See Krushwitz v. McDonald\u2019s Restaurant, </em>323 Or 520, 525-26, 919 P2d 465 (1996) (describing the two-part \u201cwork-connection\u201d test to determine whether a physical injury is compensable).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">However, plaintiff alleges fraud, which did not arise out of and in the course of plaintiffs employment. There is nothing in plaintiffs employment that caused his alleged fraud damages. Those damages were caused by defendant\u2019s intentional non-work-related conduct. Moreover, plaintiffs fraud claim is not the sort that can be compensated by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. It cannot be treated by \u201cmedical services or result[ ] in disability or death,\u201d as required by ORS 656.005(7)(a). In fact, plaintiff could not be compensated by the workers\u2019 compensation system for damages resulting from defendant\u2019s alleged fraud. A work-related compensable injury must be established by medical evidence supported by objective findings. ORS 656.005(7)(a). Thus, plaintiffs fraud claim is not within the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The Supreme Court reached a similar conclusion in <em>Moustachetti v. State of Oregon, </em>319 Or 319, 877 P2d 66 (1994). There the court concluded that the plaintiffs wrongful discharge claim \u201cwas a different \u2018injury\u2019 than his \u2018compensable injury\u2019 under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u2018requiring medical services or resulting in disability\u2019 that was * * * compensated under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 325. That was because the legal injury, wrongful discharge, was not an injury that arose out of and in the course of the plaintiffs employment. Thus, the plaintiffs discharge was not subject to workers\u2019 compensation exclusively because it \u201cwas a different \u2018injury\u2019 than his \u2018compensable injury\u2019 under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u2018requiring medical services or resulting in disability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">Nonetheless, relying on <em>Gordineer v. Bellotti, </em>100 Or App 102, 735 P2d 362, <em>rev den, </em>310 Or 121 (1990), defendant argues that the board has exclusive jurisdiction because plaintiffs fraud claim is inseparable from his workers\u2019 compensation claim. In <em>Gordineer, </em>we held that the plaintiff could not collaterally attack a workers\u2019 compensation hearing decision in circuit court by bringing a fraud action against his employer, alleging that the employer perjured herself during the workers\u2019 compensation hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 106. <em>Gordineer </em>is unlike <em>Moustachetti </em>in that the plaintiff in <em>Gordineer </em>did not allege a separate injury; rather, he simply tried to overturn the decision in the prior workers\u2019 compensation proceeding. Conversely, in <em>Moustachetti, </em>the plaintiff brought a claim with facts that were also pertinent to the plaintiffs workers\u2019 compensation claim, but the civil claim was not a \u201cclaim for injury or death\u201d subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the board. Accordingly, we have held that the circuit court has subject matter jurisdiction over claims that arise out of similar facts or events as compensable injuries so long as those civil claims have their own legal basis. <em>See, e.g., Turnbow v. K.E. Enterprises, Inc., </em>155 Or App 59, 67, 962 P2d 764 (1998) (circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs wrongful termination claim that was factually related to his compensable injury).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Plaintiff argues that defendant\u2019s fraudulent representations denied him an opportunity to seek a remedy from the workers\u2019 compensation system. That injury is not a \u201ccompensable injury,\u201d as defined by ORS 656.005(7). If plaintiffs claim is not for a compensable injury, it is not subject to workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity. <em>Krushwitz, </em>323 Or at 525. Moreover, unlike in <em>Gordineer </em>where the plaintiff alleged fraud in the workers\u2019 compensation hearing itself but continued to assert a compensable injury, plaintiff here seeks a remedy for fraud, which is not a \u201ccompensable injury.\u201d Plaintiffs claim is not that there was fraud during the workers\u2019 compensation hearing as in <em>Gordineer, </em>nor does plaintiff allege compensable work-related injuries. Rather, plaintiff alleges common-law fraud and seeks a remedy for noneconomic and economic damages. Accordingly, we conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>plaintiffs fraud claim is not subject to the workers\u2019 compensation exclusive remedy statute. ORS 656.018. The trial court incorrectly concluded that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON THE FRAUD CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">As an alternative ground for affirmance, defendant argues that the trial court could have granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs fraud claim. The parties thoroughly developed that issue for summary judgment, and we cannot say that the record would have been developed differently had the court reached that issue, nor does plaintiff argue that the record would have been different. Accordingly, we turn to whether defendant was entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs fraud claim. <em>See Outdoor Media Dimensions Inc. v. State of Oregon, </em>331 Or 634, 659, 20 P3d 180 (2001) (discussing right for a different reason principle for affirming trial court\u2019s ruling).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">To succeed on a claim for fraud, a party must prove the following elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-7\">\u201c(1) a representation; (2) its falsity; (3) its materiality; (4) the speaker\u2019s knowledge of its falsity or ignorance of its truth; (5) [the speaker\u2019s] intent that it should be acted on by the person and in the matter reasonably contemplated; (6) the hearer\u2019s ignorance of its falsity; (7) [the hearer\u2019s] reliance on its truth; (8) [the hearer\u2019s] right to rely thereon; (9) and [the hearer\u2019s] consequent and proximate injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-11\"><em>Wieber v. FedEx Ground Package System, Inc., </em>231 Or App 469, 480, 220 P3d 68 (2009). Defendant argues that, even viewing the record in the light most favorable to plaintiff, no reasonable juror could find for plaintiff as to the fifth element \u2014 defendant\u2019s intent to mislead \u2014 and the seventh element \u2014 plaintiffs right to rely on the representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-12\">Defendant argues that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to defendant\u2019s intent to mislead because plaintiff testified that he did not <em>believe </em>that Baumbach intended to mislead him. Plaintiffs testimony as to his understanding of defendant\u2019s intentions is not dispositive of defendant\u2019s intentions. The intent to mislead element <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>requires the plaintiff to show that the defendant intended that the plaintiff act in reliance on the defendant\u2019s misrepresentation. <em>Knepper v. Brown, </em>182 Or App 597, 605, 50 P3d 1209 (2002). Baumbach testified that she expected plaintiff to rely on the statements that she made during her phone conversations with plaintiff. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff, we conclude that a reasonable juror could find that Baumbach repeatedly told plaintiff that, once his medical records were submitted, defendant would open plaintiffs claim, and that Baumbach continued to make those statements to plaintiff even after his right to request a hearing on the denial had expired. Accordingly, a reasonable juror could find that defendant, through Baumbach, intended to mislead plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">We next consider whether plaintiff established a genuine issue of fact regarding the \u201cright to rely\u201d element of a fraud claim. That element requires \u201cproof of the reasonableness of the reliance.\u201d <em>Wieber, </em>231 Or App at 483. Defendant argues that no reasonable juror could find that plaintiff reasonably relied on any misstatements by defendant\u2019s claims processors because (1) plaintiff had previously filed successful workers\u2019 compensation claims and (2) plaintiff did not read defendant\u2019s certified letter that correctly described plaintiffs right to request a hearing and its time limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">As to defendant\u2019s first contention \u2014 that plaintiffs reliance was not reasonable because he previously filed successful claims \u2014 the rule for reasonable reliance is well established:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-7\">\u201cReasonableness is measured in the totality of the parties\u2019 circumstances and conduct. For example, if there is a naive and unsophisticated plaintiff on one side of the equation and an unscrupulous defendant who made active misrepresentations of fact on the other, a court might well conclude that, although a more sophisticated party would not have taken at face value the false representations of the defendant, <em>that </em>particular plaintiff was justified in doing so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-8\"><em>Wieber, </em>231 Or App at 484 (emphasis in original; internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Here, a reasonable juror could find that plaintiff was an unsophisticated party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>and that defendant made active misrepresentations. Although plaintiff had experience filing workers\u2019 compensation claims, defendant voluntarily accepted the prior claims. Plaintiff had never successfully requested a hearing on a denied claim because it was not necessary. Plaintiff also had positive experiences working with Baumbach, who, in the past, obtained necessary records on plaintiffs behalf in order to process his claim. Accordingly, a reasonable juror could find that plaintiffs positive experience working with defendant on other claims made him a less than sophisticated party, particularly with respect to requesting a hearing on a denied claim. Moreover, given the diary entries by Baumbach and Sneath noting that plaintiffs claim had been denied, but that each continued to assure plaintiff that defendant would open plaintiffs claim once defendant received the relevant medical records, a reasonable juror could conclude that defendant made active misrepresentations.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">We next consider whether plaintiff could reasonably rely on oral representations made by Baumbach and Sneath that conflicted with the written denial that defendant sent to plaintiff. In <em>Wieber, </em>we held that the plaintiff could reasonably rely on the defendant\u2019s oral interpretations of its own policy concerning a franchise contract that contradicted the written terms of the contract. 231 Or App at 484. Plaintiff here could have reasonably relied on oral representations made by Baumbach and Sneath that implied that defendant was willing to make an exception and open plaintiffs claim, just as the plaintiff in <em>Wieber </em>could reasonably rely on the defendant\u2019s representations that contradicted the written terms of the contract. Here, plaintiff had relied on defendant\u2019s help to successfully complete workers\u2019 compensation claims in the past, and the letter that defendant sent denying plaintiffs claim suggested that defendant would open plaintiffs claim even though defendant did not have to do so. Defendant stated: \u201cWe will review your claim again for possible approval, once we receive medical documentation from your physician.\u201d Consistently with that statement, Baumbach and Sneath repeatedly told plaintiff that his claim would be approved as soon as defendant received plaintiffs medical records.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Finally, defendant\u2019s conduct corroborated the statements that Baumbach and Sneath made. More than 60 days after plaintiffs claim was denied, defendant sent an investigator to interview plaintiff concerning his injuries. Plaintiff could reasonably interpret that conduct as being consistent with defendant\u2019s stated intention to open his claim. We conclude that a reasonable juror could find that plaintiff reasonably relied on defendant\u2019s misrepresentations. Defendant was not entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs fraud claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Accordingly, the trial court erred in granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b453-8\"> Later, defendant opened and accepted defendant\u2019s shoulder claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b454-8\"> Both Baumbach and Sneath kept a diary of their phone conversations with plaintiff. Those diaries are summaries, and not verbatim transcripts of the conversations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b457-10\"> ORS 656.018(7) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-11\">\u201cThe exclusive remedy provisions and limitation on liability provisions of this chapter apply to all injuries and to diseases, symptom complexes or similar conditions of subject workers arising out of and in the course of employment whether or not they are determined to be compensable under this chapter.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
