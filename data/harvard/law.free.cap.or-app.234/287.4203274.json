We write only to address his fourth assignment of error, in which he contends that, because ORS 423.570(6)(b) provides that, \u201c[i]n cases of financial hardship or when otherwise advisable in the interest of the released person\u2019s rehabilitation[,]\u201d the trial court \u201cmay waive or reduce the amount of the fee for any person whom the court has sentenced to probation[,]\u201d the trial court erred in concluding that it lacked legal authority to waive defendant\u2019s enhanced bench probation supervision fee of $15 per month. The state concedes that the trial court erred in that regard. Because we agree that the trial court declined to waive defendant\u2019s fee based on the erroneous legal premise that it lacked authority to do so and that ORS 423.570(6)(b) explicitly confers such authority, we accept the state\u2019s concession. Accordingly, we remand for the trial court to exercise its discretion under ORS 423.570(6)(b). We reject defendant\u2019s other three assignments of error without discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Reversed and remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
