J.</author>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">Petitioner appeals, challenging (1) the trial court\u2019s judgment denying post-conviction relief and (2) the court\u2019s order denying petitioner\u2019s subsequent motion under ORCP 71 B(l) to set aside that judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm, without discussion, the judgment denying post-conviction relief, but, for the reasons that follow, we reverse and remand to the trial court to reconsider petitioner\u2019s ORCP 71 B(l) motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The pertinent circumstances are uncontroverted. On March 27, 2007, the trial court entered its judgment denying post-conviction relief, and petitioner filed a notice of appeal from that judgment on April 18, 2007. On April 26, 2007, petitioner filed his initial motion for relief from judgment under ORCP 71 B, and the trial court entered its order denying that motion on May 15, 2007. Petitioner did not appeal from that order. Finally, on November 28, 2007, petitioner filed his second motion under ORCP 71 B(l) \u2014 that is, the motion that is the subject of the second of these associated appeals. On February 11, 2008, the trial court denied that motion, stating, \u201cThis case is on appeal to the Oregon Court of Appeals. This court has no jurisdiction in this case.\u201d Petitioner appealed from that order on March 5, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Petitioner asserts that the trial court\u2019s February 11, 2008, order was erroneous because the pendency of an appeal from the judgment that is the object of an ORCP 71B motion does not divest the trial court of jurisdiction to grant relief under ORCP 71 B. Petitioner is correct. ORS 19.270(5)(a) specifies that, \u201cNotwithstanding the filing of a notice of appeal, the trial court has jurisdiction * * * [t]o enter an order * * * under ORCP 71.\u201d <em>See also </em>ORCP 71 B(2) (\u201cA motion under sections A or B may be filed with and decided by the trial court during the time an appeal from a judgment is pending before an appellate court.\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>The state does not dispute petitioner\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in its determination that it lacked jurisdiction to consider petitioner\u2019s second ORCP 71 B(l) motion. However, the state asserts that any error in that regard was harmless because petitioner\u2019s appeal from that disposition was somehow untimely. As nearly as we can discern, the state seems to posit that, because petitioner did not timely appeal (and, indeed, never appealed) from the denial of his first ORCP 71 B(l) motion (i.e., the motion petitioner filed on April 26,2007), his appeal from the order denying his second motion must be untimely (notwithstanding that it was filed within 30 days of that disposition). We do not understand how, or why, that would be so in this case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Judgment in A135408 affirmed; order in A138355 reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b447-7\"> Petitioner separately appealed from each of those dispositions. <em>See generally </em>ORAP 8.25(3) (addressing procedure for appeal from \u201can order deciding a motion filed under ORCP 71A or ORCP 71B during the pendency of an appeal\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b447-8\"> Our analysis and disposition obviates consideration of the matters raised in petitioner\u2019s <em>pro se </em>supplemental brief pertaining to the denial of his second motion under ORCP 71 B(l).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b447-9\"> <em>Cf. </em>ORAP 8.25(2) (addressing procedures pertaining to the filing and disposition of a motion for relief from judgment under ORCP 71 during the pendency of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>an appeal, including the appellate court\u2019s determination of whether to hold appeal in abeyance pending the trial court\u2019s disposition of such a motion); ORAP 8.25(3) (addressing procedures for filing a notice of appeal from the trial court\u2019s disposition of such a motion while the predicate appeal is still pending).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b448-8\"> The state\u2019s untimeliness argument aside, we have <em>sua sponte </em>considered whether our affirmance of the judgment denying post-conviction relief renders petitioner\u2019s challenge to the denial of his second ORCP 71 B(l) motion moot. That is, it is at least abstractly possible that in appeals (as contemplated under ORAP 8.25(3)) that challenge both the predicate judgment and the subsequent denial of ORCP 71 B relief, affirmance of the former could render the latter moot if the grounds asserted in support of the motion for relief from judgment were completely encompassed within the arguments advanced in support of the appeal from the judgment. That is not the case here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
