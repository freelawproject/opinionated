On the second-degree assault conviction \u2014 the only conviction at issue in this appeal \u2014 the trial court sentenced defendant to 70 months\u2019 incarceration, followed by 36 months of post-prison supervision. In addition, it ordered defendant to pay restitution not to exceed $40,000. On appeal, defendant challenges the imposition of restitution. The state concedes the error and agrees that, although the claim of error was not preserved, the court should address it as plain error. For the reasons explained below, we agree with and accept the state\u2019s concession. Defendant also raises a number of arguments in a <em>pro se </em>supplemental brief, all of which we reject without discussion. Accordingly, we remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">At sentencing, the prosecutor requested that the court order restitution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-6\">\u201c[T]he victim has sent in paperwork to the State, they have authorized up to $40,000 in treatment. To my knowledge there hasn\u2019t been any actual restitution paid out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-7\">\u201cThe people in the State have asked me to request the Court to order [defendant] to pay any treatment costs that would arise as a result of this offense, not to exceed $40,000. I don\u2019t know what the Court wants to do obviously, it\u2019s been nine months, and there hasn\u2019t been any... at least physical mention . . . physically, medical bills presented, but there may be treatment costs in the future. I don\u2019t know what the Court wants to do about that, I just wanted to tell you that\u2019s where we\u2019re at.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">(Ellipses in original.) The court ordered the requested restitution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-10\">\u201c[T]here will be no costs assessed, there will be a restitution amount . . . restitution requirement set, not to exceed $40,000 as the request by the District Attorney Office, and may as the state agency, I think it is through that body that the amount of the restitution, and the dollar amount is determined. However, I\u2019m making you responsible for that also.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-11\">(Ellipsis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b645-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>ORS 137.106(1) authorizes trial courts to impose restitution only when \u201cthe court finds from the evidence presented that a victim suffered economic damages.\u201d \u201cEconomic damages,\u201d for these purposes, may include \u201creasonably predictable and easily measurable future treatment expenses.\u201d <em>State v. Donahue, </em>165 Or App 143, 146, 995 P2d 1202 (2000). In this case, the state concedes, and we agree, that the record lacks evidence that the victim has incurred or will incur such expenses. Accordingly, we remand for resentencing. <em>See State v. Cufaude, </em>232 Or App 280, 281, 221 P3d 834 (2009) (accepting state\u2019s concession that trial court erred in ordering restitution based on future counseling expenses for the victim and her mother when there was no evidence presented that they would incur those expenses).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">Remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
