ORS 475.864. He is a resident of California and is authorized under the laws of that state to possess and use marijuana for the treatment of \u201ca debilitating conglomeration of symptoms.\u201d At a pretrial hearing, he argued that the officer who arrested him lacked probable cause once defendant established his status as a lawful marijuana user under California law, because Oregon is required by the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution, US Const, Art IV, \u00a7 1, to honor California\u2019s law and permit defendant to possess marijuana in accordance with that state\u2019s laws, and that, by enforcing Oregon law against him, the state violated his right to travel from state to state, guaranteed by the Privileges and Immunities Clause, US Const, Art IV, \u00a7 2. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s pretrial motions, and defendant renews his arguments on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">We rejected identical arguments in <em>State v.
