She assigns error to the trial court\u2019s calculation of child support, to the calculation of her share of husband\u2019s military pension, to the trial court\u2019s failure to require husband to elect a survivor\u2019s annuity, and to the trial court\u2019s allowance of an offset of temporary spousal and child support arrearages. Because we agree with wife that the trial court erred in each respect, on <em>de novo </em>review, ORS 19.415 (2007),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we remand the judgment for entry of a modified judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The facts are largely undisputed. Husband and wife were married in January 1993 and have one child, a son, born in 1997. At the time of trial in August 2006, wife was 34 years old and husband was 36. Husband has been in the Air Force since 1991. He was stationed overseas from August 2003 to August 2004, and when he returned, the parties separated. We will describe other facts later on as they pertain to the issues discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The first issue on appeal concerns the calculation of child support \u2014 specifically, whether husband\u2019s military allowances for housing and food are included in his \u201cgross income\u201d for the purpose of calculating his child support obligation. The \u201cbasic allowance for housing\u201d (BAH) is a monthly sum paid to active duty members of the military who do not reside in government-supplied housing and is intended to offset the cost of civilian housing. 37 USC \u00a7 403(a)(1). The amount varies according to the member\u2019s pay grade, geographic location, and dependency status. <em>Id. </em>The \u201cbasic allowance for sustenance\u201d (BAS) is an additional monthly sum paid to active duty members to subsidize the cost of meals purchased for the benefit of the individual member on or off base. 37 USC \u00a7 402(a)(1). Both allowances are excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes. 26 USC \u00a7 134(a) (\u201cGross income shall not include any qualified military benefit.\u201d). Together, husband\u2019s BAH and BAS come to about $1,275 per month, and that amount is included in his semi-monthly paychecks.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>The trial court ruled that, because husband\u2019s BAH and BAS are excluded from income for federal income tax purposes, they do not constitute income for purposes of calculating child support. On appeal, wife contends that, although the BAH and BAS are not subject to federal income taxation, they are nonetheless part of husband\u2019s \u201cgross income,\u201d as that term is defined in the Child Support Guidelines, OAR 137-050-0340. Husband contends that the guidelines unambiguously exclude those allowances from gross income.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">ORS 107.105(l)(c) is the source of the trial court\u2019s authority to make provision in the dissolution judgment \u201cfor the support of the children of the marriage by the parties.\u201d The trial court is required to calculate the amount of support by using the formula established pursuant to ORS 25.275. ORS 107.105(l)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">ORS 25.275 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-6\">\u201c(1) The Division of Child Support of the Department of Justice shall establish by rule a formula for determining child support awards in any judicial or administrative proceeding. In establishing the formula, the division shall take into consideration the following criteria:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-7\">\u201c(a) All earnings, income and resources of each parent, including real and personal property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-8\">^ \u2021 \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-9\">\u201c(2) The formula described in subsection (1) of this section must also comply with the following standards:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-10\">\u201c(a) The child is entitled to benefit from the income of both parents to the same extent that the child would have benefited had the family unit remained intact or if there had been an intact family unit consisting of both parents and the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-11\">\u201c(b) Both parents should share in the costs of supporting the child in the same proportion as each parent\u2019s income bears to the combined income of both parents.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">The Oregon Department of Justice has, in turn, developed a formula for the calculation of child support, and that formula is set forth in the Oregon Child Support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Guidelines, OAR 137-050-0320 to 137-050-0490. OAR 137-050-0320(5) provides that a parent\u2019s \u201cbasic child support obligation\u201d is determined by \u201capplying the parent\u2019s adjusted gross income * * * to the scale in the manner set out in OAR 137-050-0490.\u201d Under OAR 137-050-0320(8), \u201cgross income\u201d means \u201cthe income of the parent calculated pursuant to OAR 137-050-0340, 137-050-0350 [relating to self-employment,] and 137-050-0360 [income presumptions in special circumstances].\u201d OAR 137-050-0340(1) states that \u201cgross income\u201d includes</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-4\">\u201cincome from any source including, but not limited to, salaries, wages, commissions, advances, bonuses, dividends, severance pay, pensions, interest, honoraria, trust income, annuities, return on capital, Social Security benefits, workers\u2019 compensation benefits, unemployment insurance benefits, disability insurance benefits, gifts, prizes, including lottery winnings, and alimony or separate maintenance received.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Gross income also includes \u201c[e]xpense reimbursements or in kind payments received by a parent in the course of employment, self employment, or operation of a business * * * if they are significant and reduce personal living expenses.\u201d OAR 137-050-0340(2). The question on appeal is whether father\u2019s BAH and BAS are part of his \u201cgross income\u201d for purposes of child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">In construing the child support guidelines, our role is to determine the intent of the enacting body by looking first to the text and context of the rule. <em>Perlenfein and Perlenfein, </em>316 Or 16, 20, 848 P2d 604 (1993). We note, initially, that the texts of OAR 137-050-0320(8) and OAR 137-050-0340(1) do not define \u201cgross income\u201d in terms of taxable income. Nor do they cross-reference the Internal Revenue Code\u2019s definitions of \u201cgross income\u201d or \u201cadjusted gross income.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rather, OAR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>137-050-0340(1) sets forth a nonexclusive list of sources that make up \u201cincome from any source.\u201d We note, further, that some of the listed sources, such as Social Security and disability benefits, are potentially not taxable. <em>See </em>26 USC \u00a7 86; 26 USC \u00a7 105. In at least one case, we have held that earned income that is not subject to federal income tax should nonetheless be treated as part of \u201cgross income\u201d in the child support calculation. <em>See Halpert and Leonard, </em>157 Or App 276, 970 P2d 253 (1998) (husband\u2019s nontaxable voluntary contributions to a 401(k) retirement account are part of his gross income under OAR 137-050-0340(1)). Contrary to the trial court\u2019s reasoning, we conclude that \u201cgross income\u201d as defined in OAR 137-050-0340 is not limited to taxable income; rather, as the rule explicitly provides, it includes \u201cincome from any source,\u201d if it is available for support of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>Our conclusion is consistent with the policies underlying the child support guidelines. ORS 25.275(l)(a) provides that the formula for calculating child support awards \u201cshall take into consideration * * * [a]ll earnings, income and resources of each parent[.]\u201d ORS 25.275(2)(a) provides that the formula must ensure that the child benefits from the income \u201cof both parents to the same extent that the child would have benefited had the family unit remained intact.\u201d <em>See Nieth and Nieth, </em>199 Or App 330, 338, 111 P3d 746, <em>adh\u2019d to as clarified on recons, </em>200 Or App 582, 116 P3d 234 (2005) (a child support award is \u201can attempt to simulate the economic benefits that the child would enjoy had the family remained intact\u201d); <em>Peterson and Peterson, </em>132 Or App 190, 201, 888 P2d 23 (1994) (\u201cORS 25.270(4) expresses a policy that child support awards be based on economic factors that address the needs of the dependent children.\u201d). In furtherance of those policies, we conclude that sources of income that are available to the parents \u2014 whether or not they are taxable \u2014 should be considered in determining the parent\u2019s child support obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">We further conclude that husband\u2019s BAH and BAS fall within the broad category of \u201cincome from any source.\u201d Those allowances are paid to husband in his semi-monthly paychecks and are available to him to spend as he desires. There is no reason why they should not be considered income for purposes of calculating husband\u2019s support obligation. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court erred in excluding husband\u2019s BAH and BAS from his gross income.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">We next address wife\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in its calculation of her share of husband\u2019s military pension. As a member of the military, husband will be entitled to a military pension after 20 years of service. At the time of trial, husband had served 15 years and two months. He testified that he had recently reenlisted and that his reenlistment was scheduled to take him past 20 years of service. After 20 years of service, husband\u2019s pension amount will be determined by a formula that uses husband\u2019s three highest years of pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\"> The Uniformed Services Former Spouses\u2019 Protection Act (FSPA), 10 USC \u00a7 1408, authorizes state courts to treat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>\u201cdisposable retired pay\u201d as divisible property for purposes of state dissolution laws. State law applies in determining the treatment of a military pension.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In Oregon, pensions, including military pensions, are personal property and, pursuant to ORS 107.105,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the \u201cmarital asset\u201d portion of a pension (that is, the portion that accumulated during the marriage) is subject to division when a marriage is dissolved. <em>Campbell and Campbell, </em>151 Or App 334, 337-38, 948 P2d 765 (1997); <em>Manners and Manners, </em>68 Or App 896, 899, 683 P2d 134 (1984). Generally, a spouse is entitled to one-half of that portion of a pension that was accumulated during the marriage. <em>See Valley and Valley, </em>97 Or App 95, 98, 775 P2d 332, <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>99 Or App 252, 781 P2d 1219 (1989), <em>rev den, </em>309 Or App 522, <em>cert den, </em>498 US 920 (1990); <em>Manners, </em>68 Or App at 899.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">In this case, at the time of dissolution in August 2006, husband had served 15 years and two months, two years of which had occurred before the marriage, and he had not yet retired. Including the year that husband was overseas, the parties lived separately for the last three years of the marriage. In determining the \u201cmarital asset\u201d portion of the pension, the trial court included the period between the date that the parties married \u2014 January 1993 \u2014 and September 1,2003, the date that the trial court concluded the parties had separated. The court explained in its oral ruling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>that it did not think that wife should share in the portion of husband\u2019s pension that had accrued during the years when the two were not living together but before they were divorced.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Because husband has not yet retired, the court chose a \u201chypothetical\u201d retirement date (September 1, 2003) for purposes of determining the size of the entire pension. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\">\u201cHusband makes a strong argument that Wife should not share in post-separation promotions, cost-of-living, and pay increases when it comes to determining what percentage she should receive once Husband retires. The parties are still young and retirement is a long way off for both of them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The judgment then awarded wife 20 percent \u201cof the disposable retired pay [that husband] would have received had he retired on September 1, 2003, with 12 years of creditable service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">On appeal, wife asserts that the trial court\u2019s division of the pension was incorrect in several respects: (1) in determining the \u201cmarital asset\u201d portion of the pension, the court should have used the date of dissolution rather than the date of separation; (2) in determining the total pension, the court should have used husband\u2019s actual years of service, to be determined at the time of his actual retirement, rather than a \u201chypothetical\u201d retirement date of September 1, 2003; and (3) the court should have awarded wife 50 percent of the marital asset portion of the pension. Additionally, wife contends that the court should have required husband to purchase a survivor annuity so that, in the event that husband predeceases her, she will continue to receive the equivalent of her share of husband\u2019s pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">We first address the second of wife\u2019s arguments\u2014 that, in determining the total pension to be divided, the trial court erred in using a \u201chypothetical\u201d retirement date of September 1, 2003, which the court deemed to be the date of separation. Husband\u2019s pension is in the nature of a defined benefit plan, and it has not yet matured, because husband will not be entitled to retirement benefits until he has accumulated 20 years of creditable military service. We agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>with wife that, under Oregon law, the marital portion of husband\u2019s pension must be calculated as a fraction <em>of the entire actual pension, </em>rather than as a fraction of a hypothetical pension amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">The \u201ctime\u201d rule is typically used to calculate the marital portion of benefits under a defined benefit retirement plan. <em>Kiser and Kiser, </em>176 Or App 627, 632 n 1, 32 P3d 244 (2001). Under that rule, the marital portion is determined by multiplying the total actual pension benefit by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of years (or months) of service during the marriage and the denominator of which is the total years (or months) of employment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">In <em>Kiser, </em>the husband was a federal civil service employee who had not yet retired, and he sought to base the wife\u2019s share of his pension on the monthly payout that he would have received had he retired on the date of dissolution. We rejected that approach, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\">\u201cWe have repeatedly emphasized that, when retirement benefits have not matured and are thus not presently liquid, it is equitable to look to the value of the benefit at retirement, because \u2018it is not proper to assume, for purposes of computing the value of these rights, that husband would immediately leave public service and * * * ignore the vested pension benefits.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">176 Or App at 631 (quoting <em>Minnis and Minnis, </em>54 Or App 70, 75, 634 P2d 259 (1981)). Thus, we held, the wife\u2019s interest in the pension was to be based on the total pension benefit as of the date of retirement, determined either by way of an actuarial present value or through a division of benefits as they are distributed. 176 Or App at 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">The same rationale applies here. Although husband\u2019s pension is not yet vested, he testified that he plans to stay in the military long enough to qualify for a pension. Because a preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that husband plans to retire after 20 years of service in the Air Force, it is not proper to assume that husband will retire as of the date the parties separated or divorced. Rather, the appropriate measure of the total pension benefit is the value of husband\u2019s pension as of the date of his actual retirement, determined either by way of the actuarial present value or as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>the benefits are distributed at the time of retirement. The trial court erred in using a hypothetical retirement date based on the date of separation in determining the total value of the pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">We next address wife\u2019s contention that the court should have used the date of dissolution, rather than the date of separation, in determining the marital asset portion of the pension. Under Oregon law, property acquired during the marriage is a marital asset to which a rebuttable presumption of equal contribution applies. <em>Kunze and Kunze, </em>337 Or 122, 133, 92 P3d 100 (2004). Even property acquired after separation but before dissolution is considered to be a marital asset to which the presumption applies. <em>Follansbee and Ackerman, </em>115 Or App 39, 44, 836 P2d 763 (1992). Thus, wife is correct that the marital asset portion of the pension is that portion that accrued from the date of the marriage to the date of dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The next question, then, is whether husband has rebutted the presumption of equal contribution with respect to any of that time. <em>Id. </em>at 134. The trial court determined, essentially, that wife did not make any contribution to accumulation of the pension after husband went overseas. The relevant testimony is as follows. Wife testified that the parties had not been getting along and that she viewed husband\u2019s time overseas as a trial separation. Husband did not dispute that the marriage was troubled, but he did not consider the time overseas to be a trial separation; he hoped that the parties would work out their difficulties and stay together. Wife testified that she realized during the time that husband was gone that she did not miss him. She testified that she made her decision then to seek a divorce when he returned. The day that husband returned from overseas, wife told him of her intention to file for divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The trial court determined, essentially, that wife made no contribution to the pension while the parties were living apart. On <em>de novo </em>review, we agree that husband has rebutted the presumption of equal contribution with respect to that portion of the pension attributable to the two-year period of separation after husband returned from overseas. It was at that time that the parties formally separated.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>However, we disagree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion with respect to the year that husband was overseas. Although the parties were not living together during that time, they were still functioning as a marital unit. <em>Compare Richardson and Richardson, </em>307 Or 370, 377, 769 P2d 179 (1989) (that portion of the present value of a pension that is attributable to the husband\u2019s post-separation employment, during which time the parties were no longer living as a marital unit, is an individually acquired asset with respect to which the statutory presumption of equal contribution is rebutted). While husband was overseas, wife worked full-time and contributed her income to the household expenses. She remained in and maintained the family home and cared for the parties\u2019 then-five-year-old son.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">The trial court found that wife spent too much money while husband was gone \u2014 and, indeed, wife incurred a significant debt during that period of time. Nonetheless, we conclude that, during that year, the marital unit was intact and that husband has failed to rebut the presumption that wife contributed equally to the acquisition of the pension, by maintaining the household, working full-time, and caring for the parties\u2019 child. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court erred in using August 2003 as the ending date for the acquisition of the marital portion of the pension. The marital portion of the pension is that portion attributable to the years between the date the parties married and the parties\u2019 separation in August 2004, when husband returned from overseas. On remand, the trial court should determine the marital portion of the total pension benefit by multiplying the pension value as of the date of retirement by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total months of service from the date of marriage until the parties separated in August 2004, and the denominator of which is the total months of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">We also conclude that the trial court erred in awarding wife only 20 percent of the marital portion of the pension instead of 50 percent, which would reflect her equal contribution. Husband presented no evidence that wife is not entitled to an equal share of that portion of the pension that accrued during the time when the parties were functioning as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>a marital unit. <em>See Kunze, </em>337 Or at 134 (\u201cWhen the statutory presumption is not rebutted, this court has determined that, absent other considerations, the just and proper\u2019 division of the marital assets is an equal division between the parties.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">In her final argument with respect to the property division, wife contends that the trial court erred in failing to require husband to purchase an annuity under the military Survivor Benefit Plan, 10 USC \u00a7\u00a7 1447-1455, and to designate her as an irrevocable beneficiary. Military retirees may participate in the Survivor Benefit Plan, through which an annuity may be purchased to award to a surviving spouse, former spouse, or child up to 55 percent of the retiree\u2019s retirement benefit. The cost of participation is withheld from the member\u2019s monthly retirement pay. 10 USC \u00a7 1452. An eligible participant may elect to name a former spouse as the beneficiary. 10 USC \u00a7 1448(b)(2), (3). Federal law also allows state courts to order military service members to participate in the Survivor Benefit Plan when they retire and to designate a former spouse as beneficiary. 10 USC \u00a7 1450(f)(3)(B)(ii) (a military spouse is required to make an election to provide an annuity to a former spouse if required by court order); 10 USC \u00a7 1450(f)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The trial court declined to require husband to purchase an annuity for wife under the Survivor Benefit Plan <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Wife contends that her interest in husband\u2019s retirement plan, which would terminate with his death, should be protected in the event that he predeceases her. Wife is correct that we have previously identified that rationale as the basis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>requiring a retired spouse to designate the other spouse as a beneficiary of a survivor annuity. In concluding in <em>Kiser </em>that the wife was entitled to the survivor benefit on the husband\u2019s federal pension plan, we reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-4\">\u201cHusband * * * receivfed] the benefit of wife\u2019s contribution as a wife, mother, and homemaker for 30 years of the marriage, during which time the benefits that would be subject to the survivor annuity accrued. Wife is therefore entitled to not only the income provided by those retirement benefits but also the security of access to that income throughout her retirement. Husband is assured that security by virtue of his participation in the plan, and, were the parties to remain married, wife would be entitled to survivor benefits automatically. Wife is therefore entitled to the maximum former spouse survivor benefit under husband\u2019s [retirement] plan, and the cost of that annuity is to be split equally between the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-5\"><em>Kiser, </em>176 Or App at 633. Wife contends that, similarly here, because she is entitled to an equal share of the marital portion of husband\u2019s military pension, it is just and proper that husband be required to designate her as the beneficiary of the Survivor Benefit Plan so that, in the event that husband predeceases her, she will continue to receive the equivalent of her share of the marital portion of the pension. Husband contends that this case is distinguishable from <em>Kiser, </em>because the parties in <em>Kiser </em>had been married for 30 years, during the entire period of the husband\u2019s employment. Here, in contrast, the parties were married only 13 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">That factual distinction notwithstanding, we agree with wife that, in view of the fact that wife is entitled to a share of the marital portion of husband\u2019s retirement benefits, and because those benefits would terminate if husband were to predecease her, it is appropriate that wife\u2019s interest be protected by the provision of survivor benefits in an amount sufficient to cover wife\u2019s share of the marital portion of the pension, with the parties to share equally in the cost of the annuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Finally, wife contends that the trial court erred in determining that husband satisfied any pretrial child and spousal support arrearages by paying down the parties\u2019 credit card debt. It is not disputed that, in September 2005, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>the trial court entered a limited judgment requiring husband to pay temporary child and spousal support retroactive to May 1, 2005, and that, at the time of trial, husband had accrued arrearages in temporary support of approximately $9,000, an amount approximately equal to the parties\u2019 credit card debt. During that same time, husband also had made overpayments in interim support, which the trial court awarded to him by way of a supplemental judgment. In determining that husband did not have to pay the support arrearage, the trial court explained, \u201cThere is no interim spousal support arrearage or interest owing on those sums, due to [husband\u2019s] payments on credit card debts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Wife contends that the trial court lacked authority to \u201cforgive\u201d husband his past-due support obligation. <em>See Warren and Warren, </em>31 Or App 213, 218, 570 P2d 104 (1977) (under <em>former </em>ORS 107.095(2), each payment under a temporary support order that was not paid by its due date became a judgment and could not be cancelled); <em>see also Alls and Alls, </em>137 Or App 32, 34, 902 P2d 1204 (1995) (the trial court lacks authority to \u201cforgive\u201d an unpaid accrued support obligation); <em>accord Goertel and Goertel, </em>209 Or App 585, 588, 149 P3d 247 (2006); <em>Binnell and Binnell, </em>153 Or App 204, 208, 956 P2d 1003 (1998). Husband contends that the trial court\u2019s ruling did not, in effect, forgive his past due obligation, but rather treated the delinquency as having been satisfied by his payment of the parties\u2019 credit card bills. We agree with husband that that appears to have been the trial court\u2019s rationale, but reject the conclusion that husband\u2019s payment of the parties\u2019 joint debt could be credited against his temporary support obligation as set forth in the limited judgment. The temporary support in this case was awarded to provide wife with assistance in meeting her monthly expenses during the pendency of the dissolution proceeding. Husband\u2019s arrearage cannot be adjusted for his payment of the parties\u2019joint debt. <em>Crump and Crump, </em>138 Or App 362, 370, 908 P2d 839 (1995) (arrearage award for unpaid temporary spousal support could not be reduced to reflect husband\u2019s voluntary payment of wife\u2019s share of house payments); <em>see Alls, </em>137 Or App at 34 <em>(\u201cThependente lite </em>[temporary support] order was not a division of property. It was to provide assistance to wife and the parties\u2019 child while the dissolution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>was proceeding.\u201d). We therefore conclude that the trial court erred in crediting husband\u2019s delinquent temporary support obligation by the amounts paid toward the parties\u2019 debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">Reversed and remanded (1) for recalculation of husband\u2019s child support obligation, taking into consideration husband\u2019s military allowances for housing and food; (2) for recalculation of wife\u2019s share of husband\u2019s military pension; (3) for recalculation of husband\u2019s arrearage in temporary child and spousal support; and (4) to require the election of a survivor annuity for wife; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b622-7\"> The notice of appeal in this case was filed before the effective date (June 4, 2009) of the 2009 amendments to ORS 19.415.
