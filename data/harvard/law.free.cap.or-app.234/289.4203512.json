He contends, in part, that the evidence did not establish that petitioner had, in fact, been \u201cthe victim of abuse committed by the respondent within 180 days preceding the filing of the petition[.]\u201d ORS 107.718(1); <em>see also </em>ORS 107.710(1). On <em>de novo </em>review, <em>see Rosiles-Flores v. Browning, </em>208 Or App 600, 603, 145 P3d 328 (2006); <em>Strother and Strother, </em>130 Or App 624, 629, 883 P2d 249 (1994), <em>rev den, </em>320 Or 508 (1995), we agree with respondent that the proof was deficient in, at least, that respect.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">A description of the underlying circumstances of this domestic dispute, and of the parties\u2019 proof, would be of no benefit to the bench, the bar, or the public. Indeed, in this context, we cannot improve on the observations of the late Chief Judge Herbert Schwab:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">\u201cThe incidents which give rise to child custody litigation are never pleasant, and often sordid. Such litigation tends to emphasize human weaknesses. While the published opinion of an appellate court in a custody case is rarely a \u2018best seller,\u2019 it is nevertheless a public record which can in later years come to the attention of the children who were the subject of the controversy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-7\"><em>Sarty v. Forney, </em>12 Or App 251, 253, 506 P2d 535 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">It suffices to say that, even giving due regard to the trial court\u2019s assessments of credibility, we cannot find by a preponderance of the evidence, ORS 107.710(2), that respondent did, in fact, commit abuse, as defined in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>ORS 107.705(1),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> against petitioner within 180 days preceding the filing of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b328-9\"> The notice of appeal in this case was filed before the effective date (June 4, 2009) of the 2009 amendments to ORS 19.415. Accordingly, the provisions of ORS 19.415(3)(b) do not apply to our review of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b329-5\"> \u201cAbuse,\u201d as defined in ORS 107.705(1), means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-6\">\u201c[T]he occurrence of one or more of the following acts between family or household members:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">\u201c(a) Attempting to cause or intentionally, knowingly or recklessly causing bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-8\">\u201c(b) Intentionally, knowingly or recklessly placing another in fear of imminent bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-9\">\u201c(c) Causing another to engage in involuntary sexual relations by force or threat of force.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
