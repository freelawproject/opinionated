The case went to trial, and the jury returned a verdict for the defendant School Board. On appeal, Kozlowski raises various challenges to the court\u2019s jury instructions, two challenges to the court\u2019s evidentiary rulings, and an additional challenge to the court\u2019s failure to sequester Pearson from the trial. After review, we conclude that the district court erred by excluding evidence of prior similar acts of age discrimination by Pearson, by admitting evidence of Kozlowski\u2019s prior DUI arrests, and by refusing to sequester Pearson, a main defense fact witness. The court also erred by failing to instruct the jury that it could infer discrimination if it did not believe the proffered reasons for the non-renewal. Any one of these errors standing alone may have been harmless; considered collectively, however, the errors were substantially prejudicial to Kozlowski\u2019s case. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-17\">The plaintiff, Dennis Kozlowski, worked at Bethel High School from 1968 to 2000. At various times during his tenure at Bethel, Kozlowski served as an English instructor, track coach, football coach, interim basketball coach, and athletic director. Starting in 1974, Kozlowski served as the head football coach. During his football <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>coaching career, his teams won three state championships and a number of other honors. Kozlowski was employed as football coach at Bethel by the Hampton City School Board under one-year contracts that were annually renewed by the Board. While the Board took the formal action to renew contracts, the Board had delegated its authority over contract renewal to the local school administrators, here the Bethel High School principal, and accepted as a matter of course the principal\u2019s recommendations regarding renewal.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">In the fall of 1993, William Pearson became the new principal at Bethel High School. Pearson had previously served as a teacher and assistant principal at various schools in the area, and during these years had been actively involved in the schools\u2019 athletic programs, coaching a number of sports including football. He testified that he was \u201cvery involved in every athletic endeavor\u201d at Bethel from the day he was hired. Pearson paid very close attention to the football program, attending almost every game and scrimmage and also attending practice once or twice a week for the whole season.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">In December of 1998, Pearson recommended another candidate, Tracy Parker, to the Board for head football coach. The Board followed Pearson\u2019s recommendation, and Kozlowski\u2019s coaching contract was not renewed for the following year. Kozlowski\u2019s teaching and athletic director contracts were renewed, however, and he held those positions until his retirement the following year. At the time of the non-renewal, Pearson and Kozlowski were both fifty-four years old. Parker, Kozlowski\u2019s replacement, was under forty years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Pearson met with Kozlowski on December 4, 1998, to discuss his plans to replace Kozlowski as head coach. Both sides agree that a number of reasons for non-renewal were discussed at this meeting, including Kozlowski\u2019s use of an ineligible player, his failure to attend a coaches\u2019 All-District meeting, and Pearson\u2019s dissatisfaction with the overall direction of the football program. According to Kozlowski, Pearson also told him that \u201cI want a younger coach.... I need new blood in it. I want people who can communicate with the kids better.\u201d Pearson denies saying anything to Kozlowski about his age. On December 10, Pearson prepared a memo to Kozlowski informing him of Pearson\u2019s final decision not to renew his contract. In this memo, Pearson provided the following reasons for non-renewal: \u201cOver the past two years, I have observed many instances of poor handling of football players, player distractions, and overall team dissension and dysfunction which probably contributed to the level of play on the field....\u201d He also mentioned the ineligible player and missing the district coaches\u2019 meeting. The letter does not mention Kozlowski\u2019s age.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">Kozlowski responded by writing a letter dated January 5, 1999, in which he tried to address the issues raised by Pearson. Pearson denies receiving this letter. In January of 1999, Kozlowski wrote to the superintendent of the Hampton City Schools about Pearson\u2019s recommendation. The Board then met with Kozlowski in a closed session in February of 1999, where Kozlowski was represented by counsel and was given the opportunity to present his case. Pearson wrote a letter to the School Board chairman in March of 1999 detailing the reasons for the non-renewal recommendation. The Board ultimately decided to accept Pearson\u2019s recommendation, as was their usual practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">Kozlowski filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) alleging age discrimination, and the EEOC issued Kozlowski a right-to-sue letter. Kozlowski then brought the cur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>rent age discrimination suit under the ADEA. The parties consented to try the case before Magistrate Judge James E. Bradberry, and the case went to trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The jury returned a verdict for the defendant School Board. Kozlowski now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">At trial, plaintiffs counsel proffered various jury instructions, some of which were accepted, with modifications, by the district court. In addition to a general age discrimination instruction, the plaintiff proffered a pretext instruction modeled after the burden-shifting scheme established in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), and a mixed-motive instruction modeled after the standard established in <em>Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, </em>490 U.S. 228, 109 S.Ct. 1775, 104 L.Ed.2d 268 (1989). On appeal, the plaintiff objects to various aspects of the final jury instructions. Specifically, the plaintiff appeals (1) the court\u2019s failure to provide one of the requested mixed-motive instructions; (2) the court\u2019s insertion of \u201cbecause of age\u201d into the <em>McDonnell Douglas prima fade </em>case; (3) the court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury that it could infer age discrimination from the falsity of the defendant\u2019s proffered reasons; and (4) the court\u2019s insertion of the term \u201csolely\u201d into the phrase \u201cbecause of age.\u201d The plaintiff also appeals two evidentiary rulings. First, the plaintiff appeals the district court\u2019s exclusion of evidence proffered by the plaintiff of prior similar alleged acts of age discrimination. Second, the plaintiff appeals the district court\u2019s admission of evidence related to Kozlowski\u2019s past arrests for driving under the influence of alcohol. Finally, the plaintiff appeals the district court\u2019s refusal to sequester Pearson, a primary defense witness, from the trial proceedings. We first address the plaintiff\u2019s various challenges to the jury instructions, and then take up his evidentiary and sequestration claims. After we address each ground for appeal separately, we will address whether the errors taken as a whole warrant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">As noted above, the plaintiff raises four challenges to the court\u2019s jury instructions. At trial the plaintiff objected to the court\u2019s rulings on the first three of these issues, but failed to object to the fourth ground for appeal, the court\u2019s use of the term \u201csolely.\u201d We will first discuss the three non-forfeited instructional issues and then turn to the forfeited error.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">We review a district court\u2019s refusal to give a requested instruction for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Abbas, </em>74 F.3d 506, 513 (4th Cir.1996). As for challenges to the content of an instruction, the test \u201cis simply the practical one of whether the instructions construed as a whole, and in light of the whole record, adequately informed the jury of the controlling legal principles without misleading or confusing the jury to the prejudice of the objecting party.\u201d <em>Spell v. McDaniel, </em>824 F.2d 1380, 1395 (4th Cir.1987). A court has \u201cconsiderable discretion in choosing the specific wording of instructions.\u201d <em>United States v. Piche, </em>981 F.2d 706, 712 (4th Cir.1992). \u201cEven if instructions are flawed, there can be no reversal unless the error seriously prejudiced the challenging party\u2019s case.\u201d <em>S. Atl. Ltd. P\u2019ship of Tenn. v. Riese, </em>284 F.3d 518, 530 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-12\">The plaintiff\u2019s non-forfeited challenges to the jury instructions are: (1) the court\u2019s refusal to give a requested mixed-motive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>instruction; (2) the court\u2019s modification of the <em>prima facie </em>case instruction to include \u201cbecause of age;\u201d and (3) the court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury that it could infer discrimination from its disbelief of the defendant\u2019s proffered legitimate reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">In order to place these objections in context, we must first set out briefly the legal frameworks governing age discrimination cases. There are two methods by which a plaintiff may prevail in an age discrimination case. Under the first method, the mixed-motive framework, the plaintiff must prove that age played a substantial motivating role in the defendant\u2019s decision. <em>See Fuller v. Phipps, </em>67 F.3d 1137, 1142 (4th Cir.1995) <em>(citing Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, </em>490 U.S. 228, 277, 109 S.Ct. 1775, 104 L.Ed.2d 268 (1989) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring)), <em>abrogated on other grounds, Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa, </em>539 U.S.-, 123 S.Ct. 2148, 156 L.Ed.2d 84 (2003). If the plaintiff makes this showing, then the burden of persuasion shifts to the defendant to prove that it would have taken the same action even absent any consideration of age. <em>Id. </em>at 1141-42 <em>(citing Price Waterhouse, </em>490 U.S. at 258, 259-60, 276, 109 S.Ct. 1775).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Alternatively, the plaintiff may proceed under the pretext framework established in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). Under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework, the plaintiff must first prove four elements to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-8\">(1) that she is a member of a protected class; (2) that she suffered an adverse employment action; (3) that at the time of the adverse employment action she was performing at a level that met her employer\u2019s legitimate job expectations; and (4) that the position remained open to or was filled by similarly qualified applicants outside the protected class.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-9\"><em>Brinkley v. Harbour Recreation Club, </em>180 F.3d 598, 607 (4th Cir.1999). If the plaintiff proves these four elements, she has established a presumption of discrimination. <em>Id. </em>The defendant can rebut this presumption by producing evidence of a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its actions. <em>Id. </em>If the defendant meets this burden, then the presumption disappears and the plaintiff bears the ultimate burden of proving discrimination. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">In the past, the plaintiff qualified for the mixed-motive framework, which has been called \u201cmore advantageous\u201d to the plaintiff because she has the opportunity to shift the burden of persuasion to the defendant, only when she presented \u201cdirect evidence\u201d of discrimination. <em>See Fuller, </em>67 F.3d at 1141-42. In a recent decision, <em>Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa, </em>539 U.S.-, 123 S.Ct. 2148, 156 L.Ed.2d 84 (2003), the Supreme Court eliminated this \u201cdirect evidence\u201d requirement in Title VII cases, holding that in order to qualify for a mixed-motive instruction, \u201ca plaintiff need only present sufficient evidence [be it direct or circumstantial] for a reasonable jury to conclude, by a preponderance of the evidence, that \u2018race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor for any employment practice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2155 (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(m)).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-12\">In this case we are not asked to address\u2014and do not address\u2014whether <em>Desert Palace, </em>a Title VII case, also applies to age discrimination cases under the ADEA. As we conclude below, the plaintiff received the benefit of the more advantageous mixed-motive instruction in this case. Accordingly, the court\u2019s instruction satisfied <em>Desert Palace </em>even if that decision applies to the ADEA. With this in mind, we now turn to the plaintiffs objections to the court\u2019s jury charge on these two frameworks.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>l.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The plaintiff first argues that the district court erred by refusing to provide a requested mixed-motive instruction, and thereby deprived him of the benefit of the more advantageous mixed-motive proof scheme established in Price <em>Waterhouse. </em>The plaintiff requested two instructions related to a mixed-motive theory of the case. First, the plaintiff requested an instruction stating that if the plaintiff proves that age was a substantial motivating factor in Pearson\u2019s decision not to renew KozlowsM\u2019s contract, then the burden of persuasion shifts to the defendant to show that it would have made the same decision even absent discriminatory animus. The court provided this instruction. Thus, contrary to the plaintiffs assertion, it is clear that he did receive the benefit of a mixed-motive instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Second, the plaintiff requested, but the court refused to provide, an instruction on \u201cdirect evidence\u201d of discrimination. This instruction attempted to identify for the jury the specific types of evidence that constituted \u201cdirect evidence.\u201d This second instruction was unnecessary and would have added confusion to an already complicated instruction. The court did give the instruction\u2014standard in all cases\u2014 that \u201cthe law makes no distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence but simply requires that the jury find from the facts in accordance with the preponderance of all the evidence in a case, both direct and circumstantial.\u201d The instruction as a whole conveyed the correct impression that the jury needed to determine, considering both direct and circumstantial evidence, whether the Board failed to renew Kozlowski\u2019s contract because of age. The court properly refused to give the plaintiff\u2019s second requested instruction, and the plaintiffs objections in this regard are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">Apart from these mixed-motive instructions, the plaintiff proposed a series of three jury instructions based on the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>pretext framework, and the plaintiffs second objection arises in this portion of the instruction. The first proposed instruction stated that the plaintiff had an \u201cinitial burden of proof\u2019 to establish, \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence,\u201d that he was a member of the protected class, that the Board failed to renew his coaching contract, that he was qualified for his job at the time, and that the Board replaced him with a substantially younger coach. The second instruction explained that the burden then shifts to the Board to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the non-renewal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The third instruction stated that if the Board met this burden, the plaintiff had to introduce evidence that the Board\u2019s purported reasons were pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">Over the objection of the plaintiff, the district court modified the first instruction\u2014relating to the <em>prima facie </em>case\u2014to the effect that Kozlowski had to present evidence not only that the Board failed to renew his coaching contract, but that the Board failed to renew it \u201cbecause of plaintiffs age.\u201d The court\u2019s modification resulted in an incorrect statement of the <em>prima facie </em>case under <em>McDonnell Douglas. Cf. Brinkley, </em>180 F.3d at 607 (listing the four elements of the <em>prima facie </em>case). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>The modified instruction injected the ultimate factual question in an ADEA case\u2014 whether the adverse employment action was because of age\u2014into the <em>prima facie </em>case. We agree with Kozlowski that the court misstated the elements of the plaintiffs <em>prima facie </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">To assess the impact of this misstatement of the <em>prima facie </em>case, however, we must first consider the function of the <em>prima facie </em>case in the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>pretext framework. In this framework, the <em>prima facie </em>case serves two functions in the ordering of evidence and burdens. First, the <em>prima facie </em>case serves as a hurdle to the plaintiff, albeit a low one. This effect is seen both at the summary judgment stage and at trial. At summary judgment, if the plaintiff has failed to produce evidence from which a reasonable fact-finder could find the existence of the four elements of the <em>prima facie </em>case, then the court will award judgment to the defendant. See <em>Mitchell v. Data General Corp., </em>12 F.3d 1310, 1316 (4th Cir.1993), <em>modified on other grounds, Stokes v. Westinghouse Savannah River Co., </em>206 F.3d 420, 429-30 (4th Cir.2000). Even if the plaintiff has survived summary judgment by presenting evidence that <em>could </em>lead a fact-finder to find the existence of all four factors, at trial the plaintiff must actually persuade the fact-finder, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the four elements of the <em>prima facie </em>case are present. <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 510 n. 3, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993). If the jury does not credit the plaintiffs evidence relating to the <em>prima facie </em>case and finds that one or more of the four elements is unproven, then its verdict must be for the defendant regardless of the defendant\u2019s ability to present evidence of a legitimate, non discriminatory reason for its actions. <em>Id.; Gafford v. General Elec. Co., </em>997 F.2d 150, 168 (6th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">The second function of the <em>prima facie </em>case is to create a presumption of discrimination, albeit one that is usually easy to overcome. Once the plaintiff proves the elements of the <em>prima facie </em>case (either at summary judgment or at trial), discrimination is presumed unless the defendant can present evidence of a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its actions. <em>St. Mary\u2019s, </em>509 U.S. at 509, 113 S.Ct. 2742. Importantly, the defendant\u2019s burden here is merely one of production, not persuasion. To overcome the presumption of discrimination, the defendant is not required to <em>prove </em>that it had a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its actions, but simply to present evidence from which a reasonable fact-finder could conclude that the defendant acted based on a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason. <em>See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 142, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000). If the defendant fails to meet this burden of production by \u201cfailing] to introduce evidence which, <em>taken as true, </em>would <em>permit </em>the conclusion that there was a nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action,\u201d then the plaintiff is entitled to judgment simply by proving the <em>prima facie </em>case. <em>St. Mary\u2019s, </em>509 U.S. at 509, 113 S.Ct. 2742.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Because the defendant\u2019s burden is one of production, that burden \u201cis an issue solely for determination by the court,\u201d not by the jury. <em>Watson v. Southeastern Penn. Transp. Auth., </em>207 F.3d 207, 221 (3d Cir. 2000). <em>See also St. Mary\u2019s, </em>509 U.S. at 509, 113 S.Ct. 2742 (\u201c[T]he burden-of-production determination necessarily <em>precedes </em>the credibility-assessment stage.\u201d). Accordingly, a jury should never be instructed on the defendant\u2019s burden of production. <em>See Watson, </em>207 F.3d at 221. If the defendant meets this burden of production by presenting evidence of a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason, the presumption created by the <em>prima facie </em>case \u201cdrops from the case,\u201d <em>U.S. Postal Serv. Bd. of Governors v. Aikens, </em>460 U.S. 711, 715, 103 S.Ct. 1478, 75 L.Ed.2d 403 (1983), or \u201cdisappears,\u201d <em>Sandstad v. CB Richard Ellis, Inc., </em>309 F.3d 893, 897 (5th Cir. 2002). To put it another way, once the court is satisfied that the defendant has met its burden of production, there is no longer any presumption of discrimination and \u201cthe trier of fact proceeds to decide the ultimate question: whether plaintiff has proved that the defendant intentionally discriminated against [him].\u201d <em>St. Mary\u2019s, </em>509 U.S. at 511, 113 S.Ct. 2742 (quotations and citations omitted) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">This brings us to evaluating the effect in this case of the court\u2019s improper modification of the requested <em>prima facie </em>case instruction. By inserting \u201cbecause of age\u201d into the <em>prima facie </em>case, the court made the plaintiff\u2019s initial hurdle more difficult\u2014 instead of simply needing to prove background circumstances where discrimination might be inferred, the court required the plaintiff to prove the ultimate issue in the case, namely whether Pearson acted because of age. And by making this hurdie more difficult, the court correspondingly made it more difficult for the plaintiff to receive the benefit of the presumption of discrimination that accompanies the establishment of the <em>prima facie </em>case. Because it is undisputed that the Board met its burden of production, however, neither of these effects prejudiced Kozlowski\u2019s case. Pearson testified as to a number of legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for the non-renewal, and the Board presented other evidence, including contemporaneous documents, which also reflected those reasons. The task of determining whether any of those legitimate reasons actually motivated Pearson was for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">Once the Board met its burden of production, the sole issue for the jury in this case was \u201cthe ultimate question [of] whether plaintiff has proved that the defendant intentionally discriminated against [him] because of his\u201d age. <em>St. Mary\u2019s, </em>509 U.S. at 511, 113 S.Ct. 2742 (citations and quotations omitted) (first alteration added). Because this was the only question for the jury, it would make no difference whether the jury understood this issue to be part of the plaintiffs initial burden, the plaintiff\u2019s ultimate burden, or both. Kozlowksi was not prejudiced by the additional element inserted into the <em>prima facie </em>case, because that element, which he bore the burden to prove, was the sole element at issue in the case. Under the court\u2019s improper instruction, the jury was under the correct assumption that the plaintiff bore the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Pearson did not renew Kozlowski\u2019s contract because of his age.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">In addition, because the Board met its burden of production, \u201c[t]he presumption [of discrimination], having fulfilled its role of forcing the defendant to come forward with some response, simply drop[ped] out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>of the picture,\u201d and \u201cthe shifted burden of production became irrelevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 510-11, 507, 113 S.Ct. 2742. Kozlowski was not deprived of the benefit of the <em>prima facie </em>case\u2019s presumption of discrimination, because that presumption disappeared once the Board had presented evidence of a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for his non-renewal. Any unnecessary confusion that the jury may have encountered in figuring out the interplay among the elements of the <em>prima facie </em>case, the defendant\u2019s burden of production, and the plaintiffs ultimate burden of proving discrimination is attributable primarily to the improper and needlessly complex jury instructions requested by the plaintiff in the first instance. In light of all of this, we conclude that the court\u2019s misstatement of the elements of the <em>McDonnell Douglas prima facie </em>case, standing alone, was harmless error.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Kozlowski next argues that the court erred by refusing to instruct the jury that if it did not believe the reasons given by Pearson for the non-renewal, then it could infer, but need not infer, that age was the real reason for the decision. Kozlowksi argues that this instruction was particularly important in this case, because the jury asked about this issue during its deliberations. Specifically, the jury asked the court, \u201cBy virtue of exclusion of defense\u2019s reasons for nonrenewal, must we conclude under the law that age discrimination has occurred?\u201d When discussing this question with counsel, the court initially indicated that its answer would be no. After some discussion, however, the court decided simply to repeat the general instruction without addressing the question specifically.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">Kozlowksi\u2019s requested instruction is a correct statement of the law. <em>See Reeves, </em>530 U.S. at 147-48, 120 S.Ct. 2097. Different courts have taken varied approaches, however, on the question of whether a court is required to instruct a jury on the inference of discrimination that may be drawn from disbelief of the employer\u2019s stated reasons for its actions. At least three circuits have held, or implied in <em>dicta, </em>that an instruction on this permissible inference is required, at least in cases where it appears from the evidence that the jury may doubt the employer\u2019s stated reasons for its actions, and that the failure to provide the instruction in such circumstances may constitute reversible error. <em>See Townsend v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., </em>294 F.3d 1232, 1236-41 (10th Cir.2002) (holding); <em>Smith v. Borough of Wilkinsburg, </em>147 F.3d 272, 279-80 (3d Cir.1998) (holding); <em>Cabrera v. Jakabovitz, </em>24 F.3d 372, 382 (2d Cir.1994) (dicta). In addition, the Eleventh Circuit has quoted positively from both <em>Smith </em>and <em>Cabrera </em>in support of the proposition that a jury should be instructed on this permissible inference. <em>See Palmer v. Bd. of Regents of the Univ. Sys. of Ga., </em>208 F.3d 969, 974-75 (11th Cir.2000). The Eleventh Circuit ultimate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>ly determined that the plaintiff in <em>Palmer </em>could not demonstrate that she \u201cwas prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s refusal to deliver the specific instructions proposed by her.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 975. Accordingly, the court found no reversible error, although it suggested that the circuit\u2019s Committee on Pattern Jury Instructions might want to revisit the issue. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">In contrast, the Seventh Circuit has held that while this instruction may be given, it is not required and a court does not commit error in refusing to provide it. <em>See Gehring v. Case Corp., </em>43 F.3d 340, 343 (7th Cir.1994). The court explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-6\">[While the plaintiffs requested instruction] is a correct statement of the law, ... a judge need not deliver instructions describing all valid legal principles. Especially not when the principle in question describes a permissible, but not an obligatory, inference. Many an inference is permissible. Rather than describing each, the judge may and usually should leave the subject to the argument of counsel.... Instructions on the topic were unnecessary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-7\"><em>Id. </em>Similarly, the Eighth Circuit has held that this instruction need not be given in a case where the \u201cevidence ... provides little to create a fact issue on pretext,\u201d and added in <em>dicta </em>that \u201c[w]e do not express any view as to whether it ever would be reversible error for a trial court to fail to give a pretext instruction, though we tend to doubt it.\u201d <em>Moore v. Robertson Fire Protection Dist., </em>249 F.3d 786, 790 &amp; n. 9 (8th Cir.2001).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The First Circuit has likewise expressed doubt, in <em>dicta, </em>\u201cthat such an explanation is compulsory, even if properly requested.\u201d <em>Fite v. Digital Equipment Corp., 232 </em>F.3d 3, 7 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">We agree with the general principle that a judge need not instruct a jury on all valid legal principles in a given case. Nonetheless, the particular inference at issue here\u2014that if the jury disbelieves the reasons given by the employer to justify its actions, then the jury may infer discrimination\u2014has in the past sparked considerable disagreement among the courts. Prior to <em>Reeves, </em>courts took a variety of approaches to when and if evidence of the <em>prima facie </em>case, combined with evidence tending to disprove the employer\u2019s stated reason for its actions, would suffice to permit a jury to determine that the real reason behind the employer\u2019s actions was discrimination. <em>See Reeves, </em>530 U.S. at 140-41, 120 S.Ct. 2097 (listing cases adopting various approaches). In <em>Reeves </em>the Supreme Court clarified that \u201ca plaintiffs <em>prima facie </em>case, combined with sufficient evidence to find that the employer\u2019s asserted justification is false, may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the employer unlawfully discriminated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 148, 120 S.Ct. 2097. Given the amount of disagreement among judges of the federal courts of appeals over whether a jury may infer discrimination simply from their disbelief of the employer\u2019s stated justifications, it seems unlikely that jurors will uniformly intuit that such an inference is permissible. As the Tenth Circuit stated, \u201c[tjhis is a difficult matter for courts, and would certainly be difficult for a jury.\u201d <em>Townsend, </em>294 F.3d at 1241. <em>See also Smith, </em>147 F.3d at 280-81 (\u201cIn light of the decades it has taken for the courts to shape and refine the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>standard into its present form and the inordinate amount of ink that has been spilled over the question of how a jury may use its finding of pretext, it would be disingenu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>ous to argue that it is nothing more than a matter of common sense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">We do not suggest that a court in a pretext case must always instruct jurors that they may, but need not, infer discrimination from their disbelief of an employer\u2019s stated reasons. Rather, we hold that when the evidence presented at trial creates some likelihood that the jury might disbelieve the legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons given by the employer to justify its actions, then the jury should be instructed on this permissible inference. The majority of circuit courts that have considered this question agree that at least in these circumstances, this instruction should be given. <em>See Townsend, </em>294 F.3d at 1241; <em>Smith, </em>147 F.3d at 279-80; <em>Cabrera, </em>24 F.3d at 382-83; <em>Palmer, </em>208 F.3d at 974-75. That said, an erroneous failure to give this instruction when circumstances call for it will not always require reversal. Rather, the court\u2019s failure to give this instruction, even when erroneous, is still subject to harmless error review. <em>See Townsend, </em>294 F.3d at 1241. <em>Cf United States v. Lewis, </em>53 F.3d 29, 32 (4th Cir.1995) (finding that, in the criminal context, a court\u2019s refusal to provide a requested instruction is reversible only when prejudicial, even when the instruction is correct and not otherwise covered in the instruction).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Turning to the case at hand, we conclude that the court erred by refusing to provide some form of the plaintiff\u2019s requested instruction that \u201c[i]f you do not believe the Defendant\u2019s explanation for its actions, then you may infer, but need not infer, that ... the Defendant intentionally discriminated against [the Plaintiff] because of age.\u201d Evidence presented by the plaintiff undermined at least some of the reasons that Pearson had given to explain his decision not to renew Kozlowski\u2019s contract. For example, Pearson claimed that Bernie West, the stepfather of one of Kozlowski\u2019s football players, Tim Smith, had complained to Pearson that Kozlowski had refused to provide him with game films that Smith needed to show to college recruiters. West testified differently, stating that he had expressed concern to Pearson about being able to get game films at some future point, but that he never complained about Kozlowski and in fact had never requested any films. Pearson also stated that Glenn Price, the father of Jason Price, had complained to him that Kozlowski had threatened to dismiss Jason from the team because he did not have a signed note excusing him from practice. Glenn Price testified that he had never spoken with Pearson about any such incident. Pearson\u2019s testimony as to several other incidents was also undermined by Kozlowski\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">It was up to the jury to determine whether the plaintiffs evidence on these matters was credible, and how directly that evidence undermined Pearson\u2019s stated reasons. But in light of this evidence, this is not a case where the \u201cevidence ... provides little to create a fact issue on pretext.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>249 F.3d at 790. The jurors\u2019 question during deliberations about how they were permitted to draw inferences in the event that they disbelieved Pearson further illustrates that the plaintiff had presented a meaningful amount of evidence suggesting pretext. In this situation, the district court erred in refusing to instruct the jurors that if they disbelieved the reasons given by Pearson, they could infer, but need not infer, that the real reason for the non-renewal was Kozlowski\u2019s age.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">Although the district court erred here, this error warrants reversal only if it \u201cseriously prejudiced the challenging party\u2019s case.\u201d <em>S. Atl. Ltd. P\u2019ship of Tenn. v. Riese, </em>284 F.3d 518, 530 (4th Cir.2002). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Because we determine in part IV, <em>infra, </em>that Kozlowski is entitled to a new trial due to the collective weight of this and the other errors, we decline to determine whether this error alone would warrant reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The plaintiff next challenges the district court\u2019s use of the phrase \u201csolely because of age\u201d in the jury charge. The plaintiff did not object to this modification at trial, so we review for plain error. When a party fails to object to a jury instruction, \u201c[w]e are prepared to reverse ... [for plain error] only when we can conclude that a particular jury instruction must necessarily have caused the jury to act in complete ignorance of, or to have misapplied, fundamentally controlling legal principles to the inevitable prejudice of an aggrieved party.\u201d <em>Spell v. McDaniel, </em>824 F.2d 1380, 1395 (4th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">The plaintiff requested the general instruction that the ADEA \u201cmakes it unlawful to refuse to hire or discharge any individual because of such individual\u2019s age.\u201d The court modified the instruction in two ways. First, it changed \u201cdischarge\u201d to \u201crenew any employment contract\u201d so as to conform the instruction to the facts of this case. Second, the court inserted the word \u201csolely,\u201d so that the instruction read that the plaintiff had to prove that the Board did not renew his contract \u201csolely because of his age.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">The court\u2019s addition of the term \u201csolely\u201d was erroneous. \u201cIt is clear ... that the law requires only that age be a causative or determinative factor in the decision, not the sole reason.\u201d <em>Smith v. Univ. of N.C., </em>632 F.2d 316, 337 (4th Cir. 1980). Nonetheless, in order to constitute plain error, this error \u201cmust necessarily have caused the jury to act in complete ignorance of, or to have misapplied, fundamentally controlling legal principles to the inevitable prejudice of an aggrieved party.\u201d <em>Spell, </em>824 F.2d at 1395. In this case, the court repeated the phrase \u201csolely because of age\u201d four times, twice during the original instruction and twice during follow-up instructions after questions from the jury. While the court repeated the term \u201csolely\u201d four times, it did not elaborate on the meaning of that term. In contrast, the court correctly instructed the jury a number of times, and at length, that age had to be a determining factor in the decision not to renew. For example, the court correctly explained that the Board is not hable if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-10\">it would have taken the same action even in the absence of discriminatory intent. This means that ... even if it put aside the discriminatory intent or if discriminatory intent did not exist at ah, the defendant would have taken the same adverse action against the plaintiff. In other words the defendant [is not hable if] ... its legitimate reasons standing alone would have induced it to make the same decision. In this particular case, the defendant acted on the recommendation of the principal. This means that in the case you must find ... that the principal would have still made the same decision to recommend the nonrenewal of Dennis Kozlowski\u2019s contract even if he was not motivated by a desire to have younger coaches.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">The judge repeated this extended explanation several times. Given this repeated, detailed, and extended explanation of the correct causation standard, we think it likely that the jury decided the case under the more fully explained (and correct) requested instruction that age must be the determining factor, the court\u2019s use of the term \u201csolely\u201d notwithstanding. <em>Cf. Cabrera, </em>24 F.3d at 384 (\u201cBecause of the Court\u2019s extensive and repeated instructions that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>the plaintiff bore the burden of proving discrimination, we believe that the jury could not have been led astray by the Court\u2019s brief comment to the contrary.\u201d). Certainly we cannot conclude that the court\u2019s instruction as a whole on the issue of causation \u201ccaused the jury to act in complete ignorance of, or to ... misapplfy], fundamentally controlling legal principles to the inevitable prejudice of an aggrieved party.\u201d <em>Spell, </em>824 F.2d at 1395. The court\u2019s insertion of the term \u201csolely\u201d into the instructions, when taken in light of the extended and correct explanation of the determinative cause standard, does not rise to the level of plain error.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">In addition to his challenges to the jury instructions, the plaintiff raises two evidentiary challenges and one challenge to the court\u2019s refusal to sequester a witness. The plaintiff objects to the court\u2019s exclusion of evidence related to alleged prior similar acts of discrimination by Pearson and to the court\u2019s admission of evidence related to his prior arrests for driving under the influence of alcohol. Finally, he challenges the court\u2019s refusal to sequester Pearson, a main defense witness, during the course of the trial. We will address these issues one at a time.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">Kozlowski argues that the district court erred in excluding his proffered evidence of alleged prior similar acts of age discrimination by Pearson. We review challenges to the court\u2019s admission or exclusion of evidence for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Stitt, </em>250 F.3d 878, 888 (4th Cir. 2001). When the court has committed an error regarding the admission or exclusion of evidence, that error is subject to harmless error review. <em>See Taylor v. Va. Union Univ., </em>193 F.3d 219, 234-35 (4th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Plaintiffs counsel proffered testimony showing that in April of 1994, Pearson replaced three coaches, ages 43, 52, and 46, with younger coaches, ages 31, 33, and 20-something. According to the plaintiffs proffer, \u201cDennis Kozlowski and Frank Brown, a football trainer, would have testified that [prior to replacing these three coaches] Principal Pearson stated that, quote, He wanted younger coaches at Bethel and that it was time for new blood, unquote.\u201d The plaintiff also argued that the evidence would have shown that the reasons given by Pearson for those replacements were false. The district court excluded this testimony, explaining that these events were five years removed from Kozlowski\u2019s non-renewal, that they involved \u201csome other matters within the school system,\u201d and that they would not be relevant to the case at hand. The court explained that it \u201cwas unwilling to allow a principal\u2019s entire career at the school to be subjected to review for the purpose of establishing in 1998 and 1999 an act of discrimination against Mr. Kozlowski.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">In a somewhat different context, we have held that a district court abused its discretion by excluding evidence of the contemporaneous use of racial slurs by members of a fire department, which were proffered to show that the plaintiff, a black man, was not hired due to his race. <em>See Mullen v. Princess Anne Volunteer Fire Co., </em>853 F.2d 1130, 1132-35 (4th Cir.1988). We stated generally that \u201c[t]he principle is well-established that prior acts and statements should be admitted where necessary to show state of mind.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1133. We cited favorably to <em>Hunter v. Allis-Chalmers Corp., </em>797 F.2d 1417, 1423 (7th Cir. 1986), a case holding that evidence of past incidents of harassment unrelated to the specific disputed action were properly admissible to show race-based intent. <em>Id. </em>at 1134.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In addition, other courts have generally held that evidence of similar alleged acts of discrimination, or other acts which reveal a discriminatory attitude generally, are admissible to show a defendant\u2019s intent in acting against the plaintiff. <em>See, e.g., Robinson v. Runyon, </em>149 F.3d 507, 512-13 (6th Cir.1998) (holding that in race discrimination case, district court abused its discretion by excluding a \u201cracist [mock] employment application, which was circulated and allegedly known to upper level management, yet not immediately condemned, [as the application] plainly makes the existence of racially motivated actions by management of the CBMC more probable.\u201d); <em>Polanco v. City of Austin, </em>78 F.3d 968, 980 (5th Cir.1996) (noting that evidence of discriminatory practices against Hispanics in the workplace was probative of whether individual plaintiff was terminated because of his nationality); <em>Spulak v. K Mart Corp., </em>894 F.2d 1150, 1156 (10th Cir.1990) (\u201cAs a general rule, the testimony of other employees about their treatment by the defendant is relevant to the issue of the employer\u2019s discriminatory intent.\u201d (listing cases)); <em>Estes v. Dick Smith Ford, Inc., </em>856 F.2d 1097, 1102 (8th Cir. 1988) (holding that in case where plaintiff claimed that he was fired from Ford dealership because of his race and age, district court erred in \u201cpreventing] Estes from presenting the jury with evidence that Ford excluded blacks from its workforce, that Ford had fired two other employees specifically because of their ages, that Ford\u2019s service department offered free rides to white customers while black customers were told to rent cars, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>members of Ford\u2019s management referred to blacks as \u2018niggers.\u2019 \u201d), <em>abrogated on other grounds, Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, </em>490 U.S. 228, 109 S.Ct. 1775, 104 L.Ed.2d 268 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">The defendant argues that it was proper to exclude the proffered testimony because it was too removed in time and because admission of the evidence would have simply resulted in duplicative and time-consuming \u201cmini-trials\u201d where the plaintiff and the defendant would have litigated whether the prior non-renewals were motivated by age, just as they were litigating the issue in this case. The cases cited by the defendant in support of the court\u2019s exclusion here, however, are quite distinguishable from the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">In this circuit, the defense relies on <em>Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, </em>805 F.2d 1143 (4th Cir.1986), <em>aff'd in part, vacated in part, </em>491 U.S. 164, 109 S.Ct. 2363, 105 L.Ed.2d 132 (1989). In <em>Patterson, </em>the plaintiff brought suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 for racial harassment and for being discharged because of her race. <em>Id. </em>at 1144. The district court correctly dismissed her racial harassment claim, ruling that claims of general racial harassment, unconnected to some adverse employment action, was not cognizable under \u00a7 1981. <em>Id. </em>at 1145.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At trial on her discriminatory discharge claim, the court excluded evidence of racial harassment of another employee ten years prior to the plaintiff\u2019s own discharge. <em>Id. </em>at 1147. We affirmed, stating that \u201c[bjecause of the remoteness in time of the events to which [the other employee] would have testified, the probative value of that evidence would have been slight and the court could properly conclude that its slight value was outweighed by the likelihood of confusion it might create on the issue on which it was tendered.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\"><em>Patterson </em>is distinguishable from this case in several respects. First of all, in <em>Patterson </em>the court excluded evidence of general racial harassment. This evidence was most relevant to Patterson\u2019s racial harassment claim, which the court properly had dismissed as not cognizable under \u00a7 1981. Here, in contrast, the alleged pri- or acts are of precisely the same nature as the acts alleged in this suit\u2014a failure to renew the contract of an older coach, replacement with a younger coach, and contemporaneous statements that the reason for the non-renewal was age. Second, the alleged prior harassment in <em>Patterson </em>was ten years removed from the plaintiffs non-promotion and layoff, whereas the acts here are only five years removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-11\">The defendant also cites <em>Johnson v. Yellow Freight System, Inc., </em>734 F.2d 1304 (8th Cir.1984). In <em>Johnson, </em>the Eighth Circuit held that the district court had not abused its discretion in a Title VII race discrimination case when it refused to allow cross-examination of a company employee concerning \u201ca petition circulated among black supervisors [that] ... alleged discrimination in that black employees had not been promoted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1311. The court did not permit discussion of the petition because \u201cto allow questions raising a new and unproven claim would necessitate inquiry into the truth or falsity of the claim. The court [also] noted that the petition was circulated three-and-one-half years <em>after </em>Johnson\u2019s termination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The main difference between <em>Johnson </em>and this case is that here, the evidence of prior age discrimination is directly probative of Pearson\u2019s motivation\u2014the testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>would have been that Pearson said he was not renewing prior contracts because the coaches were too old. In contrast, in <em>Johnson </em>the petition was directly probative only of a <em>perception </em>of discrimination among certain black supervisors, not of the fact that actual discrimination existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">We recognize that at some point, prior acts of discrimination or discriminatory statements are sufficiently removed in time and/or similarity from the current dispute that their probative value is slim and their exclusion justifiable. In this case, however, the potential probative value of these prior acts was more than slight. It is an open question whether the jury would have credited the testimony of the plaintiff and of Frank Brown, a football trainer who had also been replaced by Pearson. But if the jury had credited the testimony, these prior acts of age discrimination would have been highly probative of Pearson\u2019s motivation in this case. We also recognize that the scope of the plaintiffs proffered testimony may have been overly broad. The plaintiff proffered evidence not only of the non-renewals and the contemporaneous age-related statements, but also evidence allegedly disproving the reasons that Pearson would have given for those non-renewals. The defense is likely correct that allowing the plaintiff the opportunity to prove, person by person, that in each case Pearson\u2019s purported reasons for non-renewal were false would have required lengthy and cumbersome mini-trials. This process would have required, for each non-renewed individual, testimony from Pearson about why, five years earlier, he had refused to renew that coach\u2019s contract, rebuttal evidence and/or testimony from the plaintiff showing that those reasons were false, and reply evidence and/or testimony from the Board further justifying Pearson\u2019s decision. We find no error in the court\u2019s decision to exclude this type of evidence, which would have been quite time-consuming and would have distracted the jury from the central issue in this case, namely whether Pearson had failed to renew Kozlowski\u2019s contract because of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">In contrast with the proffer of evidence attempting to disprove Pearson\u2019s reasons for his non-renewal of the three coaches in 1994, Kozlowski\u2019s evidence of Pearson\u2019s past age-related comments would have been relatively simple to present and rebut, and, if credited, highly probative as to Pearson\u2019s intent. It appears that the defendant did not contest the fact that the three coaches had been replaced by younger coaches, so the rebuttal evidence would have consisted simply of testimony by Pearson denying making these discriminatory statements. The jury would then have been left to make credibility determinations about this testimony, just as it was required to make a credibility determination regarding Kozlowski\u2019s and Pearson\u2019s conflicting testimony about their December 4 conversation about Kozlowski\u2019s non-renewal.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">In sum, the presentation of this evidence would not have required extended \u201cmini-trials.\u201d The testimony related to essentially identical instances of alleged discriminatory non-renewals and bore directly on Pearson\u2019s motivations. The prior acts were less than five years removed from Kozlowski\u2019s non-renewal, and were performed by the same individual, Pearson, whose motivation was in question here. We conclude that in these circumstances, the court abused its discretion in refusing to admit the limited evidence of Pearson\u2019s alleged prior statements of discriminatory intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">Even though it was error to exclude this evidence, the question remains whether that error was harmless. The court in <em>Mullen </em>held that the exclusion was harm<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>less because there was overwhelming evidence that the plaintiff lacked the physical capability to be a fireman. <em>Mullen, </em>853 F.2d at 1135-86. Here, the evidence is closer. As explained in detail in part II. A.3, the plaintiff presented evidence rebutting some of Pearson\u2019s purported legitimate reasons for the non-renewal. Furthermore, during the course of the jury\u2019s deliberations, the jury asked the court whether it must infer discrimination if it did not believe Pearson\u2019s stated reasons. This question demonstrates that at least some of the jurors had serious doubts about whether they believed any of Pearson\u2019s stated legitimate reasons. On the other hand, it also seems apparent from the jury\u2019s verdict that they did not credit Kozlowski\u2019s testimony about his meeting with Pearson. It is questionable whether similar testimony from Kozlowski about prior events would have buttressed his case. It is more difficult to conjecture about whether the jury would have credited similar testimony from Frank Brown. In the end, we need not decide whether this error alone would warrant reversal. It is enough to say, as we conclude in part IV, that this error, in combination with the other errors we identify in this opinion, substantially prejudiced Kozlowski\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The plaintiff also challenges the district court\u2019s admission, over objection, of evidence that Kozlowski had been arrested several times for driving under the influence of alcohol. Evidence was also introduced showing that Kozlowski was acquitted of these charges. Kozlowski objected that the DUI evidence was prejudicial and irrelevant, because his DUI arrests were not one of the reasons given by Pearson for his non-renewal. The Board conceded at trial, and concedes on appeal, that Pearson did not consider Kozlowski\u2019s DUI arrests in making his decision. The Board argues, however, that at least one of the Board members indicated that Kozlowski\u2019s DUI arrests and related adverse publicity may have been a factor in his perception of Kozlowski\u2019s ability to continue coaching. The court admitted the evidence on this ground, noting that while Pearson made the initial decision not to renew the contract, that decision was ratified by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">The critical question, then, is whether the Board\u2019s liability in this case depended solely on the motivation of Pearson (in which case the DUI evidence was irrelevant, and its admission error) or whether the motivation of the Board members themselves might also have been relevant to the Board\u2019s liability. Under the court\u2019s own jury instructions, it was error to admit this evidence. The court instructed the jury that \u201c[i]n this particular case, the decision not to renew plaintiffs contract was made by the School Board on the recommendation of its agent, Principal David Pearson. If you find that Principal Pearson\u2019s recommendation was because of the age of Dennis Kozlowski, then you must hold the School Board liable for the acts of its agent, David Pearson.\u201d The court essentially instructed the jury that the Board members\u2019 personal motivations in ratifying Pearson\u2019s decision were not relevant\u2014if Pearson was improperly motivated by age, then the Board was liable. The ADEA, like Title VII, imposes liability on an \u201cemployer\u201d who acts with the proscribed motive. Both statutes define \u201cemployer\u201d to include \u201cany agent of\u2019 the employer. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 630(b) (West 2003) (ADEA); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(b) (West 2003) (Title VII). In applying this agency standard, the Supreme Court held that an employer is liable for the discriminatory acts of a supervisor who is \u201cprincipally responsible\u201d for an adverse employment action or who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>is the \u201cactual decisionmaker,\u201d even if that supervisor does not make the \u201cformal decision.\u201d <em>Reeves, </em>530 U.S. at 151-52, 120 S.Ct. 2097. Here, both parties agree that Pearson was Kozlowski\u2019s direct supervisor, that the School Board had delegated its authority to not renew coaching contracts to Pearson, and that Pearson was the actual decisionmaker in the non-renewal of Kozlowski\u2019s contract.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, if Pearson failed to renew the contract because of age, the Board is liable regardless of the subjective intents of the Board members.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The court therefore correctly instructed the jury to focus solely on the intent of Pearson in failing to renew Kozlowksi\u2019s contract. Under this instruction, evidence related solely to the motives of School Board members was irrelevant to any issue that was material to the case. The only impact the DUI evidence could have had on the jury, then, was to improperly prejudice them against Kozlowski. As with the exclusion of the evidence of prior similar acts of discrimination, we need not decide whether this error, standing alone, would warrant reversal. Rather, this error provides yet another reason, in combination with the other errors discussed herein, to find that a retrial is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">c.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">The final objection raised by the plaintiff is the court\u2019s denial of his motion to sequester Pearson from the trial. \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s order refusing sequestration or sequestering a person whom it finds exempt under section ... (2) [an officer or employee of a party which is not a natural person designated as its representative by its attorney], and we review for clear error factual findings about who is a party, officer, or employee.\u201d <em>Opus 3 Ltd. v. Heritage Park, Inc., </em>91 F.3d 625, 628 (4th Cir.1996). Furthermore, \u201cwe construe the rule\u2019s exemptions narrowly in favor of the party requesting sequestration,\u201d and \u201cthe party seeking to avoid sequestration of a witness bears the burden of proving that a Rule 615 exemption applies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">Under Rule 615 of the <em>Federal Rules of Evidence,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-12\">[a]t the request of a party the court shall order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses----This rule does not author-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-13\">ize exclusion of ... (2) an officer or employee of a party which is not a natural person designated as its representative by its attorney, or (3) a person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>whose presence is shown by a party to be essential to the presentation of the party\u2019s cause____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-4\"><em>Fed.R.Evid. </em>615. Before trial, plaintiff\u2019s counsel requested that Pearson be excluded, noting that Rule 615(2) applies only to officers or employees, and that Pearson had retired and was no longer employed by the Board. Before permitting the Board an opportunity to respond, the court ruled that \u201cif he is going to be designated as the representative for the City because of his involvement in the case, I will let him sit at counsel table with counsel for the trial. That will not mean that [the defendant] may then have a member of the School Board. He will be the sole representative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">From this ruling, it does not appear that the court made a factual finding that Pearson was, at the time of the trial, still an officer or employee of the Board.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Rather, it appears that the court interpreted Rule 615(2) to include a former officer or employee who is meaningfully involved in the case. This interpretation contradicts the text of the rule, which plainly refers to \u201can officer or employee\u201d but makes no mention of a former officer or employee. Obviously, a corporate defendant cannot itself be present, so Rule 615(2) allows a corporate defendant to designate one of its current employees or officers to attend the trial and not to be excluded. But just as a natural person may not designate her most important witness as her representative at trial, a corporate defendant cannot designate its most important witness simply because he is a former officer or employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">On appeal, the Board argues in the alternative that Pearson\u2019s presence at trial can be justified under part (3) of Rule 615, which provides an exception for \u201ca person whose presence is shown by a party to be essential to the presentation of the parties\u2019 cause.\u201d We are doubtful that the court\u2019s ruling against sequestration was based on this exception\u2014certainly the Board made no showing of necessity, and the court made no findings to that effect. To satisfy the exception, a party must show, among other things, that the \u201cthe witness\u2019s presence is \u2018essential\u2019 rather than simply desirable.\u201d <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>60 F.3d 128, 135 (2d Cir.1995). Putting aside the Board\u2019s failure to present any evidence or argument to the district court regarding Pearson\u2019s \u201cessential\u201d role in its presentation of its case, the Board\u2019s arguments on appeal still fall far short of establishing that Pearson\u2019s presence at trial was anything more than convenient for the Board. Thus, the court erred in refusing to sequester Pearson.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">Our prior cases make clear our reluctance to find harmless a court\u2019s erroneous refusal to sequester a witness, particularly an important fact witness. In <em>Opus 3 Ltd. v. Heritage Park, Inc., </em>91 F.3d 625 (1996), we noted that Rule 615 \u201cis designed to discourage and expose fabrication, inaccuracy, and collusion,\u201d and explained that \u201csequestering witnesses \u2018is (next to cross-examination) one of the greatest engines that the skill of man has ever invented for the detection of liars in a court of justice.\u2019 \u201d 91 F.3d at 628 (quoting 6 John H. Wigmore, <em>Wigmore on Evidence </em>\u00a7 1838, at 463 (James H. Chadboum ed., 1976)). When the individual in question is a key fact witness, \u201cadherence to the sequestration rule is most important.\u201d <em>Opus, </em>91 F.3d at 629. In <em>United States v. Farnham, </em>791 F.2d 331 (4th Cir.1986), we ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>plained our reluctance to find a sequestration error harmless:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-5\">[W]e understand the mandatory, unambiguous language of the rule to reflect the drafters\u2019 recognition that any defendant in Farnham\u2019s position would find it almost impossible to sustain the burden of proving the negative inference that the second agent\u2019s testimony would have been different had he been sequestered. A strict prejudice requirement of this sort would be not only unduly harsh but also self-defeating, in that it would swallow a rule carefully designed to aid the truth-seeking process and preserve the durability and acceptability of verdicts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALK\"><em>Farnham, </em>791 F.3d at 335. Despite our rejection of a strict prejudice requirement in <em>Famham, </em>we later clarified that \u201cviolations of Fed.R.Evid. 615 are subject to the harmless error rule.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>39 F.3d 1262, 1268 (4th Cir.1994) (citation omitted). We noted our willingness to presume prejudice \u201cwhere it would be impossible for the defendant to prove that the [non-sequestered witness\u2019s] testimony would have been different if he had not heard the first agent\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nonetheless, we explained that \u201c[w]e have no need to presume prejudice to the defendants here because we are satisfied in the case before us that the discussions that took place between the witnesses had no substantial influence on the jury verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we have found reversible error in cases where it is impossible to tell whether the non-sequestered witness would have testified differently in a manner that would have materially affected the trial. This means that the appellee does not bear the burden to affirmatively demonstrate prejudice, as is usually the case on appeal. Nonetheless, we have also made clear that an error in non-sequestration does not warrant <em>per se </em>reversal\u2014if the circumstances of a particular case illustrate clearly that the witness in question did not tailor his testimony, or that the witness\u2019s testimony had no substantial influence on the verdict, we may find the error harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">In this case, the Board argues that we can find lack of prejudice based on several factors. First, Pearson had written down the reasons for the non-renewal in letters to Kozlowski and the Board and had been deposed at length. Any tailoring of his testimony could have been brought out by contrasting it with his prior writings and deposition testimony. Second, as noted above in part II.A.3, it appears that the plaintiff was able to successfully cast doubt on much of Pearson\u2019s testimony. This would indicate that Pearson was not able to\u2014or simply did not\u2014tailor his testimony so as to suck the wind from the plaintiffs case.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">On the other hand, the plaintiff argues convincingly that Pearson nonetheless was able to tailor his responses to the plaintiffs rebuttal witnesses and therefore rehabilitate potentially discredited earlier testimony. When Pearson was recalled as a witness after having previously testified, defense counsel started by stating that \u201c[y]ou\u2019ve had the opportunity as you\u2019ve sat [in the trial] over the last couple of days to hear the testimony of various witnesses.\u201d Defense counsel then asked Pearson to respond directly to much of the contradictory testimony that he had observed. This is precisely the situation that Rule 615 was designed to prevent. When a witness is properly sequestered, that witness loses his ability to re-characterize his testimony in light of damaging contradictory testimony by other witnesses or to explain away inconsistencies. Here, Pearson was given that opportunity. We decline to decide whether this error standing alone would warrant reversal, but conclude that the error, in combination with the other errors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>we identify in this opinion, substantially prejudiced Kozlowski\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">After reviewing Kozlowski\u2019s various grounds for appeal, we have concluded that the district court committed at least four non-forfeited errors to the detriment of Kozlowski.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Specifically, the court erred by: (1) failing to instruct the jury that it could infer age discrimination from the falsity of the defendant\u2019s proffered reasons; (2) excluding evidence proffered by the plaintiff of prior similar alleged acts of age discrimination; (3) admitting evidence related to Kozlowski\u2019s past DUI arrests; and (4) failing to sequester Pearson, a primary defense witness, from the trial proceedings. We have identified certain of these errors that would not, standing alone, warrant reversal, and we have withheld judgment about the individual harmlessness of the remaining errors. As a number of courts have recognized, however, the collective force of multiple errors can, in some instances, warrant reversal even when one or two of the errors standing alone would not. <em>See Frymire-Brinati v. KPMG Peat Marwick, </em>2 F.3d 183, 188 (7th Cir.1993) (\u201cOne or two of these errors might have been excused as harmless. Collectively, however, they presented the jury such a skewed picture that the verdict is unreliable and must be set aside.\u201d); <em>Malek v. Fed. Ins. Co., </em>994 F.2d 49, 55 (2d Cir.1993) (\u201cAlthough any one of the above evidentiary errors standing alone may have been harmless and would not mandate reversal, the cumulative effect of these errors substantially prejudiced the Maleks\u2019 case.\u201d); <em>Gordon Mailloux Enterprises, Inc. v. Firemen\u2019s Ins. Co. of Newark, N. J., </em>366 F.2d 740, 742 (9th Cir.1966). <em>But see SEC v. Infinity Group Co., </em>212 F.3d 180, 196 (3d Cir.2000) (rejecting cumulative error doctrine in civil context). Although we have not yet had the occasion to consider the cumulative error doctrine in the civil context, we have applied the doctrine in the criminal context. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 532 (4th Cir.2002). We have also rejected the notion that a different standard should apply for harmless error review in the civil context than in the criminal context. <em>See Taylor v. Va. Union Univ., </em>193 F.3d 219, 235 (4th Cir.1999). Accordingly, we will now consider the cumulative effect of the errors we have identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">An error is harmless when it does not affect the appellant\u2019s \u201csubstantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Put differently, an error is harmless when the court can say \u201cwith fair assurance, after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the errors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and citations omitted). Given the number of the errors in this case and the seriousness of at least some of those errors, such as the court\u2019s failure to sequester the defendant\u2019s main fact witness, we conclude that the cumulative effect of the errors was substantially prejudicial to Kozlowski\u2019s case. The errors affected both the evidence that the jury was permitted to consider as well as the legal standard that the jury was asked to apply to that evidence. The court\u2019s evidentiary and sequestration errors meant that the jury was unaware of probative evidence of alleged prior similar acts of discrimination; was aware of Kozlowski\u2019s irrelevant DUI arrests, which cast him in a negative light; and heard testimony from the defendant\u2019s main fact witness, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Pearson, that was quite possibly tailored to meet the contrary evidence of the plaintiff. In addition, the court failed to inform the jury of an important inference that the law, as has become clear only recently, permits them to draw. When we consider the trial in light of these errors, we cannot say \u201cwith fair assurance ... that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the errors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and citations omitted). We conclude that the errors preserved by the plaintiff and raised on appeal substantially affected his case and were not harmless.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b171-6\">. For the sake of simplicity, we will refer to the magistrate judge as the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b173-7\">. This instruction as proposed was flawed in two respects. First, the instruction did not clarify whether this shifting burden was one of production or of persuasion. As discussed below, this burden is simply one of production. <em>See infra </em>part II.A.2. Second, because the shifting burden is one of production, this instruction should not have been given at all. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b174-5\">. If the defendant fails to meet its burden of production, the plaintiff has the opportunity to prevail both at summary judgment and at trial. When the defendant fails to meet its burden and \"any rational person would have to find the existence of facts constituting a <em>prima facie </em>case,\u201d then the plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment. <em>St. Mary\u2019s, </em>509 U.S. at 509, 113 S.Ct. 2742. In contrast, if \"reasonable minds could differ as to whether a preponderance of the evidence establishes the facts of a <em>prima facie </em>case,\u201d then the case will be submitted to the trier of fact solely on the elements of the <em>prima facie </em>case. <em>Id. </em>at 509-10, 113 S.Ct. 2742. If the finder of fact determines that the plaintiff has proven the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>elements of the <em>prima facie </em>case, then the presumption of discrimination is established and the verdict must be for the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>at 510 n. 3, 113 S.Ct. 2742.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b176-6\">. In contrast, when the defendant fails to meet its burden of production, a misstatement of the <em>prima facie </em>case may well be substantially prejudicial. If the Board had failed to offer any evidence of a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its actions, then the only issue in the case would have been whether Kozlowski had established the <em>prima facie </em>case. <em>St. Mary\u2019s, </em>509 U.S. at 509-510, 113 S.Ct. 2742. Because the elements of the <em>prima facie </em>case were uncontested, Kozlowski would have been entitled to summary judgment. If the court had additionally required Kozlowski to prove that the non-renewal was \"because of age,\u201d the case would have erroneously proceeded to the jury, which might have found against Kozlowski. This would have deprived Kozlowski of the benefit of the presumption of discrimination, which, in this scenario, would have been outcome-determinative.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b177-8\">. It is worth noting that the Eighth Circuit in <em>Moore </em>did not state, even in <em>dicta, </em>that it would never be erroneous for a court to fail to instruct a jury on this permissible inference. Rather, the court merely expressed doubt that such an error would be reversible. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b180-6\">. In light of our ultimate decision to remand for a new trial, we note two other errors in the jury instructions that the plaintiff has not raised on appeal. During one of the court\u2019s descriptions of the burden-shifting scheme, the court stated that once the plaintiff made out the <em>prima facie </em>case, the School Board must articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its actions. The court then instructed that \"[t]he School Board does not have to persuade you of this fact by a preponderance of the evidence. Instead, the School Board is required only to produce enough evidence in contradiction of plaintiff's claim to create a genuine issue of fact in your mind.\u201d This is a serious error\u2014the court seems to be saying that so long as the Board introduces enough evidence to create a genuine issue of fact in the minds of the jurors, then the Board should prevail. This error helps illustrate why a jury should never be instructed on a party\u2019s burden of production. It is true that a burden of production is met when a party introduces evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact. But this is a determination that is always in the province of the court, never the jury. The jury\u2019s task is to <em>decide </em>close questions of fact, not to figure out when the evidence creates a close question. Because the plaintiff does not raise this error on appeal, however, we do not consider it as part of our decision to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">Second, during one of the follow-up instructions the court stated that \u201d[i]n discrimination cases if there is a legitimate reason for an action to be taken and there is an improper and unlawful reason for an action to be taken both of which are established by a preponderance of the evidence, the defendant is entitled to judgment.\u201d This is incorrect. If age is a determinative factor in the decision, then the presence of another, legitimate factor does not absolve the defendant of liability. The court went on to add that the plaintiff must show that \"the primary reason\u201d for his non-renewal was his age. This is a bit closer, although it is imprecise and therefore potentially misleading. The phrase \u201cprimary reason\u201d seems to imply that the jury should look at the reasons and see which was the \"most important,\u201d or something to that effect. This is a different test than whether age was a but-for cause. Again, the plaintiff has not raised this error, so we do not consider it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b181-6\">. The court in <em>Mullen </em>nonetheless affirmed the jury verdict for the defendant fire company, holding that the exclusion was harmless because of overwhelming evidence that the plaintiff's physical infirmities prevented him from performing the job of a fireman. <em>Mullen, </em>853 F.2d at 1135-36.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b182-6\">.
