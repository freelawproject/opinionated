Heredia-Camino\u2019s argument is misplaced; the BIA granted her motion for an extension of time. The BIA rejected her brief because it was not served on the INS office of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-17\">To the extent she alleges a due process violation based on the rejection of her brief, she has failed to demonstrate substantial prejudice. <em>Anwar v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 140, 145 (5th Cir.1997). Heredia-Camino has not shown that she was unable or unwilling to return \u201c \u2018because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Jukic v.
