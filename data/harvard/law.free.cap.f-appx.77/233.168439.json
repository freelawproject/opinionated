Forlander argues that the district court misunderstood the scope of its authority to depart downward on the ground of aberrant behavior pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-19\">The record reveals that the district court knew that it had discretion to decide whether to depart downward on the basis of aberrant behavior. The transcript of the sentencing hearing evidences the district court\u2019s awareness of the language of \u00a7 5K2.20 and its commentary. This court does not have jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s decision to decline to grant a downward departure. <em>See United States v. Buck, </em>324 F.3d 786, 798 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-24\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b267-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
