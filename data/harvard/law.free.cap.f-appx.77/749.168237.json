R.Crim. P. 33. McWaine alleged that Officer David Sullivan presented false information in obtaining a search warrant for his residence and that Officer Ronnie Jones was indicted and convicted after McWaine\u2019s trial. McWaine has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion as he has not shown that his motion is based on new evidence unknown despite due diligence on his part, that the evidence is material, or that the evidence would probably have produced an acquittal. <em>See United States v. Sullivan, </em>112 F.3d 180, 182-83 (5th Cir.1997). Therefore, the district court\u2019s denial of McWaine\u2019s motion is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b783-17\">. Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
