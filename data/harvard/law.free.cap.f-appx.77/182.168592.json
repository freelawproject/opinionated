We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>tion because the notices of appeal were not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed.R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed.R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed.R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The district court\u2019s orders denying reinstatement were entered on the docket on June 11, 2003. The notices of appeal were postmarked July 14, 2003, and filed on July 15, 2003. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App. P. 4(c). Because Bowler failed to file timely notices of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeals. We deny Bowler\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
