Santos contends that the district court did not make the specific findings required to justify the imposition of a two-level increase in his offense level for obstruction of justice based on his allegedly perjurious trial testimony, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. Santos contends that the district court erred by failing to specify which parts of his testimony were perjurious.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-22\">We review the district court\u2019s factual finding that a defendant has obstructed justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 for clear error. <em>United States v. Adam, </em>296 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>327, 334 (5th Cir.2002). When the defendant objected in the district court to the imposition of an obstruction-of-justice enhancement, but did not also object that the district court\u2019s findings that he committed perjury were inadequate, review of the latter issue is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Holman, </em>314 F.3d 837, 846 (7th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 123 S.Ct. 2238, 155 L.Ed.2d 1108 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">The district court\u2019s statements at sentencing and its adoption of the presentence report and addendum, which specifically delineated those portions of Santos\u2019s testimony that were contradictory to those of government witnesses, were sufficient to justify the obstruction-of-justiee enhancement; and the district court\u2019s findings were adequate. <em>See United States v. Haas, </em>171 F.3d 259, 268 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"ALl\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
