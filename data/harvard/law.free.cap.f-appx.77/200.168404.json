R. Civ. P. 15 motion to amend. In the motion, Williams sought to amend a previously filed 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion in order to \u201cclarify\u201d and \u201camplify\u201d his claim of prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-21\">Because the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion which first raised the prosecutorial misconduct claim had already been denied at the time Williams filed his Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c) motion to amend, there was no \u00a7 2255 motion to relate back to. <em>See Whitaker v. City of Houston, </em>963 F.2d 831, 834-35 (5th Cir.1992); <em>Warren v. Garvin, </em>219 F.3d 111, 114 (2nd Cir.2000)(\u201cthe \u2018relation back\u2019 doctrine is inapplicable when the initial habeas petition was dismissed, because there is no pleading to which to relate back\u201d); <em>see also Graham v. Johnson, </em>168 F.3d 762, 780 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Neverson v. Bissonnette, </em>261 F.3d 120, 126 (1st Cir. 2001). Accordingly, the motion to amend was unauthorized and without a jurisdictional basis. <em>See United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-22\">Even if construed as a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, Williams\u2019 motion is a successive motion that would be barred unless he had first obtained authorization from this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Court to file such a motion in the district court, which he did not do. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(a); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>United States v. Rich, </em>141 F.3d 550, 551 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgement of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b234-16\">. Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
