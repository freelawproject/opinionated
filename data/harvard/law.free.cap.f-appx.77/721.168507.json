Owens is currently serving a 210-month sentence on his convictions for multiple counts of mail fraud, conspiracy to commit mail fraud, aiding and abetting, and use of fire to commit a felony. Owens argues that the district court erred in determining that his defective indictment claim did not meet the criteria for bringing a claim pursuant to the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-22\">Owens\u2019s reliance on <em>Jones v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 848, 120 S.Ct. 1904, 146 L.Ed.2d 902 (2000), and <em>Neder v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999), does not satisfy the requirements for filing a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). Owens\u2019s arguments that the district court should have transferred his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition to us for consideration as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, and that the \u201csavings clause\u201d constitutes a Suspension of the Writ, also fail. <em>See Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 901 n. 19; <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-23\">Owens has not briefed his arguments related to violations of <em>Accardi v. Shaughnessy, </em>347 U.S. 260, 74 S.Ct. 499, 98 L.Ed. 681 (1954), and the fair warning doctrine. Accordingly, these arguments are abandoned on appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b755-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b755-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
