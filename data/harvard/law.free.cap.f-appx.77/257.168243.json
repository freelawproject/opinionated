Welling appeals the district court\u2019s denial of motion for disclosure of the identity of a confidential informant (Cl).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">Welling argues that he needed the identity of the Cl to prove to the jury that the informant was biased and lied for financial gain and that disclosure of the information the informer gave to the Government could have been used to demonstrate inconsistencies in the testimony of other witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-12\">A court\u2019s refusal to require the disclosure of a Cl\u2019s identity is reviewed for abuse of discretion, while any factual findings upon which the court relies for its decision are reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard. <em>United States v. Vizcarra-Porras, </em>889 F.2d 1435, 1438 (5th Cir. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-13\">We use a three-part test to determine when disclosing an informant\u2019s identity is mandated. We evaluate the level of the informant\u2019s participation in the alleged criminal activity; consider the helpfulness of disclosure to any asserted defense; and consider the Government\u2019s interest in nondisclosure. <em>See Roviaro v. United States, </em>353 U.S. 53, 59, 77 S.Ct. 623, 1 L.Ed.2d 639 (1957); <em>United States v. Orozco, </em>982 F.2d 152, 154-55 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-14\">There is no indication that the Cl in the instant case did anything but tip police officers to the possibility of their finding criminal activity at Welling\u2019s residence. <em>See Orozco, </em>982 F.2d at 155. Nor does Welling argue that the Cl would provide \u201ctestimony [that] would significantly aid the defendant in establishing an asserted defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[M]ere conjecture or supposition about the possible relevancy of the informant\u2019s testimony is insufficient to warrant disclosure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Because two prongs of this circuit\u2019s test support the district court\u2019s determination that the identity of the Cl did not need to be revealed, the district court\u2019s decision should be affirmed. <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>949 F.2d 737, 749-50 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b292-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
