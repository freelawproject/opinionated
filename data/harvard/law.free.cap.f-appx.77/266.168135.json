Moussa contends that he established past persecution by Hezbollah and that he has a well-founded fear of persecution if he is forced to return to Lebanon. Moussa contends that the IJ did not make an \u201cactual credibility finding\u201d and, thus, that this court should not uphold the BIA\u2019s denial of his claims on the ground that the IJ made a finding that his testimony was not eredibile.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-20\">We review the IJ\u2019s decision because the BIA summarily affirmed without opinion and essentially adopted the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). We will uphold the IJ\u2019s determination that Moussa is not eligible for asylum if it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 350 (5th Cir.2002). The substantial evidence standard requires only that the IJ\u2019s \u201cconclusion be based upon the evidence presented and be substantially reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). To reverse the IJ\u2019s determination that Moussa is not eligible for asylum, \u201cthe evidence presented must compel a reasonable fact-finder to conclude that [he] suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution because of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Girma v. INS, </em>283 F.3d 664, 669 (5th Cir.2002); <em>see INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>We will not \u201creview decisions turning purely on the [IJ\u2019s] assessment of the alien petitioner\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>Chun, </em>40 F.3d at 78 (quotation and citation omitted). The IJ found various discrepancies and inconsistencies in the evidence which lessened the credibility of Moussa\u2019s testimony. We will not disturb this credibility finding. <em>See Chun, </em>40 F.3d at 78-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">After careful review of the briefs and the administrative record, we conclude that the IJ\u2019s credibility finding is supported by substantial evidence. The IJ\u2019s conclusion that Moussa had failed to make an adequate showing of past persecution and of fear of future persecution also is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The standard for withholding of removal is more stringent than the standard necessary for asylum and requires the alien to make a showing that a \u201c \u2018clear probability5 \u201d exists that he will be persecuted if he is removed. <em>Mikhael, </em>115 F.3d at 306. Because Moussa did not make the required showing for asylum, he was not eligible for withholding of removal. <em>See id. </em>at 306 &amp; n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b300-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
