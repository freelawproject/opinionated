For the reasons discussed below, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">In his petition, Mohamed first challenges the immigration judge\u2019s determination that he failed to establish his eligibility for asylum. To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Mohamed fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief that Mohamed seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">Additionally, we uphold the immigration judge\u2019s denial of Mohamed\u2019s application for withholding of removal. The standard for withholding of removal is more stringent than that for granting asylum. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999). To qualify for withholding of removal, an applicant must demonstrate \u201ca clear probability of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). Because Mohamed fails to show that he is eligible for asylum, he cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-10\">Finally, Mohamed argues that the Board\u2019s use of the summary affirmance procedure set out at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4) (2003) was impermissibly retroactive as applied to him. This argument is squarely foreclosed by our recent decision in <em>Khattak v. Ashcroft, </em>332 F.3d 250, 252-53 (4th Cir.2003) (rejecting a challenge to the Board\u2019s summary affirmance procedure on retroactivity grounds and concluding that \u201callowing summary opinions in clear cases is nothing more than a procedural change that does not affect substantive rights\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-11\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-12\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
