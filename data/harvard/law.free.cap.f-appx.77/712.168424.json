The district court granted summary judgment for Fresenius after determining that the Claims Administrator, Liberty Mutual Life Assurance Co. (\u201cLiberty\u201d), did not abuse its discretion by finding that the administrative record lacked objective medical evidence of Mouton\u2019s disability. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-23\">1. Mouton first argues that the decision of Liberty should be reviewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>de novo. In the district court, Mouton argued for de novo review because the decision was made by the Claims Administrator, Liberty, rather than the Plan Administrator, Fresenius. The district court rejected this argument, finding that there is an express delegation of the Plan Administrator\u2019s claims adjudication and benefits determinations to a Claims Administrator, who has also been delegated authority to determine appeals of its benefits and claims decisions. <em>See </em>Dist. Ct. Op. at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">2. On appeal, Mouton changes course and concedes that the plan gave Liberty discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits and to construe the terms of the plan. <em>See Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch, </em>489 U.S. 101, 115, 109 S.Ct. 948, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989) (explaining that an ERISA Plan Administrator\u2019s denial of benefits is reviewed de novo \u201cunless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.\u201d). Mouton now claims that Liberty disclaimed that authority, and thus de novo review is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">3. We do not reach this issue because we find that Mouton failed to properly raise it in the district court. \u201cWe will not consider an issue that a party fails to raise in the district court, absent extraordinary circumstances. Extraordinary circumstances exist when the issue involved is a pure question of law and a miscarriage of justice would result from our failure to consider it.\u201d <em>N. Alamo Water Supply Corp. v. City of San Juan, </em>90 F.3d 910, 916 (5th Cir.1996) (footnotes omitted). First, this is not a pure question of law, for its resolution would require the court to make a factual determination regarding whether Liberty intended to disclaim its discretionary authority. Second, Mouton has not explained what \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d exist justifying consideration of this forfeited issue. Thus, we decline to consider Mouton\u2019s argument and apply the abuse of discretion standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">4. Under an abuse of discretion standard of review, a Plan Administrator\u2019s denial of benefits will be subject to reversal only if it is arbitrary or capricious. <em>See Meditrust Fin. Servs. Corp. v. Sterling Chems., Inc., </em>168 F.3d 211, 215 (5th Cir.1999). It is arbitrary and capricious if the record lacks substantial evidence to support the Plan Administrator\u2019s benefit determination. <em>See id. </em>When determining whether a Plan Administrator abused its discretion in making a factual determination, the court examines the record before the administrator when the claim was denied. <em>Vega v. Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Servs., Inc., </em>188 F.3d 287, 299 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">5. Under the plan, a claimant is required to \u201cgive the employer proof in the form of objective evidence of continued: (a) Disability; and (b) required regular attendance of a Physician. The proof must be given upon the Plan\u2019s request and at the Covered Person\u2019s expense.\u201d Fresenius Plan \u00a7\u00a7 3.1, 4.1. Liberty concluded that Mouton failed to provide such evidence. Mouton does not contend that Liberty interpreted the plan incorrectly by requiring objective medical evidence of continued disability. Thus, the question is whether it was arbitrary or capricious for Liberty to conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>the record lacked objective medical evidence of Mouton\u2019s disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">6. Mouton contends that Liberty\u2019s decision was an abuse of discretion \u201c[s]ince her job required her to sit to perform most of her duties, and she couldn\u2019t sit for more than 15 or 20 minutes at a time because of pain, [and thus] could not perform all of her duties.\u201d Liberty concluded that there was no evidence that sitting for more than 20 minutes at a time was a material and substantial duty of her occupation. The Physical Job Evaluation Form completed by Mouton\u2019s employer stated that Mouton\u2019s job allowed her to change positions frequently and that \u201c[b]ecause of back problems, [the] employee is not allowed to do any lifting or prolonged sitting or typing.\u201d This statement could mean either that Mouton\u2019s employer did not require or allow Mouton to sit or type for prolonged periods, or it could mean that Mouton\u2019s physician placed restrictions on her physical activities. Liberty\u2019s interpretation of the statement\u2014that her employer did not require or allow Mouton to sit or type for prolonged periods\u2014was not unreasonable. Thus, it was not an abuse of discretion for Liberty to conclude that Mouton\u2019s inability to remain seated for prolonged periods did not mean she was unable to perform a material and substantial duty of her job.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">7. Mouton also argues that \u201cshe met the definition of disability in 1997 and 1998, but she tried to work through the pain in the hope she would get better. She finally had to admit that she was not able to do her work, and she applied for disability.\u201d According to Liberty, however, there was a lack of medical evidence supporting the worsening of Mouton\u2019s condition between 1998 and 2000. Mouton has not suggested that this evidence exists, nor does she argue that her conditions actually worsened. Instead, she contends it took her three years to realize that she was not able to do her work and that she should not be punished for working through her pain. However admirable her perseverance was, it also permits the inference that she was able to perform the material and substantial duties of her job while experiencing the level of neck and back pain she experienced in 1998. Dr. Roger G. West compared Mouton\u2019s 1998 lumbar MRI to her 2000 lumbar MRI, and concluded that the 2000 MRI showed no interval change. Additionally, Mouton\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Paul Kramm, never explained how, why, or to what extent Mouton\u2019s condition worsened during that time. The objective medical records showed no change in her back and neck condition from 1998 to 2000, and Liberty did not abuse its discretion in so concluding.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">8. Mouton also argues that Liberty abused its discretion by finding that she was not disabled because she cancelled an appointment with an orthopedic surgeon to treat her frozen right shoulder and because she showed improvements in her shoulder range of motion. There was nothing arbitrary or capricious about Liberty\u2019s determination that Mouton was not disabled by her shoulder pain, as the medical records indicate that her shoulder pain \u201cresolved\u201d between her application for short-term disability benefits and Liberty\u2019s termination of those benefits. <em>See </em>P.\u2019s Ex. 7 at 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">9. Mouton argues that Liberty abused its discretion by rejecting the expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>opinion of her treating physician, Dr. Kramm, on the ground that the opinion is not supported by objective medical evidence. Specifically, she contends that Liberty ignored her disabling level of pain resulting from the myriad of her impairments, and that the court should apply <em>Lain v. UNUM Life Insurance Co. of America, </em>279 F.3d 337 (5th Cir.2002), and hold that Liberty abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">10. <em>Lain </em>is distinguishable. First, the reviewing court made a de novo interpretation of the records and determined there was a conflict of interest between the plan\u2019s administrator and insurer, so that the administrator\u2019s factual determinations were given less deference than is appropriate in this case. Second, UNUM had incorrectly interpreted the plan, which the court cited as a strong indicator of arbitrary and capricious behavior. Third, Lain was given pain medication that did not work, while Mouton\u2019s records indicate a positive response to her pain prescriptions. Fourth, the administrator in <em>Lain </em>misrepresented the objective test results justifying its denial by claiming they were normal when instead they were \u201cabnormal\u201d and at times \u201ctop normal.\u201d There is no suggestion that Liberty misinterpreted objective test results, as no such results existed. Thus, the <em>Lain </em>court\u2019s conclusion that the Plan Administrator erred by \u201cfail[ing] to take into account that Lain\u2019s chest pains cannot be clinically measured by tests\u201d and \u201cfocus[ing] on the tests, rather than the pain and its effect\u201d is not controlling. <em>Id. </em>at 347. In <em>Lain, </em>UNUM\u2019s own staff physician determined that he \u201c[could] neither validate nor refute the claimant\u2019s subjective pain complaints though the consistency across multiple providers and the presentations of pyscho[logical] evaluations] suggest a real ongoing problem.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the present case, there is no evidence of Mouton\u2019s pain in the form of objective medical testing and no medical opinions discussing the pain she experiences.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">11. Mouton also argues that Liberty should have requested objective medical evidence in the form of her medical records for the records custodian at the Ochsner Clinic, where she was treated by Dr. Kramm, rather than directly from Dr. Kramm. Of course, Dr. Kramm could have forwarded any requests to the proper party at Ochsner, and he never informed Liberty that he could not secure the records or even that it would be easier if Liberty asked someone else for the records. In any event, the Plan places the burden of obtaining the required records on the claimant. <em>See </em>Fresenius Plan \u00a7 3.1 (providing a claim will be paid \u201cif the Covered Person gives the employer proof in the form of objective evidence\u201d upon request). Thus, Dr. Kramm\u2019s failure to provide the necessary medical evidence is imputed to Mouton.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">12. After reviewing the administrative record with careful attention to the medical records cited by Mouton, particularly the letter from Dr. Kramm to Liberty dated September 8, 2000, the orthopedic notes of Dr. William J. Hubbard dated April 11, 2001, and the letter from Dr. Kramm to Liberty dated May 3, 2001, we cannot say that Liberty abused its discretion by denying Mouton\u2019s claim. Liberty did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>ignore Mouton\u2019s pain, but instead looked to the medical records to substantiate it. Those records lack any discussion of the level of pain Mouton experiences, and the restrictions and limitations noted therein do not suggest that Mouton could not perform her sedentary occupation. Additionally, Dr. Kramm\u2019s opinion that Mouton is disabled was conclusory and unsupported by medical testing, an explanation of how Mouton\u2019s condition deteriorated between 1998 and 2000, or a discussion of Mouton\u2019s restrictions and limitations. The administrative record does not suggest that Mouton\u2019s inability to sit for prolonged periods would render her unable to perform her sedentary job. Thus, it was not an abuse of discretion for Liberty to conclude that Mouton was not disabled within the meaning of the Fresenius Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b746-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
