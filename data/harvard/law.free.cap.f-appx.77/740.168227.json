Ulmer seeks a certificate of appeal-ability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to appeal the district court\u2019s order transferring his successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 application to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-19\">We must examine the basis of our jurisdiction sua sponte if necessary. <em>Hill v. City of Seven Points, </em>230 F.3d 167, 169 (5th Cir.2000). An order transferring a successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 application to the court of appeals is a non-appealable interlocutory order. <em>See Brinar v. Williamson, </em>245 F.3d 515, 516-18 (5th Cir. 2001). This court is without jurisdiction to consider Ulmer\u2019s case. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction. Ulmer\u2019s motion for a COA is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-20\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b774-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
