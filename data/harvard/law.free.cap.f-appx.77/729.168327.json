He argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, </em>535 U.S. 234, 122 S.Ct. 1389, 152 L.Ed.2d 403 (2002), which invalidated two of the definitions of \u201cchild pornography\u201d applicable to the statute under which he was indicted and convicted, rendered his indictment insufficient and his guilty plea invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">The record does not establish whether actual children were depicted in the child pornography possessed by McDermott. McDermott has shown that his guilty plea was invalid because it was not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary and the factual basis for the plea was inadequate. <em>See United States v. Gobert, </em>139 F.3d 436, 439 (5th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Briggs, </em>939 F.2d 222, 227 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Accordingly, we VACATE the district court\u2019s judgment and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, </em>535 U.S. 234, 122 S.Ct. 1389, 152 L.Ed.2d 403 (2002).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b763-39\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b764-8\">. In addition, in the event McDermott is convicted and sentenced after remand, the district court shall impose special conditions of supervised release, if any, in conformity with our decisions in <em>United States v. Vega, </em>332 F.3d 849, 853 and n. 8 (5th Cir.2003), and <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>250 F.3d 941, 942 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
