In his appellate brief, filed pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), King\u2019s counsel asserts the district court erred by declining to depart below the applicable mandatory minimum sentence. King was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but failed to do so. We affirm. The denial of a request for downward departure is reviewable only when the district court mistakenly believed that it lacked the authority to depart. <em>United States v. Underwood, </em>970 F.2d 1336, 1338 (4th Cir.1992) (citing <em>United States v. Bayerle, </em>898 F.2d 28 (4th Cir.1990)). Because the record discloses that the district court was aware of its authority to depart, we may not review the district court\u2019s denial of King\u2019s sentencing motion. To the extent that King attacks the Government\u2019s refusal to move for a downward departure due to King\u2019s substantial assistance, the Government\u2019s decision is not reviewable but for exceptional circumstances not present here. <em>See United States v. Maddox, </em>48 F.3d 791, 795 (4th Cir.1995). We have reviewed the entire record on appeal as required by <em>Anders </em>and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm King\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-18\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
