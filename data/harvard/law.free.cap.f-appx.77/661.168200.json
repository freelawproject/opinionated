We find that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s conclusion that Simret failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution as necessary to qualify for relief from deportation. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(D) (2000); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>Huaman-Cornelio v. Board of Immigration Appeals, </em>979 F.2d 995, 999 (4th Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
