We have reviewed the record and conclude that the court did not clearly err in finding that Kinchen failed to carry her burden of establishing a causal connection between the alleged breach in the standard of care and the course of her kidney disease. The trial consisted of testimony of the treating physician and expert testimony, which was conflicting on the issues of negligence and causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">Kinchen\u2019s expert testified that the treating physician should have ordered more lab tests and should have referred Kinchen to a kidney specialist. The government\u2019s expert, Dr. Lamarche, essentially testified that more testing or a referral most likely would not have changed the course of treatment or the course of plaintiff\u2019s kidney disease. We agree with the government that the causation finding is a factual finding subject to review for clear error. We cannot say that the district court\u2019s finding on this issue was clearly erroneous, that the court erred in giving more weight to the government\u2019s expert witness, given Lamarche\u2019s credentials and the substance of his testimony, or that the district court misunderstood the legal standard for causation under applicable Louisiana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b259-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
