Garcia is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(c)(3); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a). The district court dismissed Garcia\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i)-(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Garcia asserts that the district court mistakenly assumed that the prison was on \u201clock-down\u201d status or that the dining hall was full, erred in finding his assertions of the defendants\u2019 involvement to be \u201cconclusory\u201d and \u201cunsupported,\u201d erred in addressing his claim of \u201csevere\u201d living conditions, and erred in finding his claim of denial of access to the law library unlikely. He also asserts that the district court was biased.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Based upon our review of the record, we conclude that Garcia has not shown a non-frivolous issue for appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). We uphold the district court\u2019s order certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith. We also conclude that the instant appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. Garcia\u2019s motion to proceed IFP is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 and n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">The dismissal of Garcia\u2019s complaint in the district court and the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous each count as a \u201cstrike\u201d for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). We caution Garcia that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b314-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
