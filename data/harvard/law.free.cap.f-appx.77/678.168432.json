Because we find that the district court did not make adequate factual findings as to one aspect of its sentencing determination, we affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-13\">The charges against White arose from an FBI investigation into a burglary ring that committed various thefts of commercial supplies and equipment from asphalt plants, aggregate plants and other construction sites in several southeastern states. During the course of the federal investigation, White gave a signed and dated statement to FBI agent George Glorioso in which he admitted his illegal activities. In this statement, White noted that he purchased stolen equipment on fifteen to twenty occasions over the course of six to eight years from Jamie Coleman. He further stated that he became aware that the goods he bought were stolen on about his second or third purchase from Coleman. White stated he purchased items such as generators, construction tools, grinders and hand tools at well below fair market value. In the FBI statement, White also admitted that he purchased stolen property from his brother, Tommy White, on another fifteen to twenty occasions. Tommy White had purchased the items originally from Coleman. White further stated that on one occasion, he bought stolen items from Richard Averson that were originally stolen by Coleman. This purchase included two saws and a large socket set.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-16\">The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d) devoted one numbered paragraph (\u00b6 21) and an additional sentence (in \u00b6 13) to White\u2019s specific criminal activities. Paragraph 21 is based on the signed FBI statement described above. This paragraph, which is critical to the issues White raises on appeal, reads in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-17\">On March 22, 2001, William Dale White gave authorities [agent Glorioso] a signed statement concerning his involvement in interstate transportation of stolen property. William White admitted purchasing stolen property (various tools and equipment) from Frankie Coleman for the past ten years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> William <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>White also advised he had directly purchased stolen property from Frankie Coleman on about 15 to 20 occasions. William White also advised he had purchased stolen property indirectly, through his brother Tommy Mitchell White, from Frankie Coleman on another 15 to 20 occasions. White gave investigators several receipts that documented the transactions conducted with Frankie Coleman.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Evidence indicates the loss amount attributable to William White is at least $1,000,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-4\">(JA 137).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The relevant sentence in \u00b6 13 of the PSR states that \u201cauthorities determined\u201d that White was the \u201cfence primarily responsible\u201d for the smaller equipment stolen by Coleman, such as generators, grinders, and tools. The PSR states that co-conspirators Richard Averson and Louie Averson were the fence \u201cprimarily responsible\u201d for the larger types of equipment stolen by Coleman, such as electromagnetic starters, reducers and breakers.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">In formulating White\u2019s sentence under the 2000 edition of the <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the probation officer increased White\u2019s offense level by thirteen levels pursuant to \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(N) because the probation officer concluded the monetary loss amount attributable to White was between $800,000 and $1,500,000, apparently representing the entire loss amount caused by the conspiracy as a whole. The PSR further indicated that White deserved a four-level enhancement under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(4)(B) for being \u201cin the business\u201d (\u201cITB\u201d) of receiving and selling stolen property.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">White filed written objections to the PSR\u2019s determination of both the attributable loss amount and the ITB enhancement. White also specifically objected to the PSR\u2019s sentence in \u00b6 13, which stated White was the \u201cfence primarily responsible\u201d for Coleman\u2019s smaller stolen items, such as welders, generators and hand tools. With regard to the amount of loss, White argued that he \u201ccould not reasonably foresee the totality of Frankie Coleman\u2019s thefts\u201d and that, while he purchased small items, \u201che was not involved in the more sophisticated items that were stolen.\u201d (JA 158). Therefore, he asserted the PSR improperly attributed the conspiracy\u2019s total loss of between $800,000 and $1,500,000 to him. Despite the objections, no changes were made to the PSR on these points.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-11\">At the sentencing hearing, White noted and argued the same objections he made to the PSR and testified in support of these objections. His testimony contradicted, or was at least inconsistent with, some of the information in his statement to agent Glorioso. Specifically, he stated at the hearing that he only purchased items from Coleman on \u201cfive\u201d occasions (not \u201cfifteen to twenty occasions\u201d) and that the purchases consisted of \u201cfour or five\u201d truckloads of items. (JA 96-97). However, he testified that he did not \u201cmake it a business practice\u201d to purchase Coleman\u2019s stolen items. (JA 97). White estimated that each time he paid \u201cbetween $800 to 17-$1,800\u201d for merchandise that was actually worth \u201c$1,500 [or] $2,500.\u201d (JA 98, 107). In total, White testified that the items he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>bought from Coleman were worth \u201caround five, six thousand dollars.\u201d (JA108). The district court summarily overruled White\u2019s objections and adopted the PSR without making any separate factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">The standard of review for sentencing decisions operates on a flexible sliding scale. <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217 (4th Cir.1989). In general, this Court reviews a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its application of the guidelines de novo. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">White argues that the district court clearly erred by relying entirely on the PSR without making any specific findings of fact on the amount of loss attributable to him. White asserts that under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B) (2000) and its interpretive case law, the district court should have made specific factual findings on the scope of White\u2019s agreement with the other conspirators and the reasonable foreseeability of their conduct to him. In the absence of such factual findings, White asserts, the district court could not attribute the entire loss amount of the conspiracy to him. Because the district court \u201cdeclined to assess [his] role in the overall conspiracy,\u201d White argues that the sentence must be vacated and the case remanded for specific factual findings on the amount of loss. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">The \u201crelevant conduct\u201d provisions of USSG \u00a7 1B1.3 state that the base offense and specific offense characteristics shall be determined on the basis of \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken activity.\u201d As the relevant conduct determines the offense level for finding the sentencing range, so too does the loss caused by the relevant conduct. USSG \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(3); <em>see also </em>USSG \u00a7 2Bl.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">As the Application Notes to \u00a7 1B1.3 point out,\u201d[t]he principles and limits of sentencing accountability under this guideline are not always the same as the principles and limits of criminal liability.\u201d USSG \u00a7 1B1.3, comment. (n.l). And although relevant conduct for purposes of determining the offense level may be broader than the conduct supporting the offense of conviction, it may also be narrower. Thus, the Application Notes provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-10\">Because a count may be worded broadly and include the conduct of many participants over a period of time, the scope of the criminal activity jointly undertaken by the defendant (the \u201cjointly undertaken criminal activity\u201d) is not necessarily the same as the scope of the entire conspiracy, and hence relevant conduct is not necessarily the same for every participant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">USSG \u00a7 1B1.3, comment, (n.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-12\">Focusing particularly on the offense of conspiracy, the Application Notes point out that the defendant\u2019s relevant conduct may not extend to all the conduct of the conspiracy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-13\">A defendant\u2019s relevant conduct does not include the conduct of members of a conspiracy prior to the defendant joining the conspiracy, even if the defendant knows of that conduct (e.g., in the case of a defendant who joins an ongoing drug distribution conspiracy knowing that it had been selling two kilograms of cocaine per week, the cocaine sold prior to the defendant joining the conspiracy is not included as relevant conduct in determining the defendant\u2019s offense level).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-14\"><em>Id.; accord United States v. Bolden, </em>325 F.3d 471, 499 (4th Cir.2003) (vacating sentence because neither PSR nor district court made \u201c <em>\u2018particularized </em>findings with respect to both the scope of the defendant\u2019s agreement <em>and </em>the foreseeability of his co-conspirators\u2019 conduct before holding defendant accountable for the scope of the entire conspiracy\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number><em>States v. Campbell, </em>279 F.3d 392, 400 (6th Cir.2002) (emphasis in original)); <em>United States v. Hammond, </em>201 F.3d 346, 351 (5th Cir.1999) (vacating sentence which attributed to defendant losses incurred by third parties because PSR, upon which district court relied, did not contain the \u201cabsolute prerequisite\u201d factual findings as to the scope of joint undertaking or foreseeability of losses); <em>see also United States v. Gilliam, </em>987 F.2d 1009, 1012-13 (4th Cir. 1993) (\u201cin order to attribute to a defendant for sentencing purposes the acts of others in jointly-undertaken criminal activity, those acts must have been within the scope of the defendant\u2019s agreement and must have been reasonably foreseeable to the defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">We have reviewed the PSR adopted by the district court and conclude it contains insufficient information on White\u2019s relevant conduct under \u00a7 1B1.3. The PSR does not, as required by \u00a7 1B1.3, make any particularized factual findings on both \u201cthe scope of the defendant\u2019s agreement\u201d and \u201cthe foreseeability of his co-conspirators\u2019 conduct before holding the defendant accountable for the scope of the entire conspiracy.\u201d <em>Bolden, </em>325 F.3d at 499 (citations omitted). The failure to make these particularized findings makes the sentencing court\u2019s loss determination \u201cinadequate,\u201d requiring remand. <em>Id. </em>at 500, 505. As White points out in his brief, the district court and the probation officer apparently concluded that because White was convicted for conspiracy, he may be automatically charged with the entire amount of loss caused by the conspiracy. However, as the commentary to \u00a7 1B1.3 and <em>Bolden </em>make clear, the amount of loss cannot be decided in this summary fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">The commentary to the 2002 <em>Guidelines Manual </em>clarifies the standard for determining whether a defendant warrants an ITB enhancement. Specifically, the Sentencing Commission adopted a \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d test. The district court, in applying this test, is directed to the following factors: (1) the regularity and sophistication of the defendant\u2019s activities; (2) the value and size of the inventory of the stolen property; (3) the extent to which the defendant\u2019s activities encouraged or facilitated other crimes; and (4) the defendant\u2019s past activities in stolen property. <em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.4) (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">We conclude that White\u2019s PSR, and the FBI statement upon which it is based, contain sufficient factual findings to sustain the ITB enhancement. White was involved in purchasing stolen property numerous times over a course of six to eight years. White bought items from several different people charged in the conspiracy. White purposely bought the items well below fair market value so that he could resell them for a profit. In our view, the determination that White was \u201cin the business\u201d of receiving and selling stolen property is not clearly erroneous. We therefore affirm that aspect of the district court\u2019s sentencing determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">For all of the foregoing reasons, we affirm in part, vacate in part and remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion. We express no view on the amount of loss actually attributable to White relative to his individual role. We affirm the district court\u2019s determination as to the four-level ITB enhancement. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b713-14\">. The ten years figure is apparently an error on the part of the probation officer. White\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>FBI statement indicates that the amount of time in question is actually six to eight years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b714-8\"><em>. </em>The \"receipts\u201d to which the PSR refers are mentioned in somewhat more detail in the actual statement White gave to the FBI. In the statement, White declares that: \"on several occasions, I completed receipts for the purchases from Coleman or bill of sale. I have furnished the interviewing agent [Glorioso] with the bill of sales for four purchases.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b714-13\">.
