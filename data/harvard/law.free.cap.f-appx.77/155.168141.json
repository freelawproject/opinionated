The district court based this award on its finding that Harshbarger\u2019s attorneys, Jack Gould and Christopher Schewe, introduced prejudicial evidence in the presence of the jury that the court had excluded by its prior evidentiary rulings and that Harshbarger\u2019s attorneys had assured the court would not be offered into evidence. We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand with instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">This appeal arises from an incident which occurred during the trial of Mrs. Harshbarger\u2019s suit against her employer, claiming workplace sexual harassment for the conduct of her supervisor, William Tadlock, a former employee. The Group is in the business of coordinating doctors as independent contractors to evaluate insurance claims, providing medical transcription services for those doctors, and reporting their medical findings to insurance providers. Before trial, the Group brought a motion in limine to exclude certain medical reports identified as Plaintiffs Exhibit 12. It later withdrew the motion but, as the district court related, the Group\u2019s general objection to the introduction of such evidence [referring to the medical reports] had not been withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">During the direct examination of plaintiffs witness, Christine Hall, Gould asked her to identify Plaintiffs Exhibit 12, the medical reports which were the subject of the Group\u2019s abandoned motion in limine. Linda Jackson, counsel for the Group, objected to the question on the ground that the medical reports were irrelevant. The district court held a sidebar conference on Mrs. Jackson\u2019s objection. At the sidebar conference, Mrs. Jackson asked for a proffer of the evidence Gould sought to introduce through the reports and Hall\u2019s testimony about the reports. Gould stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-12\">The proffer, in general terms, Your Honor, is to show, shall we say, less than above-board practices by high up people in the company, which I think affects the credibility of the principals [of the Group] and Mr. Tadlock____[Occasionally, routinely, [medical] reports would be changed, either by Mr. Puleio [a principal of the Group] or by Mr. Tadlock, without the doctor\u2019s approval. And the doctor\u2019s name would be signed by Tad-lock, or at his direction, by this lady, this witness. And that\u2019s what the testimony has to do with.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-14\">The court later inquired into the relevance of the proffered evidence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-15\">Court: What does all of this have to do with sexual harassment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-16\">Schewe: Nothing directly. It has to do with credibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-17\">Court: Of whom, the corporation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-18\">Gould: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-19\">Court: Generally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-20\">Gould: Well, of the three directors, of two of the three directors, Tadlock and Puleio.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-21\">Mrs. Jackson indicated that the Group would withdraw its objection to the medical reports if two conditions were satisfied. First, the Group sought to use the deposition testimony of Ronald Puleio, a principal of the Group, to explain why the alterations to the medical reports were not fraudulent. Second, the Group planned to offer evidence that the witness, Christine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Hall, had stolen the medical reports from the Group and had provided them to other female employees who used them as leverage in negotiations for settlement of their sexual harassment claims against the Group.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">The court again questioned the probative value of the medical reports and also considered whether the conditions the Group imposed upon its stipulation to the admissibility of the reports could be satisfied.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">Court: Let me say this ... I don\u2019t see how this tends to prove or disprove sexual harassment. I don\u2019t know if it has anything to do with the termination, why she was terminated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">Gould: It does not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">Court: And to generally impugn the integrity of a company generally, I don\u2019t see where it helps the jury decide whether or not there as a hostile work environment to which Ms. Hall or the plaintiff was subjected. So, if you all agree you want it in, I\u2019ll let it in, but I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s relevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-8\">Jackson: Again, I don\u2019t have a problem, as long as we\u2019re allowed to bring in those two points.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-9\">Court: I understand what you said. To me, it creates a whole separate issue that does not help to define the trial, to me, but if you all want it in, I\u2019ll\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-10\">Gould: I certainly object to reading in deposition testimony of a principal of the company [Puleio] who has been down here since Tadloek was fired, many times, and who could come down for this trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-11\">Gould: [W]e won\u2019t use [the medical reports] in our case-in-chief. I may only use them, if appropriate, in rebuttal, and it may not be appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-12\">Court: Okay</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-13\">Jackson: I don\u2019t think that gives me the kind of confirmation that I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-14\">Court: Well, I really have questions about whether or not [Ronald Puleio], being in New York, is unavailable for purposes of civil trial, under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [such that his deposition testimony would be admissible], If you can show me a case or rule that says that, I\u2019ll certainly consider it. Jackson: In that case ... I would like the Court to issue a ruling, if it could, now, on the relevance of the documents. In that case, I would maintain my objection, the relevance, undue prejudice, this is not related to issues in the case\u2014 Gould: We withdraw them [the medical reports].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-15\">Jackson: It would distract the jury from the main issues in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-16\">So, I\u2019m renewing our motion in limine. Court: At this moment, as I understand it, the plaintiff is not going to offer this testimony. So I\u2019m, not going to make an academic ruling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-17\">The district court concluded that \u201cthe allegedly altered medical reports would not to be presented during the trial in any light, most notably not for use in attacking the credibility of the company or its principals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-18\">Again, in his redirect examination of Christine Hall, Gould asked questions which appeared to elicit testimony regarding the allegedly falsified medical reports, prompting the court to interrupt the questioning.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-19\">Gould: You were accused of wrongdoing by the company, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Witness: I was accused of checks. I never knew what checks. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-5\">Gould: Did you have any conversations with Mr. Sheehy or Mr. Puleio, or both of them, about any improprieties in the office after Tadlock was dismissed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-6\">Witness: What do you mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">Court: You [Gould] may be asking to go to something else, but the question is so open-ended it seems to open up the issues of those reports and fabrications, which I don\u2019t really want to hold a trial on. What are you going into?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-8\">Gould: [T]hey have attacked her credibility, or honesty, and they used the word \u201cembezzlement\u201d ... when she was cross-examined____What I want to do is to show that she came forward\u2014after Mr. Tadlock was gone, she no longer had a fear of him, and she brought to their attention certain dishonest practices that she thought should be corrected. But I think I have to be able to rehabilitate her. And it has to do\u2014I know it has to do with not only the report that we talked about earlier at the bench, but she will testify that she told them routinely, routinely Tadlock used to change records. And she told them that, and they said to do things different.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-11\">Jackson: Same objection, Your Honor. Those medical reports were stolen to extort a settlement from the company. They had nothing to do with\u2014they had nothing to do with the sexual harassment issues.... If these medical records come up, they are not related to the substantive charges here. These medical records were taken from the office to extort a settlement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-12\">Schewe: We\u2019re not putting records in; just going to ask her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-13\">Court: No, I\u2019m not going to have a mini trial on this. [Defendant\u2019s] [objection sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-14\">The district court concluded based on this sidebar conference that it was objectively evident that the court had ruled that the disputed medical reports were inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-15\">Later, during the Group\u2019s direct examination of Tadlock, Mrs. Jackson asked about vulgar jokes that had been told in the office and, in particular, vulgar jokes told to Group employees by doctors working as independent contractors for the Group. Tadlock responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-16\">I think you and the jury need to understand that Professional Evaluation Group has an immaculate reputation as a leading medical group in this area, in the Washington, D.C. area, and is looked upon extremely favorably and as an extremely professional organization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-17\">Later, during Gould\u2019s cross-examination of Tadlock, Gould asked Tadlock about this assessment of the Group\u2019s reputation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AB_\">Gould: And ... you told us yesterday, and I want to make sure that I\u2019m correct, you told us that the company had an immaculate professional reputation; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-18\">Mr. Tadlock: In my opinion it did, yes. Gould: Is it not correct, Mr. Tadlock, that you routinely altered medical\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-19\">Mrs. Jackson\u2019s immediate objection on behalf of the Group interrupted Gould\u2019s question and the court held a bench conference on her objection. During that conference, Jackson moved for a mistrial, which the court subsequently granted. In defense of his conduct, Gould argued that Tadlock\u2019s testimony that the Group had an \u201cimmaculate reputation\u201d opened the door <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>to his impeachment as a principal of the Group who allegedly participated in falsifying the medical reports. Gould argued to the district court that he understood the court\u2019s earlier rulings about the medical reports to extend only to their admissibility in the plaintiffs case-in-chief and not to their admissibility for purposes of impeachment. Gould also emphasized that he did not seek to introduce the medical reports themselves as extrinsic evidence of the allegedly fraudulent alterations, but only to ask Tadlock whether he had altered them.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">The district court concluded that Tad-lock\u2019s statements about the nature of the company\u2019s reputation did not open the door to impeachment using the medical reports. The district court further noted that Gould failed to approach the bench and request reconsideration of the prior evidentiary ruling before asking the question. The district court concluded that a curative instruction would not remedy the prejudice caused by the question and granted the Group\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The Group also moved for attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The district court found that \u201cplaintiffs counsel recklessly flouted the Court\u2019s ruling and multiplied the proceedings by placing inadmissible evidence before the jury after being directed by the court not to do so.\u201d The district court further noted that plaintiffs counsel had withdrawn \u201cthe same evidence from use in any capacity in the trial during sidebar conferences.... \u201d Finally, the district court noted that the conduct of plaintiff\u2019s counsel multiplied the proceedings, resulting in excess costs to the Group. Based on these findings, the district court exercised its authority pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927 to grant the Group\u2019s motion and ordered both Gould and Schewe to \u201cpay, in equal proportions, the amount of $17,677.86 to Defendant.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">Subsequent to the mistrial, the district court ordered the parties to mediate before another district judge. As a result of those negotiations, Mrs. Harshbarger reached a settlement of her claims with the Group and entered a voluntary dismissal of her suit. Accordingly, neither party appeals from the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings or its judgment granting a mistrial. The only issue presented by this appeal is the propriety of the district court\u2019s order granting attorney\u2019s fees and costs to the Group against attorneys Gould and Schewe pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">We first address Schewe\u2019s argument that the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees against him was without proper notice, in violation of his due process rights. Jackson\u2019s oral motion for attorney\u2019s fees in open court requested that attorney\u2019s fees be assessed either against Mrs. Harshbarger \u201cor her counsel,\u201d without specifying whether the Group sought sanctions against the plaintiff, or Gould, or Schewe, or both, of plaintiffs counsel. The district court\u2019s scheduling instruction from the bench, however, stated that the court would give Mrs. Jackson until June 2nd to file her itemization of fees and costs, and \u201cgive <em>Mr. Gould </em>until the 9th [of June] to submit his opposition [to the Group\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees].\u201d (emphasis added) The Group clearly understood this to mean that only sanctions against Gould would be considered by the court, as demonstrated by the written motion for attorney\u2019s fees the Group later submitted to the court which sought sanctions only against Gould. Although Schewe attended the sanctions hearing and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>testified, the memoranda filed by Mrs. Harshbarger, through counsel, in opposition to the motion for sanctions only presented arguments against the imposition of sanctions against Gould. (Memoranda in district court record)</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">\u201cLike other sanctions, attorney\u2019s fees should not be assessed lightly or without fair notice____\u201d <em>Roadway Express, Inc. v. Piper, </em>447 U.S. 752, 767, 100 S.Ct. 2455, 65 L.Ed.2d <em>488 </em>(1980). See also <em>Kunstler v. Britt, </em>914 F.2d 505, 522 (4th Cir.1990) (reversing Rule 11 sanctions against plaintiff\u2019s attorneys because they were not given adequate opportunity to respond to defendant\u2019s previously submitted fee statements as required by due process). Because Schewe had no notice that the district court was considering sanctions against him and no opportunity to present the district court with his argument against the sanctions, we vacate the imposition of attorney\u2019s fees and costs against Schewe.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">We now consider Gould\u2019s argument that his conduct did not warrant sanctions. The district court sanctioned Gould under the authority to award statutory attorney\u2019s fees conferred by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927 which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-10\">Any attorney or other person admitted to conduct cases in any court of the United States ... who so multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously may be required by the Court to satisfy personally the excess costs, expenses, and attorney\u2019s fees reasonably incurred because of such conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1927 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">\u201cSection 1927 focuses on the conduct of the litigation and not on its merits.\u201d <em>De-Bauche v. Trani, </em>191 F.3d 499, 511 (4th Cir.1999). Merely negligent conduct will not support an imposition of sanctions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927. See <em>United States v. Wallace, </em>964 F.2d 1214, 1219 (D.C.Cir. 1992). Instead, \u00a7 1927 requires \u201ca finding of counsel\u2019s bad faith as a precondition to the imposition of fees.\u201d See <em>Chaudhry v. Gallerizzo, </em>174 F.3d 394, 411 n. 14 (4th Cir.1999) (internal quotations omitted). Thus, \u00a7 1927 authorizes sanctions only when counsel\u2019s bad faith conduct multiplies the proceedings, resulting in excess costs for the opposing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-14\">A district court\u2019s decision to impose sanctions is entitled to substantial deference because the district court \u201cis in the best position to review the factual circumstances and render an informed judgment as [it] is intimately involved with the case, the litigants, and the attorneys on a daily basis.\u201d <em>Blue v. United States Dep\u2019t of the Army, </em>914 F.2d 525, 538 (4th Cir.1990) (internal quotations omitted) (alteration in original). We review the district court\u2019s decision to impose sanctions under \u00a7 1927 for an abuse of discretion. <em>Chaudhry v. Gallerizzo, </em>174 F.3d 394, 410 (4th Cir. 1999); see <em>Miltier v. Beorn, </em>896 F.2d 848, 853 (4th Cir.1990). A district court\u2019s finding of bad faith, however, is a factual finding subject to review only for clear error. See <em>Wallace, </em>964 F.2d at 1217.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-15\">Gould argues on appeal that the district court abused its discretion by imposing sanctions against him on the grounds that his question to Tadlock about the medical reports was a vexatious, unreasonable, and bad-faith violation of the court\u2019s evidentiary rulings. Gould asserts that the district court\u2019s rulings did not clearly prohibit him from asking questions about the medical reports for the purpose of impeachment. Gould further argues that he did not, as the district court concluded, represent to the court that he would ask no questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>related to the medical reports. We find the argument unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">The district court concluded that in view of the statements made by the court and attorneys in the sidebar conferences at trial, it was objectively unequivocal that the court had ruled that the medical reports and related testimony were inadmissible. We agree. At the second sidebar conference conducted on the issue of the medical reports, after the district court interrupted a question which appeared to elicit testimony about the medical reports, Mrs. Jackson renewed her objection to the medical reports. At that time the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-5\">MR. SCHEWE: We\u2019re not putting records in, just going to ask her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-6\">COURT: No, I\u2019m not going to have a mini-trial on this. [Defendant\u2019s] [objection sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Thus, we agree with the district court that \u201cit was objectively unequivocal that the allegedly altered medical reports were not to be used as evidence in the trial or for any other purpose ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">Gould further argues that, even if the district court ruled that testimony about the medical reports was not admissible on the merits, the court had not ruled on the permissibility of questions about the reports in cross-examination for the purpose of impeachment. We find this argument unconvincing for the same reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">Additionally, the Federal Rules of Evidence state that specific instances of conduct may be inquired into on cross-examination <em>\u201cin the discretion of the district court, </em>if probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness\u201d of the witness or of another witness. Fed.R.Evid. 608(b) (emphasis added). The district court\u2019s discretion to allow impeachment of a witness with specific instances of conduct is guided by Rule 403. Rule 403 empowers a trial court to exclude evidence if the probative value of that evidence is outweighed by the unfair prejudice it creates or by its tendency to cause confusion of the issues or to otherwise mislead the jury. Fed.R.Evid. 403. The Rules Advisory Committee\u2019s note to Rule 608(b) clarifies that \u201cthe overriding protection of Rule 403\u201d acts as a safeguard against abuse of Rule 608. See Fed. R.Evid. 608(b) advisory committee\u2019s note; 28 Wright &amp; Gold, <em>Fed. Practice and Procedure: </em>Evid. \u00a7 6118 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">As stated, Gould argued that the medical reports were admissible because they were probative of Tadlock\u2019s credibility, even though they were not relevant to the merits of the trial. The basis of Mrs. Jackson\u2019s original objection to the medical reports on behalf of the Group, which she subsequently renewed in opposition to Gould\u2019s redirect question eliciting testimony about the reports, was that the reports were irrelevant and prejudicial and that they would distract the jury from the main issues in the case. In response, the district court noted in the first sidebar conference that the reports \u201ccreated a whole separate issue that [did] not help to define the trial.\u201d After the second sidebar conference, the district court clearly sustained Mrs. Jackson\u2019s objection that the medical reports and related questions did not survive Rule 403 scrutiny. We conclude that a reasonable attorney would have been put on notice that questions concerning the medical reports for purposes of impeachment were prohibited because the district court had ruled that the prejudice and confusion of the issues that would result from testimony about the reports would outweigh their probative value for the issue of Tadlock\u2019s credibility. The district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to admit the evidence for the purpose of impeachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Gould also argues that the district court erred by concluding that he had represented to the court that he would not elicit testimony about the reports and by considering that representation, which the court concluded was misleading, as an additional basis for sanctions. Gould argues that he expressly reserved the possibility that he would raise the issue of the medical reports later in the trial when he stated to the court that \u201cwe won\u2019t use [the medical reports] in our case-in-chief. I may only use them, if appropriate, in rebuttal, and it may not be appropriate.\u201d The sidebar did not end there, however. After Gould\u2019s representation to the court that he would only use the medical reports in rebuttal, Mrs. Jackson, concerned that she would not be able to use the deposition testimony of Puleio to explain the alleged alterations to the medical reports, asked for a clear ruling from the court on her objection to the \u201crelevance and undue prejudice\u201d caused by the reports. At that point, Gould interrupted Mrs. Jackson\u2019s explanation for the basis of her objection, stating that \u201c[w]e withdraw them [the medical reports].\u201d On the basis of this statement, the court declined to rule on Mrs. Jackson\u2019s objection because such a ruling would be academic in light of the court\u2019s understanding that Gould was \u201cnot going to offer this testimony.\u201d In summary, Gould reserved the right to raise the medical reports later in trial, to which possibility Jackson objected and sought an immediate ruling on the admissibility of the reports, prompting Gould to revise his statement and unconditionally withdraw the medical reports. We agree with the district court that Gould represented to the court that he would not pursue questions about the medical reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">We also find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s finding that Gould acted vexatiously and unreasonably. For reasons already discussed, we agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that Gould represented to the court that he would not offer evidence about the medical reports. Gould tried to ask a question about the medical reports once without consulting the court and forced the court to interrupt his questioning and hold a sidebar conference which culminated in a clear ruling that testimony regarding the reports was inadmissible. Schewe testified at a hearing on the motion for sanctions that he and Gould consulted the night before the final day of trial and developed a plan to admit testimony about the medical reports as impeachment of Tadlock. He also testified that he and Gould had arranged for witnesses to be present to testify about the alleged alterations to the medical reports, should Tadlock deny the alterations on cross-examination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We find no error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that the conduct of an experienced attorney who asks a forbidden question on these facts is in bad faith. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by awarding sanctions against Gould for unreasonable and vexatious conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Finally, Gould argues that his conduct did not result in multiplication of the proceedings or excess costs as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927. The district court concluded that Gould\u2019s disregard for the rulings of the court converted the last day of trial into a hearing on the motion for mistrial and awarded attorney\u2019s fees and costs to the Group reflecting the cost of the third day of trial. Gould speculates that completion of the trial would have taken as long as the hearings on the mistrial and that no additional proceedings were required. The effect of the mistrial, howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>er, was to end the trial prematurely, leaving both Mrs. Harshbarger and the Group without resolution of the underlying claim. Gould\u2019s conjecture that the trial on the merits, if not cut short by the mistrial ruling, would have lasted as long as the hearing on the mistrial, ignores the fundamental distinction between conclusion of a trial on the merits and a mistrial. The attorney\u2019s costs incurred by the Group for the mistrial proceedings were in no way related to the merits of its defense and were not expenses that the Group would have incurred absent Gould\u2019s conduct. We agree with the district court that Gould multiplied the proceedings resulting in excess costs for PEG within the meaning of \u00a7 1927. Gould also challenges the district court\u2019s calculation of the excess costs, expenses and attorney\u2019s fees incurred because of the mistrial. We review the district court\u2019s order for abuse of discretion, however, and find no such abuse here.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">In summary, the district court\u2019s order is vacated to the extent that it awards attorney\u2019s fees and costs against Schewe and affirmed to the extent that it awards attorney\u2019s fees and costs against Gould. Because the district court\u2019s order instructed Schewe and Gould to pay the sum of $17,677.86 in equal proportions, we eliminate half of that award to reflect Schewe\u2019s contribution, and remand to the district court to award $8,838.93 in attorney\u2019s fees, costs and expenses against Gould, consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b194-6\">. No question is made as to the amount of $17,677.86.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b197-5\">. Schewe testified that he did not believe Rule 608 prohibited extrinsic evidence such as testimony offered to prove prior conduct denied by a witness on cross-examination.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
