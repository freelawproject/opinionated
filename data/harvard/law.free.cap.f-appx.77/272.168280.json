Alvarado\u2019s pre-sentence report did not include any conviction that qualified as an aggravated felony for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). He maintains that he was subject only to the provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1). As Alvarado concedes, his sentence does not exceed the maximum under that clause, so his conviction and sentence for violating 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) did not amount to plain error because it did not affect his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Ramirez-Velasquez, </em>322 F.3d 868, 879 (5th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, \u2014 S.Ct. -, \u2014 L.Ed.2d -, 2003 WL 21314203 (2003). The aggravated-felony provision of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is merely a penalty provision and does not define a separate crime. <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 226, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"A8o\">Alvarado contends that the district court erred in applying a 16-level enhancement to his sentence based on his prior battery conviction. As Alvarado concedes, his battery conviction warrants a 16-level enhancement under the literal terms of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). Alvarado has not established that \u201cclear contrary legislative intention\u201d required the district court to read the amended guideline in a manner that contradicted its \u201cplain language.\u201d <em>See United States v. Scrimgeour, </em>636 F.2d 1019, 1022-23 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-15\">Furthermore, Alvarado maintains that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional. <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). This court must follow the precedent set in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b307-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
