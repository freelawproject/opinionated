They argue that the immigration judge erred by questioning Mr. Shafiq\u2019s credibility. As the Shafiqs have not shown they are eligible for refugee status, any error in the immigration judge\u2019s credibility assessment was harmless. <em>See Iredia v. I.N.S., </em>981 F.2d 847, 849 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">They also argue that their fear of being persecuted upon removal is well-founded. However, Mr. Shafiq admitted that nobody outside of the immediate region from which he hails has any reason to want to persecute them. Their fear is therefore not well-founded. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(C)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">We have reviewed the record and the briefs and determine that the immigration judge\u2019s decision, which the Board affirmed, is supported by substantial evidence and that the evidence in the record does not compel a contrary conclusion. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903-05 (5th Cir. 2002); <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302-04 (5th Cir.1997). Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b787-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
