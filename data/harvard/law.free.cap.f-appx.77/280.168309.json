They argue that their arrest was unreasonable under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments because Nixon had no warrant or probable cause to arrest them inside their hotel room and the alleged Class C misdemean- or city ordinance fire code violation was not committed in Nixon\u2019s presence or view.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-17\">Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with any affidavits filed in support of the motion, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-18\">The McGaughys\u2019 argument that their arrest was \u201cper se unreasonable\u201d under the Fourth Amendment because Nixon had no warrant and the alleged misdemeanor was not committed in Nixon\u2019s view or presence is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>Fields v. City of South Houston, Texas, </em>922 F.2d 1183, 1189 (5th Cir.1991). Although the Constitution does not require a warrant for misdemeanors not committed in the presence of the arresting officer, it does require that such an arrest be supported by probable cause. <em>See id. </em>Probable cause exists \u201cwhen the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>totality of the facts and circumstances within a police officer\u2019s knowledge at the moment of arrest are sufficient for a reasonable person to conclude that the suspect had committed or was committing an offense.\u201d <em>Glenn v. City of Tyler, </em>242 F.3d 307, 313 (5th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). A police officer is entitled to qualified immunity for an arrest if a reasonable person in the officer\u2019s position could have believed he had probable cause to arrest. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">As the district court determined, it was undisputed that a fire was set in the McGaughys\u2019 hotel room. The McGaughys admit that there was a faint odor of smoke when Nixon entered the hotel room and that he discovered some burnt paper in a waste basket. There was also no dispute that hotel personnel found it necessary to alert the police and fire departments regarding the fire. The record also shows that hotel employee Roberto Dorta informed Nixon, upon his arrival at the hotel, of suspicious actions on the part of the McGaughys. Based on the above undisputed facts, Nixon\u2019s arrest of the McGaughys was at least \u201carguably reasonable.\u201d <em>See Glenn, </em>242 F.3d at 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Contrary to the McGaughys\u2019 contentions, Nixon was not required to accept the McGaughys\u2019 explanation that the fire was accidental \u201cif the surrounding circumstances would validly lead a reasonable officer to conclude that [a crime had been committed].\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 313 n. 3. Furthermore, \u201cprobable cause is not destroyed by a suspect\u2019s denial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Although the McGaughys also assert that it was never proved that a violation of any law occurred, probable cause does not require proof beyond a reasonable doubt, but only a showing of the probability of criminal activity. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>941 F.2d 1300, 1302 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Although the McGaughys complain that Nixon entered the room without knocking, without consent, and -without a warrant, the fact that their hotel room was potentially on fire constituted an \u201cexigent circumstance\u201d rendering Nixon\u2019s warrant-less entry into the room reasonable. <em>See Michigan v. Tyler, </em>436 U.S. 499, 511, 98 S.Ct. 1942, 56 L.Ed.2d 486 (1978). Although the McGaughys contend that, after entering the room and confirming that there was no fire, Nixon was required to leave and obtain an arrest warrant, they rely on authority that did not involve exigent circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">In their reply brief, the McGaughys argue that the City should be held liable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for Nixon\u2019s alleged unconstitutional actions. Because the McGaughys did not brief their municipal-liability claims against the City in their opening brief, those claims have been waived. <em>See Cinel v. Connick, </em>15 F.3d 1338, 1345 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">Based on the foregoing, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b315-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
