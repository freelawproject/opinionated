The Government moves to dismiss the appeal because the petition for review was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-16\">An alien must file his petition for review \u201cnot later than 30 days after the date of the final order of removal.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). The 30-day filing deadline is jurisdictional. <em>Navarro-Miranda v. Ashcroft, </em>330 F.3d 672, 676 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-17\">The 30-day deadline began to run in the instant case on November 19, 2002, when the BIA issued its decision and wrote a letter to Liu\u2019s counsel notifying him of the decision. The deadline expired on December 19, 2002. <em>See Karimian-Kaklaki v.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b754-23\"><em>I.N.S., </em>997 F.2d 108, 110-11 (5th Cir.1993). Liu\u2019s petition for review, filed on December 20, 2002, was one day late. Because the petition for review was untimely, this court lacks jurisdiction. <em>See Karimian-Kaklaki, </em>997 F.2d at 111-13; <em>Guirguis v. I.N.S., </em>993 F.2d 508, 509 (5th Cir.1993); <em>see also Navarro-Miranda, </em>330 F.3d at 676. The Government\u2019s motion to dismiss is GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b754-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
