The Osigwes contend that their minor daughter, who is a United States citizen, will be compelled to undergo female genital mutilation (FGM) if the family returns to Nigeria.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-25\">The IJ correctly determined that the Osigwes are not eligible for asylum under the general asylum provisions based solely on their daughter\u2019s risk of being subject to FGM if she is returned to Nigeria. <em>See Jukic v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 747, 749 (5th Cir.1994). However, the Osigwes may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>be eligible for a \u201c \u2018humanitarian\u2019 grant of asylum,\u201d a claim that they raised before the IJ. <em>Krastev v. INS, </em>292 F.3d 1268, 1271 (10th Cir.2002). The Government acknowledges that, the Osigwes have exhausted their administrative remedies with respect to this claim and concedes that the case must be remanded to the BIA to determine in the first instance whether the Osigwes warrant a discretionary grant of humanitarian asylum and withholding of removal. The petition for review is GRANTED with respect to the claims of humanitarian asylum and the withholding of removal claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Although the Osigwes\u2019 citizen child would be subject to the risk of torture if she was returned to Nigeria, the Osigwes do not fall within the parameters of the Convention Against Torture Act based on their knowledge that their daughter faced a risk of being tortured. <em>See Zubeda v. Ashcroft, </em>333 F.3d 463, 471 (3rd Cir.2003). Thus, the petition for review is DENIED with respect to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The Osigwes\u2019 petition for review is GRANTED in part, and the matter is VACATED and REMANDED to the BIA so that the BIA can address the Osigwes\u2019 claims of humanitarian asylum and withholding of removal based on the severity of Mrs. Osigwe\u2019s past persecution or some other serious harm she may experience upon return to Nigeria. <em>See Rivas-Martinez v. INS, </em>997 F.2d 1143, 1148 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">PETITION GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b269-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
