We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">Lakew contends the Board used the wrong legal standard in determining he was not entitled to asylum. We find there are sufficient indications in the Board\u2019s order that it used the proper standard. Lakew farther contends the Board\u2019s findings are not supported by substantial evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal arguments are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
