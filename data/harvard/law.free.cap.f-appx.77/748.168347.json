Dale Willis appeals from the district court\u2019s judgment granting summary judgment to International Paper Company (\u201cIP\u201d) in his wrongful termination suit. IP argues that we lack appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-19\">This court has the authority to hear appeals only from \u201cfinal decisions\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, interlocutory decisions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292, nonfinal judgments certified as final under Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b), or some other nonfinal orders or judgments to which an exception applies. <em>See Briargrove Shopping Ctr. Joint Venture v. Pilgrim Enters., Inc., </em>170 F.3d 536, 538 (5th Cir.1999). The district court\u2019s judgment granted summary judgment to IP on Willis\u2019s wrongful termination claim and also granted summary judgment as to liability on IP\u2019s counterclaim. The district court\u2019s judgment, which concurred with the magistrate judge\u2019s report, left unadjudicated the issue of IP\u2019s damages. Thus, the judgment was not final. <em>See Meadowbriar Home for Children, Inc. v. G.B. Gunn, </em>81 F.3d 521, 528 (5th Cir.1996) (\u201c[A] judgment is not final until both liability and damages are determined.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-20\">The district court did not certify the judgment for immediate appeal pursuant to Fed. R. Crv. P. 54(b), and we discern no exception to the rule of finality applicable to the judgment. We therefor lack appellate jurisdiction to hear the appeal, and the appeal is DISMISSED. Willis\u2019s motion to file his reply brief out-of-time is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-21\">APPEAL DISMISSED. MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b782-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except trader the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
