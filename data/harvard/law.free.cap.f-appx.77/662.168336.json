Spencer\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), alleging sentencing issues, but stating that in his view, the is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>sues were not meritorious. Spencer has filed a pro se supplemental brief challenging his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The Government has filed a motion to dismiss the appeal based on Spencer\u2019s waiver of the right to appeal his sentence contained in his plea agreement. We grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss because Spencer validly waived his right to appeal his sentence, and the only issues raised on appeal challenge Spencer\u2019s sentence. We deny Spencer\u2019s motion for new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
