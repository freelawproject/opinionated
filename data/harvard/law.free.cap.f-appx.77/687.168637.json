As discussed below, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Petitioners first contend that the IJ erred in finding that Gboukrou failed to qualify for withholding of deportation. We have reviewed the record and the IJ\u2019s decision, which was designated by the Board as the final agency determination, and find that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Petitioners did not qualify for this relief based on Gboukrou\u2019s claim. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4) (1994);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(1)(A) (2003); <em>Gonahasa v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 538, 542 (4th Cir. 1999); <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 429-30, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Petitioners next ask that this case be remanded for the taking of new evidence on country conditions in the Ivory Coast. We find that we are barred by the transitional rules applicable here from effecting such a remand. <em>See </em>IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(4)(B). Finally, we reject Petitioners\u2019 challenges to the Board\u2019s decision to affirm the decision of the IJ without opinion under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7) (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">We accordingly deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b721-27\">.

No. 104-128, 110 Stat. 3009, effective April 1, 1997. Because this case was in transition at the time the IIRIRA was passed, \u00a7 1105a(a)(4) is applicable here under the terms of the transitional rules contained in \u00a7 309(c) of the IIRIRA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
