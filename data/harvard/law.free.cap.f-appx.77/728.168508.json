Before his conviction was final, Judd filed a motion to vacate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The district court dismissed the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion as premature. Judd seeks a certificate of appealbility (COA).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-22\">This court must examine the basis of its jurisdiction on its own motion if necessary. <em>See Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). \u201cA timely filed notice of appeal is a jurisdictional prerequisite to [this court\u2019s] review.\u201d <em>Dison v. Whitley, </em>20 F.3d 185, 186 (5th Cir.1994). Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>there is nothing in the record which maybe construed as a timely notice of appeal, this court is thus without jurisdiction to consider this case.
