The relevant facts are not in dispute. We agree with the district court that the plan administrator made a legally correct interpretation of the plan document in denying severance benefits where the beneficiary died, before his employment otherwise terminated as a result of a scheduled reduction in force that followed a change in control. The language of sections 4.1 and 5.2 of the plan provide that severance benefits are not available in such circumstances. We agree with the district court\u2019s analysis of the relevant plan provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-19\">The parties on appeal and the district court do not clearly indicate whether they think de novo or abuse of discretion review is applicable to judicial review of the plan administrator\u2019s decision. The de novo standard applies \u201cunless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.\u201d <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch, </em>489 U.S. 101, 115, 109 S.Ct. 948, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989). The parties point to no language giving the administrator discretionary authority, and appellees conceded below that the de novo standard is applicable. Even under the less deferential de novo standard, we should affirm the administrator\u2019s decision if, as here, there are no material issues of fact in dispute and the administrator\u2019s interpretation of the plan was legally correct. <em>See Dial v.
