Lever appeals the district court\u2019s order accepting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation to affirm the Commissioner\u2019s termination of disability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>income benefits. On appeal, Lever raises three specific issues: (1) whether substantial evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s finding that her medical condition had improved; (2) whether the court erred in affirming the Commissioner\u2019s consideration of her medical condition and ability to perform \u201cpast relevant work\u201d only at the time of the initial cessation determination in February 1998 and not at the time of the ALJ decision in June 1999; and (3) whether the court erred in failing to find that the ALJ did not follow the sequential evaluation analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">We must uphold the district court\u2019s disability determination if it is supported by substantial evidence. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (2000); <em>Hays v. Sullivan, </em>907 F.2d 1453, 1456 (4th Cir.1990). We have reviewed the record in light of Lever\u2019s arguments on appeal and find no reversible error. Furthermore, we find sufficient evidence in the record to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision to terminate benefits based upon medical improvement. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1594 (2003). Accordingly, we affirm the termination of benefits. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
