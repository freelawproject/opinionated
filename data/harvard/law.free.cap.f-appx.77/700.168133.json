Ponce contends that the district court erred in its application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2) by ruling that his eleven prior burglary convictions were not \u201crelated\u201d to one another and, accordingly, considering each of them separately in determining Ponce\u2019s criminal-history score.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-24\">A district court\u2019s determination that cases were consolidated for trial or sentencing is reviewed only for clear error. <em>See United States v. Moreno-Arredondo, </em>255 F.3d 198, 203 n. 10 (5th Cir.2001). \u201c[A] finding that prior cases were \u2018consolidated\u2019 will require either some factual connexity between them, or else a finding that the cases were merged for trial or sentencing\u201d. <em>United States v. Huskey, </em>137 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>283, 288 (5th Cir.1998) (citation omitted). A formal consolidation order is not a prerequisite to a \u201cconsolidation\u201d finding. <em>Id. </em>However, even if factually distinct offenses are sentenced \u201con the same day and/or in the same proceeding\u201d or result in the \u201cimposition of identical, concurrent sentences,\u201d they are not considered related under \u00a7 4A1.2 unless there is a consolidation order. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in finding that Ponce\u2019s eleven prior offenses were not \u201crelated\u201d to one another. Although Ponce pleaded guilty and the state court imposed sentence for all of these offenses on the same day, each offense was prosecuted under a separate cause number and was addressed in a separate judgment, thus suggesting that they should not be considered consolidated for federal sentencing purposes. <em>See Buford v. United States, </em>532 U.S. 59, 64-66, 121 S.Ct. 1276, 149 L.Ed.2d 197 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Ponce also contends that the felony conviction that resulted in his increased sentence under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) was an element of the offense that should have been charged in the indictment. He acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but he seeks to preserve the issue for Supreme Court review in light of the decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Ponce's contention lacks merit because <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b734-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
