Greer argues that the district court abused its discretion by not considering his Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) motion challenging the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation. For the first time on appeal, Greer contends that the district court abused its discretion by not ruling on his motion to compel prior to granting Bramhall\u2019s summary judgment motion. Greer also maintains that the district court erred by finding that his injuries were <em>de minimis </em>and that he was injured because he did not obey Bramhall\u2019s orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">In his Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) motion, Greer challenged the magistrate judge\u2019s findings that his injury was <em>de minimis </em>and that he was injured because he did not obey Bramhall\u2019s orders but did not challenge the magistrate judge\u2019s alternative findings that Bramhall was entitled to official immunity from Greer\u2019s official capacity claims and qualified immunity from Greer\u2019s personal capacity claims. As the magistrate judge\u2019s alternative findings on official and qualified immunity were sufficient, by themselves, to support the grant of summary judgment to Bramhall, Greer was not prejudiced by the failure of the district court to consider his Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) motion. Thus, while the district court should have considered Greer\u2019s Fed. R. Crv. P. 59(e) motion as timely objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, the district court did not commit reversible error. <em>See Kreimerman v. Casa Veerkamp, S.A., de C.V., </em>22 F.3d 634, 646-47 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">Greer\u2019s <em>motion to compel did not contain </em>the required certification that he had \u201cin good faith conferred with the party failing to make the discovery.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(2)(B). Consequently, Greer was not prejudiced the district court\u2019s failure to rule on the motion to compel prior to granting summary judgment to Bramhall. As Greer suffered no prejudice, Greer has not shown that the district court abused its discretion, no less committed plain error. <em>See Marshall v. Norwood, </em>741 F.2d 761, 764 (5th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-13\">We need not consider Greer\u2019s remaining arguments. Because Greer has not challenged the district court\u2019s rulings that Bramhall was entitled to official and qualified immunity on appeal, he has waived any such challenges. <em>See United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number><em>Brace, </em>145 F.Sd 247, 255 (5th Cir.1998) (en banc). The district court\u2019s rulings on official and qualified immunity are sufficient, by themselves, to support the grant of summary judgment to Bramhall. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Bramhall is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b289-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
