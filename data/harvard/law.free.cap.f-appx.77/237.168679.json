Sanchez argues that the district court erred in increasing his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5)-(6). Because Sanchez withdrew his objection to the application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5) at sentencing, it is unreviewable on appeal. <em>United States v. Musquiz, </em>45 F.3d 927, 931 (5th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Calverley, </em>37 F.3d 160, 162 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-23\">Section 2Ll.l(b)(6) calls for a two-level increase \u201cif any person died or sustained bodily injury.\u201d Sanchez\u2019s argument that the adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6) is inapplicable because he did not intend to injure anyone is without merit. <em>United States v. Garcia-Guerrero, </em>313 F.3d 892, 898 (5th Cir.2002). Because the record shows that Sanchez was involved in the overall smuggling operation which led to two aliens being injured, the district court did not err in applying the adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6). <em>Id. </em>The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b271-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
