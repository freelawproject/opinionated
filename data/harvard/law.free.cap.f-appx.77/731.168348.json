Both sides moved for summary judgment on the question whether Plaintiffs are \u201cadministrative employees\u201d according to the regulations promulgated under the FLSA. The district court granted the City\u2019s motion, denied Plaintiffs\u2019, and entered judgment for the City. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-11\">1. The FLSA requires employers to pay overtime compensation to employees who work more than forty hours during a workweek unless such employees are \u201cemployed in a bona fide ... administrative ... capacity\u2014\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a)(1). An employee who earns at least $250 per week is considered to be employed in an administrative capacity if the employee\u2019s \u201cprimary duty ... consists of ... [t]he performance of office or non-manual work directly related to management policies or general business operations of his employer or his employer\u2019s customers____[and] includes work requiring the exercise of discretion and independent judgment.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 541.2(a)(1), 541.2(e)(2). The City bears the burden of proving that Plaintiffs are employed in an administrative capacity. <em>See Vela v. City of Houston, </em>276 F.3d 659, 666-67 (5th Cir.2001). Thus, to obtain summary judgment on this issue, the City \u201cmust establish beyond peradventure <em>all </em>of the essential elements\u201d of the administrative-capacity exception. <em>See Fontenot v. Upjohn Co., </em>780 F.2d 1190, 1194 (5th Cir.1986) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-15\">2. The first required element of the administrative-capacity exception is that Plaintiffs\u2019 work be \u201cdirectly related to management policies or general business operations of [their] employer or [their] employer\u2019s customers.\u201d The intended effect of this phrase is to limit the administrative-capacity exception \u201cto persons who perform work of substantial importance to the management or operation of the business of [the] employer or [the] employer\u2019s customers.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.205(a). Excepted employees might be \u201cengaged in \u2018servicing\u2019 a business, as, for[] example, advising the management, planning, negotiating, [and] representing the company____\u201d <em>Id. % </em>541.205(b). Such persons \u201ccarry out major assignments in conduct<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>ing the operations of the business.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 541.205(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">3. The significant facts of Plaintiffs\u2019 employment with the City are uncontested. The Dallas Convention Center (\u201cDCC\u201d), for whom Plaintiffs work, rents its facilities to trade shows and conventions. As event coordinators, Plaintiffs are responsible for planning most aspects of convention center events and negotiating with clients on the DCC\u2019s behalf. Event coordinators arrange for in-house contractors to meet the needs of the DCC\u2019s clients and act as the on-site contact person during events to address clients\u2019 requests and problems as they arise. They coordinate the provision of utilities and parking and prepare invoices for such services. Event coordinators ensure that the clients have made the necessary pre-event payments and resolve billing disputes both during and after the show. These facts establish that event coordinators \u201ccarry out major assignments in conducting the operations of the business\u201d of the DCC and that their work is \u201cof substantial importance to the ... operations of [the DCC] or [the DCC\u2019s] customers.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 work is \u201cdirectly related to management policies or general business operations of [their] employer or [their] employer\u2019s customers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">4. The exception also requires that Plaintiffs exercise discretion and independent judgment. Work satisfying this element \u201cinvolves the comparison and the evaluation of possible courses of conduct and acting or making a decision after the various possibilities have been considered.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.207(a). Employees doing such work have \u201cthe authority or power to make an independent choice, free from immediate direction or supervision with respect to matters of significance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It is not necessary, however, that the employees\u2019 decisions be free from review: \u201cThe decisions made as a result of the exercise of discretion and independent judgment may consist of recommendations for action rather than the actual taking of action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 541.207(e)(1). Not excepted are employees who merely follow prescribed procedures or who determine whether specified standards are met, such as inspectors or graders. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 541.207(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">5. Event coordinators are responsible for deciding whether the client\u2019s proposed event comports with DCC policies and procedures. If it does not, the event coordinator works with the client to develop a compliant alternative. If the event coordinator determines that compliance cannot be achieved, she recommends to DCC management whether the noncompliance should be excused. Event coordinators also recommend whether a show should be canceled for non-payment, for failure to submit required paperwork, or for other reasons. Further, they make recommendations for revising the DCC\u2019s policies and procedures. Event coordinators do not have discretion to cancel an event themselves. However, as noted, it is not necessary that the employee have final decision making authority to qualify for the administrative-capacity exemption. Plaintiffs\u2019 decisions and recommendations regarding whether and how a proposed event should go forward are \u201cmatters of significance\u201d to the DCC\u2019s business. Plaintiffs regularly compare alternative courses of action and based thereon make decisions and recommendations. Clearly, Plaintiffs do exercise discretion and independent judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b766-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
