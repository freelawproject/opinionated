He argues that the district court erred in construing his complaint as a petition for mandamus relief because his allegations that the state court judges denied him access to the courts supported a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">The district court was within its authority to construe Rhodes\u2019 complaint as a petition for a writ of mandamus because Rhodes is merely seeking to have the federal court direct the state court to perform its duties as he wishes. <em>See Moye v. Clerk, DeKalb County Superior Court, </em>474 F.2d 1275-76 (5th Cir.1973) (holding that district court properly construed motion to direct state court activities as petition for writ of mandamus). Federal courts have no authority \u201cto issue writs of mandamus to direct state courts and their judicial officers in the performance of their duties where mandamus is the only relief sought.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1276 (citations omitted). Thus, the district court lacked authority to order the state courts to act on Rhodes\u2019 state habeas petitions. <em>Id. </em>at 1275-76; <em>see also Santee v. Quinlan, </em>115 F.3d 355, 356-57 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-16\">Even if Rhodes\u2019 complaint should have been treated as a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint, it is without merit because he failed to allege a constitutional denial-of-access-to-the-eourt claim. <em>Brewer v. Wilkinson, </em>3 F.3d 816, 821 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Crowder v. Sinyard, </em>884 F.2d 804, 811, 814 (5th Cir. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-17\">The dismissal of Rhodes\u2019s action is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b296-12\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
