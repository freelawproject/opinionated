Following a hearing the Juvenile and Domestic Eelations Court entered an order waiving its jurisdiction and referred both complaints to the grand jury. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:4-48 and <em>R. </em>0:9\u20145. A.E. appealed that order. Thereafter he was separately indicted for (1) robbery and larceny <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>2A:141-1 and 119-1) and (2) carrying a weapon <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>2A:151-41). The robbery and larceny indictment was dismissed for reasons not here relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>On this appeal the juvenile addresses several arguments to the propriety of the waiver and transfer order. They all need not be discussed since we are satisfied that the charge of possession of a dangerous weapon does not constitute an offense under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:4-48<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in which the Juvenile Court may waive its jurisdiction, without the juvenile\u2019s consent. We reverse the transfer order as to the weapon\u2019s offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"> While not necessaiy to our disposition, we pause to agree with appellant that the words \u201cage of majority\u201d as found in the statute mean 21 years of age (rather than 18 years as argued by the State) for the reasons expressed in <em>State in the Interest of G.T., </em>143 <em>N. J. Super. </em>73 (App. Div. 1976). Additionally, we note that the record does not reflect, as contended by appellant, that he was denied due process of law by the \u201cpractice of the state to request a waiver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>hearing on the date of the * * * delinquency trial.\u201d See <em>R. </em>5:9-5(b) (effective September 8, 1975, after the hearing in this matter).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">At the waiver hearing on the weapon\u2019s complaint it was developed that on the day in question \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Police officers in a patrol car observed A.E. and another starting to cross a city street at about 2 a.m. As the police neared the two \u201cthey spotted us and made a brief turn real quick and started walking back.\u201d The illumination at the scene from \u201cregular street lights\u201d was good. When the police were about 30 feet from the pair a spotlight was turned on them, at which time A.E. \u201cthrew something from his hand.\u201d Later one of the officers \u201cwalked back by the bushes and with my flashlight picked up a .22 caliber pistol.\u201d The weapon was cocked and loaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">On these facts the Juvenile Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-8\">* *' * the only question in the court\u2019s mind is that this is an offense against the person in an aggressive, violent and willful manner in violation of the statute. So the possession of a dangerous weapon, to wit, a .22 caliber which was cocked and loaded, the court feels that it falls into the category and I feel that probable cause has been found and, therefor, in this case this matter will be sent to the Grand Jury * *' *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">We hold this error.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">Under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:A-4:8 the court may, without a juvenile\u2019s consent, refer a matter for adult prosecution where the juvenile is between 16 and 18 years of age and where the court is satisfied that the public protection requires the waiver and that there is no reasonable prospect for rehabilitation by use of the facilities available to the court before the juvenile attains \u201cthe age of majority.\u201d The act (and <em>R. </em>5:9-5) limit transfers to four specific categories of offenses<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014 i. <em>e., </em>where there is probable cause to believe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>that the juvenile committed a delinquent act which would constitute (1) homicide; (2) treason if committed by an adult; (3) an offense against the person in an aggressive, violent and willful manner, or (4) a violation of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>24:21-19 (manufacture, distribution, dispensing or possession with intent .to do the latter acts of certain controlled dangerous substances) by a juvenile not addicted to specified narcotic drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">The issue here, then, is simply whether the weapons offense described in the record was an offense against a person done in a willful manner, aggressively and violently. Clearly it was not. We do not mean to deprecate the seriousness of A.R.\u2019s conduct. While it had the clear potential for high violence \u2014 made greater by the weapon being loaded and cocked \u2014 there simply was no offense against a person. There was no aggression. There was no violence. The record shows only possession of the weapon in A.R. and his unsuccessful attempt to surreptitiously divest himself of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Prior to the enactment in 1974 of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:4-48 references of juveniles to the county prosecutor for adult treatment were governed by <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:4-15 (repealed by <em>L. </em>1973, <em>c. </em>306, \u00a7 27). Under the latter, transfers were permitted in the cases of habitual offenders or where a juvenile, of the age of 16 or 17 years, had been charged with an offense of a heinous nature. We are directed to no authority, nor do we find any, where the possession of a weapon would fit the statutory bill under either act. See, <em>e. g., State v. Loray, </em>46 N. <em>J. </em>179 (1965); <em>State v. Tuddles, </em>38 <em>N. J. </em>565 (1962); <em>Goodlet v. Goodman, </em>34 <em>N. J. </em>358 (1961), <em>cert. </em>den. 368 <em>U. S. </em>855, 82 <em>S. Ct. </em>92, 7 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 52 (1961); <em>State in re Steenback, </em>34 <em>N. J. </em>89 (1961); <em>State v. Smith, </em>32 <em>N. J. </em>501 (1960), <em>cert. </em>den. 364 <em>U. S. </em>936, 81 <em>S. Ct. </em>383, 5 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 367 (1961); <em>In re Smigielski, </em>30 <em>N. J. </em>513 (1959); <em>State v. Van Buren, </em>29 <em>N. J. </em>548 (1959); <em>Johnson v. State, </em>18 <em>N. J. </em>422 (1955), <em>cert. </em>den. 350 <em>U. S. </em>942, 76 <em>S. Ct. </em>318, 100 <em>L. Ed. </em>822 (1956); <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number><em>v. </em>Monahan, 15 <em>N. J. </em>34 (1954). All of the cited authorities reflect offenses of a heinous nature or against persons done in an aggressive, violent and willful manner.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">In sum, we are -satisfied that the Legislature intended that offenses of the quality reflected in this record are vested in the Juvenile and Domestic Eelations Court, and exclusively so, unless the juvenile, 16 years or older, elects other appropriate treatment. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:4-49. <em>State v. Monahan, supra </em>at 46. Any broadening of the offenses warranting transfer for other prosecution must come from the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Accordingly, insofar as the order under review transferred the charge of possessing a dangerous weapon to the grand jury, it is reversed. The matter is remanded to the Juvenile and Domestic Eelations Court for further proceedings consonant with governing statutes and rules of court. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b408-5\"><em> N.J. S. A. </em>2A:4-48. Referral to other court without juvenile\u2019s consent.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">The juvenile and domestic relations court may, without the consent of the juvenile, waive jurisdiction over a case and refer that case to the appropriate court and prosecuting authority having jurisdiction if it finds, after hearing, that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\">a.

There is probable cause to believe that the juvenile committed a delinquent act which would constitute homicide, treason if committed by an adult or committed an offense against the person in an aggressive, violent and willful manner or committed a delinquent act which would have been a violation of section 19 of the Controlled Dangerous Substances Act (P. L. 1970, c. 226; C. 24:21-19) if committed by an adult and the juvenile, at the time he committed the act, was not addicted to a narcotic drug as that term is defined in section 2 of the Controlled Dangerous Substances Act (P.

Super. </em>64 (Law Div. 1976) (holding transfer orders to be final judgments directly appealable to the Appellate Division and not review able on motions to dismiss indictments), it appears that the juvenile was indicted for (1) assault with intent to kill; (2) assault with a dangerous weapon; (3) atrocious assault and battery; (4) possession of a dangerous weapon, and (5) conspiracy to commit an atrocious assault and battery. Not being necessary for its disposition, <em>Evangelista </em>did not recite its underlying facts. Since there was but one indictment we assume the possession count was but part of the overall more serious, and apparently assaultive, criminal transaction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
