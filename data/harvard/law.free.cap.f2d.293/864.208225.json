Philco Corporation, which manufactures various kinds of equipment in competition with NBC\u2019s parent, Radio Corporation of America (RCA), protested the grant. Philco charged that renewal of NBC\u2019s license was contrary to the public interest and asked for an evidentiary hearing. The Commission dismissed the protest, after oral argument but without an evidentiary hearing, and Philco appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We think the Commission should have held the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">Philco\u2019s protest attacks NBC\u2019s character qualifications. It traces what it calls the \u201cconsistent course towards monopoly\u201d of NBC\u2019s parent, RCA. It charges that NBC affords RCA \u201ca vast amount of preferential publicity\u201d not available to Philco or other competitors of RCA and so is \u201cdirectly instrumental in expanding the adverse effects of RCA\u2019s [monopoly] practices\u201d. It includes a digest of Congressional committee reports which it says \u201craise the gravest questions as to the propriety of a number of NBC\u2019s practices.\u201d It describes a number of pending antitrust suits against NBC and RCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">Section 309(c) of the Federal Communications Act made \u201cany instrument of authorization\u201d granted without a hearing subject to protest for thirty days. It did not require an evidentiary hearing on the protest unless it \u201cspecifies] with particularity the facts relied upon by the protestant as showing that the grant was improperly made or would otherwise not be in the public interest.\u201d Even if the protest meets that test, no evidentiary hearing is required if \u201cthe Commission, after affording protestant an opportunity for oral argument, finds, for reasons set forth in the decision, that, even if the facts alleged were to be proven, no grounds for setting aside the grant are presented.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">The Commission found that Philco\u2019s review of RCA\u2019s past practices, \u201ccannot be deemed to show a course toward monopoly. * * * These matters are not new to the Commission. Philco merely is reiterating matters long known to us, some of which have been disposed of by official Commission action and others which we have concluded do not warrant Commission action. The great bulk of such matters occurred from one to three decades ago and protestant has demonstrated nothing to warrant their consideration again at this late date.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We think it was error to divorce the alleged background from Philco\u2019s allegations of current monopolistic and other improper conduct. Whether or not the background alone required a hearing, the charges of new misconduct gave it new significance. The Commission is not foreclosed by its former action or inaction. Wallace Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, 323 U.S. 248, 65 S.Ct. 238, 89 L.Ed. 216, illustrates the principle. The Court said: \u201cthe Board * * ordinarily will respect the terms of a settlement agreement approved by it. It has consistently gone behind such agreements, however, where subsequent events have demonstrated that efforts at adjustment have failed to accomplish their purpose, or where there has been a subsequent unfair labor practice.\u201d 323 U.S. at page 254, 65 S.Ct. at page 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>In the belief that it concerned only Philco\u2019s standing to protest, the Commission failed to consider Philco\u2019s charge that NBC gave preferential publicity to RCA: We think this also was error. In connection with Philco\u2019s other allegations, unfair or harmful competition might be found to show that NBC lacks the character qualifications for a license.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The statement in the protest that the preferential publicity is \u201cinstrumental in expanding the adverse effects of RCA\u2019s [monopoly] practices\u201d links the publicity charge to character.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">The Commission found other charges of current improper conduct insufficient because Philco \u201cfailed to adopt as its own and offer to prove\u201d either the charges in the antitrust suits or the practices described by the Congressional committees. But \u00a7 309(c) of the Act does not require formal offers of proof. We think it assumes that one who protests thereby offers to prove his charges. It provides that \u201cwith respect to issues resulting from facts set forth in the protest and not adopted or specified by the Commission, on its own motion, both the burden of proceeding with the introduction of evidence and the burden of proof shall be upon the protestant.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">We think the protest alleges present misconduct with the particularity the statute requires. It says NBC gives RCA \u201cpreferential publicity\u201d in that NBC broadcast stations (1) repeatedly remind the public that it is receiving \u201ca service of RCA\u201d and that RCA is \u201cthe pioneer and developer of compatible color\u201d, (2) carry \u201cnews\u201d stories publicizing RCA \u201cwhich other news agencies do not find justified by their news value\u201d, and (3) incorporate RC and RCA into their call letters; also because \u201csuch programs as \u2018Today\u2019 emphasize, when that is the fact, that their place or origin is in the \u2018RCA Exhibition Hall\u2019 where RCA products are always on display.\u201d The protest says the Congressional committee reports disclose \u201cfeatures of NBC\u2019s operations\u201d which include the following: \u201cRequiring advertisers to order all of the NBC-owned television stations plus certain favored affiliated stations * * * \u201d; \u201cRetaining under its contracts the power to control affiliated stations\u2019 time and substitute its decision as to programming for that of the licensee in the latter\u2019s own community * * \u201cgiving affiliated stations first call on network programs in their communities * * \u201d; discriminating \u201camong affiliates in the compensation paid for carrying its programs and among advertisers in the rates it charges them\u201d; and maintaining \u201cexclusive arrangements with sources of foreign news film.\u201d Philco\u2019s summary of the antitrust complaints is phrased more generally but includes charges that RCA and/or NBC conspired to monopolize radio and television research, patents and patent licensing; production, distribution and use of musical compositions through Broadcast Music, Inc.; and exhibition of a television program \u201cFashion Show\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-13\">A protestant need not plead his evidence. We are not \u201cto measure the requirement of Section 309(c) by the technicalities of pleading formerly applicable in civil litigation. What is required is merely an articulated statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>of some fact or situation which would tend to show, if established at a hearing, that the grant of the license contravened public interest, convenience and necessity, * * <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Federal Broadcasting System v. Federal Communications Commission, 96 U.S.App.D.C. 260, 263, 225 F.2d 560, 563. \u201c \u2018the Commission might infer from the fact that the applicant had in the past tried to monopolize radio, or had engaged in unfair methods of competition, that the disposition so manifested would continue and that if it did it would make him an unfit licensee.\u2019 \u201d National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. 190, 222, 63 S.Ct. 997, 87 L.Ed. 1344. Cf. Mansfield Journal Co. v. Federal Communications Commission, 86 U.S.App.D.C. 102, 188 F.2d 28. The Commission has said \u201conly those persons should be licensed who can be relied upon to operate in the public interest, and not engage in monopolistic practices. When passing upon applications of persons who have engaged in monopolistic practices in other industries, the Commission must be concerned as to whether such persons would also engage in monopolistic practices in radio if they were given a license. Their conduct in other fields is obviously a matter which the Commission must consider in determining whether they possess the requisite qualifications as a licensee.\u201d Report on Uniform Policy as to Violation by Applicants of Laws of the United States (Docket 9572), 1 Pike and Fisher RR 91:495, 91:500 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">The Commission\u2019s renewal of NBC\u2019s license was \u201cwithout prejudice to whatever action the Commission may deem appropriate at such time as presently pending antitrust actions involving RCA and NBC may be terminated.\u201d But competitive practices may make an applicant unworthy whether or not they violate the antitrust laws. Mansfield Journal Co. v. Federal Communications Commission, 86 U.S.App.D.C. at page 107, 180 F.2d at page 33. \u201cNothing in the provisions or history of the Act lends support to the inference that the Commission was denied the power to refuse a license to a station not operating in the \u2018public interest,\u2019 merely because its misconduct happened to be an unconvicted violation of the anti-trust laws.\u201d National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. at page 223, 63 S.Ct. at page 1012. The purpose of the protest section of the Act \u201cis to search out the public interest.\u201d Hall v. Federal Communications Commission, 99 U.S.App.D.C. 86, 90, 237 F.2d 567, 571. Determination of the public interest cannot be postponed pending the outcome of law suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">We need not consider whether other allegations in the protest were in themselves sufficient to require an evidentiary hearing. The Commission will be \u201cfree to consider any issue bearing on the qualifications of the licensee or the required finding of public interest, convenience and necessity * * the Commission should not conclude its hearing until it has built up a record sufficient to support its final conclusions.\u201d Federal Broadcasting System v. Federal Communications Commission, supra, 96 U.S.App.D.C. at pages 264, 265, 225 F.2d at pages 564, 565. Cf. Clarksburg Publishing Co. v. Federal Communications Commission, 96 U.S.App.D.C. 211, 225 F.2d 511. The Commission may if it sees fit combine the required hearing on Philco\u2019s protest with other hearings concerning the license for station WRCVTV.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b914-7\">. We had reversed the Commission's previous action in dismissing the protest on the ground that Philco lacked standing. Philco Corp. v. Federal Communications Commission, 103 U.S.App.D.C. 278, 257 F.2d 656, certiorari denied sub nom. National Broadcasting Co. v. Philco Corp., 358 U.S. 946, 79 S.Ct. 350, 3 L.Ed.2d 352.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b914-11\">. Although the Commission said \u201ccertain of the matters do not meet the particularity requirement of Section 309(e)\u201d, we do not understand it to have found that the protest as a whole failed to allege a \u201ccourse towards monopoly\u201d with the required particularity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b915-9\">. The Commission\u2019s view that with respect to antitrust violations Philco only alleged \u201cthe pendency of certain litigation\u201d is the less tenable because Philco was itself a plaintiff in one of the suits. Phil-co\u2019s statement in its brief to the Commission that it was \u201coffering to prove those charges\u201d showed its intention and should have dispelled any doubt. It was not, as the Commission thought, an \u201cuntimely pleading\u201d or \u201cnew factual allegations\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b915-15\">. The Commission found that the material from the Congressional committee reports was \u201cunsupported by the requisite allegations stating with particularity the facts relied upon to show that the grant is not in the public interest.\u201d It thought there was a \u201cserious question\u201d whether the subject matter of the antitrust suits was alleged with sufficient particularity, but did not resolve this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b916-9\">. \u201cor that the licensee was technically or financially unqualified, contrary to the Commission\u2019s initial finding.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
