The plaintiff was expelled August 10, 1959; the Act became law September 14, 1959. The district judge dismissed the original complaint on the ground that the Act became effective after the plaintiff\u2019s resignation and expulsion, but allowed the t plaintiff twenty days within which to amend his complaint. The amended complaint raises a number of new questions. All of these are adequately considered in the opinion of the trial judge, which we adopt in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-15\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b976-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
