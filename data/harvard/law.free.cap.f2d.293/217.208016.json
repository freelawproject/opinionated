BROWN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Avn\">joined by HUTCHESON, CAMERON and JONES, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-13\">This case presents the same basic question as that in Dickson v. Edwards, 5 Cir., 1960, 293 F.2d 211, concerning the availability of judicial review under the Soil Bank Act, 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1801-1837 (Supp.1959). After the opinion in Dickson was announced on January 13, 1961, the Court, by an order en banc, vacated that opinion and judgment and ordered the two cases resubmitted for reconsideration by the Court en banc. The Court en banc, on such reconsideration, adhered to the prior opinion in Dickson so that it has become the opinion of the Court en banc. The Dickson decision is controlling on the basic issue despite the factual differences in the two cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-17\">The complaint here was filed by Caulfield, the Tenant, against two governmental defendants, the Department of Agriculture through the Secretary of Agriculture and the Louisiana State Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Committee. Also named as a party was the private defendant, the Executors of the succession of W. T. Coats, deceased, the Landowner. The theory of the Tenant\u2019s complaint was that in anticipation of making an Acreage Reserve Contract, the Landowner evicted the Tenant prior to the commencement of that crop year in order to avoid sharing the government grant under the ARC Contract. As this is forbidden by the Act, he sought recovery of his share of the payments later made to and received by the Landowner and a trial de novo of the adverse determination by the administrative committees.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-18\">The Government on behalf of the two governmental defendants only filed a motion for summary judgment. These papers included the administrative record before the County (Parish) Committee and the State ASC Committee. Thus the matter is broadened beyond the brief allegations of the complaint, F.R.Civ.P. 12(c), 56, 28 U.S.C.A. These undisputed facts<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> may be briefly summarized.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-19\">For the crop year 1957 the Tenant was a sharecropper on 18.6 acres of the Wildwood Plantation in Pointe Coupee Parish operated by W. T. Coats, the Landowner. Under the sharecropper agreement, the Tenant was to receive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>%ths of the revenues from farming operations. In late 1957 the Landowner advised the Tenant that the arrangement would be terminated at the end of that crop year. Thereafter in January 1958 the Landowner as the sole \u201cproducer\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> made an ARC Contract withdrawing these specific 18.6 acres from cotton. Under the ARC Contract the Landowner, as sole producer, was to receive $1,655.-40.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">When he belatedly learned from some friends that terminating a tenancy in anticipation of making a Soil Bank Contract was probably a violation of the law by a landowner, the Tenant complained to the Parish (County) Committee. The Landowner\u2019s contention was that the tenancy had been voluntarily relinquished when the Tenant gave up farming and sought employment in the city. On appeal the State ASC Committee reached the same conclusion. It is this basic controversy \u2014 did the Tenant leave voluntarily or was he evicted? \u2014 on which trial de novo was sought under 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1831(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">This brief recitation makes two things clear. First, even if the Tenant were actually a party to an existing ARC Contract and not merely hoped to be, there was no <em>violation </em>of such contract by him, nor did either the Parish (County) or State Committee so determine. Second, while the Tenant asserted that the Landowner violated the Soil Bank Act in securing the execution of this Contract, neither the County nor the State Committee determined that the Landowner had violated the <em>Contract. </em>On the contrary each held that there was no violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-13\">The result is that conceding the correctness of the Tenant\u2019s assertion that the Landlord\u2019s action was unlawful, there was no administrative determination that the \u201cproducer\u201d \u2014 whether tenant or landowner or both \u2014 had violated the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-15\">For the reasons spelled out in Dickson v. Edwards, supra, that was the sole matter accorded judicial review. Cf. United States v. Maxwell, 8 Cir., 1960, 278 F.2d 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-16\">Section 1831 (7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1831) has both an affirmative and negative significance. Affirmatively, in a judicial system resting upon a statutory source for jurisdiction in the district courts, see Sheldon v. Sill, 1850, 8 How. 441, 12 L.Ed. 1147, this section opens the courthouse door as to a limited controversy and as to specified parties \u2014 the administrators of the Act. The affirmative grant of jurisdiction is lacking here. Negatively, the precision with which the Act prescribes a limited judicial review \u25a0 \u2014 especially when read in conjunction with the over-all finality provision of the statute<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 5 \u2014 eliminates the Administrative Procedure Act as the statutory source of judicial review. The APA does not afford judicial review where the particular statute precludes it.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Granting but a limited review, the inference is compelling that Congress deliberately intended to keep the practical operation of this farm program out of the courthouse. Whatever might be thought to be the shortcomings of the informal tribunals of County and State Committees made up as they would be by persons having evident self-interests, Congress purposely undertook to lodge immediate responsibility in these neighborhood tribunals. Nearness to the problem and to the people affected \u2014 or afflicted \u2014 -by adjudications having decisive consequences may well have been to Congress the assurance of responsible impartiality. See Fulford v. Foreman, 5 Cir., 1957, 245 F.2d 145, 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-16\">Indeed, the legislative history supports the view that in effectuating the vigorou? policy against the use of any devious schemes by landowners as a means <em>of </em>discriminating against tenants<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Congress looked to the County Committees as the means of positive enforcement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Congress presumably put its faith m the localized and immediate responsibility of these groups as their decisions had to pass muster in the particular community. It purposely chose this in preference to its unsuccessful effort to legislate more precise standards to protect tenants who, from ignorance or poverty or lack of resources, were looked upon as a more helpless class.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\"> This is, of course, but another instance in which Congress creating the grant of public funds may determine the basis upon which money is to be paid or distributed. This includes as well the machinery for the determination of 'the facts upon which statutory standards are to operate. As Congress did not permit judicial review of any decisions other than that of a violation of a contract by a producer, neither the District Court nor this Court has the power to say whether the action of the County and State Committees was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">But this affirmance on Dickson v. Edwards relates solely to the Tenant\u2019s action against the governmental defendants. For two reasons that case does not control the disposition of Caulfield\u2019s suit against the private defendant Coats or his Succession.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-12\">First, the only appearance below and here for defendants was through the United States Attorney on behalf of the governmental parties. No appearance has yet been made on behalf of the private defendant Coats or his Succession.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Obviously, the summary judgment entered for the \u201cdefendants\u201d related solely to the governmental agents and agency. It did not undertake to pass upon the rights of Caulfield <em>vis-a-vis </em>the private defendant Coats.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-13\"> Second, the situation is quite different from the private suit in Dickson. There the Soil Bank Act came into the case only as an anticipated defense and the tenant\u2019s claim did not therefore \u201carise under\u201d the Soil Bank Act. Here, without intimating how the matter should or will ultimately be decided, it appears from the complaint as expanded that the plaintiff Caulfield is directly in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>yoking a federal statutory right. The theory of Caulfield\u2019s claim is that contrary to the Soil Bank Act (see footnote 6, supra), the Landowner defendant ousted him in anticipation of making an ARC Contract. Thus the asserted prohibition of the Soil Bank Act seems to be the very basis for the recovery sought. The right, if it exists, comes into being from the Federal Act and the effectual enforcement of that right depends on the validity, construction or effect of that statute. If that is ultimately borne out by a proper study of the complaint this would, of course, make it a suit arising under a law of the United States, and here one regulating commerce.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Bell v. Hood, 1946, 327 U.S. 678, 66 S.Ct. 773, 90 L.Ed. 939; Gully v. First National Bank, 1936, 299 U.S. 109, 57 S.Ct. 96, 81 L.Ed. 70. Of course, that phase is not directly before us and these tentative comments are stated merely to make certain that affirmance on the basis of Dickson v. Edwards is confined to the governmental suit, not the one against the private defendant. The ultimate decision in the private suit against Coats or his Succession must await its trial or other appropriate proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b266-14\">.

This bill, after being passed by Congress, was vetoed by the President. However H.R. 10875 \u25a0which became the Agricultural Act of 1956, contains the identical provision with respect to the rights of tenants and sharecroppers as appeared in H.R. 12. The Conference Report on H.R. 12 stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcP\"><em>\u201cProtection of tenants and sharecroppers. </em>No single problem connected with the proposed soil bank had caused the committee more concern than that of guaranteeing adequate protection of ten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>ants and sharecroppers under the program. Several provisions referring to tenants and sharecroppers and intended to protect their interest, while at the same time safeguarding the interests of landlords, were scattered throughout the soil-bank portion of the Senate bill. After the most careful consideration, the committee considered them inadequate to afford the protection desired. The committee tried for many hours to devise a specific legal formula or direction to the Secretary of Agriculture covering the landlord-tenant-sharecropper relationship which would assure by specific legal provision fair treatment of all concerned. It realizes, however, that these relationships are so different in various types of farming areas and in different geographic locations, and even from one farm to the next in the same area, that it is probably impossible to write into the law a formula for equitable sharing in benefits under the soil bank act which will work fairly in all the multitude of individual relationships of this type which exist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-10\">\u201cAfter the most thorough consideration, therefore, the committee of conference reached the conclusion that the safest way to guarantee fair treatment of all participants in the soil bank program is to put into the law the general rules on which the division of benefits under this act is to be made, to require that each landlord in applying for participation in the program stipulate in detail how he proposes to share the benefits with his tenants or sharecroppers, and to require the county committee made up of farmers who are thoroughly familiar with local conditions to approve the proposed division of benefits before the farmer will be permitted to participate in the program. The stipulated and approved proposal for dividing the benefits will then be made a part of the contract and failure \u25a0 or refusal to carry out that provision would subject the producer to the penalties provided by the act.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b269-14\">.

As the Tenant\u2019s claim for Ms portion amounts to $1,237.10, see note 3, supra, the requisite amount in controversy would not exist under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1331. But since statutes effectuating the Federal Farm Program constitutionally rest on the Commerce Clause, Article 1, \u00a7 8, Clause 3 of the Constitution, jurisdiction would likely exist under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1337 as to which there is no requisite amount in controversy.

I cannot believe that Congress intended the Soil Bank Act to be given the discriminatory effect denial of judicial review gives it in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">The controversy is between landlord and tenant. The majority opinion recognizes that the landlord would have the right to judicial review of administrative action depriving him of payments under his soil bank contract. But the Court bars judicial review to a tenant or sharecropper deprived of soil bank payments and as adversely affected by the ASC committee determination of no violation as -the landlord would be affected by the determination there was a violation. This unfortunate limitation of review follows from an over-literal construction of the Act and the regulatory scheme for administration of the Soil Bank Program as denying judicial review except when the Secretary terminates a soil bank contract because of a violation of the contract.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The effect of the holding is to ignore the practicalities and to work a serious injustice on tenants in Caulfield\u2019s sorry fix. When the Committee holds that the landlord has not violated the contract, there is no reason for him to go to the courts for relief: he is not hurt. But there may be very good reason, as in this case, for the tenant to appeal to the courts: he is deprived of his livelihood without compensation. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>incongruity of the result is underscored by the fact that in most cases the tenant has a larger interest in the farming revenues than the landlord; here, for example, Caulfield is entitled to three-fourths of the farming revenues, and claims three-fourths of the soil bank payments, as against Coats\u2019s one-fourth. The incongruity is more anomalous when one considers that in the natural course of events appointments to ASC committees, which double as courts besides exercising an enormous influence in the administration of agricultural affairs, fall to large landowners and farm operators \u2014 not to tenants and sharecroppers.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">I start with a presumption: \u201c[I]n our system of remedies, an individual whose interest is acutely and immediately affected by an administrative action presumptively has a right to secure at some point a judicial determination of its validity. This is to me the teaching of our history and tradition. It is our common law, and in a lesser measure a corollary of our constitutions. I am well aware that this assertion can be criticized as a futile, an empty, a useless generality. I think on the contrary that it is an important proposition, and that if it is entertained by a court it may become a crucial factor in the decision to review.\u201d Jaffe, The Right to Judicial Review, 71 Harv.L.Rev. 401, 420 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">In the Soil Bank Act Congress hammered out national policy after full consideration of the importance of protecting conflicting economic interests. The Act shows clearly that Congress intended tenants and sharecroppers to have a fair share in the Soil Bank Program.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The legislative history of the Act shows congressional concern for fear landlords might do exactly what Caulfield charges his landlord did in this case.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The soil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>bank regulations of the Department of Agriculture show a conscious endeavor to carry out the congressional mandate of protecting the interests of tenants and sharecroppers, even though the implementation falls short of the Department\u2019s good intentions.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Accordingly, in construing the Act and the regulations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>as permitting or denying a tenant the right of review, I find it easier to reach a result carrying out the congressional policy of giving tenants a fair shake than to reach a result frustrating that policy,</p>\n<p id=\"Ab_\">The Court infers, here and in Dickson v. Edwards, that since the Act expressly provides a procedure for review<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> when there is an agency decision to terminate a contract, Congress intended to deny review of any other type of agency decisi\u00f3n under the Soil Bank Act.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> I question that Congress had any such intentions. I infer simply that Congress felt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>that when a soil bank contract is terminated the procedural safeguards should be carefully outlined and the producer should have the benefit of the now relatively uncommon right of review by trial de novo in the district court rather than limited review as to the substantiality of the evidence. <em>But </em>surely all other soil bank administrative action affecting producers is not immune from judicial scrutiny. The right of judicial review is too fundamental a safeguard in our system of law to be waived aside on such thin evidence of congressional intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">The Court relies heavily on the \u201cfinality\u201d provision of the Act, 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1809 :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-5\">\u201cThe facts constituting the basis for any payment or compensation, or the amount thereof, authorized to be made under this chapter, when officially determined in conformity with applicable regulations prescribed by the Secretary, shall be final and conclusive and shall not be reviewable by any other officer or agency of the Government. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">If we must adopt so narrow a construction that review may be had of a determination of a violation but not of a determination of no-violation, consistency in strict construction should require us to hold that the finality provision applies when there is payment but not when, as in this case, there is no payment (to the tenant). More importantly, I read Section 1809 as limited to /aci-finding. Finality of /act-finding leaves the door wide open to court review for the purpose of determining if the agency correctly applied the law to the facts and acted within its authority.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> cf. Aycock-Lindsey Corp. v. United States, 5 Cir., 1948, 171 F.2d 518; 5 Cir., 187 F.2d 117.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-14\">Assuming that in the proper case the finality provision might apply to a review of the facts, the provision seems inapplicable to the facts of the instant case, as the regulatory scheme is now constructed. The Act (7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1809) makes the finality of the agency decision contingent on the determination having been in conformity with \u201capplicable regulations prescribed by the Secretary\u201d. But \u2014 the Act is silent and the Secretary has prescribed no applicable regulation for the administrative problem this case presents: the procedure for administrative action and review when (1) there is a dispute between landlord and tenant as to the latter\u2019s right to participate in soil bank benefits and (2) there is an ASC committee determination that the landlord has not violated his soil bank contract. The tenant is not accused of a contract violation. And, he has no soil bank contract to be terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-15\">Thus, even as to facts constituting the basis for the agency decision, there is no express preclusion of judicial review. Certainly, review should not be precluded by implication, contrary to the purposes of the Act. Since the Act does not preclude judicial review and since the action is not committed to \u201cagency discretion\u201d, the determination of the ASC committees, approved by the Secretary of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Agriculture, is subject to review under Section 10(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1009.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> This section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-5\">\u201cExcept so far as (1) statutes preclude judicial review or (2) agency action is by law committed to agency discretion, (a) Any person suffering legal wrong because of any agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by such action within the meaning of any relevant statute, shall be entitled to judicial review thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">As Congressman Walters said of Section 10: \u201cLegislative intent to forbid judicial review must be, if not [in] specific * * * terms, at least clear and unmistakable. * * * The mere fact that Congress has not expressly provided for judicial review would be completely immaterial.\u201d Sen.Doc. 248, 79th Cong., 2nd Sess., 368 (1946). The silence of Congress \u201cas to judicial review is not necessarily to be construed as a denial of the power of the federal courts to grant relief in the exercise of the general jurisdiction which Congress has conferred upon them. * * * Judicial review may indeed be required by the Constitution. Ng Fung Ho v. White, 259 U.S. 276, 42 S.Ct. 492, 66 L.Ed. 938. Apart from [the] constitutional requirements, the question whether judicial review will be provided where Congress is silent depends on the whole setting of the particular statute and the scheme of regulation which is adopted.\u201d Estep v. United States, 1946, 327 U.S. 114, 66 S. Ct. 423, 426, 90 L.Ed. 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-15\">\u201cFinality\u201d is an illusion in most statutes.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> It is a mirage if relied on to pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>elude <em>any </em>judicial review of an administrative agency\u2019s decisions.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> No legislative language can deprive a man of a fair hearing in the adjudication of his rights; or, of his right to have a court decide whether the administrative agency acted within its jurisdiction; and, whether the agency through a lay tribunal applied the correct rule of law to the facts.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">The law of administrative justice is still in a state of flux. The only common denominator of the decided cases I am able to discern is the broad principle, loosely applied, that finality language will be whittled down to size \u2014 to fit the Court\u2019s sense of fundamental fairness, whenever that sense is offended by denial of judicial review. I do not say that the courts <em>decide </em>reviewability cases guided only <em>by their own </em>notions of abstract justice. If courts rationalize fair play in terms of \u201cjurisdiction\u201d, \u201cstatutory construction\u201d, \u201cdue process\u201d, or some other legal concept it is always, I hope, in proper context, considering the circumstances of the ease and the interplay of policy, statute, and regulation; reducing the subjective element by weighing the presence or absence of constitutional safeguards, the reasonableness of the regulatory scheme, the effectiveness of administrative relief, the adequacy of administrative check on initial action, the comparative qualifications of courts on the one hand or administrative tribunals on the other hand to decide the par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>ticular question at issue, the nature of the judicial review prayed for, the nature of the administrative action, and many other factors, some at cross-purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The Attorney General finds a consistent principle running through the Supreme Court\u2019s holdings on reviewability. He finds that unreviewability is the order of the day when administrators deny the benefits to the beneficiaries of government programs, while reviewability follows when administrators enforce the obligations of government programs against those who are subject to the disadvantages of the programs. This so-called principle is of doubtful validity at best,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> but assuming its soundness when it is applied to a controversy between the beneficiary and the administrator \u2014 it should have no application when the controversy is really between two private persons over their share in the government program.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Congress created a right in tenants and sharecroppers to have a fair part in the Soil Bank Program. Congress set up standards to protect that right. This case raises a serious question whether the Department of Agriculture departed from the standards set by Congress, in its regulations or in the administrative actions of its law courts, the ASC committees. This is enough to justify review, apart from any express or implied provisions of the Soil Bank Act allowing review, and even apart from Section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Congress has developed a startling and extraordinary insensitivity to politics, to economics, and to justice, and produced a strange out of character sort of law \u2014 if the Soil Bank Act locks the courthouse doors to tenants and sharecroppers seeking review of administrative action but unlocks and opens wide the courthouse doors to their landlords.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">I would reverse the district court, and grant review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b270-9\">. The majority opinion states: \u201cThe result is that conceding the correctness of the Tenant\u2019s assertion that the Landlord\u2019s action was unlawful, there was no administrative determination that the \u2018producer\u2019 \u2014 whether tenant or landowner or both \u2014 bad violated tbe contract. For the reasons spelled out in Dickson v. Edwards, supra, that was the sole matter accorded judicial review.\u201d In Dickson v. Edwards the Court held: \u201c[Jludicial review is provided only where the Secretary terminates a contract because of a <em>violation, </em>of the contract. Consequently, the [District] Court concluded, since Dickson [the tenant] did not <em>violate </em>the contract and his rights terminated simply because he was no longer the lessee the statutory basis for review was lacking, * * * The one decision open to judicial review is termination of the contract by the Secretary of Agriculture after a determination by him that a violation has occurred of such a substantial nature as to warrant termination rather than a mere partial forfeiture of benefits.\u201d See footnote 15.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b271-6\">.

For the most part he does so, and may indeed be very eager to do so; and furthermore, in the vast hierarchy of a modern administration, there is always the possibility of appeal to and rectification by a higher level within the hierarchy. Yet there is in our society a profound, tradition-taught reliance on the courts as the ultimate guardian and assurance of tlie limits set upon executive power by the constitutions and legislatures. * * * The guarantee of legality by an organ independent <em>of the </em>executive is one of the profoundest, most persuasive premises of our system. Indeed I would venture to say that it is the very condition which makes possible, which makes so acceptable, the wide freedom of our administrative system, and gives it its remarkable vitality and flexibility.\u201d Jaffe, The Right to Judicial Review, Harv.L.Rev. 401, 403 (1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b277-19\">. \u201cIt is sometimes suggested that when the United States creates rights against itself, particularly rights to the payment of money, the administrative remedy given to enforce the right presumptively excludes judicial review; the grant, it is said, is a mere \u2018privilege.\u2019 But there is little or no authority to support such a presumption.
