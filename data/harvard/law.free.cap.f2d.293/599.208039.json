It resulted in a jury verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-25\">Plaintiff driver argues three points for reversal. First, he contends that the trial court seriously erred in allowing the defense to probe the extent of his drinking alcoholic beverage during the relevant period.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-26\">The accident occurred Saturday night, November 9, 1957, about 9:30. Plaintiff had been down at Ocean View on the south New Jersey shore \u201cfor a change, for recreation\u201d since the previous day. He left there around 7:30 to 7:45 P.M. for his home in Langhorne, Pennsylvania. He was headed approximately north on Weymouth Road toward the Black Horse Pike. The location of the accident was about two miles beyond Mays Landing which in turn was 25 to 30 miles from Ocean View. According to the plaintiff, in the collision area, the road was about 40 feet wide, straight away, with a little crown on it. The black top of the road was around 20 feet wide with 12 feet pavement or gravel shoulders on each side of it. It was a clear and dry night. He said his passenger automobile was traveling about 30 miles an hour; that he saw the defendant\u2019s truck coming towards him at a speed of 50 miles an hour on its own side of the road; when it was 10 to 12 feet away from him it made a left turn directly into his machine which was then about a foot or two off the black part of the road and on the gravel on his right side of the road; that the right fender of the truck struck his left front; that he had stopped his car <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>prior to the collision and that it was not in motion at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">John Michel, the driver for the defendant said that he was operating the truck in a southerly direction on Weymouth Road, that he saw the plaintiff\u2019s headlights about two city blocks ahead of him and they seemed to be on the truck\u2019s side of the road; that he went over to his right as far as he could, blinked his lights and blew his horn \u201cbut he kept coming at me.\u201d He had slowed down to practically a stop. When plaintiff\u2019s car was 20 feet or so in front of him, Michel \u201cknew he was going to hit me\u201d so he \u201c * * * swerved to the left and tried to get out of the way * * *.\u201d The other car itself swerved and hit the truck \u201cbefore I got over there.\u201d Michel stated that Eschelbach \u201c * * * to me he looked like he had been drinking.\u201d Harry Rambo was a passenger in the truck. He said that \u201cit looked like the lights were making a left turn off the highway and then they came towards us.\u201d And he generally corroborated Michel\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">New Jersey State Trooper Olsen was at the scene of the collision shortly after the event. He talked with plaintiff then and a little later at the hospital. He testified that \u201cI had asked him (plaintiff) if he was drinking and he said he had but he did not know how much.\u201d The trooper \u201c * * * found from the skid marks that the number one vehicle (truck) was swerving towards the left side of the road to avoid a head-on collision which, at the last minute, the number two vehicle (plaintiff\u2019s) swerved towards the right side and they met head-on, now there was no reason to disbelieve Mr. Michel\u2019s statement and additionally at the scene we had the skid marks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">On cross-examination, plaintiff was shown an interrogatory addressed to him reading, \u201cWhat speed was your vehicle traveling immediately prior to the accident?\u201d His answer to it was \u201cApproximately <em>45 miles </em>per hour.\u201d He denied he had said that. He was shown another interrogatory of a separate set which asked him to \u201cState the respective speeds of the vehicles at the time of the impact.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s answer to that was \u201cPlaintiff approximately 40 to 45 miles an hour and defendant\u2019s speed unknown.\u201d He said he did not recall this. He was asked \u201c * * * which is the correct version, what you gave us under oath in September, 1959 (the above answers to interrogatories) or what you are giving us under oath today * * *?\u201d He answered \u201cToday\u2019s\u201d. He said he understood the speed limit on Weymouth Road to be 50 miles an hour.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-12\">At Mays Landing, plaintiff stopped at what he described as \u201cA restaurant. I don\u2019t know if you would call it a taproom or what.\u201d He did not have any food there. He said that he was in the place an hour or an hour and a half, something like that and that he had \u201ctwo beers\u201d during that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-13\">He was asked, \u201cDid those beers have any effect on you at all?\u201d The answer was \u201cNo\u201d. He was next referred to his pretrial deposition and asked \u201cDid you on that occasion tell me that you drank 30 beers over an afternoon?\u201d The question was objected to, allowed as proper cross-examination and the answer was \u201cYes\u201d. Then came the following questions and answers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-14\">\u201cQ. And did you have your 30 beers on the afternoon before the happening of this accident? A. No. I am talking about the time that I was home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-15\">\u201cQ. Well, your answer is that you did not have these 30 beers? A. That is right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-17\">\u201cQ. That is, on the afternoon preceding the happening of this accident? A. That is right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>\u201cQ. You say you restricted yourself to two beers at Kelly\u2019s? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-5\">\u201cQ. And that was during the period of about an hour and a half? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-7\">\u201cQ. All right, and to your recollection, you say, that those two beers had no effect on you whatsoever? A. That is right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-8\">\u201cQ. On the occasion when you consumed 30 glasses of beer, did they have any effect on you, Mr. Eschelbach? A. No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">After it had been answered, the last above question was objected to as \u201cirrelevant, immaterial and incompetent\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">On <em>redirect </em>examination there was the following sequence of questions and answers :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-11\">\u201cQ. Mr. Eschelbach, you were questioned about your stay at Kelly\u2019s Taproom. A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-12\">\u201cQ. Which, I believe, is in Mays Landing. A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-13\">\u201cQ. Now, how many beers did you actually have there? A. Two, as far as I remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-14\">\u201cQ. And when you say \u2018Two,\u2019 do you mean glasses? A. Well, two glasses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-15\">\"Q. Not bottles? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-16\">\u201cQ. Had you anything else to drink at Kelly\u2019s? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-17\">\u201cQ. Was that why you stopped at Kelly\u2019s, to have a drink? A. Well, I went into the men\u2019s room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-18\">\u201cQ.- Did you have any food there? A. No, I don\u2019t remember eating that night.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-19\">\u201cQ. Were you under the influence of that drink when you were operating your automobile? After leaving Kelly\u2019s Tavern? A. No, no, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-20\">Appellant\u2019s argument on his first point is based upon a misinterpretation of the main theory behind the particular defense cross-examination. The latter was not to prove that plaintiff was intoxicated on previous occasions or addicted to the use of intoxicating liquors and endeavoring to infer therefrom that he was intoxicated at the time of the accident.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It was to directly strike at the center of plaintiff\u2019s claim- \u2014 his credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-22\">His story was that after proceeding not more than 25 or 30 miles after leaving Ocean View, he stopped at what his attorney characterized as a \u201ctap room\u201d. His attempted explanation for so doing appears in the above quoted question by his attorney and his answer thereto:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-23\">\u201cWas that why you stopped at Kelly\u2019s to have a drink? A. Well, I went into the men\u2019s room.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-25\">In the circumstances his prior admission that in the course of an afternoon at home he customarily drank thirty glasses of beer which according to him did not affect him any more than did his consumption of two, did help give the jury some assistance, together with all his other testimony and all the other evidence in the trial, to, (as was said by the judge in his charge):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-26\">\u201c * * * determine the facts from what you concede (conceive?) is the believable testimony taking into consideration the probabilities and the attitudes of the various witnesses. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-28\">\u201cIn weighing the evidence, you have the right to examine into the credibility of the various witnesses, and in so doing, you may take into consideration their demeanor on the witness stand, their interest in the outcome of the case, the vagaries of the human mind in its attempts to recall past matters, the opportunities of witnesses to see and hear what may have taken place, and the likelihood of their making particular note, or recalling particular details. You may then accept the credible, and reject the incredible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6y\">We agree that the net result of plaintiff\u2019s referred to testimony was harmful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>to his cause; on redirect most of all. However, that harm had its true source in the impression conveyed by plaintiff to the jury as to whether he was telling the truth in the narrated instances. The jury conclusion on that undoubtedly affected its view concerning plaintiff\u2019s version of how the accident happened. The court\u2019s refusal to emasculate the cross-examination of this thoroughly justified probe of plaintiff\u2019s credibility was a sound ruling and is upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">The second proposition urged for appellant as captioned in his brief is that \u201cThe Learned Trial Judge Committed Fatal Error in Admitting into Evidence the Traffic Summons, <em>Which Plaintiff Signed and Mailed into the Magistrate\u2019s Office with the Fine.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The summons was for statutory \u201ccareless driving\u201d, the specification of which was \u201cindifferent driving\u201d. It fixed a date of hearing on the charge before the Magistrate at Mays Landing. It warned that the plaintiff\u2019s driver\u2019s license would be revoked for failure to appear as directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">In accordance with the requirement of Local Criminal Court Form <em>12, </em>New Jersey Court Rules of September 9, 1953, in effect at the time, the summons contained the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-7\">\u201cAppearance, Plea and Waiver</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-8\">\u201cI, the undersigned, do hereby enter my appearance on the complaint for the offense charged on the other side of this summons. I have been informed of my right of a trial, that my signature to this plea of guilty will have the same force and effect as a judgment of court, and that this record will be sent to the Director of the Division of Motor Vehicles of New Jersey (or of the State where I received my license to drive). I do hereby Plead Guilty to said offense as charged, Waive my right to a Hearing by the court, and agree to pay the penalty prescribed for my offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-10\">(Defendant\u2019s Name)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-11\">(Address)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-12\">(Driver\u2019s License No.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-13\">The record Shows the following cross-examination of plaintiff concerning the above referred to summons for \u201ccareless driving\u201d given him by the State Trooper:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-14\">\u201cQ. Mr. Eschelbach, I show you Municipal Court summons which has been marked Exhibit D-3 for identification, and I show you the reverse side on which there appears the language T, the undersigned-\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-15\">\u201cThe Court: No, no. I don\u2019t think it is necessary to read that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-17\">\u201cMr. Devine: All right, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-18\">\u201cQ. I show you the reverse side, and I point out to you, Mr. Eschelbach, that there appears on the reverse side the signature George W. Eschelbach. That is your name, isn\u2019t it? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-19\">\u201cQ. And underneath that there appears '117 Trevose Avenue Rt.-3, Langhorne, Pa.\u2019 That was your address? A. That is right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-20\">\u201cQ. And immediately under that there appears a driver\u2019s license number 1939922. Do you recall that was your license number in 1957? A. Oh, I could not remember that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-21\">\u201cQ. Very good. Now, Mr. Esehelbach, I want you to look at that signature, and I want you to look at the signature which appears on your answers to interrogatories dated September 19, 1959, and I ask you to look at your signature appearing on the surgeons\u2019 permission slip bearing date November 11,1957, and tell me is it not a fact that the signature appearing on the summons is your signature? A. It looks like it, yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>The summons was admitted into evidence for the purpose of throwing light on the question whether plaintiff by his own action pleaded guilty to a charge of careless driving surrounding the circumstances of this accident and to test his credibility on that point. The court left to the jury the decision whether with reference to plaintiff\u2019s action if any in connection with the traffic ticket it was indicated that he had violated a rule of the road or of the Traffic Act. Continuing the court correctly charged the jury in accordance with New Jersey law that if it found \u201c * * * that the plaintiff or the defendant violated a rule of the road or of the Traffic Act that standing alone, and of itself, does not necessarily mean that he is guilty of negligence or contributory negligence. However, it may be a circumstance to be taken into consideration by you in determining whether or not under all of the circumstances as developed by the entire evidence, the plaintiff or the defendant at the time and place in question exercised the reasonable care that they were required by the law to exercise.\u201d Jones v. Lahn, 1949, 1 N.J. 358, 361-362, 63 A.2d 804; Kolankiewiz v. Burke, E. &amp; A. 1918, 91 N.J.L. 567, 103 A. 249; Belperche v. Erie R. Co., E. &amp; A. 1933, 111 N.J.L. 81, 166 A. 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Plaintiff, as seen, did not categorically admit at the trial he had signed the traffic summons. However, there is the clear admission of the fact together with that of his mailing it with the required fine to the Magistrate\u2019s office contained in the quoted brief caption.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">The objection stated in the brief is centered on the assertion that the summons is \u201cnot at all clear or definite as to what plaintiff is alleged to have pleaded guilty, nor does it show under what facts a conviction or plea of guilty was taken.\u201d No complaint is made against the statute itself, N.J.S.A. 39:4-97, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-8\">\u201cA person who drives a vehicle on a highway carelessly, or without due * * * circumspection, in a manner as to endanger, or be likely to endanger, a person or property, shall be guilty of careless driving.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">The exact term \u201ccareless driving\u201d named and defined in the law is the offense set out in the summons. In addition, as called for by the statutory form of summons, the kind of \u201ccareless driving\u201d is specified i. e. \u201cinattentive driving\u201d. State v. Joas, 1961, 34 N.J. 179, 168 A.2d 27, 31. By the named offense and the specification under it, it was charged that appellant while operating his automobile at the time and place of the accident did not give the attention to his driving which was necessary under the circumstances so as not to endanger persons or property. The plea of guilty by appellant to the traffic offense of careless driving was properly received into evidence in this civil action which arose out of the same facts and circumstances. Liberatori v. Yellow Cab Co. of Philadelphia, App.Div.1955, 35 N.J.Super. 470, 114 A.2d 469; Mead v. Wiley Methodist Episcopal Church, App.Div.1952, 23 N.J. Super. 342, 93 A.2d 9, 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">The fundamental situation facing plaintiff under which the plea of guilty was entered is manifest on the face of the summons itself. Appellant, whether because he did not wish to have a trial and personally appear or had no defense or whatever his reason, entered his written appearance to the charge and his signed plea of guilty to it on the summons and mailed it with the prescribed fine to the designated Magistrate. There is no claim that such act was other than entirely voluntary on the part of the plaintiff. There is no merit to the argument now made with respect to the reception of the summons into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-11\">The remaining point contends the trial judge erred in charging the following :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-12\">\u201cIf you find that plaintiff signed the summons issued to him by the State Trooper, you may consider such to be a plea of guilty to the charge, and an admission against interest. You may consider such an admission as evidence supporting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>the charge the plaintiff\u2019s negligence was either the sole cause of the accident, or a contributing cause barring his recovery.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">This was not objected to at the appropriate time. It is not validly before us. Fed.R.Civ.P. 51, 28 U.S.C.A. It does not embrace the substantial error that would bring it within our scope of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">We note in passing that we have already generally covered the area of the objection. The summons was rightfully allowed into evidence. Whether plaintiff signed it was left to the jury and in the event the latter found he had, as the court said in effect immediately above and at length in the portion of the charge we quoted earlier and now repeat, violated a \u201c * * * rule of the' road or of the Traffic Act that standing alone, and of itself, does not necessarily mean that he is guilty of negligence or contributory negligence. However, it may be a circumstance to be taken into consideration by you in determining whether or not under all of the circumstances as developed by the entire evidence, the plaintiff or the defendant at the time and place in question exercised the reasonable care that they were required by the law to exercise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b648-7\">.

I disagree, however, with the majority\u2019s view that the extensive examination of plaintiff with respect to his rather extraordinary drinking habits which portrayed him as a \u201cheavy\u201d drinker was not such prejudicial error as to require a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">It is settled in New Jersey that, while evidence of a car operator\u2019s intoxication at the time of the accident is admissible as \u201cproper evidence of negligence\u201d,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> evidence as to his being a heavy drinker, or of his prior intoxication, is irrelevant and must be excluded. Shelly v. Brunswick Traction Co., Ct.Err. &amp; App.1901, 65 N.J.L. 639, 48 A. 562, 563. It was there said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-11\">\u201cTo prove that the plaintiff was intoxicated on previous occasions, or, * * * was addicted to the use of intoxicating liquors, would not prove that he was intoxicated at the time of the accident, and to show that on previous occasions of intoxication he was in a helpless condition would not tend to show that on the occasion in question he was intoxicated to such a degree as to be helpless.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-14\">In the instant case there was not an iota of evidence that the plaintiff was intoxicated at the time of the happening of the accident and the trial judge committed reversible prejudicial error when he permitted introduction of evidence as to the plaintiff\u2019s drinking habits.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-15\">I vigorously disagree with the majority\u2019s view that the evidence of prior drinking was admissible because it bore on the question as to plaintiff\u2019s \u201ccredibility\u201d with respect to his testimony as to how the accident happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-16\">The general rule is <em>contra </em>to the majority\u2019s view and while research has failed to disclose its specific application in New Jersey, I believe that the courts of that state would subscribe to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-17\">The general rule was stated as follows in McQuage v. City of New York, 1954, 285 App.Div. 249, 253, 136 N.Y.S.2d 111, 116:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-18\"><em>\u201c * </em>* * The obvious purpose of the testimony was not to impeach the credibility of the plaintiff but to show that he had been intoxicated on other occasions and thus permit the jury to draw the inference that he was intoxicated at the time of the happening of the accident. Proof of intoxication on occasions prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>accident was not admissible to prove or suggest that plaintiff was intoxicated at the time of the accident. The authorities relied upon by the defendant relate to proof of intoxication at the time of the event. It has been said upon the general subject of testimonial impeachment that \u2018a general habit of intemperance tells us nothing of the witness\u2019 testimonial incapacity except as it indicates actual intoxication at the time of the event observed or the time of testifying; <em>and hence, since in its bearing upon moral character it does not involve the veracity-trait </em>* * <em>it will ususally not be admissible.\u2019 </em>(3 Wigmore on Evidence (3rd ed.) \u00a7 933, p. 481).\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Since the majority concedes that the mooted evidence was prejudicial to the plaintiff, and as I view it, its admission was clear error, the judgment below should be reversed and the cause remanded with instructions to grant a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b652-19\">.
