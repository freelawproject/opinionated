MILLER, Chief Judge, and PRETTYMAN, DANAHER, BASTIAN and BURGER, Circuit Judges, concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">Appellant Charles Williams, a resident of the District of Columbia, brought suit in the District Court against appellee Hot Shoppes, Inc., a Delaware corporation which operates restaurants in several states and the District of Columbia, to recover a statutory penalty of $500 under Sections 1 and 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1875, and damages of $5,000 under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983, for alleged deprivations of his civil rights. In essence, appellant\u2019s claim is that on November 5, 1959, appellee\u2019s manager denied him service at its restaurant in Alexandria, Virginia, solely because appellant is a Negro, and because Virginia law requires restaurants either to segregate their facilities or to exclude Negro patrons.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant contended that this refusal to serve him was State action of the sort prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment and the civil rights laws. The District Court held to the contrary and dismissed the complaint. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-13\">First of all, we think that the District Court properly dismissed the claim for the statutory penalty under Sections 1 and 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1875.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These statutory provisions were held unconstitutional as applied to private intrastate racial discrimination in the Civil Rights Cases, 1883, 109 U.S. 3, 3 S.Ct. 18, 27 L.Ed. 835. Later, in Butts v. Merchants\u2019 &amp; Miners\u2019 Transportation Co., 1913, 230 U.S. 126, 33 S.Ct. 964, 57 L.Ed. 1422, the Supreme Court held that these provisions could not be applied to penalize racial discrimination aboard interstate carriers even though the statute could, in that application, be upheld under the commerce power. The Court reasoned that since Sections 1 and 2 were penal in nature and were intended by Congress to have uniform national application, and since the provisions had been declared unconstitutional as applied to private intrastate racial discrimina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>tion, the statute should be held wholly invalid rather than be applied in only a fraction of the cases it was intended to cover. In United States v. Raines, 1960, 362 U.S. 17, 23, 80 S.Ct. 519, 4 L.Ed.2d 524 the Supreme Court expressly reaffirmed the Butts decision. Therefore, even if appellee\u2019s conduct is assumed arguendo to be State action, Sections 1 and 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1875 have no present validity, and appellant\u2019s claim under them was properly dismissed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">We turn now to appellant\u2019s claim for damages under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1981. 1983.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 1983 creates a civil action against \u201cEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States * * * to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws * '* In order to constitute conduct under \u201ccolor of law\u201d,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> within the reach of the Federal Constitution and statutes, it is essential that appellee\u2019s refusal to serve appellant be State action. See Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, 81 S.Ct. 856; Monroe v. Pape, 1961, 365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492. It is also clear that there must be a deprivation of a right, privilege or immunity \u201csecured by the Constitution and laws\u201d of the United States. For example, in the Monroe case, just cited, the plaintiff\u2019s immunity from unreasonable search and seizure, guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, had been grossly violated by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-13\">In the instant case, the pertinent portions of the complaint are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-14\">\u201c4. On November 5, 1959, plaintiff entered defendant\u2019s restaurant at 900 North Washington Street, Alexandria, Virginia, in a peaceful and orderly manner, for the purpose of obtaining food and beverage, while it was then open for business and occupied by others of the public who were then enjoying the accommodations of the business conducted on the premises. But defendant\u2019s, manager, one Fred McClure, acting within the scope of his authority, refused to serve plaintiff and excluded him from the restaurant, solely by reason of plaintiff\u2019s race or color, under the color of state law, custom or usage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-15\">\u201c5. Defendant\u2019s manager stated that Virginia law required him to refuse to serve plaintiff and to exclude plaintiff from the dining room; that neither he nor defendant had any personal or other reason for excluding plaintiff from the restaurant except for the understanding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>Virginia law, as well as the custom and usage of the community, compelled the exclusion of colored persons from the restaurant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-4\">\u201c6. Sec. 18-327, Code of Virginia, requires operators of \u2018any place of public . entertainment or public assemblage which is attended by both white and colored persons,\u2019 to segregate them, under penalty of fine of not less than $100 or more than $500 for each violation of the statute. Sec. 18-328, Code of Virginia, requires patrons to comply with such segregated seating, under penalty of fine of not less than $10 or more than $25 for each violation of the statute; authorizes the operator or manager of the place, \u2018or any public (sic) [police] officer or other conservator of the peace,\u2019 to eject any person who fails to comply with such segregation requirement; and provides that any such ejected person shall not be entitled to a refund of any admission paid by him. These laws, in effect, require operators of places of public accommodation, including the aforesaid restaurant, which are open to the general public, to exclude all Negroes unless special facilities are provided to segregate them from the rest of the public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-5\">\u201c7. The cited Virginia laws impose an economic burden upon defendant by requiring it to erect partitions or separate facilities for white and colored persons in restaurants operated in Virginia, and thus tend to compel defendant, in order to avoid that burden, to exclude all colored persons entirely. It is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution for the State of Virginia to require the exclusion or segregation of persons in places of public accommodation, solely because of their race or color, irrespective of whether such state compulsion is exercised or accomplished directly or indirectly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-7\">\u201c8. The defendant, as well as other public restaurant keepers in Virginia are following, and have for many years followed, a custom or usage of systematically excluding Negroes from their facilities under the color of sec. 18-327, Code of Virginia. <em>This custom or usage of Virginia has been produced by the interplay of governmental and private action over a long period of time. </em>By being excluded from pub- ' lie dining facilities by reason of said custom or usage, Negroes, including the plaintiff, are deprived of \u2018the full and equal benefit of all laws,\u2019 respecting access to public restaurants, \u2018as is enjoyed by white citizens,\u2019 under the color of state law, custom or usage, in violation of 42 U.S.C., sec. 1981, and sec. 1, Act of 1875.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">The complaint is thus grounded upon the theory that the Virginia public assembly statute, Section 18-327 of the Virginia Code,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> applies to restaurants, and compels segregation therein. This was the theory on which Williams pleaded and argued his ease in the District Court, and on which he at first based his appeal to this court. Later, in this court, he advanced a further theory \u2014 that appellee\u2019s refusal to serve him was caused solely by the understanding generated by the conduct of State law enforcement officials. Appellant now tells us that the police and prosecutors of Virginia have threatened action against restaurants which do not segregate, and that this was state action, whether or not based on any statutory foundation. The complaint does not say this. But appellant argues that it can be read to say it, relying on the italicized portion of paragraph 8, quoted above. It is there alleged that defendant and other restaurant owners have followed \u201ca custom or usage of systematically excluding Negroes from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>their facilities under color of sec. 18-327, Code of Virginia. This custom or usage of Virginia has been produced by the interplay of governmental and private action over a long period of time.\u201d The only \u201ccustom or usage\u201d alleged is that which arises under color of the statute. Legislative action alone is complained of: nothing is said about executive or police action. The reference to \u201cinterplay of governmental and private action\u201d seems clearly to mean that as a result of the governmental action, i. e., the statute, private persons and firms such as defendant have been compelled to discriminate against plaintiff.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">The background of this litigation, a matter of public record, may also be noted. Appellant Williams had brought an earlier suit against another restaurant in Virginia, for refusal of service, basing his complaint on the theory of an interference with interstate commerce. When the case came before the Fourth Circuit, appellant conceded that Section 18-327 of the Virginia Code did not apply to restaurants. See Williams v. Howard Johnson\u2019s Restaurant, 4 Cir., 1959, 268 F.2d 845, at page 847. The Fourth Circuit unanimously affirmed the dismissal of the complaint, saying that \u201cUnless these actions [of refusing service to Negroes] are performed in obedience to some positive provision of state law they do not furnish a basis for the pending complaint.\u201d Ibid. The Fourth Circuit s opinion came down on July 16, 1959. The incident at the Hot Shoppe restaurant, on which the present suit is based, occurred on November 5, 1959. The complaint herein, filed on November 25, 1959, was apparently framed to fit the quoted language of the Fourth Circuit, relying on Section 18-327 as the \u201cpositive provision of state law\u201d which would provide the basis of the new action.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-11\">The rule in Conley v. Gibson, 1957, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 102, 2 L.Ed. 2d 80, on which appellant relies, is of no help to him. That rule, that \u201ca complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief,\u201d cannot be used to justify the filing of unsworn statements in an appellate brief which would in effect substitute a new complaint for the old. The essence of modern pleading is that there be adequate notice to the defendant of plaintiff\u2019s claims. Here there is no allegation in the complaint as to threatening activities on the part of Virginia police and prosecutors, and, equally important, no allegation whatever that the defendant actually knew of any such activities, or that the refusal to serve plaintiff was based on fear of such activities or was in any way influenced by them, if in fact they existed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b888-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>The complaint, in our view, alleges no more than this: that the restaurant manager discriminated against plaintiff because he believed he was compelled to do so by the Virginia statute. Accordingly, we need not decide whether a cause of action would be stated if the restaurant manager had been compelled to discriminate by administrative officers of the state in the absence of an applicable statute, since that is not alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">Decision whether the complaint, so read, states a claim for damages under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983 would depend upon the answers to these questions: (1) Does the Virginia public assembly statute apply to restaurants, and require their owners to segregate by race? (2) If it does not so apply, has appellee nevertheless deprived appellant of a federally-protected right, under \u201ccolor of law\"? (3) If it does apply to restaurants, is the statute unconstitutional? (4) If it is unconstitutional, but appellee relied on it in good faith, has appellee subjected itself to damages for depriving appellant of a federally-protected right, under color of law? (5) Has there in any event been \u201cstate action\" as distinguished from private action ? The answers to all these questions, in greater or lesser degree, must depend upon the interpretation to be given to the Virginia public assembly statute, Section 18-327 of the Code. No Virginia court, as far as we are aware, has ever published an opinion on the matter. The Attorney General of the State, in a well-reasoned opinion, has said that in his view the statute has no application to restaurants.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> If he is right, the appellant\u2019s cause of action, as stated in the complaint, disappears. The temptation is great to indicate our agreement with his view, and let the case be disposed of on that basis, i. e., an affirmance without more.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-10\">The Supreme Court has many times indicated, however, that in situations like the present, where the solution of novel and serious constitutional questions depends on the interpretation to be given a state statute, not yet construed by the state courts, the Federal courts should abstain from interpreting the state statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-11\">Appellant urges that the doctrine of abstention is not applicable here. He contends that the interpretation to be given Section 18-327 is not potentially dispositive of the case, and maintains (1) that an action will lie, under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983, upon proof of deprivation of rights \u201cunder color of * * * custom, or usage\u201d, without reference to state law; and (2) that \u201cstate action\" includes the acts of a private person performed under supposed compulsion of state law, even though such acts are not so compelled, provided only that the mistake of law be reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-12\">Both these contentions must be rejected. As to the argument based upon the \u201ccustom or usage\u201d language of the statute, we join with the unanimous decision of the Fourth Circuit in support of the proposition that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-13\">\u201cThe customs of the people of a state do not constitute state action within the prohibition of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d Williams v. Howard Johnson\u2019s Restaurant, 4 Cir., 1959, 268 F.2d 845, 848.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b888-14\">A reading of the statute as broad as that urged by appellant here would raise grave constitutional questions, and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>fact would be contrary in substance to the holding in the Civil Eights Cases, 1883, 109 U.S. 3, 3 S.Ct. 18, 27 L.Ed. 835.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">Similarly, the argument based upon reasonable mistake of law reaches too far beyond the established lines of constitutional authority to be sustained. Under existing decisions, \u201ccolor of law\u201d requires a vesting of <em>actual </em>authority of some kind. In Screws v. United States, 1945, 325 U.S. 91, 65 S.Ct. 1031, 89 L.Ed. 1495, it was established that the unlawful acts of an individual might be imputed to the state (for purposes of applying the Fourteenth Amendment) if the state had done acts clothing the wrongdoer with the trappings of its sovereignty. A similar view is implicit in the recent pronouncement of the Supreme Court on the subject in Monroe v. Pape, supra. But where the state has done nothing of that sort, we fail to see how the acts of a wrongdoer, no matter how reasonable his mistake of law, may be imputed to the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">We conclude therefore that relief would be barred, and the suit concluded, by a determination in the Virginia courts that Section 18-327 does not apply here. This being so, we believe that we are obliged on the present facts to refrain from decision and permit the state courts to rule upon the question of state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">We consider such abstention not merely within the discretion of this court, but compelled by the reasoning implicit in a series of recent decisions of the Supreme Court. We are mindful that \u201cno principle has found more consistent or clear expression than that the federal courts should not adjudicate the constitutionality of state enactments fairly open to interpretation until the state courts have been afforded a reasonable opportunity to pass upon them.\u201d Harrison v. N. A. A. C. P., 1959, 360 U.S. 167, 176, 79 S.Ct. 1025, 1030, 3 L.Ed.2d 1152.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">It is, at the very least, unseemly for a Federal court to \u201cguess at the resolution of uncertain and difficult issues of state law.\u201d Alleghany County v. Mashuda Co., 1959, 360 U.S. 185, 187, 79 S.Ct. 1060, 1062, 3 L.Ed.2d 1163. And the Supreme Court has said that where the issue \u201cinvolved the scope of a previously uninterpreted state statute which, if applicable, was of questionable constitutionality Leiter Minerals, Inc. v. United States, 352 U.S. 220, 229 [77 S.Ct., 287, 1 L.Ed.2d 267], we have required District Courts, and not merely sanctioned an exercise of their discretionary power, to stay their proceedings pending the submission of the state law question to state determination.\u201d Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co. v. City of Thibodaux, 1959, 360 U.S. 25, 28, 79 S.Ct. 1070, 1072, 3 L.Ed.2d 1058.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-12\">There can be no dispute about the presence of a grave and novel Federal constitutional question in the case at bar. Much more than the constitutionality of the Virginia statute is at stake. The issue appellant seeks to have us decide is whether there is a federally-protected right to be free of state-compelled segregation in a privately-owned and operated restaurant, or to put it more narrowly, whether the Fourteenth Amendment has empowered the Congress to provide a civil remedy against private restaurant operators who discriminate by reason of race under compulsion of state law, and whether Congress did provide such a remedy when it passed the statute appellant here invokes, Section 1983 of Title 42. The scrupulous care with which the Supreme Court has recently treated similar questions, see Boynton v. Commonwealth of Virginia, 1960, 364 U.S. 454, 81 S.Ct. 182, 5 L.Ed.2d 206, is a clear warning against the dangers of premature decision. It would be most rash for us to act gratuitously where the claimed rights and privileges of one group of citizens are arrayed against the claimed rights and privileges of other groups. Grave problems of Federal-state relationships are also presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-13\">While the roots of the abstention principle may lie in the Federal equity jurisdiction, see Railroad Commission of Texas v. Pullman Co., 1941, 312 U.S. 496, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971, the Supreme Court has clearly indicated in two recent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>cases that the application of the abstention doctrine does not depend on whether a complaint has demanded equitable or legal relief. See Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co. v. City of Thibodaux, supra; Clay v. Sun Insurance Office, 1960, 363 U.S. 207, 80 S.Ct. 1222, 4 L.Ed.2d 1170. That relief at law is demanded here is thus no bar to abstention.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">Nor do we deem it material that the potential area of conflict in the instant case lies between the Federal courts and the state acting through its legislature, rather than through its administrative agencies. Certainly where Federal courts run the risk of becoming enmeshed in the functions of state administrative bodies vested with the responsibility for developing and applying a continuing state policy, special reasons for abstaining are present. Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 1943, 319 U.S. 315, 63 S.Ct. 1098, 87 L.Ed. 1424; Alabama Public Service Commission v. Southern Ry., 1951, 341 U.S. 341, 71 S.Ct. 762, 95 L.Ed. 1002. That is not to say, however, that conflict with a state administrative agency is a <em>sine qua non </em>for the application of the doctrine; and it is clear from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Harrison v. N. A. A. C. P., 1959, 360 U.S. 167, 79 S.Ct. 1025, 3 L.Ed. 2d 1152 that such is not the case. Like Harrison, the case at bar involves potential Federal interference with a state policy of segregation as expressed through its statutes.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It has been argued that such a policy is not entitled to deference. Mr. Justice Douglas, dissenting in Harrison, points out that jurisdiction there was largely premised on the Civil Rights statutes (among them 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983, the one principally at issue here), and urges that by directing abstention the Supreme Court had failed \u201cto perform the duty expressly enjoined by Congress on the federal judiciary.\u201d <em>360 </em>U.S. at page 184, 79 S.Ct. at page 1034. The significance of this contention lies in the fact that it was obviously considered and rejected by a majority of the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">For these reasons, and guided by the decision of the Supreme Court in Harrison, supra, we abstain from decision on the merits in this case, pending resolution of the meaning and application of Section 18-327 of the Virginia Code by the courts of that state.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">We do not reach, and hence do not express any view concerning, the questions of law discussed in the dissenting opinion, other than as may appear in the foregoing pages.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>The judgment of the District Court will be vacated and the cause remanded.

The Court was there speaking of the state\u2019s action in seeking to compel\u2014 by statute \u2014 disclosure of the names of members of the N.A.A.C.P., which would allegedly be followed by private action in the shape of economic reprisals and \u201cother manifestations of public hostility.\u201d At page 462 of 357 U.S., at page 1172 of 78 S.Ct.

All that appellant has told us in writing on the subject appears at page 9 of his supplemental memorandum in this court, where he says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-14\">\u201cVa.Code sec. 18-327 has been widely regarded as compelling racial segregation in places of public accommodation of all sorts, including restaurants. Such belief was supported by the decisions of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia (per Judge Albert V. Bryan who has had long experience with Virginia law) that this provision applies to restaurants. See Nash v. Air Terminal Services, 85 F.Supp. 545, 548 (1949); Air Terminal Services v. Rentzel, 81 F.Supp. 611 (1949). This</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>widespread belief was also fostered by the repeated public expressions over the years by many prosecuting officials of Virginia that racial segregation in eating places was required by Virginia law.1 [1 E. g., Washington Post, June 24, 1960, p. A \u2014 1.] \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">Later, appellant filed with us a number of newspaper clippings in support of the statement last made. Assuming the clippings to be correct reports of various episodes, there is no allegation that they came to appellee\u2019s attention, or influenced its action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b888-16\">. See letter of Hon. Albertis S. Harrison, Jr., Attorney General of Virginia, under date of August 24, 1960, attached as an Appendix hereto.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b890-5\">. In Harrison a set of five recently enacted Virginia statutes designed to limit tlie legal representation and lobbying activities of the NAACP in Virginia were challenged. The Association, prior to any test of the applicability of the statutes in the Virginia courts, brought an action to have the Federal District Court declare them unconstitutional and enjoin their enforcement. The three-judge constitutional court, basing its decision on a finding that the legislation had been enacted to nullify the effect of the Supreme Court mandate in Brown v. Board of Education, 1954, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873, held three of the statutes unconstitutional on their face, but abstained, staying proceedings ponding construction by the state courts, as to the other two. On direct appeal by Virginia from the invalidation of her barratry and lobbying statutes, the Supreme Court in a six-to-three decision reversed the lower court and directed that these three acts should likewise have been subjected to \u201cthe possibility of limiting interpretation\u201d by the Virginia courts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b890-11\">. Some of the practical consequences of the theory of the dissent \u2014 that private persons may be sued for acts committed by them under the compulsion of state officials \u2014 should perhaps be noted. One of these would appear to be that the courts of the District of Columbia would be called upon to evaluate the conduct of state officials, alleged to have infringed Federal rights, if the plaintiff has succeeded in obtaining proper service here on the person or corporation alleged to have been coerced by such state officials into taking the action complained of. Many chain stores and other great business enterprises, transacting business here and in a number of states, are subject to service of process in this jurisdiction. (Venue problems might exist as to an individual defendant, but hardly as to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>corporation doing business bere. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1391, 1406.) Nor do the possible consequences appear to be limited to the Distinct of Columbia. Apparently the theory of the dissent would permit suit challenging private action on the theory of official compulsion to be brought in any jurisdiction in the country where the private defendant is found, no matter how distant that jurisdiction is from the state whose officials are being attacked. The operation of our Federal system of government might be gravely affected by any such result. Tire spirit of the transfer statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404 (a), if not its letter, would appear to call for the avoidance of consequences of this sort wherever possible. Any court which is asked to accept the position stated by the dissent will no doubt find it necessary to give careful consideration to the practical and governmental consequences just outlined.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b891-8\">FAHY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">I concur in vacating the judgment and remanding the case to the District Court. This will afford the parties opportunity to obtain a ruling of the Virginia courts on the question of the applicability to restaurants of section 18-327 of the Virginia Code. I would require the District Court, however, to retain jurisdiction so that it may itself decide the case after such opportunity has been afforded, taking into consideration the decision of the Virginia courts if obtained, or if not obtained within a reasonable time then redeciding the case itself. The Supreme Court has approved this procedure in comparable circumstances, saying,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-10\">\u201cBy retaining the case the District Court, of course, reserves power to take such steps as may be necessary for the just disposition of the litigation should anything prevent a prompt state court determination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZZ\">Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co. v.

The abstention technique is inapplicable upon that claim because its validity does not hinge on a question of State law and hence no decision of the Virginia courts could moot the Federal question which it presents.

As I read their opinion, they reach this determination by attributing to appellant a specific intent to rely solely on the applicability of \u00a7 18-327, Code of Virginia, in order to meet the statement of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that reliance upon a \u201cpositive provision of state law\u201d was essential to a valid claim in these cases. There is serious question whether the meaning of appellant\u2019s present allegations may be derived from inferences drawn from such extraneous matter. But even if it may, the allowable inference would be only that appellant sought to rely on a \u201cpositive provision of state law,\u201d not that he relied on nothing else to establish that the State or its officers maintained and enforced segregation in restaurants.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">I read the above described allegations as charging that appellee excluded the appellant because of appellee\u2019s \u201cunderstanding\u201d that it was required by law to do so, and that this understanding was \u201cproduced by the interplay of governmental and private action over a long period of time.\u201d To restrict proof of the basis of appellee\u2019s \u201cunderstanding\u201d to a State statute ignores settled principles of modern pleading. Rule 8(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. states, \u201call pleadings shall be so construed as to do substantial justice.\u201d This \u201cexcludes requiring technical exactness, or the making of refined inferences against the pleader, and requires an effort fairly to understand what he attempts to set forth.\u201d DeLoach v. Crowley\u2019s, Inc., 5 Cir., 1942, 128 F.2d 378, 380. In light of these principles, the allegations of the complaint are sufficient to admit evidence that appellee\u2019s \u201cunderstanding\u201d was compelled by governmental officials acting under their apparent authority.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is \u201cthe accepted rule that a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears <em>beyond doubt </em>that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d Conley v. Gibson, 1957, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 102, 2 L.Ed.2d 80, emphasis supplied. To require, as I think the majority does, that the complaint further particularize the officer\u2019s conduct and appellee\u2019s awareness of such conduct is to require appellant to plead his evidence. The Federal Rules do not require a statement of \u201cfacts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.\u201d See Dioguardi v. Durning, 2 Cir., 1944, 139 F.2d 774, 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">I turn now to the legal sufficiency of the claim that appellee\u2019s refusal to serve appellant is attributable to the State because it was compelled by conduct of State officials. Since the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Brown v. Board of Education, 1954, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873, and subsequent cases,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>there can no longer be any serious doubt that freedom from state imposed racial segregation is a right \u201csecured by the Constitution and laws\u201d of the United States.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The difficult question is whether the alleged State-compelled refusal of appellee may be deemed conduct \u201cunder color of\u201d law for the purposes of \u00a7 1983. I think an affirmative answer is required by recognized principles which have evolved in Fourteenth Amendment adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">In determining the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment, and consequently \u00a7 1983, the bare rubric that it applies only to \u201cstate action\u201d as opposed to \u201cprivate conduct\u201d is, without more, of little aid. A state can act only through human representatives, <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and unless the prohibitions of the Amendment, and the legislation designed to enforce them, apply to these representatives, they are without meaning. Ex Parte Virginia, 1879, 100 U.S. 339, 347, 25 L.Ed. 676.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">If a state statute affirmatively required restaurant owners to segregate their facilities or exclude Negro patrons, conduct of the restaurant owners caused solely by the compulsion of such a statute would be state action and would give rise to a claim for relief under \u00a7 1983. The decisions of the Supreme Court in the \u201cwhite primary\u201d cases clearly indicate that, at the very least, a state cannot avoid the prohibitions of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments by delegating to private groups or institutions the enforcement of a policy which, if enforced by the state would be contrary to the Constitution. See Smith v. Allwright, 1944, 321 U.S. 649, 64 S.Ct. 757, 88 L.Ed. 987; Nixon v. Condon, 1932, 286 U.S. 73, 52 S.Ct. 484, 76 L.Ed. 984. Cf. Terry v. Adams, 1953, 345 U.S. 461, 73 S.Ct. 809, 97 L.Ed. 1152; Rice v. Elmore, 4 Cir., 1947, 165 F.2d 387, certiorari denied, 1948, 333 U.S. 875, 68 S.Ct. 905, 92 L.Ed. 1151. And where the policy is one of racial segregation constituting an unreasonable classification under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the initiation and enforcement of that policy by \u201cinstrumentalities\u201d of the State gives rise to a claim for relief under the Civil Rights Act. See Smith v. Allwright, supra; Kerr v. Enoch Pratt Free Library of Baltimore City, 4 Cir., 1945, 149 F.2d 212, certiorari denied, 1945, 326 U.S. 721, 66 S.Ct. 26, 90 L.Ed. 427. If the policy of segregation is initiated by the state legislature rather than by a private organization acting as a state \u201cinstrumentality\u201d or exercising a \u201cstate function,\u201d whose action can therefore be imputed to the state, then, a fortiori, enforcement of that policy is prohibited by the Amendment and the implemental civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>rights legislation. When otherwise private persons or institutions are required by law to enforce the declared policy of the state against others, their enforcement of that policy is state action no less than would be enforcement of that policy by a uniformed officer. Baldwin v. Morgan, 5 Cir., 1958, 251 F.2d 780; Flemming v. South Carolina Electric <em>&amp; </em>Gas Co., 4 Cir., 1955, 224 F.2d 752, appeal dismissed, 1956, 351 U.S. 901, 76 S.Ct. 692, 100 L.Ed. 1439. \u201cThe pith of the matter is simply this, that when [private groups] * * * are invested with an authority independent of the will of the association in whose name they undertake to speak, they become to that extent the organs of the state itself, the repositories of official power.\u201d Nixon v. Condon, supra, at page 88, of 286 U.S., at page 487 of 52 S.Ct. Since a uniformed officer\u2019s enforcement of a statute requiring segregated facilities would give rise to a claim for redress under \u00a7 1983, similar enforcement by a delegated representative of the State, although ostensibly a private individual, likewise would be actionable. \u201cOnly by sifting facts and weighing circumstances can the nonobvious involvement of the State in private conduct be attributed its true significance.\u201d Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, 81 S.Ct. 856, 860.</p>\n<p id=\"AYtI\">In asserting the claim here discussed, appellant does not contend that appellee\u2019s refusal to serve him was authorized or required by a positive provision of Virginia law; but rather that its refusal was caused <em>solely </em>by the understanding generated by the conduct of State law enforcement officials that such conduct was required by law. If appellant can prove this, he is entitled to relief. For if appellee was required by State officials acting \u201cunder color of law\u201d to segregate its facilities or to exclude Negroes, its conduct was likewise State action and \u201cunder color of law\u201d no less than if it had been required by an unambiguous mandate of the Virginia legislature. If the State clothed its officials with the apparent authority to enforce segregation or exclusion of Negroes in public places,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and if these officials, acting by virtue of their office and purportedly pursuant to State law, by their conduct led appellee to understand and believe in good faith that it was required by law to exclude Negroes, then the appellee\u2019s action in excluding the appellant is attributable to the State.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> For Fourteenth Amendment purposes it matters not that the policy of racial segregation originated in the executive rather than the legislative or judicial branch of the State government. \u201cWhether the statute-book of the state actually laid down any such rule * * *, or not the state, through its officer, enforced such a rule: and it is against such state action, through its officers and agents, that the last clause\u201d of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights Acts are \u201cdirected.\" Civil Rights Cases, 1883, 109 U.S. 3, 15, 3 S.Ct. 18, 24, 27 L.Ed. 835 (referring to the Court\u2019s decision in Ex Parte Virginia, supra). It is well established that conduct of State officials may constitute State action even though it is contrary to State law and subject to correction by higher State authority. United States v. Raines, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">Appellee contends that it could have segregated its facilities or excluded Negroes free from Federal restraint, and that the additional presence of State compulsion does not change its conduct into State action. Admittedly, appellee, had it so desired as a matter of corporate policy, could have chosen to engage in such conduct without offending the Federal Statute. Civil Rights Cases, supra. But, by its motion to dismiss appellee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>admits, for the purposes of testing the sufficiency of the complaint,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that its exclusion of appellant was caused solely by the mandate of Virginia expressed through its apparently authorized officials and not by any exercise of private volition. Whether appellee, apart from this alleged compulsion, would have excluded appellant because of his color is a question of fact which is properly to be determined at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Although the alleged official conduct required <em>segregation, </em>appellee <em>excluded </em>appellant. No significance, however, can be attached to this distinction. Appellee was left only the option of either segregating or excluding Negroes. That it was \u201cfree to choose\u201d between segregation and exclusion does not make its election of either a matter of \u201cchoice\u201d in the sense of response to private volition rather than public command. Appellee was compelled to choose. Whichever alternative it chose, its action would have been undertaken, according to the complaint\u2019s allegations, only because of the compulsion of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">The nature of the relief available under \u00a7 1983 is worthy of comment. That section speaks of granting relief in \u201can action at law, suit in equity, <em>or other proper proceeding for redress.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) Whatever may be said about the initial congressional purpose in enacting this legislation, in the last twenty years the expansion of the state action concept<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and of the area of rights protected by the Federal Government<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> have made this section an increasingly flexible vehicle for enforcing the Constitution\u2019s guarantees of individual liberties against encroachment by the states and their representatives. The relief provisions of the statute are strikingly adaptable for that purpose. The present case demonstrates this. If, in fact, appellee\u2019s refusal to serve appellant was compelled against its will, principles of equity combine with the purpose of the Act to dictate relief which would also shield appellee against such compulsion, rather than penalize appellee by imposing damages for surrendering to it. This is available under the flexible relief provisions of the statute by a declaratory judgment vindicating appellant\u2019s right to be free from state-imposed racial discrimination. For such relief, an actual controversy is required. Evers v. Dwyer, 1958, 358 U.S. 202, 79 S.Ct. 178, 3 L.Ed. 2d 222. A declaratory judgment would have real meaning and purpose.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It would vindicate a civil right basic to human dignity, equality before the law. As the Fifth Circuit has said in recent suits to declare State imposed segregation invalid, \u201cmany, if not most, civil rights actions and those to redress denial of equal privileges and immunities are to obtain a declaration * * * of a constitutional prerogative * * * which is being ignored or denied by the defendant.\u201d Baldwin v. Morgan, supra, at page 787, of 251 F.2d. And \u201cin a suit of this kind plaintiffs have an absolute right to have their constitutional right declared * * Jackson v. Rawdon, 5 Cir., 1956, 235 F.2d 93, 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>The complaint seeks not only damages but also \u201csuch other and further relief as to the Court may seem just and proper.\u201d Even if no relief other than damages were requested, the District Court is empowered to grant the relief to which appellant proves that he is entitled at trial. Rule 54(c), Fed.R.Civ.P.; Blazer v. Black, 10 Cir., 1952, 196 F.2d 139; Keiser v. Walsh, 1941, 73 App.D.C. 167, 118 F.2d 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">Finally the majority opinion asserts that to recognize appellant\u2019s claim under \u00a7 1983 would make the courts of the District of Columbia a possible forum for similar claims arising in any State. This is hardly a valid reason for denying relief. In any event, it overlooks the requirements of personal jurisdiction and venue and our power under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a) to transfer a case to a more convenient forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">Appendix</p>\n<p id=\"AbD\">Commonwealth of Virginia</p>\n<p id=\"AjC\">Office of</p>\n<p id=\"AGZ\">The Attorney General</p>\n<p id=\"AqN\">Richmond</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">August 24, 1960</p>\n<p id=\"AxCR\">Honorable C.

Moreover, the rules of <em>efusdem generis </em>and <em>nosciUir a sociis </em>are clearly applicable in construing the general phrase \u201cplace of public entertainment or public assemblage\u201d appearing therein. When the statutes under consideration are interpreted in light of these principles, I am constrained to believe that your initial inquiry should be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">So far as I have been able to ascertain, the leading case in Virginia involving the application of the above-stated rules of construction to a penal statute is Gates and Son Co. v. City of Richmond, 108 Va. 702, 49 S.E. 965. In that case, the defendant, a corporation whose principal place of business was located on Fourteenth Street in the City of Richmond, was convicted in the trial court for an alleged violation of a penal ordinance of the city prohibiting any person from constructing or placing \u201cany portico, porch, door, window, step, fence, or other projection\u201d which extended into any street. The specific obstruction there under consideration was a movable \u201cgangplank\u201d or \u201cskid\u201d some twelve feet in length, which extended from the front door of defendant\u2019s place of business across the sidewalk to delivery wagons in the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">Utilizing the same rules of construction which I believe are indispensable to the proper'resolution of the questions you present, the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia reversed the judgment of conviction entered by the trial court. With respect to the character of the ordinance under consideration and its proper construction, the Court pointed out (103 Va. at 704 [49 S.E. at 965]):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-10\">\u201cThis is a penal ordinance, and is, therefore, to be construed strictly. It is not to be extended by implication, and must be limited in its application to cases clearly described by the language employed. The books abound with cases illustrating this principle, which is of universal application, except in particular instances in which the doctrine has been modified by statute * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-11\">\u00bb * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-12\">\u201cThese and many other cases which could be cited to the same effect, tend to illustrate the jealousy with which courts regard any substantial departure from this time-tested canon of construction. Its violation involves a most dangerous innovation, and places persons accused of crime at the mercy and arbitrary discretion of the judge who may chance to preside in the particular case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b897-13\">In support of this view, the Court quoted the following language of Marshall, C. J., in United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76, 5 L.Ed. 37:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-14\">\u201cThe rule that penal laws are to be construed strictly is, perhaps not much less old than construction itself. It is founded in the tenderness of the law for the rights of individuals, and on the plain principle that the power of punishment is vested in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>the legislative, not the judicial, department * * *. The case must <em>be </em>a strong one, indeed, which would justify a court in departing from the plain meaning of words, especially in a penal act, in search of an intention which the words themselves do not suggest. To determine that a case is within the intention of a statute its language must authorize us to say so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-4\">\u201cIt would be dangerous, indeed, to carry the principle, that a case which is within the reason or mischief of a statute, is within its provisions, so far as to punish a crime not enumerated in the statute, because it is of kindred character with those which are enumerated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">See, Jennings v. Commonwealth, 109 Va. 821, 63 S.E. 1080 [21 L.R.A.,N.S., 265]; Withers v. Commonwealth, 109 Va. 837, 65 S.E. 16; Sellers v. Bles, 198 Va. 49, 92 S.E.2d 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">The Court also pointed out that the \u201ckindred principles\u201d of <em>ejusdem generis </em>and <em>noscitur a sociis </em>must also be considered in ascertaining the correct interpretation of the ordinance there under consideration. These two rules of construction are well stated in 17 M.J. 325, Statutes: Section 62, and 17 M.J. 327, Statutes: Section 63, respectively, in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-7\">\u201cWhen a particular class of persons or things is spoken of in a statute and general words follow, the class first mentioned must be taken as the most comprehensive, and the general words treated as referring to matters ejusdem generis with such class, the effect of general words when they follow particular words being thus restricted. Things exceptional in character are never legally deemed to be included or embraced in general terms of disposition, prohibition or regulation of a class or classes of normal or ordinary subjects mentioned. This principle is the basis or meaning of the rule ejusdem generis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-8\">* * * * \u00ab * ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-9\">\u201cIt is a fundamental rule of construction that in accordance with the maxim \u2018noscitur a sociis\u2019 the meaning of a word or phrase may be ascertained by reference to the meaning of other words or phrases with which it is associated. Language, though apparently general, may be limited in its operation or effect where it may be gathered from the intent and purpose of the statute that it was designed to apply only to certain persons or things, or was to operate only under certain conditions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-10\">\u201cIn the interpretation of statutes, words and phrases therein are often limited in meaning and effect by necessary implications arising from other words or clauses thereof * * Also, a specific enumeration of words or objects, as a rule, controls general words which follow, and limits them in their operation to others of like kind.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-11\">Supportive of the foregoing statements are numerous decisions of the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia: Gates and Son Co. v. City of Richmond, supra; Standard Ice Co. v. Lynchburg Diamond Ice Factory, 129 Va. 521, 106 S.E. 390; Rockingham Cooperative Farm Bureau v. [City of] Harrisonburg, 171 Va. 339, 198 S.E. 908; East Coast Freight Lines v. City of Richmond, 194 Va. 517, 74 S.E.2d 283; Sellers v. Bles, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-12\">Having indicated the various rules of construction requisite to the proper resolution of the question presented in the Gates case, supra, the Court concluded (103 Va. at 707 [49 S.E. at 966]):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnLQ\">\u201cApplying the foregoing well-settled principles to the case in judgment, it is quite apparent that the offense charged is not embraced by the provisions of the ordinance under consideration. The ordinance is plainly intended to apply to obstructions and encroachments on the streets of a permanent character, and cannot without unwarranted enlargement of the ordinary scope and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>meaning of the language used, be made to embrace temporary obstructions such as are caused by the use of skids and similar appliances employed in loading and unloading wagons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-5\">\u201cIf in the judgment of the city council the use made of the streets in this instance amounts to an undue interference with the rights of the public, the evil can be remedied by appropriate legislation. But the courts must construe the ordinance as they find it, and cannot enlarge its operation to meet the exigencies of particular cases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">Analysis of the language of Sections 18.1-356 and 18.1-357 of the Code of Virginia furnishes significant internal support for the view that the rules of <em>ejusdem generis </em>and <em>noscitur a sociis </em>apply with special emphasis in delineating the proper scope of these statutes and that the general phrase, \u201cany place of public entertainment or public assemblage\u201d must be interpreted as restricted to places of the same class as those denominated by the immediately preceding specific terms. Although the general phrase in question is repeated seven times in the two enactments, it is never isolated from \u2014 but in each instance appears in conjunction with- \u2014 the antecedent specific terms, \u201cpublic hall, theatre, opera house\u201d and \u201cmotion picture show.\u201d It is manifest that these specific terms embrace places of public entertainment customarily attended by large groups of people who are usually present collectively for protracted periods of time. By contrast, drugstores, variety stores, lunch counters, restaurants and cafeterias are not places of public entertainment and are usually attended by groups of people who are present only temporarily for the purpose of inspecting or purchasing merchandise or meals. Certainly, the particular establishments concerning which you inquire are not expressly embraced in the statute, and I am constrained to believe that such establishments are not of the same class as those which are specifically mentioned. Moreover, as previously indicated, the statutes under consideration must be limited in their application to cases clearly described by the language employed, and the scope of the enactments may not be extended by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-9\">In light of the principles heretofore discussed, and the decision of the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia in Gates and Son Co. v. City of Richmond, supra, I am of the opinion that drugstores, variety stores, restaurants, lunch counters and cafeterias should not be deemed to be included within the ambit of Sections 18.1-356 and 18.1-357 of the Code of Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-10\">I am not advised of any statute in Virginia which requires separation of the races in eating establishments. Such separation is, in the discretion of the owner of such an establishment, permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-11\">Section 18.1-173 of the Code deals with the offense of trespass and it is designed to protect the rights of the owner or those in lawful control of private property. Under this statute, any person who shall, without authority of law, go upon the premises of another, after having been forbidden to do so, either orally or in writing, is guilty of a misdemeanor. Therefore, while there is no statute which requires separation of the races in eating establishments, there is a statute which protects the owner whose policy is to separate the races and who does, in fact, operate a segregated restaurant or other eating establishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-12\">Very truly yours,</p>\n<p id=\"b899-13\">[Albertis S. Harrison, Jr.] Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-14\">ASHjr/w</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b891-13\">. I also concur in the result reached by the majority with respect to appellant\u2019s claim under \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Civil Eights Act of 1875. I do this on the authority of Butts v. Merchants &amp; Miners Transportation Co., 1913, 230 U.S. 126, 33 S.Ct. 964, 57 L.Ed. 1422. Although subsequent decisions have cast considerable doubt on the reasoning of that case, see Wormuth, The Present Status of the Civil Eights Act of 1875, 6 Utah L.Rev. 153 (1958), I think that the latest expression of the Supreme Court in United States v. Raines, 1960, 362 U.S. 17, 80 S.Ct. 519, 4 L.Ed.2d 524, points to a reaffirmation of Butts as an exception to the general rule announced in Eaines that a statute will be held unconstitutional only as applied to the particular facts presented in an actual case or controversy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b891-15\">.

Morgan, 5 Cir., 1958, 251 F.2d 780, where, in reversing the dismissal of a complaint for relief \u25a0under \u00a7 1983, the court found that the allegations stated a valid claim under \u00a7 1985(3) as well, although no violation of that section was alleged. The court stated that its duty was to apply the appropriate civil rights statute irrespective of whether it had been correctly described in the complaint or not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b892-12\">.
