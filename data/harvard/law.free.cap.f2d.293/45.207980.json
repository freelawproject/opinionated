Whiting elected to receive and was paid workmen\u2019s compensation benefits, pursuant to such Act, by the Surety Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-25\">The trial court held that the asserted common law liability of the prime contractor was abrogated by The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of Colorado.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-26\">Subsequent to the decision of the court below in the instant case, this court, in Thomas v.
