Wiper, brought this action pursuant to the Jones Act (46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 688) to recover damages resulting from the death of her husband allegedly caused by the negligence of the defendant or the unseaworthiness of defendant\u2019s vessel, the M/V \u201cHydro\u201d (Hydro). The jury returned a verdict for the defendant, and from the judgment entered thereon, plaintiff appeals. The appeal is based primarily on contentions (1) that the trial court erroneously refused to submit to the jury certain instructions requested by plaintiff and (2) that that court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>erroneously charged that the condition of the dock area could not be attributed to defendant. Appellant also urges that the captain of the \u201cHydro\u201d was under an affirmative duty to detain Wiper on board because of indications that Wiper had been drinking.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">(' On September 15, 1958, the Hydro was being repaired in a slip adjoining the Detroit River, Detroit, Michigan, at a dock owned and operated by the Great Lakes Engineering Works (Great Lakes). The repair work was being performed by Great Lakes. On the afternoon of the 15th, Wiper, acting Chief Engineer of the Hydro, had been drinking, and defendant\u2019s Marine Superintendent stated that between 4:00 and 5:00 p. m. he ordered Wiper to \u201cget himself straightened out and get some sleep.\u201d At approximately 8:00 p. m., an employee of Great Lakes asked McLaughlin, an oiler on the Hydro, to obtain an oil seal for a thrust bearing needed in the repair of the ship\u2019s machinery. McLaughlin, searching for Wiper, found him asleep. After having been awakened by McLaughlin, Wiper dressed in street clothes and announced that he would go ashore to the Great Lakes\u2019 machine shop to check on the missing.part. The captain of the Hydro met Wiper on deck, and after noting the heaviness of Wiper\u2019s speech and the odor of alcohol on his breath, asked Wiper not to go ashore. Disregarding this request, Wiper proceeded along the deck, descended the ship\u2019s ladder, proceeded on shore away from the ship, recognized a fellow member of the crew who was returning to the ship, and was observed as walking without stagger or assistance. His body was found in the slip on September 19, 1958. An autopsy revealed that the date of death was September 16th; that the cause of death was \u201casphyxia by drowning\u201d; and that Wiper\u2019s blood alcohol content was .35%' \u2014 an amount which, according to an expert called by defendant, would have produced such a stuporous or nearly comatose state that an individual would need assistance in such simple acts \u25a0as dressing and walking.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The issues of negligence and unseaworthiness were submitted to the jury on the basis of conflicting evidence concerning the condition of the ladders used for boarding and leaving the Hydro. On this appeal plaintiff does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support defendant\u2019s verdict, but as stated claims that the trial judge erred in refusing to charge certain of the submitted requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">A comparison of these requests with the actual charge given leads to the conclusion that no error was committed. Request No. 15 was to the effect that \u201cthe words \u2018in the course of his employment\u2019 as used in the Jones Act is [sic] not restricted to death or injury occurring on navigable waters but may include injuries or death occurring while returning to the vessel, providing the accident happened while in the performance of his duties of employment.\u201d The judge charged that \u201cit would not matter that the death occurred while he [Wiper] was not on the \u2018Hydro\u2019 itself.\u201d Requests 19, 22 and 23 all concerned the shipowner\u2019s liability when an accident is partially caused by his negligence and partially by factors for which it was not responsible. The judge fully and properly explained to the jury that a verdict for plaintiff was required if defendant\u2019s negligence or the unseaworthiness of the Hydro caused \u201cin whole or in part\u201d Wiper\u2019s death. Request No. 28 dealt with the non-delegable duty of a shipowner to provide the crew with a safe place to work. The charge specifically referred to this well settled rule of law. Request No. 31 was partially a restatement of Request No. 28 and also stated that \"a shipowner may not abandon his ship nor its responsibility.\u201d This aspect of the charge was clearly inapplicable, there being no issue in the case as to the shipowner\u2019s having abandoned its duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">There is no merit to plaintiff\u2019s contention that the purpose of the above requests was \u201cto place before the jury the proposition that the condition of and on the dock immediately adjacent to the vessel was the shipowner\u2019s responsibil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>ity.\u201d Irrespective of the merits of this proposition, these requests, which were nothing more than general statements of established rules of law, were clearly insufficient to point up such a theory. Moreover, such a purpose cannot be assumed because no objection was interposed to that portion of the charge which stated that defendant was not responsible for any unsafe condition on the dock. Nor was objection made when, at the conclusion of the charge, the judge again charged at defendant\u2019s request, that defendant \u201cis not to be charged with negligence for any failure of any condition on the dock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s contentions concerning the above requests thus boil down to the proposition that the trial judge did not charge in the exact words of the various requests \u2014 a proposition not supported by the law. Halecki v. United New York and New Jersey Sandy Hook Pilots Association, 2 Cir., 1960, 282 F.2d 137, 140, certiorari denied 1961, 364 U.S. 941, 81 S.Ct. 459, 461, 5 L.Ed.2d 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\"> Plaintiff also argues that the trial judge erred in not charging that defendant could be held liable on the theory that it was negligent to allow Wiper to go ashore when he was in a drunken condition. This argument must fail for two reasons. First, plaintiff never requested that such a theory be charged; the two requests<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which are referred to as having raised this issue are so vague, ambiguous and conclusory as to not even suggest this theory. Secondly, the claim that Wiper should have been detained is refuted by the facts. Wiper was a mature (age 51) experienced seaman, holding a responsible position on the ship. He was not ordered to go ashore \u2014 in fact, the captain actually requested that he not do so. The amount of alcohol in Wiper\u2019s blood at the autopsy indicates that he must have done considerable drinking after leaving the Hydro, because there was no evidence introduced that, at the time he left the ship, he was in the condition which .35% alcohol content would have produced according to medical testimony. On the contrary, witnesses testified that they saw him able to get dressed and proceed safely away from the ship. Whatever the \u201cparental\u201d duty of a ship\u2019s captain may be, it surely does not require him to forcibly detain every crew member who has had a few drinks or who wishes to go ashore to do a bit of drinking for relaxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b541-6\">.
