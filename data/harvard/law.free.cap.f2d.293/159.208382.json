Subsequently, appellants, having refused to go through with the purchase, brought this suit to recover their deposit, contending that appellees \u201cfailed to convey the property free of encumbrances\u201d in that the location of the house upon its lot was in violation of a restrictive covenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-14\">The pertinent covenant provides that only one dwelling house shall be \u201cerected, maintained or suffered to remain\u201d upon each described parcel of a subdivided tract. Appellees bought two adjacent parcels, and later redrew the line separating them so that one parcel became somewhat larger than the other. On this larger parcel is situated the house built by appellees; it is this house and lot which they contracted to sell to appellants. The smaller parcel had earlier been deeded by appellees to a Dr. Moretti, who had built a house on it. There were thus two houses on two parcels \u2014 no more than the number contemplated by the covenant. Appellants\u2019 contentions are based on the fact that appellees\u2019 house is not wholly contained in one of the original parcels: a corner of its porch is intersected by the original dividing line between the parcels, though not by the line as redrawn by \u00bfppellees. No part of appellees\u2019 house lies within or on the land sold to Dr. Moretti. In this situation appellants contend that the restrictive covenant has been violated, entitling them to rescind the contract of sale and recover their deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-16\">The District Court concluded, <em>inter alia, </em>that even if the covenant had been violated, \u201cthe plaintiffs\u2019 [appellants\u2019] objection to the title offered by the defendants [appellees] Allen was a trivial objection, did not, within the range of reasonable probability \u2018expose them to the hazards of future litigation * * *,\u2019 and did not affect the marketability of the title to such property.\u201d Under all the circumstances of the case, we find no reason to disagree.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b208-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b208-12\">. We note in particular that appellants do not challenge the finding by the District Court that <em>\u201c[t]he </em>District <em>Title </em>Insurance Company, being fully aware of the use made of the land in question by Dr. Moretti and by the defendants [appellees] Allen, offered to plaintiff its full coverage title insurance policy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
