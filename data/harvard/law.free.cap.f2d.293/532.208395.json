Counts 1 and 2, relating to the first transaction between the officer and appellant, involved two marihuana cigarettes for which the officer gave no money to appellant; Counts 3 and 4 involved marihuana for which the officer gave $5.00 to appellant and which was used by appellant and another; Counts 5 and 6 involved heroin for which the officer gave appellant $6.00 and $1.00 for taxicab fare; Counts 9, 10 and 11 involved heroin for which the officer gave appellant $6.00 and 50 cents for streetcar fare; Counts 12, 13 and 14 involved heroin for which the officer gave appellant $6.00; and Counts 7 and 8 involved marihuana for which the officer gave appellant $20.00 and which appellant and others were preparing to smoke when the arresting officers appeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">The sole defense at trial was entrapment \u2014 that under the cloak of friendship the officer induced appellant to procure the marihuana and heroin for him. Appellant contends that upon the evidence of entrapment he was entitled to a directed verdict of acquittal. We think, however, that under governing case law the issue was properly submitted to the jury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nor do we find any basis for reversal in the other objections raised by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b581-9\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4704(a), 4705(a), 4742 (a), 4744(a), and 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174.
