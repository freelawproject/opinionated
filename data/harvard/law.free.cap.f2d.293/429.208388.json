L. Osborn, Jr., and Bessie Ruth Osborn (plaintiffs). The court below did not write an opinion, merely dismissing the action on the merits, stating that it had found that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and concluding that Karl\u2019s was entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-21\">The statement in the margin of the issues involved, omitting the record references, is taken from the abstract of the case appearing in appellants\u2019 brief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>This statement is followed by an enumeration of the points upon which appellants stake their case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7P\">\u201cIt is appellants\u2019 position that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQx\">\u201c(1) The \u2018employment contract' was sufficient to constitute an enforceable contract to make a contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AbV\">\u201c(2) At least a fact issue was raised on whether all the essential terms were included in the \u2018employment contract\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>\u201c(3) The Statute of Frauds does not apply.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-4\">\u201c(4) A fact issue was raised on whether appellee was estopped to assert either the Statute of Frauds or that there was no contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">\u201c(5) A fact issue was raised on whether an action for deceit existed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">We will follow this definition by appellants of the issues involved, and will take up the points upon which they rely for reversal in the foregoing order. We come first to the contention that the employment contract of March 13, 1956 was sufficient to constitute an enforceable contract to make a contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">We do not think so. The general law governing a contract to make a contract is quoted by appellants from 1 Cor-bin, Contracts, \u00a7 29, pp. 67-71:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-22\">\u201c * * * ii js qUiie possible for parties to make an enforceable contract binding them to prepare and execute a subsequent documentary agreement. In order that such may be the effect, it is necessary that agreement shall have been expressed on all essential terms that are to be incorporated in the document. That document is understood to be a mere memorial of the agreement already reached. If the document or contract that the parties agree to make is to contain any material term that is not already agreed on, no contract has yet been made; and the so-called \u2018contract to make a contract\u2019 is not a contract at all.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>See also 17 C.J.S. Contracts \u00a7 49, and 12 Am.Jur., Contracts, \u00a7 25. Texas is not contra. The ease chiefly relied upon by appellants, Vise v. Foster, Tex.Civ.App., Waco 1952, 247 S.W.2d 274, 278-279, presented a factual situation altogether different from this one. Nevertheless, the rule set forth above was subscribed to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AK5\">\u201cIn Radford v. McNeny, 129 Tex. 568, 104 S.W.2d 472, 475 (Com.App., opinion adopted by the S.Ct.) we find this statement of the general rule: \u2018 * * * to be enforceable, a contract to enter into a future contract must specify all its material and essential terms, and leave none to be agreed upon as the result of future negotiations.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The Texas cases relied upon by appellants are collected in Vise v. Foster, 247 S.W.2d at page 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">It is clear that the language of the contract of March 13, 1956, set forth in footnote 2 supra, does not satisfy the requirements spelled out in these authorities. First, it will be noted that the employment contract was to be entered into only if the parties should consummate the agreement of purchase and sale bearing the same date. Next, the employment contract did not describe the duties which Lichenstein was to perform for a period of five years at a salary of $1,000 per month. It did not state whether the employment was to be full time or only part time, the character of duties he was to perform, or the place of their performance, whether his expenses were to be paid if he was absent from his home, or any other details of the work Lichenstein was to do for the $60,000 mentioned in this sentence of the contract. Further, it is clear that the contract of employment, embracing the main consideration as recognized by all parties, \u201cshall be drawn, satisfactory to both parties * * No authority is cited which comes anywhere near justifying the enforcement of a writing which, though unambiguous as far as it goes, shows clearly that many of the most important portions of the proposed contract had not yet been defined or agreed to.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-14\">It is equally clear that appellants\u2019 Point (2) is without sound basis; and that there was no fact issue as to whether all essential terms were embraced in the employment contract. In deciding that issue, we look to the wording of the two writings upon which appellants rely. The language used by the parties in these two documents is not vague, indefinite or ambiguous. It is plain what the parties were agreeing to in those written instructions of March 13th.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-15\">Appellee was to pay Betty Lee Shoes $1.00 plus 75% of the cost of merchandise it had on hand April 30, 1956, not to exceed $55,000. In addition, if the conditions of the purchase contract were met, appellee was to pay Sam Lichenstein $60,000 in equal monthly installments for performing certain services for appellee over a term of five years. The contract to be drawn up was to be \u201csatisfactory to both parties.\u201d In the second paragraph of appellants\u2019 brief, it is stated that the contract between the parties to this litigation \u201cwas then incorporated into two instruments \u2014 the purchase agreement * * * and the employment contract * * An examination of the writings upon which action is admittedly predicated, therefore, demonstrates clearly, as a matter of law, that they do not express an enforceable contract, because they show on their face that agreement had not been reached by the parties on essential elements or, in any event, that the writings did not include those terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-16\">Appellee pled affirmatively that the agreement upon which appellants based their case was, as a matter of law, unenforceable because it was not executed in conformity with the Texas statutes of fraud.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellants devote only seven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>lines of their brief to responding to appellee\u2019s argument; contending, as Point (3) of their argument, that the Statute of Frauds does not apply to this case. They cite in support of their position the decision of the Supreme Court of Texas in Wright v. Donabauer, 1941, 137 Tex. 473, 154 S.W.2d 637.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellee takes the position that the case before us is governed rather by later decisions of the Supreme Court of Texas, Chevalier v. Lane\u2019s, Inc., 1948, 147 Tex. 106, 213 S.W.2d 530; 6 A.L.R.2d 1045 (which discusses Wright v. Donabauer at pages 532-533, of 154 S.W.2d), and Hall v. Hall, 1957, 158 Tex. 95, 308 S.W.2d 12.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We agree with appellee\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">By the terms of the writings sued on it is provided that appellee \u201cwill agree to enter into an employment contract between themselves and San Lichenstein for a period of five years at a salary of $1,-000.00 per month.\u201d It is perfectly clear that Lichenstein could not perform five years of services within one year and that, therefore, this contract, as it is written, could not be performed within one year and that the quoted statute of Texas applies. No contract, embracing what the parties agreed would be contained in it, would be enforceable unless it was in writing and signed by appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Appellants argue Points (4) and (5) supra together, contending that a fact issue was raised on whether appellee was estopped to assert the Statute of Frauds, or that there was no contract; and that a fact issue was raised on whether an action for deceit existed. In support of this phase of the argument they claim that Karl\u2019s representatives managed the transaction throughout (although the approach had been made by appellants); that they went to appellants' stores and moved the central organization in Austin, shipped out some of their merchandise, bossed their employees, changed the locks on the doors and moved considerable of their equipment. They claim further that Lichenstein was \u201cnot satisfied with the procedure and protested to Karl's representatives who assured and lulled him into a sense of false security, saying \u2018Don\u2019t worry, Sam, we\u2019ve got a deal. This deal is going to close, Sam. Stop worrying.\u2019 \u201d; and that, relying on these assurances, Lichenstein \u201creluctantly permitted Karl\u2019s representatives to continue their plan.\u201d Appellants add that \u201cWhen Sam Lichenstein refused their last minute effort to further reduce the consideration promised, they walked out on the deal stating they were not willing to stick by Karl\u2019s original commitment. Mr. Lichen-stein was too trusting, a quality for which he has been penalized.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-12\">It is likely that the last sentence summarizes whatever unfortunate consequences ensued to appellants in connection with the prolonged negotiations which followed between them and appellee. But the conclusion stated in that sentence does not support the action appellants brought against appellee. It cannot be doubted that, when Betty Lee approached Karl\u2019s in an effort to sell the latter its chain of stores, both parties entered into the tentative arrangement expressed by the two writings of March 13th in good faith. From the start it was plain that Karl\u2019s interest in consummat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>ing the tentative arrangements was conditioned upon its ability to \u201cexpense\u201d the $60,000 to be paid to Lichenstein so that it could benefit by the tax consequences which would follow such a course. All of the spirited negotiations and maneuvering for position which followed in the ensuing weeks recognized this as the chief item which had to be agreed upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">For example, appellant Lichenstein attached, as an exhibit to his affidavit opposing appellee\u2019s demand for summary judgment, a \u201cconfirmation\u201d of the agreement between the parties bearing an April date and written by Karl\u2019s to Lichenstein, which sets forth the terms which Karl\u2019s desired incorporated in the contemplated written agreement. With respect to Lichenstein\u2019s proposed employment, it was made clear that the terms which appellee would find \u201csatisfactory\u201d must include a number of provisions defining the character and scope of Lichenstein\u2019s duties.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Appellants\u2019 lawyer, in his deposition, stated that he \u201cwanted it [the employment contract] written in such words that * * * they couldn\u2019t fire him without a reasonthat \u201cit was a matter of getting a piece of paper which made it clear and positive that he wouldn\u2019t be fired after they got possession of the business;\u201d that if he \u201ccould get Mr. Dougherty [appellee\u2019s attorney] to write the duties on paper that were objective enough, that would assure me that after everything was signed up that Karl\u2019s couldn\u2019t fire Mr. Lichenstein for any half-baked reason, we were ready to go.\u201d The lawyer further insisted, for a considerable time during the negotiations, that some sort of security should be given to Lichenstein protecting him in the payment of the monthly salary. The lawyer finally agreed to take Mr. Karl\u2019s personal endorsement as such security.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-13\">Appellants take the position that \u201c * * it was clearly understood that he [Lichen-stein] was not to seriously undertake substantial action that would require his ability and understanding of the retail business;\u201d and that the entire arrangement to employ Lichenstein was nothing but pure \u201csham,\u201d substituting the \u201cemployment contract\u201d in lieu of the purchase price for a portion of Betty Lee\u2019s assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-14\">The only possible significance of this evidence is that it shows that the minds of the parties never met on an important and essential ingredient of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>contract the parties had agreed to make. The only contract in writing which was enforceable under Texas laws was the one where the parties contracted that \u201cthey will agree to enter into an employment contract,\u201d and that a contract \u201cshall be drawn, satisfactory to both parties.\u201d It was recognized that the writings of March 13th did not constitute a contract, but merely an agreement to make a contract. The parties worked diligently in an effort to draw up an employment contract which both would be willing to enter into \u2014 which would be \u201csatisfactory\u201d to both parties. This they were never able to do. Since the termminology of the two writings of March 13th they both signed was clear and unambiguous and there were no conflicts between any of the provisions, the construction of the meaning of the parties as therein expressed called for the decision of a question of law only. Extrinsic evidence was not admissible under Texas law to vary, alter or amend the terms of these unambiguous written instruments. Anderson &amp; Kerr Drilling Co. v. Bruhlmeyer, 1940, 134 Tex. 574, 136 S.W.2d 800, 127 A.L.R. 1217; Texas Electric Ry. Co. v. Neale, 1952, 151 Tex. 526, 252 S.W.2d 451; Tower Contracting Co., Inc. v. Flores, 1957, 157 Tex. 297, 302 S.W.2d 396. And cf. Collins v. Republic National Bank of Dallas, 1953, 152 Tex. 392, 258 S.W.2d 305; Lewis v. East Texas Finance Co., 1941, 136 Tex. 149, 146 S.W.2d 977; and 2 McCormick &amp; Ray, Texas Law of Evidence, 2d Ed., \u00a7 1634, pp. 489-492.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">It is plain, therefore, that extraneous evidence was not, in the absence of fraud, admissible to show that an agreement to enter into an employment contract at a salary of $1,000 per month was not an employment contract at all, but a sales contract involving no employment and no salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Finally, appellants contend that their evidence raised issues of fact as to whether appellee was not estopped to assert the statute of frauds, or to contend there was no contract. They argue likewise that an issue of fact was developed as to whether they were entitled to recover on an action for deceit. An examination of the briefs and of this record of more than five hundred pages fails to disclose any material factual issue as to estoppel or deceit.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">The short answer to these contentions, however, is that they were not advanced by the appellants in the court below. Neither the complaint nor any pleading by either party mentioned estoppel or deceit, or referred to any facts tending to support an action involving either. Both estoppel and fraud are required, under Rule 8(c) F.R.Civ.P., 28 U.S.C.A., to be pled affirmatively, and Rule 9(b) requires that the circumstances constituting fraud<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> be set forth with particularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">The court below decided this action on summary judgment. Rule 56(c) requires that judgment be rendered forthwith for the party demanding it \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact * * *.\u201d The issue contemplated by this rule is an issue which is raised by the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-12\">For the reasons given we think that the judgment of the court below was right and it is</p>\n<p id=\"b484-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b478-11\">. The judgment listed what the court considered in arriving at the summary judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-12\">\u201c * * * and the Court having considered the pleadings in the action, the Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, together with all depositions, affidavits and exhibits referred to therein and attached thereto, and having considered Plaintiffs\u2019 Answer to Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment and the supplement thereto, together with all affidavits and exhibits referred to therein, and all depositions and stipulations and having heard oral argument of counsel \u00a3 * $ \u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b478-14\">. \u201cSam Lichenstein is the sole owner of Betty Lee Shoes, Inc., except for a few shares held by his wife and trusted employees. Early in 1956 Sam Lichenstein contacted a representative of Karl\u2019s Shoe Stores, Ltd., and suggested that it might be profitable if Karl\u2019s would buy Betty Lee. Whereupon Karl\u2019s representatives came to Austin.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-15\">\u201cIt was first agreed that Karl\u2019s would pay 75% of the original cost of inventory not to exceed $55,000.00 total cash outlay and $60,000.00 for the furniture, fixtures and leasehold improvements. Karl\u2019s later stipulated, however, that the $60,000.00 would be paid under an \u2018employment contract\u2019 and that $1.00 would be paid for furniture, fixtures and leasehold improvements. * * * <em>This agreement was then incorporated into tioo instruments\u25a0 </em>\u2014 the <em>purchase agreement (Record) </em>20 <em>and the \u2018employment contract\u2019 (Record SO). </em>The purchase agreement was made subject to an inspection of the stores.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-23\">\u201cThe negotiations were clear that the recited price for the furniture, fixtures and improvements would be $1.00 and that Mr. Lichenstein would be given an \u2018employment contract\u2019 whereby he was to be paid $1,000.00 a month for five years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-24\">\u201c * * * The \u2018employment contract\u2019 was to be non-cancelable. By this procedure Karl\u2019s hoped to deduct $60,000.00 of the actual purchase price as \u2018salary.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-26\">\u201cAfter inspecting the stores, Karl\u2019s drafted a letter to Mr. Lichenstein accepting the original agreement with certain changes, all to Karl\u2019s benefit. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>letter was personally brought to Austin ^ by two of Karl\u2019s representatives and submitted to Mr. Lichenstein for his immediate approval. Mr. Lichenstein was unable to obtain the advice of counsel on such short notice. Consequently, he signed the letter the day it was presented but held in reserve his final determination until such time as he would be able to discuss the matter fully with his attorney. Since the estimated inventory was running higher than anticipated, Sam Lichen-stein agreed to an adjustment whereby Karl\u2019s was to pay 75% of the original cost of the inventory up to $65,000.00 and 50% of the original cost in excess of $65,000.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-9\">\u201cDuring the entire negotiations thus far it was never contemplated by either of the parties that Mr. Lichenstein was to perform any substantial service for Karl\u2019s, if any service at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-10\">\u201cIn April of 1956 a contingency of representatives from Karl\u2019s came to Austin to consummate the agreement. They <em>took over the operation </em>of the warehouse, shipped out merchandise, had the ofiice fixtures labeled for transport and agreed on the cost price of the inventory. Representatives of Karl\u2019s were in the various stores with detailed instruction on the method for taking over the Betty Lee chain operations, Mr. Lichenstein protested over the taking over of his stores by Karl\u2019s representatives until he was paid, but was always told, \u2018don\u2019t worry, Sam, we have a deal,\u2019 or that \u2018the deal is closed.\u2019 Mr. Lichenstein relied on these assurances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-11\">\u201cApparently it suddenly came to the attention of Karl\u2019s representatives that unless there was some writing concerning the exact nature of Mr. Lichenstein\u2019s \u2018duties,\u2019 Internal Revenue would capitalize the so-called \u2018employment contract.\u2019 Therefore, they attempted to alter the deal that they had already made. When Mr. Lichenstein insisted that they abide by their original agreement, Karl\u2019s representatives left town, stating that the deal was off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-12\">\u201cThis left Mr. Lichenstein in a very precarious position. His inventory was critically low, and his entire organization was disrupted. He had even told his employees that the stores would be sold, relying on Karl\u2019s statement \u2018that the deal was closed.\u2019 Mr. Lichenstein attempted to save his business rather than see a lifetime\u2019s efforts be completely destroyed. During the next year he managed to stay in business and made arrangements to sell the business elsewhere.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-14\">\u201cThe operating profits are very definite during the period in which Betty Lee was operating under normal conditions. A very substantial profit was made each fiscal year. Right up until the time of the proposed sale profits wore substantial. However, during the period that followed a loss was sustained. As a result of the losses sustained, having relied on Karl\u2019s integrity and commitment, Mr. Lichenstein filed this suit to recover a portion of his life earnings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-15\">\u201cThe trial court sustained appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment holding as a matter of law appellants could not recover.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-16\">The agreement appearing on page 29 of the record, referred to in appellants\u2019 brief, is as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-17\">\u201cAgreement Between Betty Lee Shoes, Inc. of Austin, Texas (A Texas Corporation) and Karl\u2019s Shoe Stores, Lt\u2019d, (A California Corporation)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-20\">\u201cIt is hereby agreed between the undersigned that the Betty Lee Shoes, Inc. known as party of the first part and Karl\u2019s Shoe Stores, Ltd., known as party of the second part, as follows: Party of the second part shall purchase all of the leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures that are in the stores listed below as of this date for the sum of $1.00.
