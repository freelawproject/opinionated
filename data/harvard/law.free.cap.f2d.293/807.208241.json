The union officers had custody of the records subpoenaed and there was no claim of any physical inability on their part to produce them.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-16\">The Secretary filed a petition in the District Court for enforcement of the subpoenas, which was denied on the ground that the Secretary had made no showing as to necessity for the investigation and because the subpoenas were too broad.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-17\">It appeared on the face of the subpoenas that they were issued in connection with \u201can investigation by the Bureau of Labor-Management Reports <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> involving a determination whether any person has violated any provision of the Act.\u201d The subpoenas called for the production of the following records:</p>\n<p id=\"b856-18\">All records for the period from January 1, 1959 to the present date maintained by you or under your control which contain any basic information or data on matters required to be reported from which the organizational report (Form LM-1), and the financial report (Form LM-2) filed with the Secretary of Labor for Local 614, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America may be verified, explained or clarified and checked for accuracy and completeness, in connection with all items referred to or listed in such report and all i ferns <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>omitted or excluded therefrom which are relevant thereto and are required to be included in said reports, such records to include but not be limited to, vouchers, worksheets, ledgers, audit reports, records of receipt of dues, fees, assessments, fines and work permits, accounts receivable, accounts payable, journals, journal vouchers, check register, payroll register and related records and all books of accounts of Local 614, related to the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America, or other local unions affiliated with said International including all bank statements, cancelled checks, check stubs, audit reports, financial reports, records of loans, records of mortgages, records of ownership of property real and personal, deeds, records of trusts, records of investments, and all correspondence and memoranda pertaining to receipts and disbursements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">No evidence was offered in the District Court. The record consisted of the petition for enforcement, the exhibits attached thereto and the unions\u2019 response which admitted the allegations of Paragraphs I to XI of said petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">In the District Court, the unions contended that it was obligatory on the part of the Secretary to first establish probable cause for the investigation as a condition precedent to obtaining enforcement of the subpoenas by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">The District Court, in its opinion denying enforcement, did not expressly use the term \u201cprobable cause,\u201d but adopted words of like import which imposed a requirement at least as stringent, namely, that the Secretary establish a basis for the investigation. The court said that there must be some \u201creasonable foundation or valid purpose\u201d rather than merely looking into the records of the union in the hope of turning up something. This, in effect, was a holding that the Secretary had no right merely to investigate, but was required first to establish a probable violation of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-12\">In this Court, the unions contended that as a prerequisite to judicial enforcement of a subpoena duces tecum the Seeretaiy \u201cmust show that he has a reasonable belief of necessity [i. e., a reasonable basis] for the investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b857-13\">The statute required the unions to maintain the records which were subpoenaed. It provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-14\">\u201cEvery person required to file any report under this subchapter shall maintain records on the matters required to be reported which will provide in sufficient detail the necessary basic information and data from which the documents filed with the Secretary may be verified, explained or clarified, and checked for accuracy and completeness, and shall include vouchers, worksheets, receipts, and applicable resolutions, and shall keep such records available for examination for a period of not less than five years after the filing of the documents based on the information which they contain.\u201d 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 436.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-15\">Power was granted to the Secretary to make an investigation by the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-16\">\u201cInvestigations by Secretary; applicability of other laws</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AG6\">\u201c(a) The Secretary shall have power when he believes it necessary in order to determine whether any person has violated or is about to violate any provision of this chapter (except subchapter II of this chapter) to make an investigation and in connection therewith he may enter such places and inspect such records and accounts and question such persons as he may deem necessary to enable him to determine the facts relative thereto. The Secretary may report to interested persons or officials concerning the facts required to be shown in any report required by this chapter and concerning the reasons for failure or refusal to file <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>such a report or any other matter which he deems to be appropriate as a result of such an investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0O\">\u201c(b) For the purpose of any investigation provided for in this chapter, the provisions of sections 49 and 50 of Title 15 (relating to the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, papers, and doeuments), are made applicable to the jurisdiction, powers, and duties of the Secretary or any officers designated by him.\u201d 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 521 (a, b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-13\">The pertinent provisions of Section 9 and Section 10 of the Federal Trade Commission Act which were made applicable are set forth in footnote 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>The' legislative history of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act reveals that the original bills introduced in the House<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Senate<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> each granted power to the Secretary to make an investigation only when he had probable cause to believe that any person or labor organization had violated any provision of the Act. The probable cause requirement, however, was eliminated from the Act as it was finally passed. The reason for deleting the probable cause requirement is set forth in the minority amendments adopted by the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare. It is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-4\">\u201cSection 106(c): The Secretary shall have the power and is directed when he believes it necessary in order to determine whether anyone has violated or is about to violate a provision of this bill to make investigations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-5\">\u201cAs originally worded, this section would have given the Secretary the authority to investigate the books and records of persons reporting under the act only when he had probable cause to believe that a person had violated provisions of the act. On the surface, the term \u2018probable cause\u2019 would appear to give the Secretary all the investigatory power that he needed. But the words \u2018probable cause\u2019 would throw a monkey wrench into the Secretary\u2019s investigatory machinery. Probable cause means more than mere suspicion that the act has been violated. To have probable cause, a person must have such evidence as would lead the ordinary prudent man to believe that the act has been violated. Consequently, every time he commenced an investigation the Secretary could be dragged into court until the question of probable cause had been decided. Under nearly every statute requiring the filing of reports, such as the Internal Revenue Act and the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Administrator can conduct \u2018spot check\u2019 investigations unhampered by the \u2018probable cause\u2019 requirement. Our amendment rewrites this section to give the Secretary investigatory power when he believes it necessary in order to determine whether a violation has occurred or is about to occur.\u201d U. S. Code Congressional &amp; Administrative News \u2014 86th Congress, 1st Session 1959, pp. 2395, 2396.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">After the bill had passed the Senate, it was sent to a Conference Committee which reported:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-10\">\u201cSection 601 \u2014 Investigations</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-11\">\u201cThe Senate bill contains a provision which directs the Secretary to conduct an investigation when he \u25a0. believes it necessary in order to determine whether any person has, or \u25a0 is about to, violate the act, or any rule or regulation authorized by the act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-12\">\u201cThe House amendment directs the Secretary to make an investigation when he has probable cause to believe that any person has violated ' a provision of the act, other than title I.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-13\">\u201cThe conference substitute is similar to the Senate bill, except that the investigation authority is per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>missive rather than mandatory, no investigation may be made with respect to violations of rules and regulations, and the investigation authority does not extend to title I.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-4\">\u201cThe Senate bill also contains a provision authorizing the Secretary to report to interested persons concerning the facts required to be shown in reports and concerning the reasons for failure or refusal to file a report or any other matter he deems appropriate as a result of an Investigation. The conference substitute adopts this provision.\u201d U. S. Code Congressional &amp; Administrative News \u2014 86th Congress, 1st Session 1959, p. 2508.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">The legislative history of the Act is clear that Congress rejected the \u201cprobable cause\u201d requirement because it might hamper the Secretary in the performance of his duties with respect to investigation which were imposed upon him by the Act. With such a requirement, each investigation would likely be met by a lawsuit in which the Secretary would be obliged to prove a probable violation of the Act or enforcement of subpoenas would be denied. Even if successful in his proof, the investigation by the Secretary might be delayed for months or years while the matter was being litigated in the courts. It seems to us that the court ought not to impose a condition, which Congress rejected, on the exercise of the right of the Secretary to investigate. Nor do we see any real difference between the rejected \u201cprobable cause\u201d requirement and that of a \u201creasonable basis\u201d for the investigation t adopted by the District Court. While the disclosure sought must not be unreasonable or oppressive (Oklahoma Press Publishing Co. v. Walling, 327 U.S. 186, 208, 66 S.Ct. 494, 90 L.Ed. 614), this does not mean that the Secretary is obligated to establish a reasonable basis for his investigation. If the Secretary was in possession of facts establishing a probable violation he might never need to investigate. The purpose of the investigation authorized by Congress was to provide the means of discovery whereby the Secretary could determine whether the Act was being violated, or about to be violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">All the statute required, in order for the Secretary to investigate, was that he \u201cbelieve it necessary in order to determine whether any person has violated or is about to violate any provision of this chapter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">In his petition for enforcement filed in the District Court, the Secretary alleged in paragraph six that he believed it was necessary to make the investigation to determine whether any persons violated or were about to violate the law. The unions in their response to the petition (Par. I) admitted the allegations contained in paragraph six and certain other paragraphs of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">In the absence of proof to the contrary, there is a presumption of regularity in the proceedings of a public officer. The burden is upon the party complaining to show otherwise. Cf. Fahey v. Mallonee, 332 U.S. 245, 254, 67 S.Ct. 1552, 91 L.Ed. 2030; Mississippi Road Supply Co. v. Walling, 5 Cir., 136 F.2d 391, 394; 42 Am.Jur. \u00a7 240 p. 680. The trial judge commented on the fact that the Secretary did not offer any evidence to establish the reason or basis for the investigation. In our opinion, the Secretary was not required to do so. The statute was sufficient authority for him to proceed. The purpose of the investigation appeared on the face of the subpoenas. The Secretary could not very well perform his statutory duty and determine whether the Act was being violated or about to be violated without making an investigation. Requiring the Secretary to first establish a probable violation of the Act, as a condition precedent to making an investigation, effectively stripped him of his power to investigate and prevented him from determining whether the Act was being violated or about to be violated. It virtually rendered the enforcement provisions of the Act nugatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">We believe Oklahoma Press Publishing Co. v. Walling, 327 U.S. 186, 66 S.Ct. 494, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>509, 90 L.Ed. 614, is dispositive of this issue. In upholding enforcement of a subpoena duces tecum issued by the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-5\">\u201cCongress has made no requirement in terms of any showing of \u2018probable cause\u2019; and, in view of what has already been said, any possible constitutional requirement of that sort was satisfied by the Administrator\u2019s showing in this case, including not only the allegations concerning coverage, but also that he was proceeding with his investigation in accordance with the mandate of Congress and that the records sought were relevant to that purpose. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-6\">\u201cThe result therefore sustains the Administrator\u2019s position that his investigative function, in searching out violations with a view to securing enforcement of the Act, is essentially the same as the grand jury\u2019s, or the court\u2019s in issuing other pretrial orders for the discovery of evidence, and is governed by the same limitations. These are that he shall not act arbitrarily or in excess of his statutory authority, but this does not mean that his inquiry must be \u2018limited * * * by * * * forecasts of the probable result of the investigation * * *.\u2019 Blair v. United States, 250 U.S. 273, 282, 39 S.Ct. 468, 63 L.Ed. 979; cf. Hale v. Henkel, 201 U.S. 43, 26 S.Ct. 370, 50 L.Ed. 652. Nor is the judicial function either abused or abased, as has been suggested, by leaving to it the determination of the important questions which the Administrator\u2019s position concedes the courts may decide.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-11\">The Court was cognizant of contentions which would block an investigation at the very threshold of the inquiry stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-12\">\u201cOn the other hand, petitioners\u2019 view, if accepted, would stop much if not all of investigation in the public interest at the threshold of inquiry and, in the case of the Administrator, is designed avowedly to do so. This would render substantially impossible his effective discharge of the duties of investigation and enforcement which Congress has placed upon him. And if his functions could be thus blocked, so might many others of equal importance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-14\">In United States v. Morton Salt Co., 338 U.S. 632, 70 S.Ct. 357, 369, 94 L.Ed. 401, the Court followed Oklahoma Press and said with respect to the grounds for an investigation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-15\">\u201cEven if one were to regard the request for information in this case as caused by nothing more than official curiosity, nevertheless law-enforcing agencies have a legitimate right to satisfy themselves that corporate behavior is consistent with the law and the public interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-16\">See also Federal Trade Commission v. Crafts, 355 U.S. 9, 78 S.Ct. 33, 2 L.Ed.2d 23; Endicott Johnson Corp. v. Perkins, 317 U.S. 501, 63 S.Ct. 339, 87 L.Ed. 424; Hunt Food &amp; Industries, Inc. v. Federal Trade Commission, 9 Cir., 286 F.2d 803, certiorari denied 365 U.S. 877, 81 S.Ct. 1027, 6 L.Ed.2d 190; Provenzano v. Porter, 9 Cir., 159 F.2d 47, certiorari denied 331 U.S. 816, 67 S.Ct. 1303, 91 L.Ed. 1834; Walling v. La Belle S. S. Co., 6 Cir., 148 F.2d 198; Fleming v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., 7 Cir., 114 F.2d 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-17\">In Chapman v. Maren Elwood College, 9 Cir., 225 F.2d 230, relied on by appellees, the court denied enforcement of a subpoena duces tecum issued by the Veterans Administration on the ground that it had been issued for an improper purpose and, was therefore unreasonable. The purpose of the investigation in that case was to compel the college to agree to a ten percent projection demand. Affidavits proving this contention were offered in evidence by the college and were not rebutted by the Veterans Administration. No proof was offered by the unions in the present case that the subpoenas were issued for any improper purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>The District Court relied on Federal Trade Commission v. American Tobacco Co., 264 U.S. 298, 44 S.Ct. 336, 68 L.Ed. 696, but as we pointed out in Walling v. La Belle S. S. Co., 6 Cir., 148 F.2d 198, the Federal Trade Commission did not possess power of inspection such as was granted by Congress to the Wage and Hour Administrator under Section 11(a) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 211(a). The Secretary here has the same power as the Administrator. The later decisions of the Supreme Court in Oklahoma Press, Morton Salt and Crafts clearly indicate that probable cause for an investigation is not required. In our judgment, the District Court erred in imposing a condition on the exercise of the right granted by Congress to the Secretary to make an investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">It is next contended that the subpoenas duces tecum were too broad. In substance, they required production of records containing basic information or data on matters required to be reported from which the organizational reports (Form LM-1) and the financial reports (Form LM-2) filed with the Secretary by the unions may be verified, explained or clarified and checked for accuracy and completeness. These were the records which the statute required the unions to keep and were quasi-public records. Production of the records could not be resisted on the ground of self-incrimination. Shapiro v. United States, 335 U.S. 1, 68 S.Ct. 1375, 92 L.Ed. 1787; Wilson v. United States, 221 U.S. 361, 31 S.Ct. 538, 55 L.Ed. 771; United States v. Pulford, 6 Cir., 155 F.2d 944; Rodgers v. United States, 6 Cir., 138 F.2d 992. The unions asserted no such ground. In our opinion, it was not unreasonable to compel production of records which the law required to be kept and from which the reports filed with the Secretary were made. In no other way could the Secretary verify the reports than by examination of the records. These records were relevant to the inquiry because they would throw light on whether the reports filed by the unions with the Secretary spoke the truth. The District Court, however, had the power to impose protective restraints on the conduct of the investigation to relieve against oppression or other illegal conduct. Hunt Foods &amp; Industries, Inc. v. Federal Trade Commission, 9 Cir., 286 F.2d 803, 811, certiorari denied 365 U.S. 877, 81 S.Ct. 1027, 6 L.Ed.2d 190. This power was not invoked by the unions. They questioned the right of the Secretary to make the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">Oklahoma Press involved a corporation. It is urged that a different rule should apply to labor unions. We think not. In United States v. White, 322 U.S. 694, 64 S.Ct. 1248, 1252, 88 L.Ed. 1542, a subpoena duces tecum issued by the District Court requiring a union to produce its records before a Grand Jury was resisted by a union officer on the ground that they might tend to incriminate the union or himself individually or as such officer. The Supreme Court held that this defense was not available. While White involved the Fifth Amendment, the opinion of the Court contains language which is pertinent here. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-7\">\u201cThe fact that the state charters corporations and has visitorial powers over them provides a convenient vehicle for justification of governmental investigation of corporate books and records. Hale v. Henkel, supra; Wilson v. United States, supra. But the absence of that fact as to a particular type of organization does not lessen the public necessity for making reasonable regulations of its activities effective, nor does it confer upon such an organization the purely personal privilege against self-incrimination. Basically, the power to compel the production of the records of any organization, whether it be incorporated or not, arises out of the inherent and necessary power of the federal and state governments to enforce their laws, with the privilege against self-incrimination being limited to its historic function of protecting only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>the natural individual from compulsory incrimination through his own testimony or personal records.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-6\">\u201cThe union and its officers acting in their official capacity lack the privilege at all times of insulating the union\u2019s books and records against reasonable demands of governmental authorities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">Finally, the unions contend that Section 201 of the Act (29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 431), containing the provisions requiring them to file reports with the Secretary, is unconstitutional in violation of the Commerce Clause, Article I, Section 8. This contention was not passed upon by the District Court. The unions claim that the Secretary\u2019s authority to investigate is dependent upon Section 201 of the Act, and, therefore, such Section is subject to challenge in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">The unions concede (Brief p. 19) that Congress has the power to regulate collective bargaining activities affecting interstate commerce. N. L. R. B. v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U.S. 1, 57 S.Ct. 615, 81 L.Ed. 893. They admit (Brief p. 22) that the Section would be constitutionally supportable if the reporting requirements were limited to the filing of collective bargaining agreements, reporting strike vote procedures, hiring hall practices and the like. They insist, however, that the Section contains general reporting provisions and is an attempt by Congress, using its conceded power, to legislate with respect to all of the internal affairs of the unions, which are purely local in character. They argue that if this legislation is sustained it will obliterate any meaningful distinction between federal and state authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-9\">The trouble with this contention is that the collective bargaining procedures and the like, which admittedly may be regulated, are not the only union activities which substantially affect interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">Congress has made detailed findings, based on extensive investigations, which were adopted as part 'of the Act (29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 401). These findings, in substance, were \u201cthat the relations between employers and labor organizations and the millions of workers they represent have a substantial impact on the commerce of the Nation\u201d; that the Federal Government has a responsibility to protect the rights of the employees; that in order to accomplish the free flow of commerce, it is necessary that labor organizations, employers and their officials maintain the highest standards of responsibility and ethical conduct in the handling of their affairs particularly as they affect labor-management relations. Congress found from its recent investigations that these high standards had not been maintained but were breached and disregarded; that it was necessary to pass the Act to eliminate or prevent improper practices which defeated the policy of the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947, as amended, and burdened and obstructed commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-12\">These findings of Congress are binding on the courts. As recently stated by the Supreme Court in Communist Party of United States of America v. Subversive Activities Control Board, 367 U.S. 1, 81 S.Ct. 1357, 1409, 6 L.Ed.2d 625:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQQ\">\u201cIt is not for the courts to reexamine the validity of these legislative findings and reject them. See Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580, 590, 72 S.Ct. 512, 96 L.Ed. 586. They are the product of extensive investigation by Committees of Congress over more than a decade and a half. Cf. Nebbia v. People of State of New York, 291 U.S. 502, 516, 530, 54 S.Ct. 505, 507, 513, 78 L.Ed. 940. We certainly cannot dismiss them as unfounded or irrational imaginings. See Galvan v. Press, 347 U.S. 522, 529, 74 S.Ct. 737, 741, 98 L.Ed. 911; American Communications Ass\u2019n, C. I. O. v.

United States v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>Darby, 312 U.S. 100, 61 S.Ct. 451, 85 L.Ed. 609; Wickard v.
