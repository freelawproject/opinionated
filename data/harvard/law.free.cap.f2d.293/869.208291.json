The District Court, after a trial without a jury, held that appellants were barred because they had failed to file written proof of loss within sixty days as required by the policy. Judgment was entered for defendant-appellee, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-22\">We are constrained to affirm. The requirement of filing formal proof of loss within sixty days is printed in bold face type in the policy, and the evidence is conclusive that the policy itself had been in the possession of appellants. It is true that appellants submitted an informal proof of loss. But this does not of itself bring about a waiver of the requirement for substantial compliance with the proof of loss provision in the policy. Glenco Corp. v. American Equitable Assurance Co., 1961, 110 U.S.App.D.C. 158, 289 F.2d 899. Here the adjuster knew of the occurrence of the fire,, and reported it to the appellee. But the trial court concluded that the evidence did not show \u201cany fraud, duress, or over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>reaching of any sort on the part of the adjuster. Further, the Court finds there was no expression of any willingness on the part of defendant to proceed with the question of liability without securing written proof of loss or any representation or statement to the insured which might lead them to assume that the requirement might be dispensed with, or to make them delay compliance, nor were there any other statements or acts by the adjuster which could reasonably be construed to constitute a waiver of the requirement to file written proof of loss within the 60 days.\u201d These conclusions appear amply supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">Under the circumstances, we do not reach the other contentions of the parties. The judgment of the District Court will be</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">Afiirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
