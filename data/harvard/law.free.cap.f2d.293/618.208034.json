MOORE, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b667-17\">Plaintiff, a native-born citizen of the United States, brought this action against the Attorney General<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ***as successor to the Alien Property Custodian <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to recover the sum of $41,864.62 which had been vested in 1948 by the Custodian pursuant to Vesting Order No. 10,858. The property vested was a portion of plaintiff\u2019s interest in a trust created by the Will of his father; the reason alleged for the vesting was that plaintiff had acted or purported to act \u201cdirectly or indirectly for the benefit or on behalf of the aforesaid nationals of a designated enemy country (Germany) and, to the extent that he has so acted, is a national of a designated enemy country (Germany).\u201d The trial court found that plaintiff at all times here involved resided in the United States, was a loyal citizen of the United States, that he had never made available or offered to make available any part of his interest in his father\u2019s estate to any enemy country, that he had not acted for the benefit of nationals of any enemy country and that he was not an enemy within the meaning of the Trading with the Enemy Act, as amended. Accordingly, judgment was awarded in plaintiff\u2019s favor for the amount demanded. The Custodian appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-18\">The primary point advanced by the Custodian for reversal is that \u201cThe Plaintiff is an \u2018Enemy\u2019 as a Result of his \u2018Enemy Taint.\u2019 \u201d He claims that the \u201cenemy taint\u201d concept was formulated by the United States Supreme Court in Clark v. Uebersee Finanz-Korporation, 1947, 332 U.S. 480, 68 S.Ct. 174, 92 L.Ed. 88 and that such taint disqualifies plaintiff from obtaining any recovery in an action brought pursuant to Section 9(a) of the Trading with the Enemy Act, as amended (42 Stat. 1511; 50 U.S.C.A. Appendix, \u00a7 9(a) ). To establish this \u201cenemy taint\u201d the Custodian relies upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>a previous (1947) decision of this court in a Section 9(a) suit brought by Johanna M. Kind [plaintiff\u2019s mother] and Hermann H. Kind [plaintiff] as Trustees under the last will and testament of Hermann Kind [plaintiff\u2019s father], deceased v. Clark, Attorney General, 2 Cir., 1947, 161 F.2d 36, certiorari denied 1947, 332 U.S. 808, 68 S.Ct. 107, 92 L.Ed. 385. To determine the merits, if any, of the Custodian\u2019s claim, analysis must be made of the issues and facts then before the court in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s father, a United States citizen, died in 1928 leaving his estate in trust, the income to his widow for life, the remainder to this three children, two daughters and plaintiff. During World War II the widow and plaintiff served as trustees. An asset of the estate was an indebtedness from a German firm named J. A. Henckels, of $130,000. This debt was secured by stock of a New York corporation, Graef &amp; Schmidt, Inc. and a Canadian corporation, J. A. Henckels, Ltd. In 1939-1940 an arrangement was made whereby the Kind estate took over the New York and Canadian corporations\u2019 stock in satisfaction of the indebtedness. There was proof that there was an understanding between Hermann H. Kind and the German firm that after the estate had satisfied its $130,000 claim, any surplus would be returned to the German firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">In 1943 the Custodian seized all the stock of the New York corporation which then stood in the name of the estate. After the war, the trustees of the estate brought a Section 9(a) suit for the return of the stock or an adjudication of a security interest therein. The district court directed the revesting of title in the trustees. Upon appeal this court held that \u201cthe transfer of the stock was fictitious, its beneficial ownership remained in the Germans and was therefore subject to seizure by the United States,\u201d but that \u201csince we hold that the sale never occurred, it follows that the estate retained its claim for $75,000 against Graef &amp; Schmidt, and may therefore keep, as in reduction of that claim, the \u2018dividends\u2019 it received\u201d; and that the \u201cestate also retained its pledgee\u2019s lien on the stock, and is therefore now entitled to assert that lien for the unpaid balance of its claim.\u201d The court also refused to hold that \u201cthe estate, as such, is to be regarded as a wrongdoer.\u201d The net result of the court\u2019s decision was to leave the stock vested in the Custodian but subject to the existing lien in favor of the estate thus preserving for the Custodian such surplus interest, if any, as would remain after satisfaction of the estate\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">Upon the trial of the present case, the Custodian claimed that because plaintiff had knowledge of the alleged understanding that any surplus value which the Graef &amp; Schmidt stock might have after satisfaction of the estate\u2019s claim was to be held for the German company, plaintiff thereby acquired an \u201cenemy taint\u201d; that he was an \u201cenemy\u201d within the meaning of Section 9(a) of the Act; that this was so held in Kind v. Clark and is res judicata in this action; and that therefore plaintiff is ineligible to recover his property under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">The facts developed upon the trial and the analysis of the decision in Kind v. Clark will not support these contentions. Kind v. Clark held only that the circumstances surrounding the purported transfer of the stock to the Kind estate were such as to make the transfer a nullity. No finding was made that plaintiff was an enemy or enemy tainted; nor would such a finding have been necessary. Any characterizations of plaintiff\u2019s conduct in that opinion relate only to the issues there presented, namely, the validity of the stock transfer. The conclusion of the court below that plaintiff was neither an \u201cenemy\u201d nor \u201cenemy tainted\u201d is clearly supported by the record. At most, plaintiff\u2019s participation in the transfer\u2014 fully consummated prior to this country\u2019s entry into World War II \u2014 made available to a German firm only a possible surplus after the estate\u2019s debt was satisfied and this amount was not to be turned over until after the war. The property seized was not related to this surplus, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>rather was plaintiff\u2019s portion of the proceeds of a debt which arose many years before the war broke out in Europe. At no time did plaintiff attempt to make this or any of his other assets available to the Germans. There is nothing in the record to indicate disloyal motives on his part or that plaintiff was at any time \u201cenemy tainted\u201d \u2014 in fact, plaintiff\u2019s personal and professional contributions to the war effort and to civic affairs lead to the conclusion that he has always been a loyal American citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b667-11\">.
