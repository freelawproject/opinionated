Stubblefield contends that when he was delivered to state authorities at the time of his mandatory release from the United States Penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas, the United States lost jurisdiction over him.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-25\">On similar facts we held in Welch v. Taylor, 10 Cir., 292 F.2d 481, that, under Title 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4164, a prisoner who was confined by state authorities was still subject to the conditions of his release, and that the United States Board of Parole had authority to revoke his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>release and require the service of the full term <em>of his sentence </em>for a violation of its conditions which occurred after he was discharged by state authorities. There is no merit to the petitioner\u2019s contention that the United States lost jurisdiction over him when he was delivered to state authorities in response to a detainer. Myers v. Hunter, 10 Cir., 199 F.2d 662; Gould v. Sanford, 5 Cir., 167 F.2d 877.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
