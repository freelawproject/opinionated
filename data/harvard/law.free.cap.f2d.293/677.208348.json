Wiltshire\u2019s application, Ser. No. 362,898, filed June 19, 1953, is entitled \u201cPressure Vessel and Method of Making the Same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Horace S. Daley and Lawrence J. Talarico (hereinafter called \u201cDaley\u201d for short), appellants here, are the senior party by virtue of their application Ser. No. 324,344, filed December 5, 1952, entitled \u201cSpherical Container for Fluid Medium Under Pressure With Winding and Method of Applying the Winding.\u201d It is assigned to Specialties Development Corporation, a subsidiary of Walter Kidde &amp; Co., Inc. (hereinafter referred to as Kidde), the employer of Daley and Talarico.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">The single count is directed to a reinforced spherical pressure vessel for storing fluid such as compressed air, under high pressure (3,000 p. s. i. working pressure). Generally speaking it may be used as an accumulator or merely as a storage vessel, and more particularly the record shows that the parties developed their respective vessels for holding compressed air which feeds the combustion chamber in a jet engine starter system for military aircraft. Although the specific devices of the parties are in some ways dissimilar, broadly they have certain elements in common which form the basis for the count.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">Each vessel has an air-tight, spherical inner shell reinforced by windings to increase both the strength-to-weight ratio and the resistance to shattering upon impact of a bullet or the like. More specifically, the windings follow a particular pattern which contributes particularly to shatter-proofness. Each vessel has the usual fitting for connection to a conduit and each party begins a portion of the winding process by placing great circle windings <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> adjacent and tangential to the fitting which, for convenience, is called a \u201cpole\u201d and is said to be on the \u201caxis\u201d of the sphere. As the winding process continues, the great circle courses move away from the poles and gradually approach the so-called \u201cequator\u201d of the sphere.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">The count reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-10\"><em>\u201cA </em>vessel for storing fluids under high pressure, said vessel comprising an inner spherical shell, a fitting secured to said inner shell forming a port for entry and discharge of fluid, said vessel including an outer shell formed of .a substantially continuous strand of flexible material wound about the inner shell in a plurality of layers of windings, each winding at least inboard of the fitting substantially following a great circle path and the innermost winding extending from a zone adjacent said fitting to a zone diametrically opposite said fitting and succeeding windings having progressively lesser extent between said zones.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-11\">\u201cInboard of the fitting\u201d means inward of the flange of the fitting, in a direction toward the equator and away from the poles. It is apparently a negative limitation, when used with \u201cat least,\u201d to exclude those strictly non-great-circle windings which Wiltshire uses to hold his fitting in place and prevent it from blowing out when the vessel is charged. \u201cLesser extent\u201d means that the plane in which a great circle winding lies makes a larger angle with the axis passing through the poles and as this angle increases the windings lie in a zone which is bounded by a lesser axial distance from the equator. In other words, if the sphere were the earth, the \u201cinnermost\u201d layers of windings would be parallel to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>the meridians, passing adjacent to the north and south poles and covering the entire globe. The intermediate layers of great circle windings would not cover the frigid zones and, finally, the out-most layers would cover only the equatorial and torrid zones.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">A brief consideration of the machines for winding the pressure vessels of the parties will make the pattern more apparent. The Wiltshire pressure vessel, as disclosed in his application, has a rubber inner shell much like the ordinary bladder of a basket ball or the like, and a valve. A temporary, low melting point metal alloy, spherical core, which later is melted and poured out, supports the rubber inner shell while it is being wound and the winding begins by rotating the sphere about an axis passing through the fitting. Simultaneously, a traverse arm oscillates from one pole to the other, feeding and guiding strands of glass fibers which have previously been saturated with a polymerizable resin in its liquid phase. The time for one oscillation of the traverse arm is just slightly less than the time during which the sphere makes one complete revolution. The length of the traverse arm stroke determines the extent on either side of the equator that the sphere is covered by windings and, by gradually decreasing the stroke of the arm as layers of winding are being wound, the extent of the surface covered by the windings being applied is gradually decreased. A covering about % inch thick has many great circle windings each lying in a different plane. Since each successive individual winding or convolution overlies the next prior winding, as the winding progresses a visible ridge is formed on the surface of the sphere which spirals from each pole toward the equator due to the progressive shifting of the winding positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">Daley\u2019s pressure vessel is a relatively heavy-walled welded steel sphere upon which piano wire has been wound. In Daley\u2019s winding machine, the sphere is supported along an axis which passes through a fitting, and a feeding arm or flyer rotates around the sphere, wrapping strands of piano wire in great circles. The winding process begins with turns passing adjacent the fitting. By slowly rotating the sphere around an axis passing through the fitting, a layer of individual windings or convolutions surrounds the exterior of the spherical metallic shell. Then, as winding progresses, the polar axis is gradually tilted with respect to the plane in which the feeding arm rotates, so that the great circle windings gradually approach the equator. As in Wiltshire\u2019s sphere, a spiraling ridge running from adjacent each pole toward the equator necessarily results from the winding process. Except for this ridge, the exterior appearances of the spheres of the parties are quite different because Wiltshire\u2019s resin-impregnated glass fibers form, after curing of the resin, a solid shell of windings whereas in Daley the wire, being stronger and heavier than the Wiltshire glass fibers, is not wound as densely and, as the wires do not become consolidated, the exterior \u201cshell\u201d resembles netting or a sort of thick wire mesh structure having substantial voids between the individual wire strands.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">The complexity of this interference is indicated by the size of the printed record which has 984 printed pages, in addition to which there are hundreds of exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">We shall first dispose of the right to make issue. The language of the count was patterned after Wiltshire\u2019s claim 19 and was suggested to both parties by the examiner. Both parties made it. During the motion period both parties attempted to change the count or add additional counts and each party moved to dismiss on the ground that the other could not make the count. Only Wilt-shire\u2019s motion to dismiss on the ground that Daley could not make was decided at final hearing, the board granting that motion. The other motions, involving points not ancillary to priority, were not entitled to review at final hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">The examiner, of course, was of the opinion that Daley could make the count or the case would not be here. On the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>motion to dissolve, appellee\u2019s argument was, inter alia, that the count limitation to \u201can outer shell\u201d finds no support in the Daley disclosure of a wire winding. There were four other arguments but this was the only one the board accepted. In doing so the board recognized that the total limitation as expressed in the count is \u201can outer shell formed of a substantially continuous strand of flexible material wound about the inner shell.\u201d It refused, however, to read this as being satisfied by the winding alone and held that the term \u201cshell\u201d required something to hold the winding in place, such as \u201cbonding, soldering, welding, stapling etc.\u201d though not requiring resin bonding as disclosed by Wiltshire. The board\u2019s view was that there was no \u201cshell\u201d unless there was a \u201cwall capable of standing by itself and capable of being cut in sections identifiable as sections of a shell.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">In view of the well settled rule that a count is to be construed as broadly as is reasonably possible, a rule recognized by the board but, we think, not applied by it, we are of the opinion that such a restrictive meaning cannot be given to the word \u201cshell.\u201d The count calls for a shell \u201cformed of a substantially continuous strand of flexible material wound about the inner shell,\u201d and those are the identical words used by Wiltshire in his claim 19 where the count originated. Even if we construe them in the light of the Wiltshire application, as the board felt it must but which we think is unnecessary for want of any ambiguity, they do not require a wall which will either stand by itself or which can be cut in pieces identifiable as sections of a shell. The count makes no reference to either of such concepts. We believe the board has read into the count something which is not there. A shell <em>formed of a strand of flexible material </em>is not necessarily capable of standing by itself or of being divided into discrete sections, and a shell so made is all the count calls for. We regard the above italicized clause as a modification of the term \u201cshell\u201d which has a bearing on what is meant by the term, which meaning is not necessarily that usually accorded to it. Wiltshire\u2019s \u201cshell\u201d as defined is made only of windings and we see no reason why Daley\u2019s outer covering \u201cwound about his inner shell\u201d is not equally entitled to be called an \u201couter shell.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">The board\u2019s holding that Daley cannot make the count must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">There remains for consideration the other ground of the board\u2019s award of \u201cpriority\u201d to Wiltshire, derivation of the invention from him by Daley. To keep the matter in proper perspective, this is not a question of \u201cpriority\u201d except in the loose sense of that term as customarily employed in interference proceedings. The issue is more accurately described as the question of originality. Did Daley originate the invention of the count or did he derive it from Wiltshire through acquisition of knowledge of what Wiltshire had done as the board held he did?</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\"> As indicated by the reference above to the size of the record, much has been said on the subject. In essence the finding of derivation is a decision by the board on questions of fact, what had Wiltshire done, what did he have, and what did Daley find out about it before the date on which he is entitled to rely. Our approach to this issue must, therefore, be on the basis of the law as typically stated in Beall v. Ormsby, 154 F.2d 663, 667, 33 CCPA 959, 966, another originality case, wherein it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-9\">\u201cIt is elemental, of course, that this court will not reverse the findings of fact made by the Board of Interference Examiners unless convinced that such findings are manifestly wrong.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">It is appellants\u2019 burden to convince us. Notwithstanding the broad and emphatic assertion of appellants\u2019 counsel that <em>\u201cThere is no evidence in the case to support this holding and there is positive evidence to the contrary,\u201d </em>we are not so convinced. The board found considerable evidence to support its decision and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>devoted, in two opinions, a total of 25 pages to discussing it. While it is not to be expected that any discussion of this length could be produced without a flaw, it is scarcely so unsound as to justify appellants\u2019 criticism that the board\u2019s opinion reflects an \u201cabberation,\u201d is \"shocking\u201d and \u201cincredible.\u201d We cannot condemn the board\u2019s conclusions as to ultimate facts as manifestly wrong on the basis of a few statements about its own thought processes in reacting to the evidence, which appellants have selected for criticism. It would be strange, indeed, if no inconsistencies or minor errors could be found in 25 pages of discussion of a complicated record. The question, however, is whether the record as a whole supports the board\u2019s conclusion, so that it is not manifestly wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">We have carefully considered the board\u2019s opinions, the arguments and briefs of the parties, and the evidence. We see no useful purpose to be served by here reviewing in too great detail the entire matter. We shall review enough of the salient facts in the story to show that the board\u2019s conclusion is supported by evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">In the spring of 1951, Eclipse-Pioneer Division of Bendix Aviation Corporation (hereinafter called Bendix) approached Apex to develop a light-weight, glass-fiber, pressure vessel which was needed as a part for their jet engine starter project. The head of the Research and Engineering Department of Apex assigned the problem to Wiltshire who had been working with molded fiber glass and resin tubs for washing machines. By June of 1951 Wiltshire had definite thoughts as to how the pressure vessel should be made. It would have to have an \u201cinner thin shell of aluminum to seal against air leakage through the fiber glass laminate\u201d and the \u201cshell will be in the form of winding the continuous glass rovings\u201d which will \u201csupply the strength against bursting.\u201d Certain government specifications regarding bursting pressures, working pressures and resistance to shattering were contemplated, as was the problem of constructing a winding machine and completion of the vessels for September delivery. Wiltshire, however, easily completed a small-scale, hand-operated device with which he wound string upon a wooden croquet ball by rotating the sphere while feeding the string by hand along the axis of rotation. Going on from the small, crude, hand-operated device, Wiltshire next built the so-called %-size machine. It was much more refined and, instead of feeding the string to be wound by hand, it used an oscillating winding arm whose motion was automatically controlled by a barrel cam,- the latter causing the winding arm to oscillate from pole to pole in step with rotation of the sphere. The %-size machine also varied the length of the traverse stroke automatically by means of a cam, the shape of which had been determined by experimenting with the earlier machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">About the time the %-size machine was being developed, Mr. Scott, an Apex salesman who was dealing with Bendix, offered to deliver the fiber glass wound spheres to Bendix provided they would not have to guarantee that the rigid specifications would be met, as Apex was not equipped to perform all the necessary tests. Bendix ordered six tanks. Wilt-shire designed and built the full-size winding machine, with which he wound some sixteen spherical pressure vessels on metal liners. Those metal-lined spheres, designated M-l through M-16, were wound during the period November 1, 1951 to February 20, 1952. While they varied somewhat as to the type of resin impregnation and the method of curing, all the original sixteen spheres were wound in substantially the same manner. Numerous working and bursting pressure tests, as well as other destructive tests, as, for example, those to determine the glass content, were performed either at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, at the Case Institute of Technology in Cleveland, or at Teterboro, New Jersey, by Bendix. In February, 1952, Dr. Nara of the Case Institute pressure tested tank No. 13 until it burst <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>at 6,800 p. s. i. and cycle tested tank No. 14 by initially loading it to 5,000 p. s. i. and then recharging it twenty-five times at 3,000 p. s. i. Tank No. 14 was \u201co. k.\u201d after this testing and was shipped to Teterboro on February 15, 1952. A Bendix report dated March 19, 1952, indicates that \u201ctank (c),\u201d later shown to be tank M-14 which was tested by Dr. Nara, \u201cPassed the proof pressure test but failed after approximately 30 cycles during cycling tests.\u201d It was this vessel, M-14, which Bendix had at a meeting with Daley on March 24, 1952, whereat disclosure to Daley is alleged to have been made. The requirement of gunfire resistance remained and we will now review the evidence directed to the gunfire test.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">One of the original sixteen spherical vessels, M-3, was subjected to a gunfire test at the Wright Air Development Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, and the results of those tests were recorded by several parties independently. An Air Force \u201cMemorandum Report,\u201d entitled \u201cInformal Gunfire Test of Apex Fiberglass Storage Tank\u201d and dated 8 February 1952, is of record. It says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-5\">\u201cB. <em>Factual Data:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-6\">* # <em>* * \u00ab *</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-7\">\u201c8. On 21 November 1951 a fiberglass wound storage tank supplied by Apex Electric Manufacturing Company was filled with aompressed air at 3000 psi. A 50 caliber armor piercing bullet was then tumbled into it. The bullet entered at 90\u00b0 and left at 45\u00b0 from the vertical axis of the sphere. (See Exhibits A and B). The entry was a slit approximately 1%, inches long and <em>% </em>inch wide. The exit was elliptical with the axis being approximately 2 inches by <em>2y% </em>inches. There was no evidence of fragmentation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-8\">\u201cC. <em>Conclusions:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-9\"><em>\u201c4. </em>None, data merely submitted. \u201cD. <em>Recommendations:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-10\">\u201c5. A complete gunfire test should be run on this type of high pressure storage vessel since it has wide applications in aircraft.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-12\">Several photographs of the vessel accompany the report. Wiltshire was also in Dayton for the gunfire test and an unsigned report, dated November 24, 1951, which Wiltshire testified he had written, after briefly setting forth the testing procedure, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-13\">\u201cThe Tank took the shot with no tearing of any kind. The Tank weighed 16# <em>1% </em>oz. before test and the same after the test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-14\">\u201cAll persons concerned stated that they had never seen a Tank that did not tear when fired as above.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-15\">An Apex \u201cProgress Report,\u201d dated November, 1951, is directed to the various tests that had been performed on the four tanks that had been made as of that date and as respects resistance to gunfire says, \u201cThe gun fire test on one tank shows that no tearing or shattering takes place.\u201d Additional photographs of the vessel are of record. Furthermore, after the gunfire tests, M-3 was cut up for inspection and the parts of it are Wilt-shire\u2019s physical Exhibits A \u2014 1, A-2 and A-3. Wiltshire also testified that gunfire tests at Wright Field were set up by Bendix personnel. One of the Bendix personnel present at the gunfire test was C. D. Flanigen, a senior project engineer, who was the person who \u201cpulled the trigger on the gun\u201d and was also one of the Bendix personnel at the March 24, 1952 meeting which Daley attended.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-16\">During February of 1952, Bendix specifications were changed, including a requirement that the tanks withstand 10,000 cycles of pressurization, a requirement which Apex\u2019s metal-lined vessels apparently could not meet, as evidenced by Dr. Nara\u2019s cycle testing of M-14. Apex, therefore, decided to develop a rubber inner liner which would be wound with glass fibers. However, Bendix had to meet delivery schedules for the starters and since they had previously used Kidde pressure vessels, either Wire-wound cylinders or spheres which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>were not wire wound, in development testing of the entire air system, Bendix requested Kidde to supply' the needed vessels.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">On March 24, 1952, at Teterboro, four engineers from Bendix met with Horace Daley and John Stock of Kidde. Stock was a \u201ccontract engineer\u201d but not an engineer by education. It is his report which has been a principal but not the only source of information as to what was disclosed at that meeting. This report is entitled \u201cEclipse Pioneer Fiber Glass Containers Engine Starter Project.\u201d It says that he was following up on work originally started by Mr. Hall in supplying 875 cu. inch spheres which were solid-walled, non-wire wound spheres and it pointed out that \u201cEclipse is working with our steel bottles as well as with fiber glass bottles from another source * * *.\u201d It also says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-6\">\u201cThe meeting was generally devoted to exchange back and forth of experience on fiber glass and steel containers * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-7\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-8\">\u201cI don\u2019t know whether this is news or not however, Eclipse fiber glass bottles are being made by an outfit in Cleveland by name of Apex who they said got into the fiber glass business through using it for washing machine tubs, etc. Eclipse are apparently doing the designing and Apex only the manufacturing. Another note of interest is that Eclipse stated that the fiber glass bottles that they had obtained to date did not stand up under cyclings \u2014 the inner steel shell ruptured. <em>They showed us one as we were leaving, which I believe was one of the ones that had failed on cycling (although, it looked perfectly okay on the outside) </em>and if I remember correctly it had failed after 39 cycles. By contrast, they had cycled one of our steel bottles for 2,000 cycles satisfactorily.\u201d [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">When Stock was called as a witness for Daley he could not remember the details of the meeting. When asked \u201cDid it have a metal liner?\u201d he answered, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d When his attention was called to the statement in his report that \u201cthe inner steel shell ruptured\u201d he responded, \u201cI made notes of the conversation * * * and * * * one of the Eclipse people present must have stated those words exactly and I recorded them.\u201d He also answered \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d to the two questions \u201cWhat did Bendix tell you about fiber glass containers?\u201d and \u201cDid they tell you anything about how they were constructed?\u201d On the other hand, he testified that the sphere which they were shown at the meeting looked \u201clike an over-sized golf ball without a cover on it\u201d but he couldn\u2019t recall, at the time he testified, how the windings appeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-11\">Daley testified that the \u201csum total\u201d of the \u201cexchange back and forth of experience on fiber glass\u201d was a \u201cdiscussion * * * on the subject of fiber glass * * * test results and to the effect that the testing on fiber glass was quite unsatisfactory to that date and that basically their problem was in the endurance life of the containers which was completely inadequate.\u201d He remembered being shown a container as stated in the Stock report and he testified that he recalled it as being the \u201cequivalent of our 875 cubic inch steel sphere.\u201d He also testified that he \u201cunderstood\u201d it had a \u201cmetal liner of some sort that had caused failures\u201d but that he couldn\u2019t see the liner because \u201cYou could only see the outside.\u201d He didn\u2019t remember \u201chow closely we were actually to the sphere\u201d and he didn\u2019t believe that \u201cat a distance\u201d you could tell whether it had been molded or wound but he said, \u201cI must say in all fairness that I knew from being somewhat conversant with the subject that winding had been used in order to obtain any reasonable strength properties in fiber glass.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-12\">Of the four Bendix engineers who were present William J. Deitz, Jr., and C. D. Flanigen testified. They were called as rebuttal witnesses for Wiltshire. Deitz was assigned by Bendix to work on combustion starters at the plant at Teter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>boro during 1951 and 1952. He testified as to the contents of numerous Bendix progress reports which related to the starter project generally, including summary data on pressure vessels. These reports were written prior to the March 24th meeting, during the regular course of business at Bendix and copies were received by him. He was also somewhat acquainted with Kidde\u2019s spheres which Bendix had used. He was questioned specifically about discussion at the meeting but he couldn\u2019t recall the specific meeting as he had attended several with Kidde representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">i Mr. C. D. Flanigen, a senior project engineer for Bendix during 1951 and 1952, was also present at the meeting and testified that the meeting with Kidde was to obtain air tanks that were necessary to meet their $20,000,000 starter project. Kidde had been contacted since they apparently were in a position to supply heavier, 29 to 34 pound, pressure tanks. He testified that prior to the meeting, Kidde had been told that fifty bottles were needed for early delivery but made it clear that Bendix preferred an 18-pound vessel, presumably Apex\u2019s, that still had a lot of bugs in it, and that therefore Kidde would probably only be needed to supply the 50 vessels and no more. These are the reasons why Bendix showed Kidde the Apex vessel at the March 24th meeting which Flanigen summarized when he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-5\">\u201c * * * we made no bones about showing the fiber glass bottles to Kidde so they could judge for themselves as to how rough it would be for them to beat the competition in the long range future.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Referring to what Daley and Talarico did right after the March meeting, the board said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-7\">\u201c * * * there is no convincing proof that they did anything about reinforcing with a winding a spherical vessel, until immediately after said meeting of March 24, 1952. Then, they became extremely active. According to Daley\u2019s testimony before the <em>end of March </em>of 1952 they had \u2018a jury rig type of machine for winding spheres\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">We think the foregoing and other evidence adequately support the board\u2019s conclusion as to the originality issue against the charge that it is manifestly wrong. The board stated its final conclusions as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-10\"><em>\u201cIt </em>appears to us, that the positive as well as the circumstantial evidence make a prima facie case that, interpreting the term \u2018outer shell\u2019 to be satisfied by the Daley <em>et al. </em>winding, Wiltshire was the original and first inventor of the subject matter of the count and that Daley <em>et al. </em>derived it from him. The burden, then, was upon the senior party Daley <em>et al. </em>to proceed with the evidence to rebut this prima facie case made by the junior party. * * [citing authority]. The senior party has failed to rebut it. Daley <em>et al. </em>have not shown that they were in possession of the invention before the Wiltshire container was disclosed to them. In fact the date claimed by them for conception, both in their preliminary statement and in their brief is more than a month after the date of said meeting. * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-11\">* * * * # <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-12\">\u201c * * * <em>we </em>believe that Wilt-shire is entitled to prevail on this prima facie case of derivation of the invention by the senior party from him, and all other issues raised by the parties become moot.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-13\">The decision of the board awarding priority to Wiltshire is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-15\">KIRKPATRICK, District Judge, did not participate in decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b726-12\">. This merely means that the winding lies in a plane which passes through the geometrical center of the sphere.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
