A cogent explanation of the relevant circumstances is contained in the opinion of the defendants in State v. Torzillo, 1960, 61 N.J.Super. 253, 160 A.2d 511, and in that of Judge Meaney in the court below in the instant case. We can perceive no valid basis for Torzillo\u2019s complaint that his civil rights have been violated in breach of R.S.1979, Section 1 of the Civil Rights Act of April 20, 1871, 17 Stat. 13, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983, or that he was denied any right guaranteed to him by the Fourteenth Amendment. Accordingly the judgment will be affirmed, D.C., 190 F.Supp. 504.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
