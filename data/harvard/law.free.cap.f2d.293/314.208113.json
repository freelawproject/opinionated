He also asks for the appointment of counsel to represent him.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-19\">The appeal is from an order, which made denial on its face of a motion by appellant for vacation of his sentence, under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-20\">Appellant had waived indictment under Rule 7(b) of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C.A., and had pleaded guilty to an information charging him, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2114, with having robbed a clerk, in charge of a Post Office Contract Station, of $180.87 in funds belonging to the United States, of which such clerk had lawful charge, custody and control, and having in effecting the robbery put the clerk\u2019s life in jeopardy by the use of a loaded automatic pistol. The court had imposed the mandatory 25-year term required by \u00a7 2114 for this aggravated degree of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-21\">The basis of appellant\u2019s motion under \u00a7 2255 was that, on the facts stated by the Government at the time of the sentencing, the robbery involved was not able to constitute an offense under \u00a7 2114 of the Criminal Code. The Assistant \u2018United States Attorney, in his comments to the court, had remarked that the robbery occurred at 5:45 p. m. The agreement between the Government and the robbery victim, covering the location of the contract station in the latter\u2019s drug store, required the victim to \u201cconduct postal matters\u201d only between the hours of 10:00 a. m. and 5:00 p. m. Hence, appellant argues, at the time of the robbery, the victim \u201cwas conducting busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>ness other than postal matters,\u201d and the robbery and putting of his life in jeopardy therefore did not occur in his status of a postal employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Section 2114 does not make the robbery a matter of commission against persons of particular title, position, or duties, but of commission against \u201cany person having lawful charge, control, or custody of any mail matter or of any money or other property of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Any characterization in an indictment or information of the victim\u2019s title, position, or duties beyond the responsibility set out in \u00a7 2114 is surplus-age and of no consequence. Banks v. United States, 7 Cir., 239 F.2d 409, 410; Jones v. United States, 7 Cir., 72 F.2d 873, 874; Martin v. United States, 10 Cir., 241 F.2d 693, 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Under the terms \u201ccharge, control, or custody\u201d in \u00a7 2114, the robbery offense is subject to being committed by a taking from the victim\u2019s physical or manual possession, or by a taking from his presence when the mail matter, money or other property of the Government is subject to his control. Randazzo v. United States, 8 Cir., 300 F. 794, 797.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Here, the postal money taken was within the victim\u2019s presence and was subject to his control, at the time appellant entered the store for the purpose of committing the robbery. As a matter of fact, from the record of the sentencing proceedings, the money was in fact taken from the victim\u2019s manual possession, since he was required at gun\u2019s point to produce it and turn it over. In either event, however, it would constitute a robbery committed against him, as one having lawful charge, custody and control of the postal funds involved; and this would be true no matter in what task he may have been engaged at the time appellant entered the store \u2014 whether selling stamps or drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">It should perhaps be added that, while we have engaged in pointing out that appellant\u2019s contention is utterly without any possibility of substance, the question which he has sought to raise is one which could properly have been refused any examination at all in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding. One who has pleaded guilty to a criminal charge cannot ordinarily challenge the allegations of fact contained <em>in the </em>charge as an attack upon the Judgment through a \u00a7 2255 proceeding. Cf. Hood v. United States, 8 Cir., 152 F.2d 431, 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">To clear the records of the appeal pending from the filing of notice of appeal, the case will be permitted to be docketed without payment of fee and it will thereupon be dismissed as frivolous. The .request for appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
