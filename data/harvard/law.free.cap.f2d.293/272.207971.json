The appellant was charged in a 3-count indictment with violations of the federal statutes relating to narcotic drugs. Upon a plea of guilty, he was sentenced to serve consecutive sentences on two counts, although the violations of the different statutory provisions resulted from the same acts. He contends that, under these circumstances, there could be a valid sentence on only one count.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-22\">The case of Gore v. United States, 357 U.S. 386, 78 S.Ct. 1280, 2 L.Ed.2d 1405, controls the question here, and we have on two previous occasions followed the Gore decision. Smith v. United States, 10 Cir., 273 F.2d 462, certiorari denied 363 U.S. 846, 80 S.Ct. 1619, 4 L.Ed.2d 1729; Richardson v. United States, 10 Cir., 285 F.2d 751, certiorari denied 365 U.S. 854, 81 S.Ct. 821, 5 L.Ed.2d 818. See also Harris v. United States, 359 U.S. 19, 79 S.Ct. 560, 3 L.Ed.2d 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
