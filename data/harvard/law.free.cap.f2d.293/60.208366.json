BROWN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b110-13\">At the heart of this appeal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is the question whether under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1331-1343, the applicable substantive law for an injury received in connection with a fixed off-shore platform is that of Louisiana, the adjacent state, or the general maritime law. What makes an answer decisive is the problem of timeliness of the suit. For if the occurrence is governed by Louisiana law, it is conceded that a suit filed 22 months after the injury of November 6, 1956, is prescribed by the Louisiana one-year statute. LSA-C.C. Art. 3536. If it is maritime, then the equitable doctrine of laches controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-15\">The injury occurred on a fixed drilling platform owned and controlled by The Pure Oil Company. It rested permanently on vertical upright members securely affixed to the ocean floor. It was not, therefore, the floating-submersible type dealt with in Offshore Co. v. Robison, 5 Cir., 1959, 266 F.2d 769, 1959 AMC 2049. The platform was located in the Gulf of Mexico about 65 miles off the coast of Louisiana. This location was substantially seaward of Louisiana\u2019s historic extended maritime boundary recognized in the Submerged Lands Act, 43 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1301-1315. Whether measured in terms of Louisiana\u2019s claim or the boundary finally delineated in United States v. States of Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida, 1960, 363 U.S. 1, 121, at page 66, 80 S.Ct. 961, 4 L.Ed.2d 1025, 1096, this platform was in the area defined in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. As all must be judged finally by this Act, it is important at the outset to emphasize the comprehensive, unqualified, unlimited claim of Federal sovereignty asserted and accomplished by that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-16\">The Act first provides that \u201cIt is declared to be the policy of the United States that the subsoil and seabed of the outer Continental Shelf appertain to the United States and are subject to its jurisdiction, control, and power of disposition as provided in this subchapter.\u201d \u00a7 1332(a). In a sweeping way it then provides that \u201cThe Constitution and laws and civil and political jurisdiction of the United States are extended to the subsoil and seabed of the outer Continental Shelf and to all artificial islands and fixed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>structures which may be erected thereon * * * to the same extent as if the outer Continental Shelf were an area of exclusive Federal jurisdiction located within a State. * * *\u201d \u00a7 1333(a) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The decision of what law controls is therefore a problem in statutory interpretation of a congressional enactment. Guess v. Read, 5 Cir., 1961, 290 F.2d 622. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is in no sense one of those cases of undulating conflicts of state versus national power inevitable and irrepressible in our unique federalism.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">The plaintiff Snipes was not working for Pure. He was an employee of Loffland Brothers Drilling Company. By two separate but identical formal, written agreements with Pure, Loffland had undertaken to drill two wells from the platform. Loffland was described as, and was, an independent contractor. The claim of Snipes against Pure was therefore the now familiar suit against a third party. Success by Snipes depended upon establishing some independent negligence on the part of Pure. Under the contract Loffland was to supply the drilling rig and its normal incidental equipment. Pure was to supply, among other things, the derrick, the platform and \u201c * * * all necessary casing, tubing * * * valves, fittings <em>flow line connections, </em>* * * and all mud treating compound * * * also * * * fuel and water * * (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">The occurrence of this accident may be briefly described. The platform deck is about 50 feet above the water. Since the first of the two projected wells had been completed, it was necessary to skid the drilling rig from one position on the platform to another one on the same platform in order to commence drilling the second well. This was to be done by a series of blocks and jacks. Before the rig was to be skidded it was necessary to dismantle a pipe which ran from the hydraulic brake of Loffland\u2019s rig to a fresh water tank. The tank belonged to Pure and was a part of the permanent equipment of the platform. It was constructed of metal. The top of it presented a curved surface approximately 15 feet above the deck of the platform. There were no handrails or other safety life lines around the edge of the tank top, although the tank was equipped with a permanent welded ladder evidencing the likelihood that workmen would be going to and from the tank top from time to time. The water from the tank v/ent to the hydromatie brake through a \u201csuction\u201d line and was returned to the tank by the overhead line. This pipe was suspended horizontally above the platform and ran from the rig to the top of the water tank.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-15\">It was this pipe which had to be dismantled to permit skidding the rig. This was being done by Snipes and his fellow Loffland employees. Snipes went to the top of the tank in order to lift the tank end of the pipe out of the hole through which it entered the tank. After doing this and while Snipes was sliding the pipe across the tank top so that the other workers standing on the deck could lower it to the platform, the pipe, still in a horizontal plane, broke at a collar joint. When the breaking permitted one end of the pipe to drop toward the platform, the end on the tank top moved abruptly upward. As a consequence Snipes was thrown from the tank top. In falling he struck the platform deck 15 feet below. But he did not land there. Earlier that morning employees of Pure had removed some sections of the expanded metal grating next to the tank thus leaving a space about 3 feet by 20 feet. This space was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>not at the edge of the platform. Rather it left a \u201chole\u201d in the platform near the tank. After momentarily striking the platform deck, Snipes fell through the open space and dropped into the ocean 50 feet below. In the course of this fall, he hit at least two steel structure members. Despite his injuries, he was able to get to a ring life buoy thrown to him. This kept him afloat for the estimated five to fifteen minutes during which time he was drifting quickly away from the platform under a strong tidal current. He was picked up by a Pure motor launch summoned to the scene by a radio emergency May Day alarm and was shortly thereafter transferred by airplane to a hospital ashore. His injuries were severe, the hospital and medical treatment long and extended, and substantial permanent disabilities resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">In every sense of the word this happened on the high seas. It did not happen in Louisiana. Nor did it happen in waters which Louisiana could regard as within her territorial boundaries. If Louisiana law is to apply, it is because Congress has specified that this is so. Pure contends that this is the consequence of \u00a7 1333(a) (2) which \u201cTo the extent that they are applicable and not inconsistent with this sub-chapter or with other Federal laws and regulations * * * \u201d adopts as Federal law the civil and criminal law of the adjacent state for the subsoil, seabed and offshore structures. Such \u201ccivil and criminal laws of each adjacent State * * * are declared to be the law of the United States \u00ab\u25a0 -* # \u00bb<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\"> We think that a consideration of both intrinsic and extrinsic factors requires the conclusion that it was the intention of Congress that (a) this occurrence be governed by Federal, not State, law, and (b) that the Federal law thereby promulgated would be the pervasive maritime law of the United States. In connection with the latter phase \u2014 the choice by Congress of maritime law\u2014 it is again important to keep in mind that we are in an area in which Congress has an almost unlimited power to determine what standards shall comprise the Federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">On this approach we are not confronted with the question whether Congress would have the constitutional power to declare as to these offshore activities that for an essentially maritime matter a nonmaritime standard is to be followed. <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At most, we have a question whether Congress may treat an occurrence in this new geographical area as substantially maritime even though on traditional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>lines an event taking place on a structure fixed' permanently to the bed of the water might be regarded as non-maritime. For that matter, even in the development of that decisional law, the course was never fixed and there were frequent conceptual deviations. Thus, while damage by vessels to a pier was non-maritime, The Plymouth, 1866, 3 Wall. 20, 70 U.S. 20, 18 L.Ed. 125, damage to a beacon or similar structure maintained primarily as an aid to navigation, was maritime. The Blackheath, 1904, 195 U.S. 361, 25 S.Ct. 46, 49 L.Ed. 236; The Raithmoor, 1916, 241 U.S. 166, 36 S.Ct. 514, 60 L.Ed. 937. After considerable difference of opinion in the lower courts, the Supreme Court finally held in The Admiral Peoples, 1935, 295 U.S. 649, 55 S.Ct. 885, 79 L.Ed. 1633, 1935 AMC 875, that injuries received on the dock as a result of falling from a defective ship\u2019s gangway was maritime. In T. Smith &amp; Son, Inc. v. Taylor, 1928, 276 U.S. 179, 48 S.Ct. 228, 72 L.Ed. 520, 1928 AMC 447, a longshoreman standing on the wharf projecting a few feet over the water was struck by a sling load of cargo and was knocked into the water where he was some time later found dead. The Court held that occurrence was subject to the local law, not maritime. In contrast in L\u2019hote v. Crowell, 5 Cir., 1931, 54 F.2d 212, 1932 AMC 27, we held that a longshoreman working ashore who violently hit the side of the vessel while riding the ship\u2019s tackle and thereupon fell to the wharf sustained maritime injuries.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In Minnie v. Port Huron Terminal Co., 1935, 295 U.S. 647, 55 S.Ct. 884, 79 L.Ed. 1631, 1935 AMC 879, the longshoreman on the deck of the vessel was struck by a swinging hoist precipitating him to the wharf. These injuries were held to be maritime. Many of these refined distinctions are now of historic and academic interest only since Congress cut through many of them by the 1948 Act which extends admiralty and maritime jurisdiction to \u201call cases of damage or injury, to person or property, caused by a vessel on navigable water, notwithstanding that such damage or injury be done or consummated on land.\u201d 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 740. Its constitutionality has been upheld. United States v. Matson Nav. Co., 9 Cir., 1953, 201 F.2d 610, 1953 AMC 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">But whether the injuries received in the fall which caused Snipes first to strike the deck of the platform then fall through the open space after which he banged against two girders and then dropped into the ocean where further distinguishable severe damage was done<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> would, as an academic inquiry on maritime or non-maritime jurisdiction, constitute a maritime injury under the historic standard of \u201cthe substance and consummation of the occurrence which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>gave rise to the cause of action\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> is not decisive. This is so because the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act itself reveals that when it is federal, not adjacent state, law to apply, Congress adopted the maritime standards. At least two specific items evidence this. This evidential material serves a dual role: in demonstrating that (1) Congress chose the maritime law as the federal law it proves also that (2) federal, not state, law was to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">First, Congress committed to the agency traditionally charged with regulation and enforcement of maritime matters the duty and \u201cauthority to promulgate and enforce * * * regulations with respect to * * * safety equipment, and other matters relating to the promotion of safety of life and property * * * \u201d on the artificial islands, structures or waters adjacent thereto. The agency specifically named was the Coast Guard.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Contrary to the contentions of Pure, this statutory obligation and authority transcends the mere marking of the structures either as an aid to navigation or the warning of its presence as an obstruction. See also \u00a7 1338(e) (2) and (f). In accordance with the statutory mandate the Commandant of the Coast Guard has promulgated extensive regulations which reflect a view that whether manned or unmanned, fixed or submersible, these oil well drilling structures located in the midst of the high seas present substantially all of the perils of the seas<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and are therefore to be regulated as such.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> One such hazard expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>recognized is the likelihood of falling on to the deck or into the ocean.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This elaborate administrative establishment to assure reasonable safety to all persons working on such platforms without particular regard to their status as an employee, independent contractor, employee of an independent contractor, or service personnel reflects a dual congressional determination. The first is that as the hazards and risks are essentially maritime, it is appropriate that standards of safety be those imposed by the maritime law with policing and enforcement left to a traditional maritime agency. And second, it was a determination that this matter could not adequately be left to the adjacent states either in the creation of the underlying substantive standards or in their enforcement. Of course enforcement and effectuation of such congressional policy makes the question of sanctions, including that of civil tort liability, of like congressional concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\"> The second indicia found in the terms of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act itself is its express adoption of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 901 et seq., as the basis of compensation for death or disability of an employee. 43 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1333(c). This is of significance for several reasons. One has to do with general safety conditions showing again the congressional concern for a federal policy<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The other bears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>directly on the subject at hand \u2014 a suit by an injured employee against a third party. By \u00a7 933 elaborate provisions are made concerning suit by the injured person or in some situations by his employer (or insurance carrier).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Of course \u00a7 933 does not purport to define the substantive basis upon which the third person \u201cis liable in damages\u201d to the injured employee. It does not confine it to federal law, or to state law, or to maritime law, to common law or to civil law. Presumably it embraces whatever law is legally available. But \u00a7 933 certainly undertakes to secure to the injured employee whatever rights to damages might be open. The provisions of \u00a7 905 prescribing that the Longshoremen\u2019s Act is the exclusive liability of the employer<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> does not operate for the benefit of anyone else and certainly not for a third party. Ryan Stevedoring Co. v. Pan-Atlantic Steamship Corp., 1956, 350 U.S. 124, at pages 130-131, 76 S.Ct. 232, 100 L.Ed. 133, 1956 AMC 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-11\">But that is not so in Louisiana. We have called this \u201cthe unique Louisiana policy\u201d and of it have had this to say. \u201cUnlike many other compensation acts, the Louisiana statute regulates more\u2019 than the rights as between injured employee and his employer. Under some circumstances it controls the right of such injured worker against a third party not his employer. L.S.A.-R.S. 23:-1061. And as construed uniformly by the Courts this provides in substance that an employee of an independent contractor injured by the negligence of the third party for whom the independent contractor is performing the service has no right to recover damages if the work being performed was a part of the usual trade, business and occupation of such third party. His sole remedy against either his employer or such third party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>is under the Louisiana Compensation Act which itself carries the usual exclusive liability provision.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Kent et al. v. Shell Oil Company et al., 5 Cir., 1961, 286 F.2d 746, at pages 750-751.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">What is true of Louisiana could be multiplied by as many states as are contiguous to the lands of the Outer Continental Shelf. What is true of Louisiana demonstrates that the congressional purpose to assure a right of action against the third party might be thwarted or completely prevented were the substantive principles to be those of the adjacent state. Congress knew from long experience the desirability \u2014 if not the constitutional necessity \u2014 of a substantial uniformity in dealing with matters maritime. It runs counter to the whole purpose of the Act to assume that Congress meant a matter of such, importance as safety of life and limb should be left to the shifting policies of adjacent states.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The law applicable was therefore federal maritime law, not that of Lousiana. Consequently there being no Louisiana-created cause of action, the Louisiana one-year prescription period was not self-operative to bar this suit. But the question remains, is the one-year period of any importance, and if so, to what extent? Translating that inquiry into more tangible terms, it takes this form: for a maritime injury occurring within the geographical limits of Louisiana, such as, for example, the Port of New Orleans, does the local Louisiana law of limitations (prescription) bar the claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\"> That question is answered authoritatively both by general principles and by a specific recent case presenting that very problem. In Czaplicki v. SS Hoegh Silvercloud, supra, 351 U.S. 525, 76 S.Ct. 946, 100 L.Ed. 1387, 1956 AMC 1465, the plaintiff was injured in 1945 while working as a longshoreman on board the SS Hoegh Silvercloud in the Port of Hoboken, New Jersey. The suit against the third party was filed in New York long after the statute of limitations of New York, New Jersey, or both had run. The Court of Appeals had held: \u201cwhether the statute of limitation of New Jersey, * * * or the statute of limitations of New York * * *, is our guide, the time has long since passed when the [plaintiff] might have recovered against the alleged tort-feasor.\u201d 2 Cir., 223 F.2d 189, at page 191. Reversing this the Supreme Court reiterated the long accepted principle of laches. \u201cThe Court of Appeals found it unnecessary to consider whether Czaplicki could maintain this suit, because it was held barred in any event on account of laches. The only reason given for this holding was that both the New York and New Jersey statute of limitations, the two that might be applicable, had run. It is well settled, however, that laches as a defense to an admiralty suit is not to be measured by strict application of statutes of limitations; instead, the rule is that \u2018the delay which will defeat such a suit must in every case depend on the peculiar equitable circumstances of that case.\u2019 The Key City (U.S.) 14 Wall. 653, 660, 20 L.Ed. 896, [898]. In cases where suit has been brought after some lapse of time, the question is whether it would be inequitable, because of the delay, to enforce the claim. * * * \u2018Where there has been no inexcusable delay in seeking a remedy and where no prejudice to the defendant has ensued from the mere passage of time, there should be no bar to relief.\u2019 Gardner v. Panama R. Co., 342 U.S. 29, 31, 72 S.Ct. 12, 13, 96 L.Ed. 31, [36]. This does not mean, of course, that the state statutes of limitations are immaterial in determining whether laches is a bar, but it does mean that they are not conclusive, and that the determination should not be made without first considering all the circumstances bearing on the issue.\u201d 351 U.S. 525, at page 533, 76 S.Ct. 946, at page 951. See also Gardner v. Panama R. Co., 1951, 342 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>U.S. 29, at page 30, 72 S.Ct. 12, 96 L.Ed. 31, 1951 AMC 2048, and Annotation 96 L.Ed. 37. We have several times applied this doctrine to suits against third parties to recover for maritime injuries sustained within the territorial confines of a state.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Here there can b\u00e9 no basis for holding that the District Court abused its discretion in overruling the defense of laches. The injuries occurred November 6,1956, and the complaint was filed September 15, 1958. The record establishes without contradiction that this slight delay of ten months beyond the Louisiana one-year period could not have produced any prejudice to Pure. It knew all about the case. Indeed, it was Pure\u2019s motor launch which rescued Snipes and arranged for transfer to the hospital. The defense of Pure was undertaken by Travelers Insurance Company which was also the compensation insurer of Loffiand.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> This mutual Insurer arranged for and paid the physician who treated Snipes. Pure was content to rely upon his medical report including the one covering re-examination made by him for Pure\u2019s account on the eve of the trial. As to the occurrence itself the facts were really not in dispute. What Snipes was doing, how he came to fall, where he fell, and what happened to him was the subject of little controversy. Nothing in this record suggests that the able and vigorous advocate for Pure on the trial commencing March 15, 1960, would have had any further or better evidence, information or materials in the defense of an event occurring in 1956 had the suit been filed November 6, 1957, rather than September 15, 1958. \u201cLaches is much more than time. It is time plus prejudicial harm, and the harm is not merely that one loses what he otherwise would have kept, but that the delay has subjected him to a disadvantage in asserting and establishing his claimed right or defense.\u201d Point Landing, Inc. v. Alabama Drydock &amp; Shipbuilding Co., 5 Cir., 1958, 261 F.2d 861, at page 865, 1959 AMC 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Pure insists that nevertheless the judgment cannot stand because a directed verdict should have been granted on the ground that no showing was made of Pure\u2019s ownership or control of the return water line which broke. We do not regard this as decisive. There was considerable evidence of usage of those in the oil business from which the jury might infer that the \u201cflow line connection\u201d described in the contract as a piece of equipment Pure was to furnish would include this return water line. But this does not matter. Quite apart from that there was ample evidence to warrant the jury finding that the significant permanent injuries resulted from Snipes falling through the open space, against the girders, and then into the ocean. This condition admittedly was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>created by Pure\u2019s employees. There was no need for the grating to have been left off for that period of time. And it was for the jury, not the plaintiff by conclusory statements made in response to adroit cross-examination, to determine whether a prudent platform owner would have left it open. More than that, there was a serious issue about the absence of any guard rail on the tank top. The evidence showed, as the permanent ladder manifested, an expectation that men would work on the tank top from time to time. True, no specific word testimony was offered that on some other rig the tank tops generally had a rail. Evidence was received, however, that such a rail would have been easily installed at little expense. This was not a matter necessarily requiring expert testimony. The jury could have concluded that at that height, considering the curved surface and the possibility of falling onto the platform and perhaps into the sea, a prudent platform owner would have had some protective device. Of course the matter is not to be determined by what is usual and customary. That may be evidence of due care, or the lack of it, but it is not the end itself.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Quite apart from a question whether the Coast Guard regulations, note 10, supra, technically cover the tank top, it is evident from \u00a7\u00a7 143.15-1, 15-5, Title -33 C.F.R., that the Coast Guard considers that one of the principal hazards is that of falling from great heights. As a matter of everyday common sense the jury may well have thought the same here.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">We find nothing to the complaints about the Court\u2019s charge. The charge as given was full and fair and in many instances repeated verbatim the charges requested by Pure.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-13\">Nor, within our limited power of review, do we find the jury verdict unreasonable. American Automobile Ins. Co. v. Wainwright, 5 Cir., 1960, 284 F.2d 942; Whiteman v. Pitrie, 5 Cir., 1955, 220 F.2d 914; Sunray Oil Corp. v. Allbritton, 5 Cir., 1951, 188 F.2d 751. Snipes had an income of $600 per month as a roughneck. The defendant\u2019s own doctor in 1960 on the eve of the trial adhered to his earlier estimate of permanent disability, see note 6, supra, and he was positive in his assertion given in 1957 that \u201cI do not believe that this patient should return to his duties as a roughneck.\u201d Snipes\u2019 efforts to obtain employment were unfruitful. By the time of the trial he had lost for all practical purposes 3% years\u2019 income which would alone account for some $25,000 of the verdict. The medical reports received in evidence by stipulation warranted a finding of permanent disability involving more than the left elbow. Considering the loss of wages and expenses already incurred, the pain suffered past and future, the prolonged recovery and convalescence period, and the commuted value of lost future earnings, the jury\u2019s award is fully supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-14\">We find no merit in the other contentions asserted. The claim was timely filed and the evidence warranted the finding of negligence resulting in serious and permanent injuries warranting the payment of a substantial sum of money. Those matters were answered by the jury\u2019s verdict. There it ends.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b110-17\">. Snipes v.

This essential nature of the inquiry was emphasized in this case recently decided by this Court. An offshore oil rig employee was killed when a company helicopter in which he was riding crashed into the Gulf shortly after leaving the rig. In that ease, though, the questions involving the interpretation of the Outer Continental Shelf Act with which we are here concerned were not reached for two reasons. First, the Louisiana direct action statute sought to be invoked was not applicable by its own terms, and second, the death occurred literally on or over navigable waters of the High Seas within the Death on the High Seas Act, 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 761 et seq., and did not occur on the offshore structure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b112-5\">. 43 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1333(a) (2) reads in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Avd\">\u201c(2) To the extent that they are applicable and not inconsistent with this subchapter or with other Federal laws and regulations of the Secretary now in effect or hereafter adopted, the civil and criminal laws of each adjacent State as of the effective date of this subehapter are declared to be the law of the United States for that portion of the subsoil and seabed of the outer Continental Shelf, and artificial islands and fixed structures erected thereon, which would be within the area of the State if its boundaries were extended seaward to the outer margin of the outer Continental Shelf, and the President shall determine and publish in the Federal Register such projected lines extending seaward and defining each such area.

The \u201cinfecting organism was one of the paracolon group <em>* </em>* * \u201d and this the doctor concluded was from \u201ccontamination of the water about the rig platform * * * \u201d from inadequate dispersal from the platform\u2019s sanitary facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-12\">The severe permanent disabling injuries are therefore traced directly to the fall into the water.
