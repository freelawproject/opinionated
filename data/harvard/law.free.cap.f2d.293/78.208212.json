The review is sought under Section 25 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 78y(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-17\">The background of the case may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b127-18\">J. H. Lederer Co., Inc. had been registered with the Commission as a broker and dealer. Its registration was revoked on December 28, 1958, for violation of fraud provisions of the statute. Organ was a salesman employed by Lederer in 1958, a period during which Lederer was conducting a selling campaign of stock of a company named Continental Mining Exploration, Ltd. Organ &amp; Co. was organized in January, 1959, and its application for registration as a broker and dealer was received by the Commission on October 19, 1959. The Commission instituted proceedings to determine whether Organ, while employed by Lederer, had violated fraud provisions of the federal securities acts. The Commission postponed the effective date of Organ &amp; Co.\u2019s application for 15 days and directed a hearing to determine whether the effective date of registration should be further postponed pending denial proceedings. The hearing was held, but the Commission did not reach a determination on this question prior to the date on which the application became effective by lapse of time.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Commission, on January 28th, dismissed the denial proceeding on the ground that it had become moot and in the same order instituted a revocation proceeding which resulted in the revocation order under review here. The record developed in the preliminary hearing on postponement was incorporated into the record of the revocation proceeding. Petitioners make four points.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-19\">The first point is that the Commission\u2019s order is not supported by substantial evidence. Chiefly concerned in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>the consideration of this objection is the Commission\u2019s claim that certain representations made over the telephone and which were fraudulent<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> were made by Organ. There were two of these telephone conversations going to the same prospective customer. The caller identified himself as Organ. The recipient, who subsequently bought stock,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> did not know Organ but identified the caller\u2019s voice as the same on the two occasions. Although this evidence might not be enough by itself to justify a conclusion that Organ was the caller, there was considerably more. The written confirmations of the sale received by the purchaser bore the initials \u201cN. 0.\u201d which were Organ\u2019s initials and Hallen, the purchaser, cancelled one of his purchases by notice addressed to Lederer marked to the attention of Organ. Further, Hallen was given a telephone number to call in order to get in touch with the salesman who identified himself as Organ, and this telephone number was used by Organ in calling other customers., The trial examiner did not think that this was enough to identify Organ as the caller on the telephone; the Commission thought otherwise. It is the Commission\u2019s responsibility to decide the question and the fact that it differed with the examiner does not matter.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-13\">The Commission pointed out correctly that this is a non-criminal case and that Organ\u2019s failure to testify is significant. He did not deny the evidence just recited and the accepted rule is that failure to explain facts and circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>warrants the inference that his testimony would have been adverse.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">We agree with the Commission that the factors are sufficient to establish Organ as the maker of the communication.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">The second point is that the proceedings fell under the principles set out in Jencks v. United States, 1957, 353 U.S. 657, 77 S.Ct. 1007, 1 L.Ed.2d 1103.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">An investigator for the Commission interviewed Hallen and made notes for the purpose of preparing an affidavit to be signed by Hallen. He did prepare such an affidavit and destroyed the notes. Hallen did not see the notes which, it was testified, were simply to serve as cues for the preparation of the affidavits by the investigator. In the hearing Hallen was shown the affidavit to refresh his recollection. Petitioners\u2019 counsel had opportunity before Hallen testified to read the affidavit, and it was in the hands of petitioners\u2019 counsel for cross-examination of Hallen.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">There was no suggestion that these notes were destroyed with any intent to suppress evidence. See United States v. Thomas, 2 Cir., 1960, 282 F.2d 191. There was no refusal by the Government to produce a statement within the meaning of the so-called \u201cJencks\u201d statute. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500. The only statement that Hallen signed was shown to Organ\u2019s counsel as stated above. There was no violation of any right of Organ involved here.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">Third, petitioners charge that the Commission\u2019s publication of the notice of the proceedings constituted a prejudgment against them and was a denial of due process. This Court had occasion to comment on this subject in Gilligan, Will &amp; Co. v. S. E. C., 2 Cir., 267 F.2d 461, certiorari denied 1959, 361 U.S. 896, 80 S.Ct. 200, 4 L.Ed.2d 152. It was there said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-21\">\u201cApart from \u00a7 5 [of the Administrative Procedure Act] and the restrictions it may impose, the Commission\u2019s reputation for objectivity and impartiality is opened to challenge by the adoption of a procedure from which a disinterested observer may conclude that it has in some measure adjudged the facts as well as the law of a particular case in advance of hearing it. There would appear to be no such conflict between the Commission\u2019s duty to inform the public and its duty to prosecute as would necessitate the use of press releases of the kind here questioned.\u201d 267 F.2d at pages 468-469.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-22\">We reiterate that statement. It is not the business of this or any other court to write publicity notices for the Commission. But we think it should be borne in mind that when the body which is the investigator, the prosecutor and the judge starts a proceeding by saying that the order of the Commission asserts that members of its staff have reported information tending to show that Organ has violated anti-fraudulent provisions, it creates an impression which could be interpreted as tending to indicate that the Commission had already made up its mind. We do not think the Commission intended such a result; we certainly do not indicate that due process of law was denied to the petitioners. But we do not think the notice was a very good kind of notice for a government body to issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-23\"> Fourth, petitioners claim that <em>res judicata </em>operates to prevent the order under attack from being valid. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>base this, of course, on the dismissal of the denial proceedings, but those proceedings did not decide anything. They were dismissed as moot because action of the Commission was not taken until the application for registration had become effective by lapse of time under the provisions of the statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is well settled that the dismissal of a case because it is moot does not lay a basis for the application of the doctrine of <em>res judicata,.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">The petitioners in a letter submitted after argument urge that C. A. B. v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 1961, 367 U.S. 316, 81 S.Ct. 1611, 6 L.Ed.2d 869, is controlling here. We think not. In that case the Aeronautics Board allowed a certificate of convenience and necessity to become effective by lapse of time despite pending petitions for reconsideration of the award. Subsequently the Board imposed restrictions on the certificate without formal notice or hearing. The precise holding of the Supreme Court was that the statutory mandate of notice and hearing must be complied with before an existing certificate can be amended or modified. There was no discussion of or reliance upon the fact that the evidence on which the restrictions were based was before the Board when the certificate became effective by lapse of time. In the instant case after the certificate became effective by lapse of time the Commission instituted a revocation proceeding, as authorized by statute,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and conducted a hearing. The record developed in the earlier proceeding was incorporated into the record of the revocation proceeding. Petitioners had full opportunity to rebut any damaging evidence before the Commission at the revocation hearing. That they failed successfully to do so does not in any way reflect any improper action by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The decision of the Commission will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b127-14\">.
