It seems hardly possible that Congress could have considered the specific question the Kelley-Waltman cases raise.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-25\"> In the Kelley-Waltman cases on appeal from the Tax Court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> this Court must determine the meaning of the term <em>\u201ca substantial part\u201d </em>as that term is used in. Section 117 (m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 64 Stat. 934 (1950); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 117(m). This section defines a collapsible corporation as one \u201cformed or availed of * * * with a view to the sale or exchange of stock by its shareholders * * * prior to realization by the corporation * * * of a substantial part of the net income to be derived<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> from [its] property, and the realization by such shareholders of gain attributable to such property\u201d. If Island Shores, Inc., the corporation in question here, was a collapsible corporation in 1952, Kelley and Waltman, the taxpayers (stockholders), should have reported the gain from the sale of their stock as ordinary income; they reported it as a capital gain.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b954-11\">Section 117(m) has been said to confront the Court with the necessity of choosing one of two conflicting meanings, each of which may be defended on grammatical and semantic grounds.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Does \u201ca substantial part\u201d mean the part already realized or does it mean the part not yet realized? After this choice is made, the Court must then determine how much is \u201csubstantial\u201d ?</p>\n<p id=\"b954-12\">There is no dispute over the facts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In 1952 Island Shores had realized one-third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>of the total net income it might expect to derive from its property. The Tax Court held that the definition of a collapsible corporation looks to the income already realized and that one-third is a substantial part; that Island Shores, therefore, was not a collapsible corporation in 1952. We agree. Unfortunately, this result falls short of accomplishing the full objective of the statute <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> but, required to choose between two possible constructions, we feel compelled to give effect to the one that more naturally conveys the ordinary meaning of the words as they are written in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">The collapsible corporation is a brain child of resourceful tax advisors to the motion picture and the construction industries. By using corporate trappings taxpayers, before 1950,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> were able to cloak a single venture or short-term project with the appearance of a long-term investment; for example, a corporation would be organized to produce a single picture, the director and actors would receive stock instead of salaries, and the stock would be sold or the corporation liquidated as soon as the picture was made. Congressional committee reports describe the collapsible corporation as \u201ca device whereby one or more individuals attempt to convert the profits from their participation in a project from income taxable at ordinary rates [20 per cent to 91 per cent for individuals and from 30 per cent to 52 per cent for corporations] to a long-term capital gain taxable only at a rate of 25 per cent\u201d.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b956-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>The problem before Congress was how to prevent taxpayers\u2019 conversion of ordinary income into capital gain through the use and abuse of the corporate form. Congress attacked the problem on the shareholder level, not on the corporate level; Section 117 (m) defines a collapsible corporation and denies long-term capital gain treatment when the shareholders sell their stock in such a corporation or liquidate the corporation. The policy of the law is to require realization of income at the corporate level but to visit the sins of collapsibility on the shareholders by converting all of their gain into ordinary income. The resulting uncertainty over the meaning of Section 117(m) makes the solution somewhat less than wholly successful.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">As the Commissioner sees it, the test of collapsibility is whether a substantial part of the total net income remains to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>be realized <em>after </em>the date of the taxpayers\u2019 sale of stock. Here, according to the Commissioner, since two-thirds of Island Shores\u2019 income had not been realized, the sale occurred \u201cprior to the realization by the corporation of a substantial part of the total net income to be realized\u201d. According to the taxpayers, one-third is a substantial part and since they sold their stock <em>after </em>a substantial part of the total net income had been realized the sale did not occur prior to the realization of a substantial part. The grit in the oil is that <em>a </em>substantial part has already been realized, but <em>a </em>substantial part remains to be realized, leaving \u201cplenty of life in the collapsible corporation device\u201d.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">For authority, the Commissioner relies on two cases: Abbott v. Commissioner, 3 Cir., 1958, 258 F.2d 537, affirming 1957, 28 T.C. 795 and Payne v. Commissioner, 5 Cir., 1959, 268 F.2d 617, affirming 1958, 30 T.C. 1044.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">In Abbott, 258 F.2d 537, 542, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-7\">\u201cPetitioners make a final contention that Leland was not a collapsible</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b957-15\">corporation because it had already realized a \u2018substantial part\u2019 of the net income to be derived from the property. The corporation realized $23,472.75 profit from the sale of land in 1949. Petitioners\u2019 profit on liquidation was $191,876.45, or a total profit of $215,349.20. It is argued that the profit in 1949 is 10.84% of the total profit and was therefore a \u2018substantial part\u2019 of it.\u201d .[[\u201cThe real question posed by the statute, however, is not whether a substantial part <em>of </em>the total profit was realized prior to dissolution, but rather whether that part of the total profit realized <em>after </em>dissolution was substantial. This was the test correctly applied by the Tax Court in making its finding that the dissolution took place before a substantial part (nearly 90%) of the total profit was realized.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b957-16\">The Third Circuit\u2019s interpretation of the Tax Court\u2019s decision in Abbott was a surprise to the majority of the Tax Court in the instant ease.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Judge Kern, writing for the majority, pointed out, in a care<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>fully reasoned opinion: \u201cWith all due deference to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, we were not aware that we made the finding and applied the test referred to in the above question.\u201d Judge Kern said that in Abbott the Tax Court simply held, inferentially, that 10.8 per cent, already realized at the date of liquidation, was not a substantial part:<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-4\">\u201c[In Abbott] we were concerned with the question of whether \u2018only the property actually sold by the corporation can be regarded as giving rise to the income from the transaction\u2019 or whether the enhancements in value to the property arising from commitments made by the corporation but carried out by the stockholders after its dissolution could also be considered. Having resolved this question, we found as a conclusion of fact that \u2018[w]hen Leland [the corporation] distributed the land to petitioners [the stockholders], it had not realized a substantial part of the net income to be derived from the property.\u2019 In that case the \u2018part of the net income to be derived from the property\u2019 which had been realized by Leland at the time of its dissolution was approximately 10 per cent of such income. Therefore, we inferentially held in that case that 10 per cent of the net income to be derived from the property was not a substantial part thereof.\u201d 1960, 32 T.C. 135.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b958-9\">Expressly rejecting the view imputed to it,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the Tax Court found that \u201cthe question to be decided is whether the <em>realized </em>income is a substantial part of the net income to be derived.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> * * * [T]here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>may be two (or more) substantial parts of a whole, and therefore a finding that the unrealized part of such net income is substantial does not preclude a finding that the realized part of such net income is substantial\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">The Commission relies also on certain language of this Court in Payne v. Commissioner, 5 Cir., 1959, 268 F.2d 617, 622, affirming 1958, 30 T.C. 1044. We there stated that \u201cthe Tax Court could properly find on the record that a substantial part of the income of the corporations remained to be realized over the 35 remaining years of their expected life\u201d.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The questions before us in Payne are not before us here. The basic question there was whether the plan of stock redemption had been established at the time the corporation was formed; there was no consideration of the question here presented. The taxpayers and the Commissioner took it for granted that the corporation would not be deemed collapsible unless the distribution was made before the corporation had realized any substantial portion of its income, and the Tax Court decision was based on the finding that no substantial portion of income had been realized. Although the language of the Payne opinion when taken by itself may tend to suggest the interpretation of the statutory phrase \u201ca substantial part\u201d here urged by the Commissioner, its more natural meaning when viewed in context is that it was intended simply to aifirm the findings of the Tax Court, that the earnings of the corporation at the time of the distribution did not constitute \u201ca substantial part\u201d. In short, neither Payne nor Abbott is controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">In Levenson v. United States, D.C.Ala. 1957, 157 F.Supp. 244, the only case in which the interpretation of \u201ca substantial part\u201d was clearly posed for decision, the district court looked to the already realized portion of the income as determinative of the question. In Levenson a corporation was formed in July 1953 to carry on a business conducted by a partnership. The partnership assigned to the corporation a contract to purchase 3,495 trailers. By February 15, 1954, the corporation had sold 1,795 trailers, thereby realizing 51.37 per cent of the entire net income to be derived from the 3,495 trailers. February 15, 1954, the taxpayers sold all their stock, and four days later the buyers liquidated the corporation. The court concluded that the 51.37 per cent already realized constituted a substantial part of the net income to be derived from all of the corporate property and, accordingly, held that the corporation was not collapsible. Levenson, therefore, plugs the loophole just about halfway. The Commissioner did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-8\">The weakness in the Commissioner\u2019s argument is the assumption that there can be only one substantial part of a whole. There is no logical or legal basis for this assumption. There were certainly two substantial parts of a whole in Levenson.' Unquestionably there would be two substantial parts if each were fifty per cent of the whole. The brief for the Commissioner states: \u201cSpecifically, \u2022the issue is whether this two-thirds portion constituted <em>the </em>\u2018substantial part of the net income to be derived from the property\u2019.\u201d But Section 117(m) does not use the definite article \u201cthe\u201d in referring to \u201csubstantial part\u201d. The statute does not require that <em>the </em>substantial part be realized or that substantially all of the total income be realized or that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>the part unrealized be insubstantial in relation to the part realized, in order for a corporation to escape collapsibility. It is necessary to read some such language into the statute in order to construe Section 117(m) as the Commissioner would have us construe it. Section 117 (m) requires only that <em>\u201ca </em>substantial part\u201d be realized. The indefinite article \u201ca\u201d says in plain language that there may be two or more .substantial parts.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Accepting the statute at its face value \u2014 what Congress said, not necessarily what Congress might have intended to say if this case had been presented as a specific problem for legislative resolution \u2014 when the.first \u201csubstantial part\u201d is realized, the statutory requirement is met, and it is immaterial that another substantial part remains to be realized. Mr. Justice Holmes succinctly stated the limits of judicial inquiry in such a case: \u201cWe do not inquire what the legislature meant; we ask only what the statute means.\u201d Holmes, Collected Legal Papers 207 (1920).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">Courts are not captives of grammars and dictionaries. Neither are they free to ignor common usage and dictionary-tested meaning \u2014 especially in the field of tax legislation, where the necessities of the subject require technically exact language and certainty of meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">Still, a statutory provision must be construed in context and in harmony with the statutory purpose. There is nothing in the legislative history or in the factual setting that produced Section 117 (m) to indicate that Congress designed the law to penalize the reasonable use of the corporate form of enterprise. The problem Congress faced was <em>not only </em>\u201chow to prevent avoidance of ordinary tax rates by the use of the corporate vehicle <em>[but also how to do </em>so] without changing the basic scheme of corporate-shareholder taxation and without introducing excessively intricate statutory provisions\u201d.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Congress was aiming at abuse of the corporate entity. The committee reports show that Section 117 (m) was adopted in the light of problems raised by \u201cone shot\u201d motion pictures and one-project building corporations when stock in such corporations was sold or the corporation was dissolved, as described in Senate Report 2375, before \u201cany\u201d income was realized.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-7\">The legislative approach to taxing capital gains has not been distinguished for clarity or consistency. From time to time some have questioned the policy and the whole tax treatment of capital gains. Nevertheless, since 1921 our tax scheme has embraced the principle that a capital gain is not really income; that the gain from the sale of stock is a capital gain, not ordinary income. The concept of a collapsible corporation is an exception to that principle aimed at a particularly outrageous example of taxpayers\u2019 overreaching of which the instant case is not characteristic. Such an exception is in derogation of the general rule governing the sale of capital assets. The \u201call-or-nothing\u201d approach<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> of Section 117(m) has, in fact, certain penal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>implications: here, for example, there is surely some part of the gain that is properly a capital gain. It seems to us, therefore, that a court should not give such an exception a broad-brush interpretation based on, first, the court\u2019s finding that Congress intended to plug the loophole more tightly than Congress said it was plugging the loophole, then, the court\u2019s supplying appropriate verbiage in the name of legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">The effect of our holding is to leave the loophole two-thirds open to these taxpayers.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Section 117 (m), as we feel we should construe it, seems therefore a poor sort of tool for plugging loopholes. But the best workman can work only with the tools he has. If Congress wants a better job done, Congress should provide a tool that will not just plug the loophole \u201ca substantial part of the way\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-15\">The next step is to determine what amount constitutes a \u201csubstantial\u201d realization. The committee reports and the statute do not hint at the definition of this term. Nor is resort to other areas satisfactory.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We think that the term is a relative one.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Without reading too much into the silence of Congress, it seems to us that if the test were to be mechanically applied by the use of an arbitrary percentage, Congress would have phrased the statute in terms of a percentage of the income. Not having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>done so, the recurring question must be resolved on the facts of each case, giving weight to the findings of the Tax Court. We have no litmus-paper test. The ordinary dictionary meaning of \u201csubstantial\u201d is: \u201cConsiderable, in amount, value or the like; large, as a <em>substantial </em>gain\u201d (Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2d Ed. unabridged 1958); \u201cof ample or considerable amount, quantity or dimension\u201d (Oxford English Dictionary 1933). We agree with the Tax Court that, giving the word \u201csubstantial\u201d its ordinary meaning, one-third constitutes a substantial part.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\"> In summary, we hold that the term \u201ca substantial part\u201d in Section 117 (m) (2) (A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 refers to the realized, not to the unrealized, portion of the income; we hold that the one-third already realized constitutes \u201ca substantial part\u201d of the total net income to be derived from the property by the corporation. We affirm the decision of the Tax Court that Island Shores, Inc., was not a collapsible corporation in 1952. The opinion of the Tax Court is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b953-26\">.

In the 1954 Code Section 341, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 341 is the counterpart of Section 117(m).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b954-5\">. In determining the \u201cincome to be derived\u201d the total net income which will eventually be derived from the property is estimated as of the date of the sale, exchange, or distribution \u2014 assuming that there had been no sale, exchange, or distribution. See Rose Sidney, 1958, 30 T.C. 1155, affirmed 2 Cir., 1960, 273 F.2d 928. This is consistent with the statutory language, \u201cnet income to be derived from such property\u201d; but there is a serious question whether the phrase \u201cto be derived\u201d refers only to the value of the assets at the sale or liquidation. In this case there is no dispute over the Tax Court finding that Island Shores had realized one-third of its anticipated total net income.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b954-7\">. \u201cGain from the sale or exchange (whether in liquidation or otherwise) of stock of a collapsible corporation, to the extent that it would be considered (but for the-provisions of this subsection) as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than 6 months, shall, except as provided in paragraph (3), be considered as gain from the sale or exchange of property which is <em>not </em>a capital asset.\u201d Section 117 (m) (1), Internal Revenue Code of 1939.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b954-15\">. \u201cThe clause \u2018prior to the realization * * * of a substantial part of the net income to be derived from such property\u2019 can conceivably be given either of two meanings. The first, which is probably intended, would interpret the provision to mean that a susbtantial part of the total net income must be realized before the sale or liquidation. The second, also grammatically correct, would interpret the provision to mean that no substantial part of the total net income remains to be derived from the property at the time of the sale or liquidation. The committee reports do not make clear which of these interpretations is intended. As in the case of the statute itself, the numerous general statements in the Regulations using the phrase \u2018income to be derived\u2019 can be read both ways, although probably it will be more readily assumed that they refer to the part of the income realized before the sale or exchange.\u201d McLean, Collapsible Corporation, 67 Harv.L.Rev. 55, 67 fn. 18 (1953).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b954-17\">. In April 1950 the taxpayers formed Island Shores, Inc., a Florida corporation, to buy and subdivide a tract of land on Estero Island, a short distance from Fort Myers, Florida. The corporation purchased the tract for $150,000 and spent about $30,500 on improvements. Before closing the purchase, the taxpayers submitted plans to the Federal Housing Authority to obtain FHA-guaranteed financing for a subdivision and a hotel. Later, they learned that they could not meet FHA standards unless they made costly improvements to raise the ground level of the island a minimum of four or five feet and to build a sea-wall. They attempted 'to find private financing to construct a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>hotel on the site but were unsuccessful. In December 1950 the corporation began selling lots, and during the following months it sold about one-third of the land. In May 1950 Waltman, the principal shareholder, announced that because of his wife\u2019s poor health he would have to go to another climate for a considerable period of time and that he was considering a permanent move to another area; the Waltmans spent the summer of 1951 in Colorado because of Mrs. Wait-man\u2019s poor health. In October 1951 five of the shareholders, who were directors and owners of fifty per cent of the stock, sold their stock to the corporation. After the withdrawal of these shareholders Waltman owned five-sixths of the stock and Kelley one-sixth. The following month a syndicate offered to buy all of the land still owned by the corporation. Waltman and Kelley decided to sell. Accordingly, they transferred the stock to the purchasers for $192,666 and liquidated the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-9\">The taxpayers made three contentions before the Tax Court: (1) that they did not at any time have any intention of forming or availing of the corporation with a view of collapsing it. (2) that they sold their stock in 1952 as a result of circumstances arising after the purchase and development of the corporation and therefore, under Regulation 111, section 29.117, 11(b), section 117 (m) is inapplicable; (3) that the corporation is not within the statutory definition of a collapsible corporation. The Tax Court found it unnecessary to decide the first two contentions as do we.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b955-10\">. Commentators usually condemn the section.

The stockholders, after holding the stock more than six months but before the corporation realized any considerable income, would sell their stock taking a long-term capital gain. The purchaser could then liquidate the corporation at no tax cost to him, taking as a basis for the corporate property the price he paid for the stock. If instead of selling their stock, the shareholders liquidated the corporation, a subsequent sale of the property acquired resulted in no additional tax because the basis of the property in the shareholders\u2019 hands was the fair market value at the time of distribution. Taking advantage of this loophole in the tax laws, prior to 1950, it was <em>not </em>uncommon for taxpayers to form a corporation to produce a single motion picture. After completing the picture, hut before realizing any income, the incorporators would liquidate the corporation or sell their stock. In exchange for their stock the shareholders would receive undivided interests in the assets, and pay a capital gains tax on the differ\u2022ence between the cost of the stock and the fair market value of their undivided interests in the property at the time of 'liquidation. The entire proceeds from \u25a0distributing the motion picture would be treated as a tax free return of capital. 'The same tax-saving device was often used by building contractors in the construction of a subdivision or a large apartment house.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b956-6\">.

It was a surprise to most of the legal commentators. \u201cThis [the court\u2019s approach in Abbott] is an approach for which no precedent exists. Legislative history [Sen.Rep.No.7375, 81st Cong.2d Sess. 89 (1950) and H.Re.Rep.No.2319, 81st Cong.2d Sess. 97 (1950)], the statute itself, the Regulations [Reg. \u00a7 1.341-5(c) (2)], and existing case law all indicate that the \u2018substantial realization\u2019 referred to in the collapsible definition must take place at the corporate level.\u201d Weithorn, Collapsible Corporations: 1960 Status, 19 N.Y.L .Tax Inst. 593, 603 (1961). \u201cIn view of the attitude of the Service, the Congressional purpose, and the understanding of the tax bar, the Abbott case is shocking.\u201d Axelrad, Recent Developments in Collapsible Corporations, 36 Taxes 893, 895 (1958). \u201cUntil the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>appellate decision in Abbott, 3 Cir., 1958, 258 F.2d 537, nearly everyone had assumed, apparently, that a corporation would not meet the collapsible definition if, at the time of the sale or distribution, it had already realized a substantial part of the income expected to be derived from its property. This construction is the obvious one that would be derived from a reading of the statute, and there is nothing contrary in the Regulations or Congressional Committee Reports.\u201d Ryan, Payne, Kelley, Other Recent Cases, Add New Uncertainty to Collapsible Provisions, 12 Journ. of Taxation 71 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">Informal rulings issued prior to the spring of 1956 interpreted \u201csubstantial part\u201d as referring to the realized income. Axelrad, Tax Advantages and Pitfalls in Collapsible Corporations and Partnerships, 34 Taxes 841 (1956); Axelrad, Recent Developments in Collapsible Corporations, 86 Taxes 893 (1958). In the only clear reference in the Regulations, U.S.Treas.Reg. 111, \u00a7 29.117-11 (1953), Example 4 refers to the sale of the stock at a date when the corporation \u201chas realized\u201d a substantial part of the net income to be derived from each of its productions except the last.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b958-7\">. Cf. \u201cThe court of appeals\u2019 statement that its test, that \u2018substantial part\u2019 refers to the unrealized portion, was applied by the Tax Court is questionable. The Tax Court\u2019s view that a substantial part had not been realized is fully consistent with the conclusion that 10.84 per cent was not itself substantial. * * * \u201d Axelrad, Recent Developments in Collapsible Corporations, 36 Taxes 893, 895 (1958). \u201cThe result in [Abbott] where only 10 per cent of the profit was realized before liquidation can be easily defended; but it is difficult to find support in the statute for its theory that a substantial amount of <em>unrealized </em>income is fatal.\u201d Bittker, Federal Income Taxation of Corporations and Shareholders 306 (1959).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b958-15\">. Five judges on the Tax Court dissented. Judge Opper, author of the dissenting opinion in Kelley, wrote the Tax Court opinion in Abbott. In his short dissenting opinion in Kelley, Judge Opper said: \u201c[T]he only appellate court which has spoken, clearly views the critical words as meaning the opposite of what is now being accepted. Abbott v. Commissioner, (C.A. 3) 258 F.2d 537, affirming 28 T.C. 795. And this was not a reversal of a Tax Court opinion but its affirmance. Cf. Arthur L. Lawrence, 27 T.C. 713, revd. (C.A. 9) 258 F.2d 562.\u201d The dissent relies on the general legislative purpose to preclude transformation of \u201csubstantial\u201d amounts of ordinary income into capital gains. The dissent also questions whether the legislative purpose can be fulfilled if anything less than fifty per cent of the total net income should be considered as being a substantial part of the whole.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b958-16\">. Judge Kern cited Rose Sidney, 1958, 30 T.C. 1155, affirmed 2 Cir., 1960, 273 F.2d 928, in which the Tax Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>\u201cIn determining what is \u2018a substantial part of the net income to be derived from such property\u2019 we must consider the relationship between net income realized by the corporations prior to the distributions and the whole of the net income which may be reasonably anticipated to be derived from such property.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b959-10\">.

In Farmers\u2019 Loan &amp; Trust Co. v. Bowers, 2 Cir., 1938, 98 F.2d 794 the estate tax of William Waldorf Astor was in question. One of the issues was whether gifts had been made in contemplation of death; that involved the question of substantiality in relation to the whole estate. The circuit court approved the district court\u2019s instructions on the meaning of \u201csubstantial.\u201d The district court charged the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b961-17\">\u201cI mean by \u2018substantial\u2019 considerable, material, not trifling, not inconsequential.

That construction would carry out the overriding legislative purpose, which was to prevent transformation of ordinary income into capital gain. To concur with the majority in this case, I would have to think that Congress did not intend to close a loophole, but intended to close it only a part of the way, and to leave the loophole two-thirds open to taxpayers bent on saving taxes by the use of collapsible corporations. I cannot conceive that, in its enactment of a corrective statute, Congress intended to leave such a gaping loophole. We should adopt a rule of statutory interpretation which strikes more directly at the evil at which Congress aimed. I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
