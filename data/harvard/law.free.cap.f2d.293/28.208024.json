Pleading for help and just trying to live, he sought the help of the board. The board declined jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-24\">In 1957, he made a choice. In 1959 the board decided it had jurisdiction to pursue him for the wrong choice. Now it would have us enforce an order to desist from the unfair labor practices found and to make certain restitution to six dischai\u2019ged employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-25\">The boax-d did excuse Trama from the back pay provisions from March 21, 1958, to February 27, 1959, the period during which the board\u2019s then current policies precluded exercise of its jurisdiction. It determined in its discretion that it would best effect the policies of the act to suspend respondent\u2019s back pay obligation for the period in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-26\">When the board to a large extent created Trama\u2019s problem, we think its reasoning requires that all back pay be suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-27\">The proposed order of the board will be enforced except as to back pay.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
