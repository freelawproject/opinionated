To this petition an answer was filed by J. Parker Norris, Esq., setting forth, inter alia, that John De Haven Hanbest and Hannah A. Hanbest had not been lawfully appointed the administrators d. b. n.- c. t. a. of said estate, as their appointment was in conflict with the act of March 15,1832, sec. 21 (Br. Purd. 575, pi. 22), and inasmuch as there was no administrator to execute the order of sale, and as he had been trustee of the estate for about twelve years, the court should award the order of sale in partition to him. The orphans\u2019 court of Philadelphia county dismissed the petition of Virginia A. Freno, and granted the prayer of the petition of John De Haven Hanbest and Hannah A. Hanbest, and decreed that the order of sale be directed to them. Decrees following the decision of the court were entered thereon.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A_hC\">November 19, 1902 :</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-5\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were the decrees of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b462-6\"><em>Horace M.

Porter, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">This case primarily involves the interpretation of the lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>guage of the act of March 15, 1832, which provides that \u201c no letters of administration shall in any ease be originally granted upon the estate of any decedent after the expiration of twenty-one years from the day of his decease except by the order of the register\u2019s (orphans\u2019) court upon due cause shown.\u201d The court below has held that the act applies only to cases in which no letters of administration have been previously granted, and bave issued an order to sell real estate in partition, to administrators d. b. n. c. t. a., to whom letters were issued by the register more than twenty-one years after the death of the decedent in a case where former letters had been more than once issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The purpose of the legislation quoted is manifestly to take from the register and confer upon the orphans\u2019 court the power and duty to determine whether letters of administration shall be granted upon the estate of a decedent after twenty-one years. It is to be observed that the act does not say that no \u201c original \u201d letters of administration shall be granted by the register, but that no letters shall in any case be \u201c originally granted.\u201d The construction given by the court below is only made possible by transplanting the adverb \u201coriginally\u201d from its position in the sentence and by inserting it in adjective form before the words \u201c letters of administration.\u201d The true significance of the adverb is in the synonymous expression \u201c in first instance,\u201d thus imposing on the orphans\u2019 court the duty primarily to determine the propriety of the grant of letters. The intervention of the court to prevent unnecessary and intrusive issuance of letters of administration long after the decedent\u2019s death is quite as necessary in the case of a second or third issuance as in the case of an original grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">From what has been said it will be seen that the letters of administration in this case could only have been properly granted pursuant to an order of the orphans\u2019 court upon due cause shown, and that the parties to whom the letters were issued by the register gained no status in the present proceeding by virtue of the grant. To this extent at least may we go in holding the register to be without jurisdiction, whatever effect such grant of letters might have in imposing liability upon those acquiring or acting under it. See Foster v. Commonwealth, 35 Pa. 148; Wall v. Wall, 123 Pa. 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>The order of sale was issued to \u201c John De Haven Hanbest and Hannah A. Hanbest, administrators de bonis non cum testamento annexo of Thomas Passmore Hanbest.\u201d The order is to the parties named qua administrators. By section 44 of the act of February 24, 1834, it is provided that \u201cwhenever any real estate shall be ordered to be sold under proceedings in partition the orphans\u2019 courts are hereby authorized and required .... in case there be no executor or administrator, to appoint some suitable person trustee for- the purpose of making the sale,\u201d etc. The order in the present case is neither based upon suitability ascertained nor to parties nominated as trustees. It may be that the parties claiming as administrators will be found by the orphans\u2019 court upon investigation to be in their proper persons suitable to act under appointment as trustees to make the sale. On this subject we express no opinion. It involves the exercise of a discretion which is lodged by the terms of the act in the orphans\u2019 court. - The order to the administrators to make the sale is vacated and the record is remitted to the end that the proceeding may go forward in accordance with the views herein expressed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
