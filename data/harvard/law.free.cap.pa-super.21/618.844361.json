Defend.ant took an appeal, entered an appearance, filed a plea and went to trial on the merits. No objection seems to have been made at the trial to want of proper service.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b652-10\">The constable\u2019s return of service was as follows : \u201c Summons returned indorsed. November 9,1901, served on defendant by leaving a true copy of the original summons at his dwelling house with an adult member of his family.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b652-11\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $124.54.

Frank Eshleman, </em>with him <em>James </em>Walker, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZm\">The want of jurisdiction may be shown as error in the Supreme Court, after the trial of an appeal in the court of common pleas, where the question of jurisdiction was not raised: Hill v. Tionesta Twp., 129 Pa. 525; Bergman v. Roberts, 61 Pa. <em>497; </em>Collins v.

L. 614, which provides that service shall be by \u201c handing \u201d a true and \u201c attested \u201d copy to the defendant. The last clause of this act declares the act shall be an \u201cexclusive system of service.\u201d The old act of 1810 did allow service by \u201c leaving \u201d a true copy with an adult member of the family, but now it must be by handing and be an attested copy. Where the judgment is by default, the exact method, pointed out by the act, must- be pursued: Lacock v. White, 19 Pa. 495.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b653-4\"><em>B. F. </em>Davis, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Abf\">An appearance \u2022 and defense upon the merits is a waiver of any irregularity in the summons: Myers v. Stauffer, 22 W. N. C. 412; Fennell v. Guffey, 155 Pa. 38; Putney v. Collins, 3 Grant, 72.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b653-5\">Per Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The only question raised by this appeal is the alleged want of jurisdiction on the part of the justice of the peace to hear the case, arising from the fact that the summons was not properly served.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The 16th section of the Act of July 9, 1901, P. L. 614, requires that \u201c writs issued by any magistrate, justice of the peace or alderman shall be served in the county wherein they are issued by the constable or other officer therein to whom given for service in the same manner and with like effect as similar writs are served by the sheriff, when directed to him by the proper court,\u201d etc. The 1st section provides \u201cthat the writ of summons, etc., may be served by the sheriff of the county wherein it is issued, upon an individual defendant or garnishee, in any one of the following methods: (5) By handing a true and attested copy thereof to an adult member of his family at his dwelling house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">The summons in this case was returned as indorsed: \u201c Served on defendant by leaving a true copy of the original summons at his dwelling house, with an ad.ult member of his family.\u201d It is, of course, well for a public officer serving a summons to make his return correspond precisely with the requirements of the act of assembly. Whether or not this summons was properly served need not now be definitely determined. It may be said, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>however, that it is difficult to see how the officer could have left the copy with an adult member of the family, without handing it to him or her. We think, however, without pursuing this subject, the appellant has waived any irregularity, if it existed, in the officer\u2019s return of service of the summons,</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">1. In taking an appeal. \u201c Section 4 of the Act of March 20, 1810, 5 Sm. L. 161, provides that on appeal from a justice\u2019s judgment, the case shall be decided on its facts and merits only and no deficiency of form or substance in the record or proceedings returned, nor any mistake in the form or name of the action shall prejudice either party.\u201d 10 P. &amp; L. Dig. of Dec. 17,553. See also Swain v. Brady, 19 Pa. Superior Ct. 459. The alleged irregularity appearing upon the face of the record, the appellant\u2019s remedy was by certiorari. He waived the irregularity by the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">2. After the appeal was entered, he entered an appearance and a plea and proceeded to trial upon the merits. This was also a waiver of the irregularity complained of and by it he is bound.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
