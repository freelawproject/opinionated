J., found the facts to be as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-12\">From the testimony and other evidence produced, the following facts appeared: On April 14, 1892, the testator leased the premises southeast corner of Eighth and McKean streets, to be used as a dwelling house and tavern for the term of three years, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>one month and sixteen days, the first payment of rent, $40.00 per month, to be made on May 1, 1902. He entered into possession, and continued as a tenant of the premises for the full term of the lease, and thereafter under the provisions of said lease until his death, on June 15,1898. On April 14,1898, the lessor, desiring to obtain possession or increase the rent, notified testator to remove from and surrender possession of the premises at the expiration of the term, viz: July 16, 1898. But he did not remove from the premises and continued to occupy the same until his death on June 15, 1898, as above stated, one month prior to the expiration of his term. Although testator had carried on business for six years and two months, yet when he died he had no money on deposit in bank nor in his possession, and his entire personal estate consisted of his household furniture, fixtures of the barroom and stock of liquors on hand, amounting per inventory and appraisement to only $290.75. Although two weeks previous to his death he had obtained a renewal of his license to sell liquor at retail for one year from June 1, 1898, at a cost of $1,100.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-6\">Testator at that time, or shortly thereafter, was in failing health, and desirous of disposing of the business carried on by him. He so informed a relative, and requested him to endeavor to obtain a purchaser, at the same time stating he considered his business worth $9,000. His relative however informed him he did not think he could obtain a purchaser at that price, but believed he could obtain a purchaser at the price of $6,500. This interview occurred but a very few days before testator\u2019s death, and his fatal illness prevented any further consideration of the subject. After testator\u2019s death his widow remained in possession of the premises. Six days after her husband\u2019s death she obtained letters of administration upon his estate. This was on June 21, 1898. On the same day she was \u25a0 offered verbally and in writing the sum of $6,500, \u201c for the stock, fixtures, good will, unexpired term of lease and opportunity to apply for a transfer of the license.\u201d But the offer was declined by her, although it was also agreed by the person making the offer to immediately deposit with any trust company named by her, $6,500, with authority to pay the money over to .her as soon as she delivered possession of the stock, etc., and the proper court had transferred the license to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>Accountant still remained in possession of the property and continued the business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-5\">On June 21, 1898, the same day the letters of administration were granted to accountant, she obtained from the court a transfer of the license previously granted to her husband to herself individually. She also subsequently obtained from the lessor of the premises a withdrawal of the notice to vacate which had been given to testator and an acceptance of her as the tenant, at the same rent paid by her late husband. On July 8, 1898, she paid the rent to August 1, 1898. And from that time until the present she has occupied the property as tenant and carried on business. After accountant took out letters of administration, she made no effort to obtain a purchaser for the unexpired term, good will, fixtures and liquors, but appropriated the same to her own use. She made neither a public nor private sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-6\">Upon proceedings before the register instituted by creditors, the accountant was afterwards obliged to enter additional security as administratrix. This was on July 11, 1898.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-7\">On July 21, T898, the accountant filed an inventory and appraisement of the personal estate of testator, which comprised the household goods, fixtures of barroom and liquors appraised at $290.75, and also a proportion of the license fee paid by testator for one year from Junel, 1898, viz : from June 15, 1898, the date of his death, to June 1, 1899, or eleven and one half months, or $1,054.20, in all $1,344.95.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-8\">The accountant still converted to her own use the entire personal property, not even claiming her exemption of $300, as widow, and retaining the household goods and other personalty, in accordance with the act of assembly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-9\">About August 1, 1898, a testamentary paper was discovered, evidently written by testator, dated February 11, 1897, signed by him, and bequeathing all his estate to his wife.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-10\">On August 11,1898, this was admitted to probate, the letters of administration granted to accountant revoked, and letters of administration c. t. a. were granted to her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-11\">No new inventory and appraisement was filed by accountant.

The auditing judge in the court below found, as facts and conclusions of law, that \u201c the administratrix on the same day letters of administration were granted to her obtained a transfer of the license to herself, refused the offer of $6,500, soon thereafter, became the tenant of the property in place of her deceased husband, retained the other personal property for her own use, carried on the business as her own from that time until the present, and now in effect says that all she is in law or equity bound to pay therefor to the creditors of her deceased husband is the proportion of the license fee and the appraised value of his household goods, bar fixtures and liquors on hand; but, in view of the facts, the contrary seems to be well settled: Buck\u2019s Estate, 185 Pa. 57; Mueller\u2019s Estate, 190 Pa. 601. See also In Re Becker, 98 Fed. Repr. 407. The present case is readily distinguishable from Malton\u2019s Estate in this court, not reported. There the testator was owner of the real estate where he carried on his saloon and devised the same to his wife for life. There was no lease and, of course, the license expired with the death of the owner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>\u201c The auditing judge has reached the conclusion that the administratrix should be surcharged with a sum sufficient to pay the creditors. She being a creditor and sole legatee, it is unnecessary to charge her with any additional amount, as it would simply be awarded to her in her own right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Accepting the findings of fact as made by the court below, we are satisfied with the conclusions of law drawn therefrom. Without considering the specifications of error in detail, we are satisfied that no error was committed in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
