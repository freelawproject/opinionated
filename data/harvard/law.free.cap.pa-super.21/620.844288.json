T., 1900, page 462, confirming report of viewers in WestDonegal Township Road.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"A70\">Before Beater, Orlady, W. W. Porter and W. D.

Reviewers were' then appointed, and, on August 19, their report was presented and confirmed, nisi. These reviewers reported that there was no occasion to vacate the said road. The court thereupon appointed rereviewers. On January 22,1902, the report of the rereviewers was likewise presented and confirmed nisi, and by it a similar recommendation, as set forth in the report of the viewers, was made, that the road ought to be vacated. The present rule was thereupon entered to finally settle the controversy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b655-7\">By the depositions which have been taken, in order that the question might be understandingly presented to the court, it was shown that the Harrisburg, Portsmouth, Mount Joy &amp; Lancaster Railroad, operated by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, crossed this public road, and that the width of the cut at the place of crossing was 250 feet, and that its greatest depth was about ninety feet. In order, therefore, to make the road passable, it will be necessary to either cut down the bank to the grade of the tracks, or else to erect a bridge over the railroad, either of which would manifestly be attended with very considerable expense. There is only one farmhouse upon the road, which is owned and occupied by Abram Hoffer, who, however, has released all damages by reason of the vacation of the road, and has stipulated, in writing, that neither he nor his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>successors in title will make application for a public road. In addition, it is also stated that there are roads in the immediate vicinity, by which anyone, with very little inconvenience, can reach the same points as they can by using this road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b656-5\">But, disregarding, for the moment, the fact that Mr. Hoffer is not here objecting, we have before us the report of two juries in favor of its vacation. In the case of Schuylkill Falls Road, 2 Bin. 250, Yeates, J., says : \u201c Many cases may occur, where, from local circumstances, it may be difficult for the court to form their judgment on the relative merits of two different returns. The members of the court may suppose that the viewers and reviewers possessed equal disinterestedness, respectability of character and knowledge of the ground through which the road passes, and their minds may balance between them. What more proper medium of information could be pointed out in such a case than the view of other discreet and reputable men, to determine to which of the returns the preference should be given ? \u201d In Forks Township Road, 1 Northampton, 223, which was a case somewhat similar to the present one, in that the viewers reported in favor of vacating the road in controversy, and a jury of reviewers against vacating it, the court below appointed rereviewers to settle the question of the necessity of the road. See also Trickett, Pennsylvania Road Law, p. 164. In Towamencin Road, 10 Pa. 195, Bell, J., says that \u201c the propriety of granting or refusing the prayer for a road is generally thought not to be ascertained until at least two juries of view concur in opinion on the subject, and it sometimes happens that, before this is attained, three, four or more views may be appointed.\u201d In Road in Ephrata Township, 5 Lane. L. R. 5, it has been said by this court that, \u201c usually, where viewers and reviewers have been properly appointed by the court, and the only inquiry is as to the necessity for a new road, or the usefulness of an old one, the question, being one of fact, is to be determined by the road jurors and, not by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b656-6\">Under all the facts surrounding this case, we think that, as two juries, who have been upon the ground and viewed the general location, have concurred in vacating the road, we should adopt their conclusions as the facts of the case. For this reason, we have determined to adopt the report of the viewers.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AOq_\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>December 13, 1902:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b657-3\">Rule made absolute and report of viewers adopted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b657-4\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the order of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b657-5\"><em>B. F. Davis, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0Hp\">The discretion of the court in vacating the road was not properly exercised : Abington Road, 3 Pa. Dist. Rep. 226 ; O\u2019Hara Twp. Road, 152 Pa. 319 ; Leet Twp. Road, 159 Pa. 72; Pennsylvania R. R. Co.\u2019s App., 128 Pa. 509.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b657-6\"><em>W. U. Hensel, </em>with him <em>Isaac R. Herr, </em>for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWK\">Time out of mind it has been the practice in the lower court to confirm the action of a majority of road juries; and when there are two reports in favor of a road, or of vacating it, such reports are almost invariably confirmed, and the report of a single jury against two adverse reports is seldom, if ever, approved. This rule will not be departed from, unless manifest abuse of discretion in the court below is demonstrated: Abington Twp. Road, 14 S. &amp; R. 31 ; Aston Twp. Road, 4 Yeates, 372; Towamencin Road, 10 Pa. 195; Paradise Road, 29 Pa. 20 ; East Donegal Twp. Road, 7 Lancaster Law Rev. 67; Forks Twp. Road, 1 Northampton, 223; Ephrata Twp. Road, 5 Lancaster Law Rev. 5.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b657-7\">The appellate court cannot consider the evidence: Keller\u2019s App., 5 Pa. Superior Ct. 222; Benzenhoefer\u2019s App., 154 Pa. 547.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b657-8\">It will he presumed that the viewers performed their duty and that all things were rightly done, unless the contrary be shown: South Abington Twp. Road, 109 Pa. 118.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b657-9\">The omission to return a draft of the road vacated is obviously unnecessary and useless, and it makes no difference that even the order to vacate directs the viewers to return a plan. Road in Jackson Township, 9 Pa. 85.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b657-10\">Per Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">On the face of the petition to view and vacate the road in question and of the report of the viewers, the court had jurisdiction of the subject-matter. There was a Ariew, a review and a rereview, to all of which exceptions were filed. Upon a rule to show cause why the report of the rereviewers should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>adopted, the court below confirmed the report of viewers absolutely, filing an opinion fully covering the grounds upon which the order was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">The questions of fact raised in the court below and argued here do not properly come before us. A certiorari does not bring up the evidence and, therefore, this court has no power to review the questions of fact passed ujnon by the court below on depositions submitted to the court: Nobles v. Piollet, 16 Pa. Superior Ct. 386, and cases there cited; Road in Herrick Twp., 16 Pa. Superior Ct. 579; Hector Twp. Road, 19 Pa. Superior Ct. 120. It is argued that neither the petition nor the report of the viewers shows facts sufficient to move the discretion of the court in entertaining the petition and confirming the .report of the viewers. It is true that the petition sets forth only in general terms that the road sought to be vacated \u201c has become useless, inconvenient and burdensome.\u201d This is the ordinary form of a petition and is doubtless sufficient to justify and sustain the appointment of viewers, but the report of the viewers which has been confirmed sets forth the fact that the road crosses the new line of the Harrisburg, Portsmouth, Mount Joy &amp; Lancaster Railroad Company, and the draft which accompanies the report shows a crossing of a double track railroad at the point indicated in the report. This of itself would be sufficient to move the discretion of the court and the facts brought to. its attention by the depositions would only be supplementary thereto and with them, as we have already said, we have nothing to do. The opinion of the court satisfactorily disposes of all the questions raised before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The thirteenth assignment of error is as follows: \u201c The report of the viewers is fatally defective in this: neither it nor the draft attached thereto describe the buildings, fences, clearings or improvements on the land.\u201d This question was not raised in the court below. Whether or not in a report of viewers to vacate a road it is necessary to note the improvements need not now be discussed. We have lately considered the question relating to the necessity of noting improvements quite fully in Road in Upper Darby Township, 15 Pa. Superior Ct. 652, and there decided that such an omission \u201c cannot be said to be incurably fatal for, if the attention of the court below had been called to it, the report could have been referred back to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>the viewers for amendment. It is not like the case where.the termini in a petition for a road are not definitely specified. Such a defect is incurable and vitiates all subsequent proceedings, because the supervisors can have no definite guide in opening the road.\u201d But we also there decided that it is too late to raise the question here. The authorities are fully discussed in this opinion and it is not necessary to repeat what is there said. See also Road in Rostraver Twp., 21 Pa. Superior Ct. 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">The assignments of error are all overruled and the order of the court below, confirming the report of viewers, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
