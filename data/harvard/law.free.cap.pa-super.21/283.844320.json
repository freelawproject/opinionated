Ewing to John F. Proper, which is the basis of this suit, there was reserved a royalty of one fourth of one eighth (or in other words, one-thirty-second) part of all the oil the lessee, or his assigns, might produce from the land therein described. <em>Answer: </em>This point is refused. \u2022 [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-12\">The court charged in part as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-13\">[We say to you that all the plaintiff is entitled to recover in this is one sixty-fourth of the amount of oil brought to the top of the ground on the premises, and that was to be delivered to him in the pipe lines.

There being no allegation of deception, misrepresentation or fraud on the part of Ewing, and the defendants having accepted from Proper the transfer of the Ewing lease, they cannot deny their liability to pay whatever royalty is reserved by its terms : Thayer v. Society of United Brethren, 20 Pa. 60 ; Ward v. Philadelphia, 18 W. N. C. 561 (6 Atl. Repr. 263); Means v.

Superior Ct. 529.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-10\">When Ewing excepted one-fourth part of the oil in \u201csaid land,\u201d it was the one fourth of what he had, which was the undivided one half. He could not except anything from the whole, and \u201c said land \u201d could have reference only to the property or interest of the grantor: Whitaker v. Brown, 46 Pa. 197 ; Kister v. Reeser, 98 Pa. 1; Case v. Haight, 3 Wend. 632; Earl of Cardigan v. Armitage, 2 Barn. &amp; Cress. 197 ; Bryan v.

Ewing acquired title to the undivided one half of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>the land, in Harmony township, Forest county, Pennsylvania, by deed described and referred to in plaintiff\u2019s declaration in this case, from Henry C. Ewing, dated November 19,1867, duly recorded.\u201d This agreement was offered for the purpose of showing the extent of Ewing\u2019s title and was so admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">On May 31, 1887, Ewing and wife conveyed the undivided one half of the said tract of land to Samuel R. Lyon, which deed contains the following exception or reservation : \u201c Excepting and reserving, nevertheless, to the party of the first part, their heirs and assigns, the one-fourth part of all oil, gas or other minerals in, under or upon said land, with the right of way of ingress, egress and regress over and upon said land for mining-purposes and the production, search and boring for oil on said described premises as fully to all intents and purposes as if this deed had not been made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Subsequently the said Ewing made a lease of his interest in the said land to J. F. Proper, which said lease contains, among others, the following clause : \u201c Fourth. To deliver to the first party in pipe lines free of charge one eighth of all the oil produced from the one-quarter interest of said first party, or, in other words, the one fourth of one-eighth royalty he may produce from said land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Plaintiff claims that under this clause in the said lease he is entitled to the one thirty-second part of all the oil produced upon the entire property, instead of the one thirty-second of the half interest of the said George C. Ewing, the lessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Whatever Ewing\u2019s intention may have been, it is clear that he could not, by virtue of his lease to Proper, create an estate greater than that which he held. It is also clear that by the exception or reservation in his deed to Lyon \u201c from said land,\u201d he referred to the land conveyed, which was an undivided half. The interest in the lease to Proper is measured by the reservation in the deed to Lyon. That reservation is governed by the amount conveyed. The amount conveyed is determined by the estate which Ewing held. Proper\u2019s interest under the lease, therefore, was the one eighth of the one fourth of the one half. This is what the defendants were liable to pay under the lease to Proper, assigned to them, and was all that the plaintiff had the right to reserve or to claim in the present suit.\" The appellant\u2019s statement of the question involved looks like a very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>simple arithmetical proposition, but it omits the determining factor of the extent of the estate held by Ewing. The plaintiff was entitled to the one sixty-fourth of the oil produced under the lease to Proper. For this, concerning the amount of which there is no dispute, judgment was entered and that judgment is now affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
