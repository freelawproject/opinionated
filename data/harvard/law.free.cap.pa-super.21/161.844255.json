A man may get in possession of land of another and go and pay the taxes on it himself and yet have no claim to title, no right at all, and it is held that that act alone would of itself be no evidence of title in him.; but it is held that the payment of taxes, along with improvements, the cultivation of the land such as it were susceptible of, and if it were a farm and there were fields to be tilled, and the man would sow, plough and-reap and erect buildings and make repairs and improvements and pay taxes, and that he went in under an agreement with the original owner to purchase the land, about whose title there was no dispute, and continued in possession under circumstances of that kind for twenty-one years, and can show no deed, and show that the vendor lived close by all the time and never disturbed his possession or denied his title, then the law says that if those facts are established to the satisfaction of a jury, they may infer that there was a presumptive grant, that, is, the man had bought that property under articles of agreement and went into possession of it, \u2014 continued in possession of it; under circumstances of that kind the law will presume that the original owner or vendor to him has been satisfied, and if there is no evidence of a \u201cdeed, or the testimony or anything of that kind is lost, then all these facts taken into consideration raise a presumption in law upon which the title is said to be good, that is, that a deed was made, or it may be lost or mislaid, or if it wasn\u2019t made, the vendee has so used and occupied and possessed the land, that it may be presumed that he in some way satisfied the vendor for the agreed price, and if he does not have his deed, he ought to have it, inasmuch as the vendor\u2019 lived here most of the twenty-one years and never disturbed the vendee for treating the land as his own. And particularly is that held to be the case if the vendor, the original owner, who put this party into possession has suffered him to be in possession all the time, remained by quietly and tacitly, or went off and abandoned any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>claim to it; that increases the presumption that he has been satisfied.] [13]</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AoY\">October 13, 1902:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-4\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff.

McMichael, 17 Pa. Superior Ct. 476 \u2014 it was clearly intimated that, if the plaintiff had based his claims in the court below upon the ground assumed in the argument in this court, the result might have been different. The case had been tried in- the court below upon the theory that the plaintiffs had acquired title by adverse possession. Having entered into possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>under articles of agreement for purchase from those under whom the defendant claimed, it was clear that the possession was not adverse and that no title by adverse possession could ever be acquired without a change of conditions. It was upon this ground that the judgment was reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">In the trial which resulted in a verdict upon which the present judgment is based, the case was tried upon an entirely different theory. The sale from Boyd to Bowman and from Bowman to Marshman and the entry under articles of agreement was shown and the evidence in regard to the payment of purchase money considerably strengthened. The continuous possession, payment of purchase money and acts of ownership exercised by the Marshmans from 1855, when they acquired possession under the agreement, down to the time of trial, were claimed by the plaintiffs to be such as to raise the presumption of a grant by Boyd to the Marshmans, or those under whom they claimed, upon which the plaintiffs could rely.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">\u201c Presumptions arising from great lapse of time and non-claim are sources of evidence which a court is bound to submit to a jury, as the foundation of title by conveyances long since lost or destroyed: \u201d Carter v. Tinicum Fishing Co., 77 Pa. 310. In Taylor v. Dougherty, 1 W. &amp; S. 324, Mr. Chief Justice Gibson, referring to the cases in which the presumption of a conveyance had been held to arise, said: <em>\u201c </em>The case before us is much stronger, for we have the expenditure of money, not in a single contested act of ownership, but in acts repeated and persisted in for more than thirty years as regards the ownership of the warrant and without any adverse claim to it whatever. On every principle of authority and reason, this was sufficient not only to be left to the jury but, in the absence of conflicting evidence, to command a verdict. The execution of a deed is presumed from possession in conformity to it for thirty years; and why the entire existence of a deed should not be presumed from acts of ownership for the same period which are equivalent to possession, it would not be easy to determine.\u201d See also Hasson et al. v. Klee, 181 Pa. 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The appellant does not deny the general principle set forth in the cases above cited, although denying its applicability to the facts of this case, but claims that the plaintiffs, having failed to give distinct notice, by an amendment of their abstract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>of title, that they intended to claim that the facts therein stated raised the presumption of a grant by. Boyd to those under whom they claimed, should not be permitted to give in evidence the facts which, although set forth in their abstract, raised that question. Without determining how far the parties to an ejectment are bound to set forth the legal propositions to be established by the facts contained in the abstract, it is sufficient to say that the appellants had abundant notice of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. It was argued in this court, when the cas e was previously heard. If there had been nothing more in the case than the claim of title by adverse possession, it would have been reversed by us without a venire, but the new venire was awarded for the express purpose of enabling the plaintiffs to try their case upon the theory that the facts raised the presumption of a grant by Boyd to those under whom they claimed and the distinction between title by adverse possession and title by grant to be presumed from long continued possession and acts of ownership was clearly pointed out in our previous opinion. The appellant, therefore, had abundant notice that that was -the only question in the case, and although strictly speaking an amendment of the abstract of title was the orderly way of giving such notice, and in case of the first trial would have been held necessary, we cannot see that any amendment of the abstract of title was necessary under the circumstances to enable the plaintiffs to try their case upon that theory. But, if such notice had been necessary, it was given almost at the outset of the trial. The appellant was not surprised, did not ask for a continuance and went through the trial with the knowledge that the plaintiffs claimed that the facts contained in their abstract of title would raise the presumption of a grant by Boyd to those under whom they claimed. We cannot see that the appellant suffered wrong. We are clearly of opinion that the facts shown by the plaintiff were sufficient, if believed by the jury, to raise the presumption of a grant by Boyd, under whose heirs the defendant claims, to those under whom the plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The facts were fairly submitted to the jury for their consideration. We think they justified a finding for the plaintiffs and that the judgment entered upon the verdict in their favor should stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
