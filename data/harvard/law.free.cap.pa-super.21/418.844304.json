T., 1902, by Cumberland Valley Railroad, from- order of Q. S. Franklin Co., Road View No. 4 of 1901, dismissing exceptions to report of road viewers in case of Road in Greene and Guilford Townships.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Am0L\">Before Rice, P. J., Beaver, Orlady, W. W. Porter and W. D. Porter, JJ.</judges>\n<disposition data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AI3Q\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-5\">Exceptions to report of viewers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-6\">Swope, P. J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-7\">The first five exceptions to report of viewers in this case refer to alleged defects in the termini of the road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-8\">1. That the proceedings do not show that the termini are within the county of Franklin, and they are too indefinite.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-9\">2. The report does not show that the termini are within the township of Greene and the borough of Chambersburg, county of Franklin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-10\">B. The petition does not show in what township or county the place of beginning of said road is located.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-11\">4 and 5. That as to the eastern terminus of said road there is a variance between the petition, order of view, road notice and report of the viewers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Am0i\">An examination of the proceedings in this case, in the light of the maxim, \u201c Id certum est quod certum reddi potest,\u201d which is properly applicable here, leaves all the above exceptions without pertinency or force.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-13\">The petition was by sundry inhabitants of the townships of Greene and Guilford to the court of quarter sessions of Franklin county, asking for the appointment of proper persons to view and lay out a public road to lead \u201c from a bend in the public road running from Scotland to Chambersburg, at a point where the lands of Joseph E. Lehman, D. B. Long and Isaac White intersects near an old lime kiln, and at the eastern terminus of a private lane leading from the farm buildings of David Stouffer, in Greene township, thence through the said township of Guilford and into the borough of Chambersburg, in said county, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>a point in the eastern terminus of Prospect street as now opened and where Prey\u2019s lane crosses Prospect street, said Prospect street being in the borough of Chambersburg in said county.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AUKy\">This petition clearly shows that the termini of the proposed road are within the county of Franklin. The one in the township of Greene and the other in the borough of Chambersburg. After describing the place of beginning as in Greene township and thence through said township of Guilford and into the borough of Chambersburg, the words \u201c in said county \u201d refer to the county mentioned above, Franklin county, and are intended to and do locate all previous descriptions. The same is equally true in reference to the words \u201c in said county \u201d in describing the point of ending of road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-4\">The order to view and the notice follow the petition in the description of termini, and the report of the viewers substantially conform to it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-5\">The viewers in reporting the road for public use describe the same termini as mentioned in the petition and state: \u201c The road as above described being located partly in Greene township, partly in Guilford township and partly in the borough of Chambersburg,\u201d \u2014 and in the draft of the road, which accompanies and is part of their report, they say, \u201c Plan of a proposed public road in Greene and Guilford townships and borough of Chambersburg, Franklin county, Pennsylvania.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-6\">From the testimony in this case it appears that although a private lane or roadway leads from the farm buildings of David Stouffer to a bend in the public road leading from Scotland to Chambersburg at point mentioned in the petition, yet strictly speaking, the eastern terminus of Mr. Stouffer\u2019s private lane ends at a public road 189-| feet west of the bend in the Scotland and Chambersburg road. But this at most is but an indifferent error, since the petition treats the roadway, as it appears upon the ground, and describes its eastern terminus as at the bend in the Scotland and Chambersburg road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-7\">We fail to discover anything indefinite or uncertain about either terminus of this road, or any reasonable conflict between the petition, order, notice and report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-8\">We believe the supervisors would be able to open this road between the points petitioned for and reported by the viewers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>without a thought of embarrassment as to the certaiuty of location, and the above exceptions are therefore dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-3\">The sixth exception is without force. The testimony shows that the 189-| feet of the proposed road mentioned in the exceptions was never opened as a public road, and although it might be true that the public was entitled to the use of the same by prescription, yet the supervisors have never done any work on it. And viewers may carry a road to the point designated partly over the bed of a road already laid out and opened. West Chester and Germantown Road, 2 Rawle, 421; Road in Springdale Twp., 91 Pa. 260; Reserve Twp. Road, 80 Pa. 165.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-4\">Seventh exception. \u201c The supervisors were not notified of the time and place of holding the view as required by the act of assembly.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-5\">There are three supervisors in Greene township and three in Guilford township. But two supervisors in Greene township and two in Guilford township were notified of the time and place of holding the view. They accepted notice of the time and place of meeting in writing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-6\">The Act of May 2, 1899, P. L. 176, requires written notice to be given the supervisors of the territory through which a new public road is designed to be laid out, of the time and place of any views, reviews or rereviews, etc. We are of opinion that this notice must be given to all the supervisors of such territory, and that a failure to give such notice would be fatal to the proceedings. '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-7\">But the act of May 2, 1899, does not apply to the county of Franklin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-8\">The county of Franklin has a special road law passed by the legislature, March 13, 1869, P. L. 368, under which and in full conformity to which these proceedings were had.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-9\">This special act has never been repealed and therefore still remains as the governing law of Franklin county in reference to the matter of roads.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-10\">The act of May 2, 1899, is a general act without any repealing clause or reference to special laws and cannot be held to repeal the act of March 13, 1869.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-11\">A general statute without negative words will not repeal a previous one which is particular, though there be some incon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>sis.tency between them: Brown v. County Commissioners, 21 Pa. 37; Bounty Accounts, 11th Ward, Pittsburg, 70 Pa. 92; Kilgore v. Com., 94 Pa. 495; Seifried v. Com., 101 Pa. 200; Com. ex rel. v. Judges of Orphans\u2019 Ct., 102 Pa. 228; Malloy v. Com., 115 Pa. 25.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-4\">This exception, which we would consider fatal under the general road law, we think has no application to the case in hand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-5\">The eighth exception claims that there is no public necessity for this road. That it is only about 1,500 feet from the turnpike leading into the borough of Chambersburg and is almost parallel to it. That the purpose of the petitioners is to avoid the payment of toll and the opening of the \"road would be an unnecessary expense upon the county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-6\">It appears from the testimony that the distance from the proposed road to the turnpike is about 1,500 feet, and the distance from the beginning of it to the Diamond in Chambersburg is only 200 feet shorter than the route now used and traveled to the same place. But it is certainly not fair to suppose that this road is intended only to go to the Public Square, but for the easy, direct and convenient access to said town.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-7\">There is nothing in the case to justify the conclusion that this road is asked for simply to avoid the payment of toll. It is apparent that the opening of this road will diminish the receipts of toll on the turnpike. But while turnpikes have rights which all are bound to respect, yet they must not be allowed to prevent the laying out of other roads necessary for the public use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-8\">The viewers have laid out and returned this road for public use. They have passed upon its necessity, and we discover no sufficient reason for disturbing their finding or interfering with any of their conclusions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-9\">The proposed road crosses a private siding of the Cumberland Yalley Railroad, known as the \u201cWolf siding,\u201d at grade, and, as claimed, at a point which would render it a very dangerous crossing. This is urged as the ninth and last exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-10\">In the earlier period of railroads the danger of their crossing at grade was overlooked or disregarded, but as remarked by Chief Justice Paxton in Perry Co. R. R. Co.\u2019s Appeal, 150 Pa. 193, \u201c The time for grade crossings in this state has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>passed. They ought not to be permitted except in case of imperious necessity. They admittedly involve great danger to life and property.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-4\">In Bryner v. Youghiogheny Bridge Co., 190 Pa. 617, Mr. Justice Mitchell says : \u201c The same considerations of safety to life and property, though in a less imperious degree, require the application of the same general policy in cases of highways crossing railroads as in railroads crossing each other at grade.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-5\">But the above and similar cases with their wise rulings apply to railroads proper, and not to a long and extended private siding of the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-6\">The matter of railroads crossing highways and highways crossing railroads has very properly received legislative regulation by the Act of June 7, 1901, P. L. 531, which went into effect June 1,1902. But its 10th section provides : \u201c Nothing in this act shall prevent any railroad company from laying additional tracks at crossings previously existing, or from constructing switches and sidings and branch lines from their lines of railroad now or hereafter constructed, to any mill or other manufacturing establishment, etc.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-7\">The track crossed by this proposed road is a private siding, extending about one mile from the main track of the Cumberland Valley Railroad to Wolf\u2019s mill or manufacturing establishment, and it crosses the Harrisburg, Carlisle and Chambersburg Turnpike road at grade.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-8\">Shall this extended siding be allowed to prevent the opening of a road found to be necessary for the accommodation of the public, unless it crosses the siding above grade when the siding crosses the turnpike at grade ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-9\">By reason of the limited amount of business done on this siding we can see no necessity or justice in this claim and this exception is dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-10\">And now, July 28, 1902, all exceptions are dismissed and report of viewers is confirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-11\"><em>Error assigned </em>was in overruling exceptions to report of viewers.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b457-12\"><em>Irvin C. </em>Elder, of <em>Sharpe &amp; </em>Elder, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYW\">It is not required that the petition describe the termini with absolute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>precision, yet it has always been held that reasonable certainty in naming the ends of the road in the petition is indispensar ble : Lower Merion Road, 58 Pa. 66.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A5yW\">November 19, 1902:</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-4\">The notice required by the act of 1899 is independent and additional to the notice required by the act of 1869.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-5\">The two acts can stand together without inconsistency or repugnance, and should be so construed: Kulp v.
