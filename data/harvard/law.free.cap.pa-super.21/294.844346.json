Even in such a case the judge should exercise a sound discretion, after a careful consideration of the character and effect of the testimony. There is, however, a plain distinction between such a case, where the paper itself does not go into the scales against him, and a case where the testimony of the defendant is opposed by that of the plaintiff, and the latter is aided by the presumption arising from an admittedly genuine paper.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b328-8\"><em>Judgment </em>\u2014 Opening <em>judgment </em>\u2014 Imposing <em>terms.</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b328-9\">Where a judgment entered upon a warrant of attorney is opened generally, and without terms, the plaintiff is put to proof of his cause of action precisely as if no judgment had been entered. When it is opened upon an allegation of forgery it is not usual to impose as one of the terms that the instrument alleged to be forged shall \u201c be offered and read on the trial of the case as a prima facie case for the plaintiff.\u201d If such terms are imposed in the order, they may be stricken out after due notice, although a trial has been had, and a new trial granted.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b328-10\">Judgment\u2014 <em>Opening judgment </em>\u2014 Evidence\u2014Declarations\u2014Bes <em>gestae.</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b328-11\">Where declarations or acts accompany the facts in controversy and tend to illustrate or explain it, they are treated not as hearsay but as original evidence, in other words, as part of the res gestse, but declarations or acts of a person other than the one sought to be charged, if not brought to the knowledge of the latter or shown to be authorized by him, are not part of the res gestse.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b328-12\">On the trial of an issue to determine the validity of a confessed judgment, where one of the two defendants alleges that his name was forged to the judgment note, declarations and acts of the other defendant are not admissible, where there is no offer to bring home knowledge of them to the first defendant, or to show that he authorized them.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b328-13\"><em>Evidence </em>\u2014 Gross-examination\u2014Discretion\u2014Gross-examination <em>of expert as to his fees.</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b328-14\">The extent to which a party may go in cross-examination for the purpose of testing the accuracy of recollection, the interest or the bias of an opposing witness rests largely in the discretion of the trial judge, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>appellate court will not reverse because of the admission of questions asked for that purpose, unless there has been a very plain abuse of discretion to the injury of the party complaining. The fact that an expert witness is to receive, or has received, per diem compensation beyond the legal witness fee does not affect his competency as a witness, and it may have very slight bearing upon the question of his impartiality. Nevertheless his relation to the party calling him may be such as to warrant the jury in taking it into consideration in weighing his testimony, Therefore, it is not reversible error to permit cross-examination upon the subject within reasonable limits.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b329-5\">Evidence\u2014 <em>Gross-examination </em>\u2014 Improbability <em>of statements.</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b329-6\">The general rule limiting cross-examination to the matters elicited in the examination in chief does not exclude questions as to declarations or conduct naturally tending to show the improbability of statements made in the examination in chief.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b329-7\"><em>Evidence </em>\u2014 Cross-examination\u2014Cumulative <em>questions.</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b329-8\">Assignments of error relating to questions put on cross-examination will be overruled where substantially the same questions were put to and answered by the witness in other parts of his testimony.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b329-9\">Judgment\u2014 <em>Opening judgment </em>\u2014 \u2022 <em>Witness </em>\u2014 Party <em>dead.</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b329-10\">On an issue to determine the validity of a confessed judgment the defendant alleged that his signature to the judgment note was forged. A competent witness called by the plaintiff testified that in a conversation between her and the defendant, the latter admitted that he had signed the note in controversy. When the defendant was called to contradict her, objection was made upon the sole ground that the conversation took place prior to the death of the payee in the note, and original plaintiff in the issue. <em>Held, </em>(1) the objection was properly overruled, as there were present all the elements requisite to bring the case within the operation of the Act of June 11, 1891, P. L. 287 ;\u25a0 (2) that an additional objection offered for the first time in the appellate court as to the form of the question was too late.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b329-11\"><em>Evidence </em>\u2014 Witness\u2014Refreshing <em>memory </em>\u2014 Boohs <em>of account.</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b329-12\">Where owing to certain testimony given by a witness, it becomes necessary to show that the witness took up her residence at a certain place on a certain date, a merchant may be permitted to testify that at about the time mentioned he sold the witness a bill of goods, and he may be permitted to refresh his memory as to the date by referring to his books of account. In such a case it is immaterial that he enumerates the articles sold after refreshing his memory from the books.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b329-13\"><em>Evidence </em>\u2014 Witness\u2014Contradiction <em>of witness.</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b329-14\">The right to discredit a witness by proof of contradictory statements Without first calling his attention to them in order that he may have an opportunity to explain or reconcile them, is a matter within the-sound discretion of the trial judge upon the circumstances of the case.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>On the trial of an issue to determine the validity of a judgment, it appeared that a witness for the plaintiff between the date of the granting of the rule, and the date of the trial of the issue had become mentally incompetent to testify. The plaintiff read in evidence the deposition of the witness taken on the rule to open. The defendant then offered to contradict the witness by proof of his declarations made after his deposition was taken. The witness had been in the court room, but before the defendant could examine him as to his contradictory statements he had left the court without permission. The plaintiff objected to the defendant\u2019s offer on the ground that the witness had not first been examined as to his contradictory statements and given an opportunity to explain them. <em>Held, </em>that the court committed no error in overruling the objection.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b330-5\"><em>Judgment </em>\u2014 Opening <em>judgment </em>\u2014 Evidence\u2014Payment <em>of taxes on money at interest.</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b330-6\">On the trial of an issue to determine the validity of a judgment entered on a judgment note alleged to have been signed by the defendant in the issue and another person, where the defendant denies his signature, and the plaintiff shows that the other maker had drawn another judgment note of the same amount to the defendant to secure him, and that this note had been entered up, although not by the defendant, the defendant in order to show that he had no knowledge of the transaction in a particular year, may prove by the tax assessment books that in the year mentioned he paid no taxes on money at interest.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b330-7\"><em>Judgment </em>\u2014 Opening <em>judgments </em>\u2014 Depositions\u2014Party <em>dead </em>\u2014 Evidence\u2014 <em>Gross-examination.</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b330-8\">On the trial of an issue to determine the validity of a judgment where the plaintiff dies before the trial, the deposition of the plaintiff taken on the rule to open the judgment will be admitted, where it appears that the only objection to the deposition was the refusal of the plaintiff to answer a question on cross-examination when the deposition considered as a whole showed that the question had been substantially answered.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b330-9\"><em>Evidence </em>\u2014 Depositions\u2014Notice <em>of filing </em>\u2014 Buies <em>of court.</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b330-10\">Where in compliance with a rule of court notice of the filing of a deposition has been given and has been accepted by the attorneys for the opposite party, and no exceptions have been filed to the deposition, objections to the deposition are thereby waived and cannot be raised at the trial.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b330-12\"><em>Buie of courts </em>\u2014 Construction <em>of rules.</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b330-13\">Upon a question of the construction or application of its own rules, a court can be reversed only for manifest and material error.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b330-14\">Judgment\u2014 <em>Opening judgment </em>\u2014 Delay\u2014Forgery.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b330-15\">Where the defendant in a confessed judgment alleges that his name was forged to the judgment note, a delay of one year after judgment was entered on the note to take steps to open the judgment will not make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>him liable on the note if in fact his name was not signed to it by himself or by his authority.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b331-5\">The fact of the delay, however, is a significant circumstance for the consideration of the jury, but it may be explained by the defendant as the result of his obedience to the advice of counsel.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b331-6\">While the defendant in a confessed judgment who alleges that his signature was forged, may explain that his delay in taking steps to open the judgment was due to advice of counsel, his attorney will not be permitted to testify that at the time the advice was given the defendant had stated to him that his signature had been forged by his son.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b331-7\"><em>Evidence </em>\u2014 Witness\u2014Contradiction <em>of witness.</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b331-8\">If a party asks and receives a negative answer to an irrelevant question, he is not in a position to complain of the admission of evidence to contradict it.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b331-9\"><em>Evidence </em>\u2014 Handwriting\u2014Expert\u2014Act <em>of May </em>15, 1895, <em>P.

Burden of proof and weight of evidence are two very different things. The burden of proof remains on the plaintiff in support of his case and does not change in any aspect of the case.

If so, state fully when it was as near as you can fix it, and what you said to Martin Castner concerning it, or advised him to do about it. A. Martin Castner, the defendant in this case, consulted me about this judgment; I cannot fix the time; he apparently wanted to know whether such judgment in fact was entered against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>him. I examined the record and found the judgment and either showed it to him or told him about it. My recollection is that he then said it was all wrong. The substance of his statements to me was that he never signed the note on which the judgment was confessed nor authorized any one to sign it for him, and that he knew absolutely nothing about it. In short, from his statements, his son and codefendant in the judgment had forged his, Martin Castner\u2019s, name to the note.

A. Taking exhibit \u201cB,\u201d the Magee note, the writing of the name \u201c Castner,\u201d which appears twice here, is written, the upper one, at a rather low angle, while that below is almost vertical. Now, being written by the same person under peculiar conditions this indicates to me that those conditions changed the angle of the writing so that the writing is not merely the writing of J. P. Castner but is a combination of the two. Now, I find the same thing in exhibit \u201cA,\u201d or the note in dispute. These two signatures of \u201c Martion Castner \u201d are so much alike that I feel satisfied they were made under the same conditions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-8\">The capital \u201c C \u201d in Castner is written vertically and is almost identical, that is, the \u201c C \u201d in Castner in exhibit \u201c B \u201d is almost identical with the \u201c C \u201d in Castner in exhibit \u201c A,\u201d the note in dispute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-9\">Again, taking the terminal syllable \u201c ner,\u201d that is written separately, disconnected in both cases ; and the \u201c e \u201d in both cases (which I can make more distinct to you than by any description) the \u201c e \u201d in Castner is written vertically, as will be seen in both cases, as compared with the \u201c e \u201d immediately above. The \u201c e \u201d in the lower Castner in both cases is written vertically as compared with the \u201c e \u201d in Castner above it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-10\">The writing of the two signatures Martion Castner is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>same. There is the same form of the small \u201c a \u201d following \u201c M,\u201d in both cases. The name Martion is written in two groups\u2014 M-a-r-t-i-o-n, in both cases. The two names, Martion Castner, are so much alike and at the same time so different from J. P. Castner, that they must have been written under the same conditions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-5\">\u201c Q. Anything further you wish to say ? A.

As an expert, Mr. Flack, what does it indicate when there is no variation of any kind between two signatures? A. That one is made from the other. That is the direct inference ; although possibly one in sixty thousand times, say, it has been calculated, two signatures may agree. Q. Made by the same person? A. Yes. Q. As a rule do men\u2019s own signatures differ in some respects, even as to every letter ? A. They do, the signatures differ more or less all along. Q. And the letters ? A. The letters. The difference may be very slight, however. Q. Mr. Flack, take exhibit \u2018 B,\u2019 the Magee note, and look at the color of the ink, as to the witness and as to the signatures, and state if there appears to be a difference. A. There is not an appreciable difference more than would be produced by an empty pen. Q. Does a pen almost empty make a different colored signature? A. Yes, it does. Q. With the same ink? A.

Burden of proof and weight of evidence are two very different things. The burden of proof remains on the plaintiff in support of his case and does not change in any aspect of the case.

The court erred in its charge to the jury, saying: \u201c Gentlemen: We cannot possibly go over all the evidence in this case. We have given you the names of those witnesses that testified to the handwriting of Martin Castner on a number of these exhibits; some of the exhibits were testified to by several witnesses and some perhaps by only one. They will all go out with you. This rule that where a person sees a man write his name a single time, if he says he is acquainted with the hand- \u2022 wilting, why it is evidence. Witnesses have testified to these different exhibits; in some instances have proved certain exhibits to be in the handwriting of Martin Castner, and there is no dispute as to that fact, \u2014 nothing to contradict it; so that we can say that the \u00a3 several exhibits that have been offered are sufficiently proven to show that they are genuine signatures and you are to use them in deciding and passing upon the genuineness of the signature to the writing in suit; you are to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>make that comparison and say from an examination of the signatures in these different exhibits, whether the signature of Martin Castner to the note in suit is the defendant\u2019s signature.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"165\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-4\">30.

That is ruled out as a test paper, and you will have no right to compare it with the signature of the note in suit. Understand that, gentleman, distinctly. This note is only admitted for a certain purpose, and limited to that, in connection with the testimony of Peter Walley, and goes more to the point as to whether a note was ever signed by Martin Castner, in the name of Martin Castner, so that <em>yon </em>will bear in mind and not use that note in any way for that purpose.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"166\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-5\">31. The court erred in its charge to the jury, saying : \u201c But it will be for you to consider all of the eyidence bearing on the signature and to make a comparison from the writings that are admitted or proved to be genuine of Martin Castner with the respective alleged signature of Martin Castner on the face and back of the note. You will recollect that there were a number of witnesses who testified to being acquainted with the handwriting of Martin Caster, who said that the signature of \u2018 Martion Castner \u2019 to the note in suit, and on the back of the note, are not in his handwriting.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"167\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-6\">32.

The court erred in its answer to defendant\u2019s first point, to wit: \u201c Even if the jury should believe from the evidence that Martin Castner signed or authorized his son, John P. Castner, to sign his name to the Magee note (plaintiff\u2019s exhibit \u2018 B \u2019), or hold his hapd on the hand of his son when the latter wrote the name, \u2018 Martion Castner,\u2019 to said note, such evidence would not warrant the inference that the Yeany note was signed or authorized by Martin Castner in any of the three modes above mentioned. <em>Answer: </em>Affirmed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"169\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>34. The court erred in its answer to the defendant\u2019s second point, to wit: \u201c A forged instrument cannot be ratified by the party whose signature has been forged, and, therefore, no act, declaration, delay; or omission on the part of Martin Castner would make him liable on the note in suit, unless the jury find from the evidence that at the time of the making of the note, his name was signed to it by himself, or someone else by his authority. <em>Answer: </em>Affirmed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"170\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-4\">35. The court erred in its answer to the defendant\u2019s fifth point, to wit: \u201c The burden is on the plaintiff and remains on the plaintiff throughout the whole case to satisfy the jury by a preponderance of the evidence that Martin Castner either signed the Yeany note in suit, or authorized the signing of his name to said note before it was delivered to McComb &amp; Clarke, and unless the jury find from a preponderance of the evidence that Martin Castner did so sign or authorize the signing of said note, the note is a forgery, and the verdict must be for the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>Affirmed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"171\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-5\">36. The court erred in its answer to the defendant\u2019s sixth point, to wit: \u201c Under all the evidence in this case, if the jury do not believe the evidence of Mettie Castner that Martin Castner told her, or in her presence, that he had signed the Yeany note, the verdict must be for the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>Affirmed.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"172\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b352-6\"><em>J.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ANkE\">1. The unsupported testimony of a defendant in a confessed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>judgment admitting the execution of the instrument upon which the judgment was entered, but alleging fraud in the procure ment or use of it, which is directly opposed by the testimony of the plaintiff, is insufficient to warrant the opening of the judgment or to be submitted to the jury on the trial of an issue awarded. In such a case the conflict of testimony is over the equity which the defendant sets up as the ground for relief from a legal liability he has assumed. The instrument itself is evidence against him, and therefore, both upon reason and authority, he must overcome the prima facie presumption arising from his own act, and establish his allegation by the quantum and character of proof required to move a chancellor to make a decree in his favor, or be left where he has placed himself under the law. And though the defendant testifies that his signature is a forgery, and there is opposing testimony, there is no inflexible rule which compels the court to open the judgment. Even in such a case the judge should exercise a sound discretion, after a careful consideration of the character and effect of the testimony: Roenigk\u2019s Appeal, 2 Cent. Repr. 68; Essick\u2019s Appeal, 1 Mona. 588. Nevertheless there is a plain distinction, it seems to us, between such a case, where the paper itself does not go into the scales against him, and a case where the testimony of the defendant is opposed by that of the plaintiff and the latter is aided by the presumptions arising from an admittedly genuine paper. And the distinction was clearly recognized in the recent case of Schomaker v. Dean, 201 Pa. 439, where the court went farther than we are required to go in the present case .in sustaining the order opening the judgment. The case before us is not a case of oath against oath merely, but the testimony of the defendant was supported by other testimony to such an extent as to bring the case fairly within the rule laid down in Jenkintown Nat. Bank\u2019s Appeal, 124 Pa. 337, and the later cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">2. Where a judgment entered upon a warrant of attorney is opened generally and without terms, the plaintiff is put to proof of his cause of action \u201cprecisely as if no judgment had been entered : \u201d Sossong v. Rosar, 112 Pa. 197; Harris v. Harris, 154 Pa. 501. When it is opened upon an allegation of forgery it is not usual to impose as one of the terms that, the instrument alleged to be forged shall \u201c be offered and read on the trial of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>case as a prima facie case for the plaintiff,\u201d as was done here. Nor were there any exceptional circumstances in this case which required the imposition of such terms. The utmost that can be claimed is that the court had discretionary power to include this in its order; it cannot be claimed that it was its duty to do so. But if in its discretion the court might have omitted it, it seems clear that it could reconsider the question and amend the original order by striking it out. The amendment was made after due notice and full consideration, and, though made after a trial had been had and a new trial granted, we cannot see that there was any abuse of discretion. Therefore, we would not be warranted in reinstating that part of the original order, which the learned judge declared was inadvertently made.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">3. Where declarations or acts accompany the fact in controversy and tend to illustrate or explain it, they are treated, not as hearsay, but as original evidence, in other words, as part of the res gestee. In this case the fact in controversy was the genuineness of the signature, \u201c Martion Castner,\u201d to a note purporting to be signed by him and J. P. Castner. The parties to the issue were the executor of the payee and Martin Castner. The court permitted the plaintiff\u2019s witness to testify that the note was given for a loan to J. P. Castner, that it was drawn by the witness and signed by J. P. Castner in his presence, that it was taken away by the latter and subsequently returned by him with the name \u201c Martion Castner \u201d added. The plaintiff further offered to show by the same witness what was said at the time the note was taken away by J. P. Castner, what the condition was upon which the loan was made to him, what was done during the negotiations relative to the examination of the record as to Martin Castner, and whether upon the return of the note the attention of J. P. Castner was called to the manner in which \u201c Martin \u201d was spelled. He also offered to prove by another witness that the money loaned to J. P. Castner was applied by the latter upon another note of which Martin Castner was joint maker with him. We fail to see how the acts and declarations thus offered to be shown, standing alone, illustrate, explain or throw any light upon the fact in controversy. There being no accompanying offer to bring home knowledge of them to Martin Castner or to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>that he authorized them, the evidence was irrelevant to the issue, and was properly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">4. The extent to which a party may go in cross-examination for the purpose of testing the accuracy of recollection, the interest or th.e bias of an opposing witness rests largely in the discretion of the trial judge, and the appellate court will not reverse because of the admission of questions asked for that purpose, unless there has been a very plain abuse of discretion to the injury of the party complaining. The fact that an expert witness is to receive, or has received, per diem compensation beyond the legal witness fee does not affect his competency as a witness, and it may have very slight bearing upon the question of his impartiality. Nevertheless, his relation to the party calling him may be such as to warrant the jury in taking it into consideration in weighing his testimony. Therefore, it is not reversible error to permit cross-examination upon that subject within reasonable limits, which we think were not exceeded in this case by the questions referred to in the ninth assignment of error. See Commonwealth v. Farrell, 187 Pa. 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">. 5. The general rule limiting cross-examination to the matters elicited in the examination in chief does not exclude questions as to declarations or conduct naturally tending to show the improbability of statements made in the examination in chief. Of this nature were the questions put to Martin Castner which are quoted in the fourteenth, fifteenth and sixteenth assignments. We overrule these assignments, not because the questions were not legitimate cross-examination, for we think they were, but because substantially the same questions were put to and answered by the witness in other parts of his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">6. Mettie Castner, a competent witness called by the plaintiff, testified that in a conversation between her and the defendant the latter admitted that he had signed the note in controversy. When the defendant was called to contradict her, objection was made upon the sole ground that this conversation took place prior to the death of John Yeany, the payee in the note and original plaintiff in the issue. All the elements requisite to bring the case within the operation of the Act of June 11, 1891, P. L. 287, being present, the objection was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>properly overruled: Rudy v. Myton, 19 Pa. Superior Ct. 312. The additional objection which the counsel now raise goes to the form of the question, is without real merit and comes too late: Gorman v. Bigler, 8 Pa. Superior Ct. 440. There never was a plainer case for holding a party complaining on appeal of the admission of evidence objected to in the court below to the specific objection made to it there. See Danley v. Danley, 179 Pa. 170, Fisher v. Ruch, 12 Pa. Superior Ct. 240, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">7. By reason of testimony of Mettie Castner, not necessary to be recited here, it became important for the defendant to show that she and her husband Matthew went to housekeeping at Blacks Corners prior to June, 1895. For that purpose Michael Toomey, a merchant, was called and permitted to testify that it was about the time he sold them a bill of goods, and to refresh his recollection as to the date was permitted to refer to his books of account in which the items were charged. This was clearly competent: First Nat. Bank of Du Bois v. First Nat. Bank of Williamsport, 114 Pa. 1. His examination upon the subject might well have ended there, but no possible harm resulted to the plaintiff from permitting him to enumerate the articles after refreshing his recollection by reference to his books. There is no merit in the tenth assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">8. The plaintiff offered in evidence the deposition of one Peter Walley, taken on the rule to open the judgment. Walley was living at the time of trial and was present in court part of the time, but it appearing to the court from his preliminary examination that his mental condition was not such as to enable him to testify, the deposition was permitted to be read. His testimony was to the effect that he had seen Martin Castner sign a certain note which the plaintiff desired to use in the trial as a test paper. Later in the trial the defendant offered to contradict and impeach the witness by proof of his declarations made after his deposition was taken, to the effect that he had never seen Martin Castner sign any note. The objection was made that he had not first been examined as to these declarations and given an opportunity to explain them. But how could the plaintiff raise that objection when, by his own showing, the witness was unable to testify ? Moreover, the defendant attempted to comply with the rule but was prevented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>from doing so by the fact that Walley had left the court without permission. In view of all the circumstances to which we have alluded, the court exercised its discretion properly in overruling the objections and admitting the testimony referred to in the seventeenth and nineteenth assignments of error. \u201c The right to discredit a witness by proof of contradictory statements without first calling his attention to them in order that he may have an opportunity to explain or reconcile them is a subject on which our decisions have not always been uniform, but it is now settled by the later cases that the question is one of sound discretion in the judge trying the case, upon the circumstances before him: \u201d Cronkrite v. Trexler, 187 Pa. 100; Commonwealth v. Cowan, 4 Pa. Superior Ct. 579. \u201cIn this case the rule, which is based largely on a regard for the witness himself, could not have been enforced without sacrificing the interest of the party. The court was clearly right in refusing to enforce it at such a sacrifice: \u201d Baldi v. Metropolitan Ins. Co., 18 Pa. Superior Ct. 599. The same may be said with equal appropriateness in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">9. It appears that when this note was given, another judgment note for the same amount was drawn in favor of Martin Castner and signed by J. P. Castner. This was intended to secure the former and judgment was entered upon it, but not by Martin Castner, in 1892. It became a matter of importance in the trial to determine when he first had notice of the transaction. To repel any inference that he must have got notice of it as early as 1898 through the assessment of taxes, the defendant was permitted to show that he was not assessed with taxes upon money at interest in that year. This we understand to have been the purpose of the offers which are referred to in the twentieth and twenty-first assignments of error. We cannot say that this was a wholly irrelevant fact, nor that the book referred to in the assignments was not sufficiently proved in the first instance to warrant its admission in evidence for that purpose. The twenty-third assignment may appropriately be considered in this connection. When James Pinks, a witness called by the plaintiff in rebuttal to prove that the book put in evidence by the defendant was a mere copy of the original assessment book, finally admitted upon cross-examination that it was \u201cthe only book from which the duplicate is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>made up charging taxpayers with taxes,\u201d his testimony in chief became unimportant, and no error was committed by striking out his whole testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">10. Martin Castner having become incompetent to testify by reason of the death of John Yeany, the deposition of the former taken in 1895 and used on the rule to open the judgment, when John Yeany was alive, was offered in evidence and objected to upon the ground that it appeared on the face of the deposition that, by the advice of counsel, he had refused to answer a certain question put to him upon cross-examination. It is urged that under the authority of Stonebraker v. Short, 8 Pa. 155, it was the imperative duty of the court to reject the deposition regardless of the special circumstances. Inasmuch as his testimony given on the first trial covering the same ground was read, it is difficult to see how the error, if error there was in permitting his deposition to be read, could have been prejudicial to the plaintiff. But we need not put our decision on that ground. The question which the witness refused to answer, though perhaps proper cross-examination, was of little importance. He had testified in chief that he first saw the note in question when his attorney took him to the office of McComb and Clarke, the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys. The question he refused to answer was, whether he went there on business of his own or that of his son. His counsel deeming this illegitimate cross-examination instructed him not to answer. But immediately preceding this he had testified, while under cross-examination: \u201cCouldn\u2019t tell whether McComb and Clarke were attorneys for my son, J. P., didn\u2019t inquire into such business.\u201d Looking at his testimony as a whole it is manifest that the question was answered substantially, and that his refusal to answer it categorically did the defendants not the slightest injury. In Crossgrove v. Himmelrich, 54 Pa. 203, a somewhat similar case, it was held that the admission of the deposition was not error. Still further, it appears that notice of the filing of the deposition was accepted by the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys and that they filed no exceptions to it. It is argued with great force that under the rule of court quoted in the bill of exceptions the objection was thereby waived. ' The court evidently took this view of the matter, and it is well settled that, upon a question of the construction or application of its own rules a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>court can be reversed only for manifest and material error. See Kunkle\u2019s Estate, in which we have this day filed an opin-' ion, and the cases there cited; also Depew v. Depew, 2 Cent. Repr. 611. The eleventh assignment is not sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">11. Judgment was entered on the note in question, as well as upon the indemnity note of J. P. Castner to Martin Castner, in April, 1892. The former note became due in April, 1893, execution was isssued thereon in April, 1895, and a levy made, but the application to open was not made until June 29, of the same year. According to the defendant\u2019s own admissions he was shown the records of these judgments by his attorney early in the year 1894, but he gave no notice to the plaintiff or his attorneys that his signature was a forgery, and made no application to see the note until about the time when he moved to open the judgment thereon. The court correctly charged the jury, as requested in the defendant\u2019s second point (thirty-fourth assignment), that no act, declaration, delay or omission on his part shown in the present case would make him liable on the note, if his name was not signed to it by himself or by his authority: Henry Christian B. &amp; L. Association v. Walton, 181 Pa. 201, and cases cited. Nevertheless his delay of over a year in moving to open a judgment against him upon a note which he now alleges to be a forgery, and which was overdue when knowledge of the judgment was brought home to him, was a circumstance of considerable significance. This was recognized by both parties; by the plaintiff in his fifth point, which was affirmed, and by the defendant in the introduction of the testimony quoted in the twelfth assignment. The defendant\u2019s delay did not estop him, but the circumstance being such as would properly call for some action or declaration from men similarly situated, the jury might very naturally and properly regard it as some evidence of consciousness on his part that the judgment was valid. But if his delay was involuntary, it would not furnish any ground for such inference. So also, if he consulted counsel as soon as he learned of the judgment and the latter advised him to take no action until the plaintiff should move in the matter, the effect of his delay, pursuant to such advice, as evidence of a consciousness on his part that he had no defense to the judgment might be weakened in the estimation of the jury, if not wholly destroyed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Advice of counsel would not prevent an estoppel, if his acts otherwise created one, nor would it relieve from laches where that was sufficient to bar relief; but we are not prepared to say that it was error to permit it to be proved for the narrow purpose above suggested. It is to be observed, however, that the state of mind of the defendant was not directly in issue ; that is to say, proof of what it was was not essential to the plaintiff\u2019s case or that of the defendant. The case is not precisely analogous to an action of deceit or for malicious prosecution, or for enticing away a man\u2019s wife, in all of which motive and intent are directly in issue. To extend the principles of such cases so far as to permit the defendant, not only to prove that his delay in moving to open the judgment was by advice of counsel, but also to put his counsel on the stand to narrate the facts that he communicated to him when he took his advice, would be unwarranted. \u201c Where it is important to know whether a statement made by a witness on the trial of a cause is of recent fabrication, it is sometimes competent to show that upon some former occasion, when there was no reason to suspect his motives, he stated the matter in the same way as upon the trial: \u201d Clever v. Hilberry, 116 Pa. 431. We are relieved from the necessity of discussing the question whether this rule applies to the case in hand, for the defendant\u2019s counsel frankly concede that they make no such claim. If that rule does not apply, and we agree with counsel on both sides that it does not, it was error to admit those parts of the deposition of Judge Reed in which the witness recited the facts narrated to him by the defendant. Thereby the fact that the defendant declared to his counsel that his son had forged his name to the note became lodged in the minds of the jurors and it would be difficult to dislodge it. A party toan action or a defendant in a judgment, which he means to contest, cannot make evidence for himself in that way. And although the jurors were told to consider the fact only as an excuse for the defendant\u2019s delay, the error was not made harmless, because proof of that fact was not admissible even for that purpose. We would not reverse if the evidence had been confined strictly within the limits heretofore suggested, but because it was not we are compelled to say that this assignment of error is well founded. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>The objections to the kind of testimony are very forcibly stated in Clever v. Hilberry, supra, and we need not repeat them.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">12. The plaintiff opened the door to the admission of the evidence complained of in the thirteenth assignment by asking and receiving a negative answer to the question put by his counsel to sheriff Stetzler, a witness called by him: \u201c State whether or not Martin Castner made any allegation at that time \u2019\u2019 \u2014 June, 1895, the time of the levy \u2014 \u201c regarding the note, or that judgment being a forgery or anything of that kind.\u201d If the testimony introduced by the plaintiff was relevant, it was competent for the defendant to contradict it. If it was irrelevant, still the plaintiff is not in a position to complain of the admission of evidence to contradict it: Schriver v. Eckenrode, 1 Penny. 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">13. One of the rules laid down in Travis v. Brown, 43 Pa. 9, is: \u201c 1. That evidence touching the genuineness of a paper in suit may be corroborated by a comparison, to be made by the jury, between that paper and other well authenticated writings of the same party.\u201d The Act of May 15, 1895, P. L. 69, changed the law as declared in Travis v. Brown by making it competent for experts to make such comparison, but in nowise changed the law as to the introduction of other well authenticated writings of the same party for the purpose of comparison to be made by the jury. On the contrary, it expressly declares that \u201c the final determination as to whether any particular handwriting is genuine or simulated shall remain, as heretofore, a question for the jury on all the evidence submitted.\u201d The signature to the paper offered by the defendant (twenty-second assignment) was sufficiently proved; it was made in 1890, two years before the date of the note in question, and hence was not made with this litigation in view. The fact that the name \u201c Martin \u201d was written correctly and not \u201c Martion \u201d as in the note in controversy, neither destroyed nor lessened its value as a test or standard with which to compare the signature in dispute. The counsel for the plaintiff, in further support of this assignment, say that they do not claim that this signature to the note in controversy bears any resemblance to the ordinary signature of Martin Castner. But the defendant could not be expected to anticipate that the plaintiff would make such admission. Even if it had been solemnly made and put <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>on the record, the error was, not in admitting proof of a fact that harmed the plaintiff, but in taking up time to prove a fact that he admitted. This would not be a ground for reversal and putting the parties to the expense of another trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">14. To authorize the admission of the writing offered as a test or standard, nothing short of evidence by a person who saw the party write the paper, or of an admission by such party of its being genuine, or evidence of equal authority, is sufficient: Baker v. Haines, 6 Whart. 283. This rule has been adhered to in later cases (Cohen v. Teller, 93 Pa. 123), and was not changed by the act of 1895. The case of Sweigart v. Richards, 8 Pa. 436, is not an exception; it simply decides that certain evidence is of \u201c equal authority.\u201d Under the act of 1895, the document or writing offered for purpose of comparison must be \u201cadmitted to be genuine,\u201d or \u201cproven to the satisfaction of the judge to be genuine.\u201d The execution of the test paper offered by the plaintiff in this case was seriously in conflict. Martin Castner denied it and the witness called to prove it was contradicted by proof of his subsequent declarations, and other testimony. Even according to his testimony it is more probable that the handwriting, in a physical sense, was that of J. P. Castner than that it was that of Martin Castner. He said, \u201c J. P. Castner held the pen and Martin Castner had his hand on top of J. P. Castner\u2019s hand.\u201d The court first admitted the paper but afterwards reconsidered the matter, and upon the defendant\u2019s motion struck it out, at the same time saying, amongst other things : \u201c The only evidence offered on the part of the plaintiff is that of Peter Walley taken by deposition, and it is of such an uncertain character that it leaves a doubt in our mind as to the paper being sufficiently proved.\u201d Unquestionably it is the duty of the judge to require the same kind of proof as was required prior to the act of 1895; but if such proof is furnished and there is opposing testimony, his decision of the question of fact must ordinarily be accepted as conclusive, for the obvious reason that the credibility of the witnesses is an important factor, and of this he had better opportunity to judge than is afforded the appellate court. The paper in question was neither \u201c admitted to be genuine \u201d nor \u201c proven to the satisfaction of the judge to be genuine.\u201d The statutory conditions- were not fulfilled. Tak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>ing into consideration the manner in which it was alleged to have been executed by Martin Castner, and the serious conflict of testimony as to whether it was executed in any manner, by him, it is not for us to say that the judge ought to have been satisfied with the proof and admitted the paper. Even according to the plaintiff\u2019s showing, the paper had little, if any, more value as a test paper than if the signature had been written by J. P. Castner by Martin Castner\u2019s direction, and it had less value than a letter press copy, which, in Cohen v. Teller, supra, was held to be inadmissible. The testimony of J. B. Flack, quoted in the twenty-fourth assignment, was based on this paper, and when it was ruled out nothing of any consequence in that testimony remained which was relevant to the issue. Therefore the court committed no error in striking it out, or in the instructions complained of in the thirtieth assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The remaining questions relate to the charge of the court and the answers to the points.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">15. As the issue stood when the case was tried, the burden of proof rested on the plaintiff, and it was incumbent on him to establish his allegation that the note in suit was signed by the defendant or by some one authorized by him : Sossong v. Rosar, supra ; Harris v. Harris, supra; Shrader v. U. S. Glass Co., 179 Pa. 623. In such a case as this, where the defense consists of a general denial of the plaintiff\u2019s allegation, it is sufficiently accurate to say to the jury that the burden of proof is on the plaintiff throughout, and does not shift; especially when such instruction is accompanied by the explanatory statement that the weight of the evidence may shift from side to side in the progress of a trial, according to the nature and strength of the proofs offered in support dr denial of the main fact to be established, and the further instruction that if the jury find that the evidence preponderates in favor of the plaintiff it is their duty to render a verdict in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">16. The instructions complained of in the twenty-seventh, twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth assignments of error, read without reference to the context, would seem to be open to the criticism that the question at issue was to be, or at least might be, determined by the jury from a comparison of the disputed signature with the signatures proved to be genuine^ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>and that alone. We feel quite sure that this was not what the learned judge meant, and looking at the charge as a whole it is probable that the jury did not so understand him. It must be conceded, however, that the expressions, especially in the twenty-eighth assignment, were unfortunate, and while, perhaps, the error, standing alone, is not sufficiently clear to require a reversal of the judgment, yet we deem it our duty to call attention to it in order that it may be avoided in the next trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">17. The answer to the thirty-second assignment of error is twofold: first, the presumption against the defendant from his failure to call J. P. Castner is no stronger than that against the plaintiff from his failure to call him ; second, the court was justified in refusing to charge as a matter of law that there was a \u201c presumption \u201d against either. Under some circumstances the jury may draw an unfavorable inference against a party from the nonproduction of evidence, but it is an inference of fact, not a presumption of law: Wills v. Hardcastle, 19 Pa. Superior Ct. 525, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">18. In discussing other assignments of error we have incidentally passed upon the questions raised by the thirty-first, thirty-fourth and thirty-fifth assignments, and the thirty-third does not require discussion. It is sufficient to cite the case of Penna. Co. v. Franklin Fire Ins. Co., 181 Pa. 40, at p. 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">19. The last assignment alleges error in the affirmance of the defendant\u2019s sixth point, which was as follows : \u201c Under all the evidence in this case, if the jury do not believe the evidence of Mettie Castner that Martin Castner told her, or in her presence, that he had signed the Yeany note, the verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d It would unduly extend this opinion, already too long, to attempt a recital and an analysis of the evidence introduced by the plaintiff, outside of that of Mettie Castner, tending to show that the defendant signed or authorized his name to be signed to the note in suit. Nor is it necessary to do so, for it is fully and accurately summarized in the judge\u2019s charge. We therefore simply state our conclusion, reached after a thorough and careful examination of it, that it would be insufficient, standing by itself, to sustain a recovery in favor of the plaintiff upon a note alleged by the defendant to be a forgery. In other words, if Mettie Castner\u2019s testimony bad not been introduced, or for any proper cause had been struck out, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>would have been compelled to give binding instructions for the defendant, if asked to do so. Such being the case, it was not error to affirm the point. The learned judge had already instructed the jury to give careful consideration to all the evidence, and that it was their duty to do so was recognized in the point. The effect of the affirmance of the point was not to withdraw any of it from their consideration, either in determining the main question or in deciding as to the veracity of Mettie Castner. It only directed them as to their verdict in the event that upon a consideration of all the evidence they should not believe Nettie Castner. We recognize the principle, stated by Mr. Justice Trun key in Ott v. Oyer\u2019s Executrix, 106 Pa. 6, that \u201c the credit of a witness may be so shaken that a jury would not rely upon his testimony alone to establish a fact, and yet justly consider it with other testimony; \u201d but we are not convinced that the effect of the affirmance of this point was to direct or permit the jury to disregard it.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">All the assignments of error, excepting the twelfth, twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth, are overruled, the judgment is reversed and a venire facias de novo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
