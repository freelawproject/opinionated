Herman for an Order Declining the Appointment of an Independent Counsel, filed under seal on May 18, 1998, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b210-16\">ORDERED that the Motion is denied for the reasons set forth in the accompanying opinion.

Herman. On May 11, 1998, at the end of the preliminary investigation, and pursuant to \u00a7 592(c)(1) of the Act, the Attorney General, believing that further investigation was warranted, submitted an application to this court seeking the appointment of an independent counsel. In her application, the Attorney General described in detail both the information received by the Department of Justice that led to the initiation of the preliminary investigation as well as the results of that investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-23\">On May 18, 1998, Secretary Herman filed with this court, under seal, a motion seeking an order declining the appointment of an independent counsel. Relying on <em>In re Meese, </em>907 F.2d 1192 (D.C.Cir.1990), Secretary Herman asserts that the Attorney General\u2019s application does not satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 592(c)(1)(A), which states that the Attorney General shall apply for the appointment of an independent counsel if, after the completion of a preliminary investigation, she \u201cdetermines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that further investigation is warranted.\u201d In essence, Secretary Herman argues that the conclusions of the preliminary investigation, as set forth in the application, do not support a determination of \u201creasonable grounds.\u201d Therefore, she argues, \u201cthe application is invalid, the statute is not properly invoked, and this Court may not appoint an independent counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-24\">We find \u00a7 592(f) of the Act to be controlling/ That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-25\">The Attorney General\u2019s determination under this chapter to apply to the division of the court for the appointment of an inde<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>pendent counsel shall not be reviewable in any court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Under this section the Attorney General\u2019s determination to apply for the appointment of an independent counsel, which is made under \u00a7 592(c)(1)(A), is not reviewable in this (or any other) court. While acknowledging \u00a7 592(f), Secretary Herman states that she is not seeking \u201creview\u201d by the court of the Attorney General\u2019s determination, but rather a determination that the Attorney General has not complied with \u00a7 592(c)(1)(A). We will not adopt this distinction. We conclude that, however styled, Secretary Herman <em>is </em>seeking the review that we are forbidden by \u00a7 592(f) to grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">We are not confronted in this case with a situation in which the application by the Attorney General is so facially deficient that we are arguably deprived of jurisdiction to appoint an independent counsel. Such a situation may arise, for example, if the application did not pertain to a covered person as required by \u00a7 591 of the Act, or if the application contained no allegations of any violation of criminal law. Here, the Attorney General has made a determination that an independent counsel is to be appointed, she has filed an application for the appointment that is not facially deficient, and her determination is not reviewable pursuant to \u00a7 592(f). Consequently, we are bound by the Act to appoint an independent counsel in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Accordingly, the motion of Secretary Herman is</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">\n<em>Denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
