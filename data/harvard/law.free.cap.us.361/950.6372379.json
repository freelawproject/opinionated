It appears, as respondents pointed out in their application to the Court of Appeals for the stay herein, that the issues in No. 64, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Raines, </em>now pending on appeal in this Court, are' pertinent to the disposition of this case. In view of this, and of the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>that the issues raised by this application are closely rel\u00e1ted to those involved on the merits of the controversy now before the Court of Appeals, the Court believes that, the entire matter should be considered at' one time. In light of the foregoing, and of the imminence of the State general election scheduled for April 19, 1960, the Court will entertain a petition for certiorari to review the judgement of the District Court, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1254 (1), 2101 (e)l' if filed by the Solicitor General on or before January 29, 1960. The petition may be filed in type-, written form.
