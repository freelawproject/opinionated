Buccinna filed a complaint against defendants Denise Micheletti, Davis T. London, Woodbine Developmental Center (Woodbine), and the New Jersey Department of Human Services alleging violation of his rights under the Conscientious Employee Protection Act (CEPA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-1 to -8, commonly referred to as the \u201cWhistleblower Act.\u201d The complaint alleged, among other things, that defendants had retaliated against Buccinna for reporting abuse of a client at Woodbine where plaintiff was and is employed. After a bench trial, the trial judge, in a letter opinion dated December 5, 1996, found no violation of CEPA and dismissed the complaint. Thereafter, by notice of motion the public entity defendants sought an order assessing costs in the amount of $12,220.48. After hearing arguments on the application, the judge entered an order on May 1, 1997, taxing costs aggregating $9,766.73. Plaintiff appeals from that order, contending that an award of costs is inappropriate in a CEPA action, and that deposition and expert witness expenses were not properly awardable as costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">We need not recite at length the facts and allegations in the underlying case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Suffice it to say that Buccinna was employed as a behavior modification program technician at Woodbine and supported allegations made by a young client of improper treatment by Woodbine personnel. The parties conceded prior to trial, and do not dispute on appeal, that in January 1994, plaintiff reported in good faith what he thought was the improper treatment of that client at Woodbine. A nurse had also reported the complaints. Thereafter, Buccinna was temporarily reassigned to what he considered an unfavorable post at Woodbine and required to take \u201cimprovement\u201d classes as a result of charges that he committed infractions of Woodbine\u2019s rules. With respect to the disciplinary actions taken against Buccinna the trial judge found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>that he had not presented a prima facie case of retaliation, and even if such a prima facie case had been presented, the articulated reasons given by Woodbine clearly overcame the presumption of discrimination, and its actions did not constitute \u201cother adverse employment actions.\u201d The judge found that Woodbine\u2019s decision to take the actions it did were justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">It is clear that defendants prevailed at the trial and therefore Buccinna would be the proper party against whom any taxed costs would be assessed. <em>R. </em>4:42-8(a). Authority for assessing costs must be found in either the Court Rules or a statute. <em>United States Pipe &amp; Foundry Co. v. United Steelworkers of America, </em>37 <em>N.J. </em>343, 355, 181 A.2d 353 (1962). The costs that are contemplated in the Court Rules are in the usual case those authorized in <em>N.J.S.A. 22A-.2-8. </em>However, imposition of taxed costs is discretionary. <em>Hirsch v. Tushill Ltd., </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>644, 646, 542 A.2d 897 (1988); <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">The May 1, 1997 order awarded defendants the following costs, all payable by Buccinna:</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">1.

In this respect the judge erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-14\">The purpose of CEPA is to encourage employees to exercise their rights under the act while affording them protection from retaliation for engaging in such conduct. <em>See Abbamont v. Piscataway Bd. of Educ., </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>405, 417, 650 A.2d 958 (1994). CEPA provides in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-6:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-15\">A court, upon notice of motion in accordance with the Rules Governing the Courts of the State of New Jersey, may also order that reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and court costs be awarded to an employer if the court determines that an action brought by an employee under this act was without basis in law or in fact. However, an employee shall not be assessed attorneys\u2019 fees under this section if, after exercising reasonable and diligent efforts after filing a suit, the employee files a voluntary dismissal concerning the employer, within a reasonable time after determining that the employer would not be found to be liable for damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-16\">There was no finding that Bueeinna\u2019s cause of action was without basis in law or in fact and, hence, attorneys\u2019 fees and court costs were not properly awardable under this statute. We note the similarity in the standard of \u201cwithout basis in law or fact\u201d in the quoted statute to the standard in the frivolous claim law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-59.1. That statute states that in order for costs to be awarded to the prevailing party because of a frivolous claim, a showing should be made that the nonprevailing party either brought the claim in bad faith for harassment, delay, or malicious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>injury; or \u201cknew, or should have known that the complaint [or] counterclaim ... was without basis in law or equity----\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-59.1b(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">There was no showing in the case at bar that the complaint was \u201cin bad faith, solely for the purpose of harassment, delay or malicious injury,\u201d or had no \u201creasonable basis in law or equity.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-59.1b(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In fact, defendants conceded for the purposes of trial that Buccinna acted in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">Neither CEPA nor the frivolous claim law were relied on below by defendants. However, plaintiff argued the non-applicability of costs because of CEPA in the trial court and here, and defendants have cited certain portions of the frivolous claim law on this appeal. Because appeals are from judgments, not the reasons given by the judge, <em>Glaser v. Downes, </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>10, 16, 312 A.2d 654 (App.Div.1973), <em>certif. denied, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>513, 317 A.2d 726 (1974), we have considered these statutes in reviewing the trial court\u2019s award of costs to defendants. <em>See Isko v. Planning Bd. of Tp. of Livingston, </em>51 <em>N.J. </em>162, 175, 238 A.2d 457 (1968); <em>Ellison v. Evergreen Cemetery, </em>266 <em>N.J.Super. </em>74, 78, 628 A.2d 793 (App. Div.1993). Simply stated, in light of the fact that there was no issue of plaintiffs lack of good faith, and the fact that there was no finding that the suit was either frivolous or without basis in law or fact, the imposition of these costs was inappropriate under CEPA or the frivolous claims statute. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-59.1a(1) and (2); <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:19-1 <em>et seq.; Velli v. Rutgers Casualty Ins. Co., </em>257 <em>N.J.Super. </em>308, 312, 608 A.2d 431 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>597, 617 A.2d 1220 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Because costs and fees were not awardable under either CEPA or <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-59.1, we next consider the viability of the award under <em>R. </em>4:42-8(a) and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>22A:2-8. In <em>R. </em>4:42-8(a) the authority for allowance of costs is succinctly set forth: \u201cUnless otherwise provided by law, these rules or court order, costs shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party. The action of the clerk in taxing costs is reviewable by the court on motion.\u201d There is no question that the allowance of costs is generally discretionary. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A: 15-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Our eases generally make clear that deposition costs are not generally recoverable as taxed costs. <em>See Hirsch v. Tushill, Ltd. Inc., supra </em>(110 <em>N.J. </em>at 649, 542 A.2d 897); <em>Finch, Pruyn &amp; Co. v. Martinelli, </em>108 <em>N.J.Super. </em>156, 159-160, 260 A.2d 259 (Ch.Div.1969). N.J<em>.S.A. </em>22A:2-8 does allow a party entitled to an award or allowance of costs the \u201ccosts of taking depositions when taxable, by order of the court.\u201d However, our case law makes clear that depositions should not be routinely taxed as expenses in every case. <em>Finch, Pruyn &amp; Co. v. Martinelli, supra, see also Sunset Beach Amusement Corp. v. Belk, </em>33 <em>N.J. </em>162, 170, 162 A.2d 834 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">The policy of this State is that litigants bear their own expenses for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, except where specifically authorized by statute, rule, or agreement. <em>Velli v. Rutgers Casualty Ins. Co., supra </em>(257 <em>N.J.Super. </em>308, 608 A.2d 431); <em>Sunset Beach Amusement Corp. v. Belk, supra </em>(33 <em>N.J. </em>162, 162 A.2d 834). Although deposition costs are awardable, they should not be awarded routinely. <em>See Finch, Pruyn &amp; Co. v. Martinelli, supra </em>(108 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 159, 260 A.2d 259); <em>Fagas v. Scott, </em>251 <em>N.J.Super. 169, </em>200, 597 A.2d 571 (Law Div.1991) <em>see also Velli v. Rutgers Casualty Ins. Co., supra </em>(257 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 310, 608 A.2d 431).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Indeed, when depositions are necessary or required, the length of those depositions is largely out of the hands of an opposing litigant. Discovery abuses have led to complaints that excessive depositions have been used to wear down an adversary and discourage a party from asserting a legal claim. <em>See 1996 Report of the Supreme Court Committee on Civil Practice, Comments on Proposed Amendments to R. 4:14-3 and 4:14-4 </em>\u2014 re <em>Depositions, </em>143 N.J.L.J. 625 (Feb. 19, 1996), at Supp. 4-5; <em>2 New Jersey Practice, Court Rules Annotated, </em>Comment on <em>R. </em>4:14-3, at 35 (Ralph N. Del Deo and John H. Klock) (4th ed. Supp.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The remaining issue involves the allowability of experts\u2019 fees and expenses. We need not address whether expert fees might be allowable as reasonable \u201clitigation costs\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:15-59.1a(2) because, aside from any issue of retroactive or prospective application, there is no basis in the record to apply that statute, and neither the judge nor the parties relied on it at the trial level.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We turn then to the other potential bases for authorizing an allowance for expert fees. The fees charged by experts are clearly not taxable costs under <em>N.J.S.A </em>22A:2-8. <em>See Hirsch v. Tushill, Ltd., supra </em>(110 <em>N.J. </em>at 649, 542 A.2d 897); <em>Helton v. Prudential Ins. Co., </em>205 <em>N.J.Super. </em>196, 205, 500 A.2d 717 (App.Div.1985). Expenses for either an expert preparing for trial or obtaining an expert\u2019s report are merely costs incident to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>trial preparation. In the absence of statute or rule, they are part of the expenses that must be borne by every litigant in their own ease. The statute which allows for the taxation of costs does not contemplate the paying of fees or expenses for expert witness preparation, reports and testimony in a civil case. Since this statute is in derogation of the common law, which did not recognize an award of costs, it is strictly construed. <em>Hirsch v. Tushill, Ltd., supra </em>(110 <em>N.J. </em>at 647, 542 A.2d 897).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">The reference in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>22A:2-8 to reimbursement of the \u201clegal fees of witnesses, including mileage for each attendance,\u201d refers to reimbursement for subpoena fees and mileage costs for \u201cattending at court,\u201d N.J.S.A. 22A: 1-4, which are in the usual case relatively minor expenses.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">It is discretionary with the court to allow various reproduction costs, including costs for obtaining copies of certain records. However, in this case the transcript of the motion proceeding reflects that the judge denied the $726.43 for \u201cblow-up\u201d costs paid to Triangle Reprocenter. The order nonetheless contains an award for that cost. Those costs were disallowed by the judge. Thus, that provision in the order appears contrary to the judge\u2019s intent and inadvertent. Accordingly, we vacate that portion of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Reversed, except for the allowance of the copying fee for medical records which is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b576-7\"> The facts and allegations are set out in the trial judge's comprehensive letter opinion dated December 5, 1996.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b579-10\"> This statute was amended effective January 20, 1995, to allow costs to public entities that prevail in defending frivolous lawsuits against their present or former employees in civil actions. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-59.1a(2). That statute is nonetheless inapplicable here as it requires that a judicial determination be made that the nonprevailing party's suit was frivolous. <em>Ibid. </em>Such a determination was not made here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b580-8\"> A survey of other jurisdictions evidences similar authority. In federal court, the decision to impose deposition costs is discretionary with the trial court, although \u201cthere is general agreement that the expenses of a deposition may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>taxed as costs when received in evidence.\" <em>Evans v. Fuller, </em>94 <em>F.R.D. </em>311, 313 (W.D.Ark.1982); <em>see In re Nissan Antitrust Litigation, </em>577 F.2d 910 (5th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 <em>U.S. </em>1072, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>843, 59 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 38 (1979); <em>Harris v.
