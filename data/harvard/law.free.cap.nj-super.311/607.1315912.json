Sanborn installed the engine in a boat which plaintiff already owned. After approximately three to five hours of use, it developed problems of an unknown cause. Plaintiff brought the boat back to Sanborn which, after consulting with Brunswick, agreed to fix the problem. However, plaintiff demanded either a new engine or a refund. When Sanborn refused either to provide plaintiff with a new engine or to refund the purchase price, plaintiff placed the boat in storage. Plaintiff then filed a complaint alleging breach of warranty under the Uniform Commercial Code, violations of the Consumer Fraud Act, <em>N.J.S.A </em>56:8-1 to -47, strict liability in tort, and negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-13\">Prior to trial, plaintiff sought to call Brunswick\u2019s expert witness as a witness in his direct case. Plaintiff\u2019s application was denied. At trial, when plaintiff rested his case, the trial judge granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>defendants\u2019 joint application for a directed verdict pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:37-2 and <em>Rule </em>4:40-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Plaintiff appeals, contending that he did, in fact, prove a <em>prima facie </em>case under each count of his complaint, thus precluding a directed verdict, and that the trial court erred when it barred him from using Brunswick\u2019s expert as a witness in his direct case. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">On July 25,1995, plaintiff took delivery of his boat with the new engine sold to him and installed by Sanborn. On that same date, plaintiff was given a warranty book containing the following conspicuously written engine warranty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-9\">Our obligation under this Warranty shall be limited to repairing a defective part, or at our option, refunding the purchase price or replacing such part or parts as shall be necessary to remedy any malfunction resulting from defects in material or workmanship as covered by this Warranty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">The warranty also conspicuously provided that all incidental or consequential damages were excluded and that there were no warranties of merchantability and fitness. Other implied warranties were limited to the life of the warranty, which was one year from the date of purchase. The warranty also stated: \u201cEngine noise does not necessarily indicate a serious engine problem. If diagnosis indicates a serious internal engine condition which could result in a failure, condition responsible for noise should be corrected under the warranty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">Plaintiff explained at trial that on the date of delivery he drove the boat from the Sanborn location to his home in Point Pleasant. That trip took approximately one hour. Two weeks later, plaintiff took a boat trip with some friends. They traveled one hour to their intended destination. On the return trip, the engine began to make a loud noise. Plaintiff indicated the noise sounded like the engine had no oil. Plaintiff shut the engine down immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-12\">Plaintiff indicated that he opened the hatch and looked for oil on the engine and any parts that might have come loose. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>discovered that the engine did have oil. Based on his prior boating experience and his own experiences working with and repairing engines, he concluded that the noise he heard was \u201cdefinitely in the valve train.\u201d He restarted the engine and proceeded to his home. He estimated that the total use of the new engine was between three and five hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">The following day plaintiff contacted Sanborn. Plaintiff was directed to bring the boat in for inspection. Thereafter, plaintiff was informed by telephone by a Sanborn employee that the \u201cstuds pulled.\u201d When plaintiff returned to Sanborn, he was advised that Sanborn intended to replace the heads.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff informed San-born he did not want the boat repaired. He explained that he had bought a new engine and he wanted a new engine. Plaintiff testified that Sanborn informed him that Brunswick would not replace the engine.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The warranty in this case is permitted under the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-719, <em>supra, </em>because the parties\u2019 intent to limit remedies was \u201cclearly expressed.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-719 cmt. 2. Plaintiff contends that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-608 permitted him to revoke acceptance of the engine because the defect substantially impaired the product\u2019s value to him. Although revocation of acceptance is available to the purchaser of a defective product pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-608, that right does not accrue where, as here, the product is sold with a limitation of remedy. Under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-719(2), plaintiff was not entitled to relief under section 12A:2-608 unless circumstances caused the limited remedy \u201cto fail of its essential purpose.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-719(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">Although the U.C.C. does not explicitly require a buyer of a defective product to allow a seller to \u201ccure\u201d the defect in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>product alter the buyer has accepted it, the warranty in this case, which is permitted under the U.C.C., gave the manufacturer the right to repair or replace at its option. Since plaintiff did not abide by the requirements of the warranty in that he did not allow the manufacturer to use the remedy the warranty permitted, he was not entitled to recovery under his breach of warranty claim. A directed verdict was therefore appropriate. <em>See R. </em>4:37 \u2014 2(b); <em>R. </em>4:40-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-719 specifically permits a warranty contract to limit remedies available to a buyer and to provide that the seller may repair a defective product instead of permitting the buyer to revoke acceptance of a defective product within the scope of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-608. Here, defendants took advantage of <em>N.J.S.A </em>12A:2-719 and provided for remedies in addition to or in substitution for those provided in the U.C.C. \u201cby limiting the buyer\u2019s remedies to ... repair and replacement of non-conforming goods or parts____\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Since the warranty excludes warranties of fitness and merchantability, limits the duration of other implied warranties to one year from the purchase date, and states \u201cour obligation ... <em>shall be limited </em>\u201d to repairing, refunding, or replacing, at the seller\u2019s option, the provision meets the requirements embodied in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-719(l)(b), that the remedy is \u201cexpressly agreed to be exclusive, in which case it is the sole remedy.\u201d (emphasis added)</p>\n<p id=\"AJ0\">We thus conclude that plaintiff had an obligation to allow defendants to try to repair the engine. While defendants did not have the statutory right under the U.C.C. to cure any defect discovered after acceptance of the engine, defendants did have a right to expect plaintiff to comply with the terms of the warranty. Plaintiffs reliance on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-608 is therefore misplaced. The provisions permitting revocation of acceptance are inapplicable where the terms of a warranty limit the purchaser\u2019s remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">Even if <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-608 were applicable, because defendants never had a chance to try to repair the engine, we cannot infer that the defect, although not identified, was serious and incapable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>of repair. Thus, it is not possible to conclude that the defect caused a substantial impairment in value under <em>N.J.S.A </em>12A:2-608(1). <em>See General Motors Acceptance Corp. v. Jankowitz, </em>216 <em>N. J.Super. </em>313, 334, 523 A.2d 695 (App.Div.1987) (\u201cThe buyer has the burden to prove that the revocation was proper and justified, including proof that the breach caused a substantial impairment in the value of the contract to the buyer.\u201d); <em>see also Herbstman v. Eastman Kodak Co., </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>1, 9, 342 A.2d 181 (1975) (\u201cThe requirement that there must be substantial impairment of value before the buyer may revoke acceptance precludes revocation for trivial defects or defects which may be easily corrected.\u201d). Further, defendant\u2019s warranty did not fail of its essential purpose because defendant was not allowed the opportunity to repair the engine. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-719(2); <em>Jankowitz, supra, </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 329, 523 A.2d 695 (\u201c[T]he exclusive remedy of repair and replacement of defective parts fails of its essential purpose if, after numerous attempts to repair, the [boat] did not operate as a new [boat] should free of defects.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Here, the most plaintiff had proven at trial was that the engine made noise and lost power, and that while Sanborn\u2019s mechanics thought the \u201cstuds had backed out,\u201d plaintiffs own examination and that of defendant\u2019s expert showed that that was not the case. Plaintiff did not present any other evidence to show if anything else might have been wrong with the engine. He had not had his own mechanic examine it nor had he attempted to have anyone else determine what was wrong with it. Thus, plaintiff failed to prove a <em>prima facie </em>case that the defect in the engine substantially impaired its value to him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Lee R. Russ, Annotation, <em>What Constitutes \u201cSubstantial Impairment\u201d Entitling Buyer to Revoke His Acceptance of Goods Under U.C.C. \u00a7 2-608(1), 38 A.L.R. </em>5th 191 (1996), discusses what type of evidence a buyer must put forth in order to prove that the non-conformity substantially impaired the value of the item to him or her:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-6\">While no list could be exhaustive of the potential circumstances that may come into play, the considerations tend to include: the nature of the defects; the cost and length of time required for repair; whether past repair attempts have been successful; the degree to which the goods can be used while repairs are attempted; the degree to and ways in which the buyer is inconvenienced by the nonconformities; and the availability and cost of alternative goods pending repair attempts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 223.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Plaintiff simply failed to prove any of these items. Accordingly, a directed verdict was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">TV</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">At trial, plaintiff established that it was defendant Brunswick\u2019s policy not to replace an engine unless it was more than seventy percent defective. Plaintiff contends that Brunswick\u2019s policy violates the Consumer Fraud Act, specifically, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-2.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">We are guided by <em>Kugler v. Romain, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>522, 279 A.2d 640 (1971), in which the Court discussed the concept of unconseionability: \u201cThus we believe that in consumer goods transactions</p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">rejects a tender. Once a buyer accepts a product with a limited warranty, however, he must comply with the warranty before revocation under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-608 is applicable. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>such as those involved in this case, unconscionability must be equated with the concepts of deception, fraud, false pretense, misrepresentation, concealment and the like, which are stamped unlawful under <em>N.J.S.A </em>56:8-2.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 544, 279 A.2d 640. A breach of warranty or breach of contract is not per se unfair or unconscionable and does not alone violate the Consumer Fraud Act. <em>Gennari v. Weichert Co. Realtors, </em>288 <em>N.J.Super. </em>504, 533, 672 A.2d 1190 (App.Div.1996), <em>modified, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>582, 691 A.2d 350 (1997); <em>D\u2019Ercole Sales, Inc. v. Fruehauf Corp., </em>206 <em>N.J.Super. </em>11, 25, 501 A.2d 990 (App.Div.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">The fact that Brunswick has an internal policy determining when it will replace an entire engine cannot equate with an unconscionable business practice. Under its warranty, Brunswick had the right to repair or replace as it chose. It had the discretion to repair when it wished to do so or to replace an entire engine if it elected to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">In <em>D\u2019Ercole Sales, supra, </em>the plaintiff had purchased a tow truck from Fruehauf Corporation, which custom built and assembled the vehicle. Parts of the truck, the chassis, cabin, engine and drive train, had been manufactured by General Motors and purchased from Beyer Brothers, a General Motors dealer. <em>Id. </em>at 13-14, 501 A.2d 990. The tow truck broke down the day it was delivered and several times thereafter even though Beyer Brothers tried to rectify the problem. It was not until four to six weeks later that Beyer Brothers determined that the problem had been caused by Fruehauf. <em>Id. </em>at 14, 501 A.2d 990. But Fruehauf refused to acknowledge any responsibility and would do nothing to rectify the condition. <em>Id. </em>at 17, 501 A.2d 990.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">One of the issues in that case was whether the Consumer Fraud Act applied to the action against Fruehauf. We held that mere breach of warranty would not be sufficient to prove a violation of the Consumer Fraud Statute. <em>Id. </em>at 25, 501 A.2d 990. We also held that Fruehauf s refusal \u201cto honor its warranty and its intransigent and shoddy attitude toward plaintiff\u2019 did not constitute an unconscionable commercial practice. <em>Id. </em>at 28, 501 A.2d 990. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>reaffirmed the concept that \u201cunconscionability must be equated with the concepts of deception, fraud, false pretense, misrepresentation, concealment and the like which are stamped unlawful under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-2.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31, 501 A.2d 990. Fruehaufs disavowal, \u201coffensive though it may be,\u201d was not deplorable enough to constitute an unconscionable commercial practice under the Consumer Fraud Act. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Brunswick\u2019s policy to replace an engine only if more than seventy percent of it needed replacement, but to otherwise repair it pursuant to its limited warranty, is much less reprehensible than Fruehaufs refusal to do anything at all about a problem attributable to the manufacture of its own product. Moreover, the policy was not shown to be deceptive, or to constitute any kind of misrepresentation of the nature prohibited by the Act. Plaintiffs claim under the Consumer Fraud Act was therefore properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">In parts one through four we have fully discussed Points I and II of plaintiffs appeal, which were asserted as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-9\">\n<em>POINT I</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-10\">THE PLAINTIFF PROPERLY REVOKED ACCEPTANCE OF THE ENGINE PURSUANT TO THE UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE AND THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S DISMISSAL OF PLAINTIFF\u2019S BREACH OF WARRANTY CLAIM WAS PLAINLY ERRONEOUS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-11\">\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-12\">DEFENDANT BRUNSWICK\u2019S APPLICATION OF ITS WARRANTY POLICY REGARDING REPLACEMENT OF ENGINES AND REFUNDS TO CONSUMERS IS UNCONSCIONABLE AND VIOLATES THE CONSUMER FRAUD ACT.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-13\">We find that the remainder of plaintiffs points of error are without sufficient merit to warrant discussion in a written opinion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See R. </em>2:11 \u2014 3(e)(1)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b628-8\"> At trial, plaintiff described the head as the \"part that sets over top of the pistons\" and \"a major component of the engine.

As we read <em>Zabriskie, </em>that decision hinged on an application of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-508, as the buyer there had never accepted the automobile, <em>id. </em>at 457-58, 240 A.2d 195, and the decision did not apply <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-608, although this section of the U.C.C. was discussed in the trial court opinion. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-508 provides a statutory right to cure where a buyer</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b631-14\"><em> N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-2 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b631-15\">The act, use or employment by any person of any unconscionable commercial practice, deception, fraud, false pretense, false promise, misrepresentation, or the knowing concealment, suppression, or omission of any material fact with intent that others rely upon such concealment, suppression or omission, in connection with the sale or advertisement of any merchandise or real estate, or with the subsequent performance of such person as aforesaid, whether or not any person has in fact been misled, deceived or damaged thereby, is declared to be an unlawful practice----</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b633-15\"> <em>POINT III</em></p>\n<p id=\"ADq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>SUFFICIENT PROOF WAS PRESENTED AT TRIAL TO SHOW THAT DEFENDANT SANBORN\u2019S CONDUCT VIOLATED THE CONSUMER FRAUD ACT.</p>\n<p id=\"Al6K\">\n<em>POINT IV</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A4fQ\">THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DISMISSING PLAINTIFF\u2019S CAUSE OF ACTION FOR STRICT LIABILITY IN TORT.</p>\n<p id=\"AY9\">\n<em>POINT V</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"APu\">THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY BARRING PLAINTIFF FROM USING DEFENDANT BRUNSWICK\u2019S EXPERT-EMPLOYEE\u2019S OPINIONS.</p>\n<p id=\"AS3\">\n<em>POINT VI</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AMX\">THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY DISMISSING PLAINTIFF'S NEGLIGENCE CLAIM AGAINST DEFENDANT SANBORN.</p>\n<p id=\"AjBK\">\n<em>POINT VII</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AqaF\">THE INTERESTS OF FAIRNESS REQUIRE REASSIGNMENT TO A NEW TRIAL JUDGE ON REMAND.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
