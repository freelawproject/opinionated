On appeal, the question is whether there is a genuine issue of fact as to Ridgewood\u2019s liability for the conduct of its Chief of Police, defendant Louis J. Mader (Chief Mader).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Plaintiff filed a complaint against Ridgewood, Chief Mader, Ridgewood Officers Robert Preston and James Rice, the Bush/ Quayle \u201992 General Committee, Inc. (Committee), and Bush/ Quayle \u201992 General Committee, Inc. member Scott Stephen (Stephen), in January 1995. In his eight count complaint, plaintiff alleges that the defendants deprived him of various constitutional rights in violation of 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985(3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Defendant Ridgewood moved for summary judgment on both the \u00a7 1983 and \u00a7 1985 claims. Judge Doyne heard argument on September 15, 1995, and issued a bench decision on that day. As to the \u00a7 1983 claim, Judge Doyne granted defendant Ridgewood\u2019s motion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-9\">With regard to the application as it relates to the 1983 action, the motion is granted. The municipality cannot be held liable under section 1983 based upon a respondeat superior theory. The plaintiff must establish the governmental policy and its causality to the injury and the constitutional violation. Here, plaintiff has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>failed even to identify the government policy. If the policy is to fail to adequately train, which appears to this court to be an oxymoron, then plaintiff must then show deliberate indifference____ Plaintiff has failed to do so. Accordingly, as it pertains to ... section 1983, defendant\u2019s application is granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">With regard to the \u00a7 1985(3) claim, Judge Doyne denied the motion. Recognizing that there were some factual issues that had to be developed on the conspiracy issue, the judge granted plaintiffs motion to compel discovery regarding the arrangement between Ridgewood and the Committee concerning security at the rally.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">Thereafter, Ridgewood moved for reconsideration of the court\u2019s denial of its motion for summary judgment on the \u00a7 1985 issue. The plaintiff cross-moved for reconsideration of the court\u2019s decision to dismiss the \u00a7 1983 count against Ridgewood.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">On February 28, 1996, Judge Doyne issued a written opinion in which he concluded that \u201cplaintiff has presented no competent evidence of any kind that would allow a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the Village and the Committee conspired to injure him in the manner proscribed by \u00a7 1985(3).\u201d Accordingly, on the \u00a7 1985(3) count, the judge granted summary judgment in favor of defendant Ridgewood. Plaintiffs motion for reconsideration of the September 15 decision was denied. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-12\">On October 22, 1992, the Committee scheduled a rally for then-incumbent President George Bush in support of his bid for reelection. The Committee leased Veteran\u2019s Field in Ridgewood for the event, and President Bush was scheduled to speak at the rally.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-13\">On the morning of the event, Chief Mader met with Committee chairman William Palatucci to discuss the police officers\u2019 role in security for the event. At that time, the two discussed the procedure by which criminal complaints would be filed should the need arise. Palatucci informed Chief Mader that only those members of the Committee who possessed a copy of the lease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>between Ridgewood and the Committee would have authority to sign a criminal complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Plaintiff, who was a registered Democrat and supporter of the challenger, now-President William Clinton, decided to attend. He, along with a friend, went to Veteran\u2019s Field before the expected start time of 3:00 p.m. and acquired tickets to attend the rally.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Plaintiff joined a group of approximately 10-15 people who were also Clinton supporters. According to the plaintiff, the members of the group were holding signs and chanting in support of Clinton. Plaintiff held a sign of his own and chanted along with the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">According to the plaintiff, at some point while the group was standing at the entrance to the field, Chief Mader, along with a Committee member, defendant Stephen, approached the group and had a discussion with other members of the group and then left. Plaintiff testified that he did not overhear what was discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Stephen subsequently approached the group on a few occasions, saying something to the effect, \u201cIf you don\u2019t move, you\u2019re going to be arrested.\u201d Although not aware who Stephen was at the time, plaintiff assumed that Stephen was a staff person because he was wearing buttons to that effect. On one occasion that Stephen addressed the group, plaintiff told Stephen that they were doing nothing wrong, and that \u201che would probably be advised not to continue trying to get (them) to move.\u201d A short time later the group was again approached by Chief Mader and Stephen, and Chief Mader requested that the group move to another location. The group moved without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">At their new location, the group continued to wave their signs and chant. Soon thereafter, the group was once again approached by Chief Mader and Stephen. Plaintiff was informed by other witnesses that there was discussion between Chief Mader and Stephen about the lease. When asked if he had any discussion with Stephen or Chief Mader at this time, plaintiff responded: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>\u201cThere may have been a discussion [but] I can\u2019t recall the substance of it.\u201d In any event, plaintiff overheard Stephen ask Chief Mader to arrest plaintiff, and Chief Mader directed two officers to do so. Plaintiff was arrested but not handcuffed. He was detained for approximately an hour and then released.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trespassing complaint against plaintiff was later voluntarily dismissed by Stephen.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">\n<em>PLAINTIFF\u2019S \u00a7 1983 CLAIM</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">We will assume for the purpose of discussion that plaintiffs arrest was without probable cause because he was not committing a disorderly persons offense in the presence of the arresting officers; that his invalid arrest resulted in an unconstitutional infringement on his freedom of political speech and assembly; and that his incarceration was an unwarranted and unconstitutional infringement of his liberty interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">Section 1983 provides, in relevant part, that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-10\">Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and the laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-11\">[42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1983.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-12\">Prior to 1978, municipalities did not fall within the definition of a \u201cperson\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1983. <em>See Monroe v. Pape, </em>365 <em>U.S. </em>167, 81 <em>S.Ct. </em>473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961). That, however, changed in 1978 with the seminal United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Monell v. Department of Soc. Serv. of the City of New York, </em>436 <em>U.S. </em>658, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>2018, 56 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>611 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>In overruling <em>Monroe, </em>and dismissing the holding in that case as a \u201cdeparture from prior practice,\u201d the Court held that Congress intended for \u201cmunicipalities and other governmental units to be included among those persons to whom \u00a7 1983 applies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 690, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2035, 56 L.Ed.2d at 635. In recognizing municipal liability under the statute, however, the Court prohibited the imposition of liability on the theory of <em>respondeat superior. Id. </em>at 694-95, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2037-38, 56 L.Ed.2d at 637-38. Rather, the Court held that liability may only attach to a governmental entity where the plaintiff proves that some governmental policy or custom caused their injury. It is only where the execution of the governmental policy or custom is the \u201cmoving force of the constitutional violation\u201d where the public entity may be liable under \u00a7 1983. <em>Id. </em>at 694-95, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2038, 56 L.Ed.2d at 638.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Following <em>Monell, </em>it was clearly understood that formal, adopted legislative policy of a local government could potentially expose the governing body to liability under \u00a7 1983. However, because the Court never reached the issue of what other informal, unadopted acts of government officials may constitute \u201cmunicipal policy,\u201d <em>see id. </em>at 695, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2038, 56 L.Ed.2d at 638, lower courts struggled with the task of determining when a <em>de facto </em>\u201cpolicy\u201d or \u201ccustom\u201d existed, and \u201cwhose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy.\u201d <em>See </em>Colleen R. Courtade, Annotation, <em>What Constitutes Policy or Custom for Purposes of Determining Liability of Local Government Unit under b2 U.S.C.A \u00a7 1983 </em>\u2014 Modern <em>Cases, </em>81 A.L.R.Fed. 549, 557 (1987). Needless to say, this uncertainty produced mixed results in the lower courts. <em>Id. </em>at 558.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">In <em>Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>469, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1292, 89 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 452 (1986), the Supreme Court attempted to define the contours of public entity liability under \u00a7 1983. There, the Court recognized that a governmental \u201cpolicy\u201d may be advanced through a \u201csingle decision\u201d of a policymaking official. <em>Id. </em>at 480, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1298, 89 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>In <em>Pembcmr, </em>the plaintiffs \u00a7 1983 action arose from an instance in which law enforcement officials, at the direction of the county prosecutor, were instructed to forcibly break into the plaintiffs clinic to execute a capias.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 472-74, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1293-94, 89 L.Ed.2d at 458-59. Plaintiff subsequently brought a \u00a7 1983 action against the City of Cincinnati, the County of Hamilton, and others for alleged violations of his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. <em>Id. </em>at 474, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1292, 89 <em>L.Ed.2A </em>at 459. The district court dismissed plaintiffs complaint against the city and county on the basis that the officers were not acting pursuant to the kind of \u201cofficial policy\u201d necessary to trigger liability under <em>Monell. Id. </em>at 475, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1296, 89 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 460. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">In reversing the decision of the lower courts, the Supreme Court recognized that \u201cmunicipal liability may be imposed for a single decision by municipal policymakers under appropriate circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 480, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1298, 89 L.Ed.2d at 463. Thus, where the \u201cacts or edicts [of a municipal official] may fairly be said to represent official policy,\u201d such decisions may give rise to municipal liability under \u00a7 1983. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">In reaching this decision, however, the <em>Pembaur </em>Court emphasized that \u201cnot every decision by municipal officers automatically subjects the municipality to \u00a7 1983 liability\u201d and, further, that liability will not be imposed, pursuant to <em>Monell, </em>based simply on a theory of <em>respondeat superior. Id. </em>at 481, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1299, 89 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d at 464. \u201c[O]nly where ... a deliberate choice to follow a course of action is made from among various alternatives by <em>the official or officials responsible for establishing final policy with respect to the subject matter\u201d </em>will liability attach to the municipality. <em>Id. </em>at 483, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1300, 89 L.Ed.2d at 465 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>(emphasis added). Thus, in order for liability to be imposed against a municipality under \u00a7 1983, the plaintiff carries the burden of demonstrating the existence of a particular municipal policy or custom, and further proving that such policy subjected or caused him to be subjected to constitutional injury. <em>See City of Oklahoma v. Tuttle, </em>471 <em>U.S. </em>808, 829-30, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>2427, 2439, 85 L.Ed.2d 791, 807-08 (1985) (Brennan, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Against this backdrop, we examine plaintiff\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action. Plaintiff offers eleven municipal \u201cpolicies\u201d that he claims were created by Chief Mader\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-6\">(a) The policy of allowing Chief Mader to conspire and agree with William Palatucci, Executive Director ... [of the Committee], to prohibit the exercise of free speech by Democrats and by supporters of Bill Clinton, the Democratic candidate for President.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-7\">(b) The policy of prohibiting the exercise of freedom of speech on public property by Democrats and by supporters of Bill Clinton, the Democratic candidate for President.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-8\">(c) The policy of preventing by force, intimidation or threat, any citizen who is lawfully entitled to vote from giving his support or advocacy in a legal manner toward or in favor of electors supporting Bill Clinton, the Democratic candidate for President.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-9\">(d) The policy of allowing Chief Mader to conspire and agree with William Palatucci... to prohibit the exercise of the right to peaceable assemble with others by Democrats and by supporters of Bill Clinton, the Democratic candidate for President.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-10\">(e) The policy of prohibiting the exercise of the right to peaceable assembly with others on public property by Democrats and supporters of Bill Clinton, the Democratic candidate for President.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-11\">(f) The policy of allowing Chief Mader to conspire and agree with William Palatucci ... to prohibit the exercise of their right to be secure in their persons against unreasonable searches and seizures by Democrats and supporters of Bill Clinton, the Democratic candidate for President.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-12\">(g) The policy of prohibiting the exercise of their right to be secure in their persons against unreasonable seizures on public property by Democrats and supporters of Bill Clinton, the Democratic candidate for President.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-13\">(h) The policy of allowing Chief Mader to conspire and agree with William Palatucci ... to prohibit the exercise of their right not to be deprived of their liberty without due process of law by Democrats and supporters of Bill Clinton, the Democratic candidate for President.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-14\">(i) The policy of prohibiting the exercise of their right not to be deprived of their liberty without due process of law by Democrats and supporters of Bill Clinton, the Democratic candidate for President.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>\u00a9 The policy of deliberately failing to train its police in the proper protection of the constitutional rights of persons who would attend or attempt to attend the Bush Rally and express his/her pro-Democratic, pro-Clinton ideas and preferences,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANP\">(k) The policy of failing to adequately train, instruct and supervise the members of its police department [i.e., Mader, Preston and Rice] regarding the making of arrests. This policy equates to a policy of deliberate indifference to safety, lives and liberty of persons, such as Plaintiff, in the Village of Ridgewood.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">In response to these claims, Ridgewood argues that these alleged \u201cpolicies,\u201d presented in plaintiffs amended answers to interrogatories, were not raised by plaintiff until after Judge Doyne granted summary judgment. We need not resolve this factual dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Claims b, c, e, g, and i essentially allege that Ridgewood had a policy of depriving Democrats of their rights to due process, free speech, freedom of assembly, freedom to be secure in their persons without unreasonable searches and seizures, and by preventing Democrats from supporting or advocating a candidate. Aside from those bare allegations, the plaintiff simply offers no proof whatsoever to support the allegation that there was a municipal policy in Ridgewood to suppress the beliefs of Democrats. Such a policy cannot be inferred from plaintiffs arrest itself. This is particularly so when one considers the fact that plaintiff was the only person among 15-20 Democratic, pro-Clinton supporters to be arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">As to the remainder of plaintiffs claims which essentially contend that Chief Mader created policy through his discussion with Palatucci on the morning of the rally on how to handle criminal complaints, as well as his claim of inadequate training, in-depth discussion is required. Despite Ridgewood\u2019s contention, both issues were raised by plaintiff prior to the summary judgment decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">Plaintiff alleges that the conversation between Chief Mader and Palatucci constituted the development of a municipal policy, through Chief Mader, by which officers at the rally would handle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>criminal complaints. It is alleged by plaintiff that the policy established by Chief Mader was that so long as the person filing the complaint possessed a copy of the lease, Chief Mader would order the person to be arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">It is conceded by the defense that Mader was a policymaking official in Ridgewood. This fact, alone, however, is not enough for a \u201csingle decision\u201d by that official to create municipal policy. As the Court expressly recognized in <em>Pembaur,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-5\">The fact that a particular official' \u2014 even a policymaking official \u2014 has discretion in the exercise of particular functions does not, without more, give rise to municipal liability based on an exercise of that discretion. The official must also be responsible for establishing <em>final government policy respecting such activity before the municipality can be held liable. </em>Authority to make municipal policy may be granted directly by a legislative enactment or may be delegated by an official who possesses such authority, and of course <em>whether an official had final policymaking authority is a question of state law.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">[475 <em>U.S. </em>at 481-83, 106 <em>S.Ct </em>at 1299-1300, 89 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 46-65 (Brennan, J.) (plurality opinion).] <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">While this particular point in <em>Pembaur </em>only garnered support from a plurality of the Court, later decisions of the Court have recognized this principle as a requisite for the imposition of municipal liability. <em>See, e.g., Board of County Comm\u2019rs v. Brown, </em>520 <em>U.S. </em>397, \u2014, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>1382, 1390, 137 L.Ed.2d 626, 639 (1997); <em>Jett v. Dallas Ind. School Dist. </em>491 <em>U.S. </em>701, 737, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>2702, 2724, <em>105 L.Ed.2d </em>598, 627-28 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">Thus, even though Chief Mader was a policymaking official in Ridgewood, this does not mean that he had the authority to implement the policy relevant to plaintiffs claim. While it is true that ease law has recognized that a police chief, under certain circumstances, is the final authority representing official police policy, <em>see Black v. Stephens, </em>662 F.2d 181, 191 (3d Cir.1981), plaintiff fails to address the fact that the Bergen County Prosecutor in this case established a police procedure to effect the arrest of trespassers. It has long been recognized in this state, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>both our statutory and case law, that the county prosecutor is the foremost representative of the executive branch of government in law enforcement in his county and is responsible for local law enforcement authorities functioning within his county. <em>State v. Winne, </em>12 <em>N.J. </em>152, 96 A.2d 63 (1953); <em>see also N.J.S.A. </em>2A:158-5. As the <em>Winne </em>Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-6\">It is a matter of common knowledge that the local law enforcement authorities from the chanceman on his beat to the chief of police and beyond him to the director of public safety are responsive to the county prosecutor\u2019s concept of law enforcement on pain of possible indictment if they do not cooperate with him in enforcing the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 168, 96 A.2d 63.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">That is not to say that the municipality has no authority over the Chief of Police, or that he, in turn, has no authority to make policy. As both <em>Winne </em>and <em>Pembaur </em>acknowledge, policymaking functions may be separate or shared when it comes to law enforcement. <em>Winne, supra, </em>12 <em>N.J. </em>at 168, 96 A.2d 63; <em>Pembaur, supra, </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>at 484, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1301, 89 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 466. The point to be made, however, is that the inquiry must be sharply focused to determine what function exercised by the Chief of Police in this case caused the violation of plaintiffs constitutional rights, and who had the ultimate policymaking power with respect to that function. In this case, the Chief of Police was exercising the power of arrest without a warrant for a disorderly persons violation. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>2C:18-3. The critical question to be answered is whether Chief Mader had the ultimate policymaking authority with respect to that determination so as to have made it on behalf of Ridgewood.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">Municipal authority to hire a Chief of Police is conferred by statute. <em>N.J.SA </em>40A:14-118. When that authority is exercised, the Chief of Police \u201cshall be the head of the police force and ... shall be directly responsible to the appropriate authority for the efficiency and routine day to day operations thereof.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In that context, the Chief of Police has the power to \u201cenforce rules and regulations ... for the disposition and discipline of the force; ... [prescribe the duties and assignments of all subordinates ...; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>[d]elegate ... authority as he may deem necessary for the efficient operation of the force to be exercised under his direction and supervision; and ... [r]eport at least monthly to the appropriate authority in such form as shall be prescribed by such authority on the operation of the force during the preceding month.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>40A:14-118(a), (c), (d) and (e). The Chief of Police may also exercise the same police power as his subordinate officers. <em>N.J.S.A </em>40A:14-118(b). '</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">While this statute serves to \u201cavoid undue interference by a governing body into the operation of the police force,\u201d it also serves to define the sphere of the municipality\u2019s power in matters concerning the police department and the Chief of Police. <em>Falcone v. De Furia, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>219, 222, 510 A.2d 1174 (1986). To the extent that Chief Mader had policymaking authority sufficient to bind Ridgewood, his authority in that respect could not be greater than Ridgewood\u2019s. And as to Ridgewood\u2019s authority, there is nothing in the provisions of the forgoing statute suggesting, no less specifically stating, that the municipality has the authority to make law enforcement policy with respect to effecting arrests, obtaining search warrants, or the like. That power resides in the prosecutor pursuant to statute and ease law. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:158-5; <em>State v. Winne, supra. </em>So important is the prosecutor\u2019s role in law enforcement that, even where the municipality is exercising its control over the Chief of Police under the statute, the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cinterest in the relationship between the governing body and the Chief of Police\u201d is of sufficient importance to give the prosecutor standing in litigation between the Chief and the municipality. <em>Falcone, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 226, 510 A.2d 1174.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Indeed, at oral argument before us, plaintiff acknowledged that Ridgewood could not effectuate a law enforcement policy that was contrary to a policy established by the Bergen County Prosecutor. Thus, it is no wonder that, in answers to interrogatories propounded by plaintiff inquiring as to policies in effect at the time of the incident, Chief Mader referred plaintiff to the \u201cLaw Enforcement Policies and Procedural Manual\u201d maintained by the Bergen Coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>ty Prosecutor\u2019s Office. Specifically, Ridgewood provided a copy of an excerpt from the Bergen County Manual entitled, <em>\u201cCommentary, A. Arrests; B. Warrantless Searches; 1. Warrant Not Required for an Arrest in a Public Place.\u201d </em>That excerpt provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-6\">A police officer has authority to arrest a suspect in a public place without a warrant if he has probable cause to believe that the suspect has committed a crime (a common law felony), even if the crime was not committed in his presence---- By this standard, crimes under the New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice of the first, second, third and fourth degrees are the equivalent of \u201cfelonies,\u201d while disorderly persons and motor vehicle offenses are not____ <em>If the offense committed by the suspect is only a disorderly persons or a motor vehicle offense, then, unless it is committed in the officer\u2019s presence or admitted to by the suspect, an arrest may not be made without a warrant, </em>(emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">Also included with this excerpt was a copy of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:18-3, stating that unless a trespass is committed in a dwelling, which would be a fourth degree crime, the crime is a disorderly persons offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">Thus, to the extent that the policy for arresting trespassers is set forth in a manual promulgated by the Bergen County Prosecutor regarding law enforcement policies and procedures, and our State law clearly holds that municipal authority is inferior to that of the county prosecutor in such matters, <em>see Winne, supra, </em>Ridgewood did not have any policymaking authority in the context of this case. Therefore, Chief Mader could not have been acting for Ridgewood in that respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-13\">Based on our review of the record, there is no indication that Chief Mader ever discussed with Palatucci the manner in which these persons would be dealt with once a complaint was filed. Furthermore, even if he did, as noted above, in light of the fact that there was a county policy in effect regarding how persons charged with disorderly persons offenses would be handled, neither he nor Ridgewood had the \u201cfinal\u201d policymaking authority with respect to such procedure. <em>Pembaur, supra, </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>at 483, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1300, 89 L.Ed.2d at 465. Thus, the only issue that may have arisen from the conversation between Chief Mader and Palatucci, and Chief Mader\u2019s subsequent action in arresting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>plaintiff, is whether Chief Mader wilfully or negligently misapplied then-existing county policy on how to handle a criminal complaint for a disorderly persons violation. This is an issue, however, that relates to Chief Mader\u2019s individual liability, not the municipality\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Because the plaintiff has failed to establish a municipal policy in this regard, his reliance on <em>Pembaur, supra, Black v. Stephens, supra, </em>and <em>Bartholomew v. Fischl, </em>782 <em>F.2d </em>1148 (3d Cir.1986) is misplaced. In those decisions, the local governmental policymaking official had \u201cfinal policymaking authority\u201d with regard to the particular action that subjected the plaintiff to constitutional injury. For example, in <em>Pembaur </em>it was determined that the county prosecutor was in fact the final policymaking official with regard to the manner and procedure that officials were to follow in effecting arrests. 475 <em>U.S. </em>at 484-85, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1300-01, 89 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 465-66. Similarly, in <em>Bartholomew </em>the plaintiff brought an action against the City of Allentown for his unlawful termination. In reversing a dismissal of the plaintiffs complaint, the Third Circuit found that Fischl, among other Allentown officials, was a municipal policymaking official with the authority to terminate the plaintiffs position. 782 F.2d at 1152-53. Thus, because plaintiffs position was terminated by allegedly unlawful motivations of Fischl and others, plaintiff had established a municipal policy that could give rise to municipal liability. <em>Ibid. </em>Likewise, in <em>Black </em>it was established that the chief of police represented official policy concerning <em>disciplinary </em>matters which proximately caused the plaintiffs injuries in that case. 662 F.2d at 191 (emphasis added); <em>cf. N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-118(a). Unlike these cases, the plaintiff here, while establishing that Chief Mader had a limited policymaking role, has not demonstrated that Chief Mader had any final policymaking authority with regard to plaintiffs alleged constitutional injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Plaintiff argues in the alternative that Ridgewood failed to adequately train its officers to safeguard the interests of Demo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>crats in Ridgewood. According to the plaintiff, \u201c[a] (Ridgewood) official had to know and to have anticipated that at least some persons that were Democrats, not Republicans, ... were going to avail themselves of the opportunity to attend the rally and express their ideas and principles in a peaceful manner.\u201d It is plaintiffs contention that it was Ridgewood\u2019s failure to train its officers to safeguard the constitutional rights of Democrats that caused him harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">In <em>City of Canton v. Harris, </em>489 <em>U.S. </em>378, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>1197, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (1989), the Supreme Court set forth the standard upon which courts should analyze \u201cfailure to train\u201d claims. There, the Court was reviewing a claim that the inadequate training of prison officials led to a violation of a detainee\u2019s constitutional rights. In setting forth the standard, the Court specifically held that mere negligence on the part of the official would not suffice; rather, a plaintiff trying to establish municipal liability on this basis must show that the municipal action taken, either officially adopted by the governing body or through a policymaking official, was with \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to the action\u2019s known or obvious consequences. <em>Id. </em>at 388, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1204, 103 L.Ed.2d at 426. Recognizing that a \u201cfailure to provide proper training may fairly be said to represent a policy for which the city is responsible,\u201d the Court noted that such a claim will only be tenable in the \u201climited circumstances\u201d where \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d is proven. <em>Id. </em>at 387-91,109 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1204-06, 103 L.Ed.2d at 425-28. The fact that a program is negligently administered or that an officer makes a mistake is not enough to establish municipal liability. <em>Id. </em>at 391, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1206, 103 L.Ed.2d at 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">In its recent decision in <em>Board of the County Comm\u2019rs of Bryan County v. Brown, </em>520 <em>U.S. </em>397, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>1382, 137 L.Ed.2d 626 (1997), the Court, in analyzing the decision in <em>Canton, </em>explained that \u2018\u201cdeliberate indifference\u2019 is a stringent standard of fault, requiring proof that a municipal actor disregarded a known or obvious consequence of his action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u2014, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1391, 137 L.Ed.2d at 643. Again reiterating the limited nature of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>this cause of action, the Court stated that, \u201cevidence of a single violation of federal rights, accompanied by a showing that a municipality has failed to train' its employees <em>to handle recurring situations preventing an obvious potential for such a violation, </em>could trigger municipal liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u2014, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1391, 137 L.Ed.2d at 642 (emphasis added). Thus, to state a cause of action under \u00a7 1983 on a failure to train theory, a plaintiff must show that, prior to the alleged injury, the municipality, through its policymaking official in charge of training, was put on notice of the likelihood of injury. <em>Id. </em>at \u2014, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1390, 137 L.Ed.2d at 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">In the present case, the plaintiff has failed to meet this stringent burden of proof. Although it is conceded that Chief Mader, as Chief of the Ridgewood Police Department, is a municipal policymaker and, assuming for the sake of discussion, that he was the official responsible for making policy with regard to police training, there is nothing in the record from which the court can impute prior knowledge or deliberate indifference to plaintiff\u2019s rights. While plaintiff makes the broad accusation that Ridge-wood is \u201cRepublican country\u201d and that \u201cDemocrats have to walk gingerly along Republican streets,\u201d plaintiff fails to point to one incident in which Democrats were the target of official misconduct. Plaintiff\u2019s allegation that the mere fact that there was a Republican rally should have put Chief Mader on notice to train officers to safeguard the constitutional rights of Democrats hardly meets the stringent requirements of <em>Canton </em>and <em>Brown.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">Furthermore, not only does plaintiff fail to demonstrate that Ridgewood was on notice of potential injury, but also plaintiff has failed to adduce evidence showing that the alleged inadequacies in the police training resulted from a conscious choice, or, in other words, a \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to the rights of Democrats. As Justice Brennan noted in <em>Pembaur, supra, </em>the type of \u201cpolicy\u201d which gives rise to municipal liability under \u00a7 1983 is where a \u201cdeliberate choice to follow a course of action is made from among various alternatives.\u201d 475 <em>U.S. </em>at 483, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1300, 89 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number><em>L.Ed. </em>2d at 465. Plaintiff has simply offered no basis to support the conclusion that Mader, as Ridgewood\u2019s policymaker with regard to police training, had an intent to suppress the views of Democrats.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">\n<em>PLAINTIFF\u2019S \u00a7 1985(3) CLAIM</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A_5\">42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1985(3) provide that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-8\">If two or more persons in any State or Territory conspire or go in disguise on the highway or on the premises of another, for the purpose of depriving, either directly or indirectly, any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws, or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws; or for the purpose of preventing or hindering the constituted authorities of any State or Territory from giving or securing to all persons within such State or Territory the equal protection of the laws; or if two or more persons conspire to prevent by force, intimidation, or threat, any citizen who is lawfully entitled to vote, from giving his support or advocacy in a legal manner, toward or in favor of the election of any lawfully qualified person as an elector for President or Vice President, or as a Member of Congress of the United States; or to injure any citizen in person or property on account of such support or advocacy; in any case of conspiracy set forth in this section, if one or more persons engaged therein do, or cause to be done, any act in furtherance of the object of such conspiracy, whereby another is injured in his person or property, or deprived of having and exercising any right or privilege of a citizen of the United States, the party so injured or deprived may have an action for the recovery of damages occasioned by such injury or deprivation, against any one or more of the conspirators.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">Plaintiff here alleges that Judge Doyne improperly granted Ridge-wood\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the \u00a7 1985(3) count, alleging that he satisfied the requirements of a claim under both the first and third clauses of \u00a7 1985(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">As Judge Doyne recognized, there is no need to analyze the particulars of plaintiffs \u00a7 1985(3) claim, because, as noted above, the plaintiff has failed to establish that a municipal \u201cpolicy\u201d subjected him to constitutional injury. As the Third Circuit recognized in <em>Mody v. City of Hoboken, </em>959 <em>F.</em>2d 461, 466 (3d Cir.1992), the success of both a \u00a7 1983 action and a \u00a7 1985(3) action requires the plaintiff to prove causation between a discriminatory municipal policy and the alleged injury. Thus, the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>tiffs failure to demonstrate a municipal policy in the first instance bars his recovery under both \u00a7 1983 and \u00a7 1985(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b536-10\"> All defendants, except Ridgewood, settled with plaintiff and do not participate in this appeal.
