He was charged with murder, unlawful possession of a handgun without a permit, and possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose. After a hearing lasting several days in March 1995, the Chancery Division, Family Part, waived jurisdiction to the Law Division, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4a-26. A jury convicted defendant of reckless manslaughter, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11 \u2014 4(b)(1), as a lesser included offense of murder. The jury also convicted defendant of unlawful possession of a handgun without a permit, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-5(b), and acquitted him of possession for an unlawful purpose, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-4(a). Defendant received a seven year sentence with a three year period of parole ineligibility on the manslaughter conviction and a concurrent four year term on the possession offense. On this appeal, defendant makes the following arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>POINT I THE PROSECUTOR FAILED TO DISCLOSE EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE PURSUANT TO BRADY V.

The judge applied the correct standards under <em>State v. Scott, </em>141 <em>N.J. 457, </em>661 A.2d 1288 (1995) and <em>State v. R.G.D., </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>1, 527 A.2d 834 (1987), applying N.J.S.A 2A:4A-26a. <em>See also State v. Onque, </em>290 <em>N.J.Super. </em>578, 676 A.2d 560 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>497, 683 A.2d 200 (1996). While our decision might have been different with respect to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>probability of rehabilitation before age nineteen,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> there was sufficient credible evidence to support the judge\u2019s determination, and we do not find it to be such a \u201cclear error of judgment [as to] shockf ] the judicial conscience.\u201d <em>State v. Scott, supra, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>at 467, 661 A.2d 1288.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">However, after a thorough review of the record and the arguments submitted, as well as the applicable law, we are convinced that plain error in the jury charge, though not raised by defendant on appeal, nevertheless requires us to reverse defendant\u2019s conviction of reckless manslaughter. Because that error does not affect the guilty verdict for unlawful possession, we affirm that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Many of the facts are not in dispute. On the evening of May 10, 1993, Ronald Sexton and Alquadir Matthews, who had been friends and neighbors for several years on Fairmount Avenue in Newark, were standing on the sidewalk near a house owned by defendant\u2019s mother. At some point the boys walked to a nearby vacant lot, where they both handled a handgun. As we will discuss below, the jury did not hear that the gun was registered to Matthews\u2019 grandmother, with whom he lived. Matthews assured Sexton that the gun was not loaded. Matthews repeated that assurance after Sexton asked whether he was \u201csure.\u201d Sexton pulled the trigger. The gun fired one bullet that hit Matthews. After the shot, each boy ran off. Matthews ran to his grandmoth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>er\u2019s apartment, where he collapsed. An ambulance soon arrived and took him to the hospital, and he died soon after. Sexton ran to his sister\u2019s apartment in the three-family house owned by his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Later that night Sexton left his sister\u2019s apartment, returning to rented quarters in Montclair where he and his mother resided and from which he attended school. The next day, Sexton went to stay with his father in Philadelphia. There is contradictory evidence as to precisely when Sexton realized that Matthews had been shot, and when he learned that Matthews had died. In any event, defendant remained in Philadelphia with his father for eight months, long after learning of Matthews\u2019 death and after learning that the police were looking for him. Apparently his father advised him not to return to New Jersey. In January 1994, one of Sexton\u2019s uncles accompanied him to turn himself in to the police in Philadelphia.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">The primary issue for the jury was whether this shooting was the result of a tragic accident, or whether defendant acted recklessly and therefore was guilty of manslaughter. It is with those factual and legal questions in mind that we address defendant\u2019s arguments on appeal, for the context is critical to our conclusions. At trial, as on appeal, the defense theory of the case was that at the time of the shooting, Sexton was under a reasonable though mistaken belief that the gun was not loaded. <em>See Wilson v. Tard, </em>593 <em>F.Supp. </em>1091 (D.N.J.1984). In <em>Wilson, </em>defendant\u2019s conviction of reckless manslaughter was reversed because the jury had not been charged that the State carried the burden of refuting the defense of mistake of fact. Although the State seeks to distinguish <em>Wilson v. Tard </em>on the facts, we find those facts to be on all fours with this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">In <em>Wilson </em>the defendant claimed that he aimed the gun at the victim only to frighten him, and that he had first removed the magazine of bullets. He claimed he was unaware that one bullet remained in the chamber when he fired the gun. The victim was killed. Wilson argued that his mistaken but reasonable belief that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>the gun was unloaded negated the recklessness necessary for a manslaughter conviction. The District Court Judge, applying New Jersey law, agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Here defendant\u2019s argument is even stronger. Sexton testified that Matthews invited him to the empty lot in order to show him \u201csomething.\u201d The something turned out to be the handgun. According to Sexton, the following exchange ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-7\">Q. Now when you were talking to Alquadir Matthews, tell us what he said to you and what you said to him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-8\">A. He told me he wanted to show me something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-9\">Q. Where was he when he said that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-10\">A. We was walking \u2014 we was walking towards the lot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-11\">Q. Did he show you anything while you were walking?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-12\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-13\">Q. Where were you when he \u2014 did he show you something?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-14\">A. Yes. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-15\">Q. Where were you when he showed you something?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-16\">A. In the lot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-17\">Q. And what did he show you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-18\">A. A gun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-19\">Q. Did he say anything about that gun?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-20\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-21\">Q. What did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-22\">A. <em>He told me the gun was empty.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-23\">Q. <em>What did you say?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-24\">A. <em>And I asked him. was he sure.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-25\">Q. <em>What did he say?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-26\">A <em>He said yes.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-27\">Q. And at that time where was the gun?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-28\">A In his hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-29\">Q. What, if anything, happened after he told you that there was no bullets in the gun \u2014 the conversation \u2014 what happened to the gun?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-30\">A Then he asked me would I like to see it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-31\">Q. And what did you say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-32\">A I told him yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-33\">Q. And what happened to the gun then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-34\">A I took the gun and was looking at it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-35\">[Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Detective Gary Prystauk, a firearms examiner for the Newark Police Department Ballistics Laboratory, testified with respect to the gun that was recovered. According to him, the weapon\u2019s sealed chamber design required a person to pull the slide back in order to see whether a bullet was chambered. Detective Prystauk agreed that an inexperienced person easily might assume that once the magazine had been removed, no bullet remained in the chamber. In fact the gun can hold a chambered bullet with or without the magazine in place.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">The only other evidence of the conversation between Matthews and Sexton came from Shakirah Jones. Jones was the same age as Sexton and lived in the neighborhood, although she did not really know him. Her testimony was somewhat inconsistent, especially in light of several prior statements she had given and variously recanted. We also note substantial leading by the assistant prosecutor, although without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Jones testified that she was out on Fairmount Avenue with some other girls on the evening of the shooting, and that she saw and heard Ronald Sexton and Alquadir Matthews on the sidewalk arguing about their dogs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-8\">Q. Right before the shooting took place, did something happen that caught your attention?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-10\">A. Just some argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-11\">Q. Arguing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-12\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-13\">Q. Who was arguing? Who did you notice arguing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-14\">A. Ron and Quadir [Alquadir Matthews],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-15\">Q. Ron and Quadir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-16\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-17\">Q. Now what could you hear what they were arguing about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9\">A, Dogs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Q. Dogs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-6\">A. A dog fight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-7\">Q. And what do you recall hearing them saying to each other, if anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-8\">A. Quadir was talking about a dog fight. Ron didn\u2019t want to hear it. So he told him to leave him alone and stop playing. He didn\u2019t want to hear it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-9\">So Quadir kept talking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-10\">Q. What was Quadir saying about the dog fight?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-11\">A. I don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-12\">Q. Ron didn\u2019t want to hear it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-13\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-14\">Q. Okay. And what \u2014 Quadir kept on talking about it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-15\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-16\">At that point, according to Jones, the boys went into the lot where she claimed to be able to see them. However, she did not see the shooting. She only heard a shot. She then saw Sexton throw the gun, and each of the boys ran off in a different direction. Earlier she had testified that she saw Sexton with the gun as the boys walked into the lot. Her testimony continued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-17\">Q. And then what happened? Did you see him? What did you see, if anything, he do with the gun?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-18\">A. I didn\u2019t see him \u2014 what he did with it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-19\">All \u2014 only thing I seen was when they were talking he said \u2014 Ron said to Quadir: So you think there are no bullets in this gun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-20\">And Quadir said: There is no bullets in this gun. And then that is when I heard the shot but I didn\u2019t see it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-21\">He \u2014 and they all ran out of the lot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-22\">Q. You heard Ron say: You think there are no bullets in the gun?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-23\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-24\">Q. What did Quadir say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-25\">A There are no bullets in the gun. Stop playing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-26\">Q. Quadir said: There are no bullets in that gun. Stop playing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-27\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-28\">Q. And then if you didn\u2019t see the shooting you just heard the shot?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-29\">A. I heard the shot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-30\">Q. How many shots did you hear?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-31\">A One.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-32\">According to Jones, after defendant threw away the gun, a third boy kicked the gun under a car, and later led police to the spot where they found the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>With the significance of the mistake of fact defense in mind, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-4(a)(l), we address defendant\u2019s arguments in Points I and II that the omitted evidence of the gun\u2019s ownership was material. Defendant claims that the State violated its obligation under <em>Brady v. </em>Maryland<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by failing to provide defendant with the identity of the gun owner, and that Sexton was denied effective assistance of counsel by his trial attorney\u2019s failure to request that information from the prosecutor. Neither claim was raised below, and.we therefore address both according to the plain error standard. <em>R. </em>2:10-2. The State contends that it had no obligation under <em>Brady </em>to determine and provide defendant with the identity of the gun\u2019s owner; that defense counsel was on notice, at least as of the date of the waiver hearing, that the gun may have belonged to Matthews\u2019 grandmother; that he could have sought confirmation of that information;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that in any case, ownership of the gun was not material to the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Evidence that the gun was registered to Matthews\u2019 grandmother, which the jury never heard, would have corroborated Sexton\u2019s testimony that Matthews brought the gun to the scene and offered to show it to Sexton; that Sexton actually relied upon Matthews\u2019 telling him that the gun was not loaded; and that it was reasonable for Sexton to do so. It was certainly material for the jury to hear corroboration of defendant\u2019s testimony. Such evidence could have negated the inference that Sexton knew or should have known the gun was loaded, or even that he was the kind of young person who carried a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">The State argues that it would only be material for the jury to know the ownership of the gun if there were also evidence that Sexton himself knew the ownership of the gun. We disagree. It was enough that defendant knew that Matthews brought the gun. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Lack of materiality is belied by the assistant prosecutor\u2019s argument in summation that it was an intentional shooting and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AR\">the defendant, I submit to you, this was his gun. He knew how to use it and he knew how to get it prepared, ready to fire. And he was the one who did that because it flies in the face of common sense that the victim would have handed him something just ready to go off like that----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The State must have known the gun was not stolen, as defendant was never charged with receiving stolen property.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">Irrespective of whether this situation constitutes a <em>Brady </em>violation, it certainly contributed to depriving defendant of a fair trial. In light of our determination with respect to the jury charge, we need not decide the <em>Brady </em>question here, nor whether the omitted evidence alone would require a new trial. It is plain, however, that the information was material, and that the State argued that the gun belonged to the defendant with actual knowledge or reason to know that it did not. That is prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">In addition, defense counsel\u2019s failure to pursue the same information and to offer it at trial, under the circumstances of this case, constituted ineffective assistance of counsel with a real potential for producing an unjust result. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>668, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <em>State v. Fritz, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>42, 519 A.2d 336 (1987). We see no reason to defer that finding to an application for post conviction relief. <em>Compare State v. Preciose, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>451, 609 A.2d 1280 (1992). Because defendant is entitled to a new trial, we trust the errors of both the State and the defense with respect to the gun\u2019s ownership will be corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">We now address errors in the jury charge, which compel reversal. First, the trial judge denied defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal on the murder charge, despite the absence of evidence that defendant intended to kill or seriously injure Matthews. Although the jury acquitted defendant of murder, the unwarranted charge had a potential for leading the jury to a compromise verdict on reckless manslaughter instead of acquitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>him entirely. <em>See State v. Christener, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>55, 362 A.2d 1153 (1976).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-6\">On the record in this case, there was a real possibility that the jury could have found the defendant not guilty. Hence, the possibility that the jury, in the absence of sufficient evidence to sustain a first degree murder charge, may have reached a compromise verdict suggests that Christener may have suffered prejudice by that instruction in spite of his manslaughter conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-7\">Jurors are not skilled in legal techniques. They welcome an opportunity to compose differences and agree upon a compromise verdict. <em>See State v. Thomas, </em>140 <em>N.J.Super. </em>429, 356 A.2d 433 (App.Div.1976).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 69-70, 73, 362 A.2d 1153],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">It was therefore error to charge the jury on first degree murder in the absence of any credible evidence that defendant intended or desired Matthews\u2019 death or serious injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">The second critical error was not raised at trial or on this appeal. While we reject defendant\u2019s legal argument that the manslaughter verdict was against the weight of the evidence, we are convinced that the reasoning of <em>Wilson </em>points to plain error in the jury instructions here. The failure to charge the jury that it was the State\u2019s burden to disprove defendant\u2019s reasonable belief that the gun was not loaded deprived defendant of a fair opportunity for the jury properly to weigh the evidence of an essential element of the crime: defendant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the shooting. We cannot ignore plain error in the jury charge. <em>See State v. Fair, </em>45 <em>N.J. </em>77, 211 A.2d 359 (1965) (evidence supported defendant\u2019s claim that he acted in the reasonable belief of the necessity to defend another):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-11\">The trial judge has a mandatory duty to charge the jury on the fundamental principles of law which control the ease, but whether, in the absence of objection, a failure to so charge constitutes plain error is dependent upon the circumstances of the particular case. <em>State v. Butler, </em>27 <em>N.J. </em>560, 594-595, 143 A.2d 530 (1958)____ Basically, the so-called \u201caffirmative defense\u201d of defense of another in murder cases negates the existence of the essential element of malice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Whether such a mental state existed at ail, and if so whether it was reasonably entertained, are necessarily jury questions which cannot be determined by this Court. In any event, this question was so essentially involved in the factual context of this case that the trial court\u2019s failure to charge the jury on that issue <em>sua sponte </em>was nothing less than plain error requiring a reversal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-6\"><em>[Id. at </em>90, 93, 211 A.2d 359].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-4a(l) provides that \u201cmistake as to a matter of fact ... is a defense if the defendant reasonably arrived at the conclusion underlying the mistake and ... [i]t negatives the culpable mental state required to establish the offense \u2014 \u201d Where a mistake of fact would negate the mental state that is an element of a crime, the burden of disproving the mistake must fall on the State. <em>See State v. Kelly, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>178, 200, 478 A.2d 364 (1984) (reasonable and honest belief in imminent danger of death essential of self-defense justification for killing).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-8\">It is perhaps worth emphasizing here that for defendant to prevail, the jury need not find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\u2019s belief was honest and reasonable. Rather, if any evidence raising the issue of self-defense is adduced, either in the State\u2019s or the defendant\u2019s case, then <em>the jury must be instructed that the State is required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the self-defense claim does not accord with the facts; </em>acquittal is required if there remains a reasonable doubt whether the defendant acted in self-defense. <em>See State v. Abbott, </em>36 <em>N.J. </em>63, 72, 174 A.2d 881 (1961). <em>See generally State v. Chiarello, </em>69 <em>N.J.Super. </em>479, 174 A.2d 506 (App.Div.1961).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-9\"><em>[Id. </em>(emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-10\"><em>See also State v. Fair, supra, </em>45 <em>N.J. </em>at 91, 211 A.2d 359 (quoting <em>State v. Abbott, </em>36 <em>N.J. </em>63, 72, 174 A.2d 881 (1961)); Cannel, <em>Criminal Code Annotated, </em>comment 3 on <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:2-4; comments 2 and 3 on <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:1-13 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-11\">While we find no decision by a New Jersey court adopting the holding of <em>Wilson v. Tard, </em>this case calls for such a ruling before any retrial. The critical holding of <em>Wilson </em>is that once the defendant, as here, presents evidence of a reasonable mistake of fact that would refute an essential element of the crime charged, the State\u2019s burden of proving each element beyond a reasonable doubt includes disproving the reasonable mistake of fact.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>In the case before us, in advancing the argument that he had reasonably believed that the gun was unloaded when he pulled its trigger, petitioner had raised a defense whose proof would negate the mental element necessary to constitute manslaughter. Thus, under <em>Mullaney </em>he should have borne only the burden of raising the issue, not that of proving it. The state was required to refute this defense beyond a reasonable doubt as an inseparable part of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that petitioner had acted recklessly and thus was guilty of manslaughter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-6\"><em>Wilson v. Tard, supra, </em>593 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 1096.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">The State\u2019s burden with respect to the mistake of fact defense to negate the reckless state of mind for a manslaughter conviction is no less compelling than the burden of disproving a reasonable perception of risk to justify a homicide. The burden is comparable to that required where a defendant presents credible evidence of diminished capacity to negate mens rea. <em>See Humanik v. Beyer, </em>871 <em>F.2d </em>432, 440 (3rd Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>493 <em>U.S. </em>812, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>57, 107 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>25 (1989).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-8\">[I]n the situation where the element of the offense and the so-called \u201caffirmative defense\u201d pose the same ultimate issue and a state places the burden of persuasion on the defendant with respect to that ultimate issue____ [T]he relevance of the subsidiary facts in the case are the same and the sole significance of the defendants\u2019 evidence concerning the so-called \u201caffirmative defense\u201d is to create a reasonable doubt about the existence of an element of the offense. In this context, as the Supreme Court of New Jersey recognized in both <em>Breakiron </em>[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] and <em>Zola </em>1<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>], it is not constitutionally permissible under <em>Winship </em>[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] and <em>Martin </em>[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] to charge the jury that the defendant has the burden of proving his defense by a preponderance of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-11\">The same is true where a defendant offers evidence of having acted in the heat of passion, to disprove the purposeful state of mind for a murder conviction. <em>See Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>421 <em>U.S. </em>684, 95 <em>S.Ct. </em>1881, 44 L.Ed.2d 508 (1975). <em>See also State v. Powell, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>305, 315, 419 A.2d 406 (1980). As the New Jersey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>Supreme Court said in <em>State v. Bowens, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>622, 632, 532 A.2d 215 (1987):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-6\">Our law has always recognized the difference between a defense based on the existence of a fact that negates an essential element of the crime as defined, and the narrower concept of an affirmative defense that excuses conduct that is otherwise unlawful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Defendant was convicted of reckless manslaughter, albeit as a lesser included offense of murder. Acting \u201crecklessly\u201d is defined by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-2b(3):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-8\">A person acts recklessly with respect to a material element of an offense when he consciously disregards a substantia! and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct. The risk must be of such a nature and degree that, considering the nature and purpose of the actor\u2019s conduct and the circumstances known to him, its disregard involves a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the actor\u2019s situation. \u201cRecklessness,\u201d \u201cwith recklessness\u201d or equivalent terms have the same meaning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-9\"><em>See also State v. Concepcion, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>373, 384-87, 545 A.2d 119 (1988) (Handler, J., concurring). Of course, the judge here did not expressly place the burden of proving the mistake on defendant, as did the judge in <em>Wilson. </em>Nevertheless, it is axiomatic that accurate jury instructions in a criminal case are essential to the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial. <em>E.g., Concepcion, supra, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>at 379, 545 A.2d 119. Additionally, we must look to the charge as a whole to determine error and the potential harm therefrom. <em>Id. </em>at 376, 545 A.2d 119. The judge did explain to the jury that it should acquit defendant of manslaughter if it found defendant to have acted upon a reasonable mistake that the gun was not loaded. The judge also made it clear that the State had to prove each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. However, the judge did not make it clear to the jury that in order to prove the element of recklessness, the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt either that defendant did not actually believe the gun to be unloaded, or that his belief was unreasonable. In other words, the jury should have been instructed that the State had the burden of disproving the mistake of fact defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>The charge on reckless manslaughter followed the charges on murder and aggravated manslaughter. The judge described the alternative theories of the case in the context of the elements of aggravated manslaughter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-6\">You have to consider the nature and purpose of what Ronald Sexton did, the circumstances known to him and you have to determine whether, in light of those things, his disregarding the risk was a gross deviation from what a reasonable person'would have observed in the defendant\u2019s situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-7\">Now, again the state and the defense have differing version, factual versions of what they contend happened here. The state contends that Ronald Sexton \u2014 the first position of the state of course is this was knowing purposeful murder but alternatively the state would contend, if not satisfied with that, at the very least there was an act of recklessness. That Ronald Sexton, pointing a loaded gun at or in the direction of Alquadir Matthews and pulling the trigger amounted to recklessness because he had to be aware of the fact that if a gun is pointed at someone and it is loaded and you pull that trigger, you might kill somebody or hurt somebody really seriously and the state says he was aware of that but yet he disregarded that risk. He did it anyhow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-8\">The defense, on the other hand, contends not that this didn\u2019t happen but it was just a tragic accident. The defense contends that Ronald didn\u2019t know the gun was loaded. In fact, says the defense, he had been told specifically by Alquadir that it was not loaded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-9\">So says the defendant, he wasn\u2019t being as careful as he might have been if he thought or had any reason to believe the gun was loaded. And unfortunately, unbeknownst to him, it was loaded. Unfortunately at the moment he happened to pull the trigger, it must have been pointing in a direction that found the body of Alquadir with tragic results but it was an accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">The judge thereafter addressed the lesser included offense of reckless manslaughter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-11\">Reckless manslaughter is when one person causes another\u2019s death and he does so recklessly. Those are the only 2 elements of reckless manslaughter. \u201cA\u201d causes \u201cB\u2019s\u201d death. In other words, \u201cB\u201d would not die, \u201cB\u201d being Alquidir Matthews would not die but for what \u201cA\u201d Ronald Sexton did and \u201cA\u201d acted recklessly as I previously defined that word for you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-12\">If you find beyond a reasonable doubt that Ronald Sexton recklessly caused Alquadir Matthews\u2019 death and are satisfied of both those elements beyond a reasonable doubt, find him guilty of reckless manslaughter. If you have a reasonable doubt in your mind as to one or more of those elements, find him not guilty of reckless manslaughter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>I remind you the defendant contends that the state has not been able to prove any of these degrees of homicide: Knowing or purposeful murder, aggravated manslaughter, being reckless, causing death under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to human life or even reckless manslaughter, a reckless causing of death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-6\">Defense contends this was a tragic accident. That Alquadir, says the defense, handed the gun to Ronald. Alquadir told Ronald, you know, the gun was not loaded. Ronald believed that the gun was not loaded. Ronald did not think the gun was pointed at Alquadir when it went off. But the gun went off accidentally and, says the defense, that is a very tragic and sad accident but it is not a crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-7\">If, after considering all the evidence in this case, including the evidence presented by the defense as well as the evidence presented by the state, if you have a reasonable doubt in your mind as to whether the state has proven all the elements of any of these crimes: Murder, aggravated manslaughter, or reckless manslaughter, you must find the defendant not guilty of those crimes. On the other hand, if and only if you\u2019re satisfied from the evidence that the state has proven beyond a reasonable doubt all the elements of any of those degrees of homicide, you may find the defendant guilty of that degree of homicide.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">We cannot conclude that the jury understood that it was the State\u2019s burden to disprove defendant\u2019s mistake beyond a reasonable doubt. The prosecutor\u2019s misconduct, along with the defense attorney\u2019s ineffective assistance, combined to deprive the jury of the opportunity to weigh the gun\u2019s ownership along with the other evidence of defendant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the shooting. Because the evidence of a reckless shooting rather than an accident was not strong, the failure to explicitly place upon the State the burden of disproving defendant\u2019s reasonable mistake of fact cannot be deemed harmless error. As we held in another context in <em>State v. Parsons, </em>270 <em>N.J.Super. </em>213, 224-25, 636 A.2d 1077 (App.Div.1994), \u201c[t]he error undermines our confidence that the deliberative process produced a just result and the conviction must be reversed.\u201d The erroneous charge alone is sufficient to require a new trial. Even if it were not, the addition of the prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel that combined to hide the gun\u2019s ownership from the jury establish cumulative error requiring a new trial. <em>See State v. Orecchio, </em>16 <em>N.J. </em>125, 129, 106 A.2d 541 (1954); <em>State v. Allen, </em>308 <em>N.J.Super. </em>421, 431-32, 706 A.2d 220 (App.Div.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>In Point IV defendant contends that the trial judge erred in barring him and his mother from testifying to his placement in a special education class, his attendance at a special school, or his classification as impaired in any way. Although the jury heard nothing about it, the defendant was apparently a special education student who attended a special school to which he was sent by the Montclair Board of Education. With respect to the exclusion of testimony regarding Sexton\u2019s \u201climited mental ability and his status as a special education student,\u201d we add these comments in the event of a retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Defense counsel at this trial clearly stated that he did not intend a diminished capacity defense, and the trial judge accepted the State\u2019s arguments that allowing the proffered evidence would open a \u201cback door\u201d into the diminished capacity defense. We are not satisfied that that is necessarily the case, or that such evidence should necessarily be barred despite defendant\u2019s intention not to raise a diminished capacity defense. Evidence of defendant\u2019s mental ability is potentially relevant to the reasonableness of his perceptions at the time Matthews told him the gun was not loaded. As such, it is therefore relevant to the presence or absence of the requisite reckless state of mind. It is also relevant to the jury\u2019s evaluation of defendant\u2019s demeanor and credibility as a witness at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">We note that despite extensive psychological expert testimony at the waiver hearing, no expert testimony was offered at trial. Under those circumstances, it was within the trial judge\u2019s discretion either to admit or to exclude defendant\u2019s and his mother\u2019s testimony regarding his school placement. The trial judge found the proffer so vague as to be more prejudicial and confusing than relevant. <em>See N.J.R.E. </em>403. However, we think it only fair, in the event of a retrial, that defendant have the opportunity upon proper notice to the State, to offer relevant experts and/or appropriate school personnel, who may be able to fairly describe defendant\u2019s mental ability. In light of our decision today, there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>need to address defendant\u2019s contentions regarding the sentence for manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">We affirm the conviction for unlawful possession of a handgun and the sentence for that offense. We reverse the conviction for reckless manslaughter and remand to the Law Division for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b107-7\"> The State argued that defendant had not proved the requisite likelihood of rehabilitation before age nineteen, citing the report of defendant's expert psychologist that \"[defendant] will continue to require ... supervision and structure [like the small self-contained classroom when he was in school].\" The State argued that the psychologist was unable to \u201celaborate as to what type of supervised structure is within the confines of the juvenile correctional system that would best facilitate Ronald Sexton.\u201d It seems to us that the burden of production (though not the burden of proof) is unfairly placed on the juvenile to show available means of rehabilitation when information and control over programs within the juvenile justice system is more accessible to the State than to the juvenile. However, it is within the province of the other co-equal branches of state government to establish and maintain facilities within which rehabilitation of juvenile offenders would be a realistic goal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b110-18\"> Defendant and other defense witnesses testified that neither boy owned a dog.
