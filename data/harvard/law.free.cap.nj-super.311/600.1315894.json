Prior to 1983, drivers who could not obtain coverage directly from insurers in the open and voluntary market were insured through an assigned risk plan, under which the Commissioner apportioned high-risk drivers amongst all auto insurers doing business in New Jersey. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>17.-29D-1. In 1983, the assigned-risk system was replaced by the Automobile Full Insurance Availability Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30E-1 to -24, which created the JUA. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. State, </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>32, 40-41, 590 A.2d 191 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Under the JUA plan, high-risk drivers were allocated to insurance carriers doing business in the State and to the JUA itself, with premiums set at the same rates as those found in the voluntary market. To defray the added costs incurred from insuring high-risk drivers, the proceeds of certain fees and surcharges on motorists were allocated to the JUA <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30E-8. By 1988, over fifty percent (50%) of New Jersey drivers had to be insured through the JUA, and by 1990, the JUA had accumulated a deficit of over $3.3 billion in unpaid claims and losses. <em>State Farm, supra, </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>at 42, 590 A.2d 191; <em>In re Rate Filing by the Market Transition Facility of N.J., </em>252 <em>N.J.Super. </em>260, 265, 599 A.2d 906 (App.Div.1991), <em>certif. denied, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>565, 606 A.2d 376 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The Fair Automobile Insurance Reform Act (FAIRA), <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:33B-1 to -63, was enacted in 1990 in an attempt to phase out high-risk drivers from the JUA, and with the further purpose of creating funding mechanisms to pay off the JUA\u2019s debt. The New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>Jersey Automobile Insurance Guaranty Fund (Auto Fund) was created by FAIRA to collect and disburse the monies generated by the various funding mechanisms. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:33B-5. For example, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:33B-57 to -62 imposed annual fees on lawyers, doctors, chiropractors, therapists, and auto body repair facilities to be remitted to the Auto Fund. Additionally, a significant funding source to help retire the JUA debt was assessments to be imposed by PLIGA on automobile insurance carriers. The proceeds of the assessments were denominated as \u201cloans\u201d to be paid into the Auto Fund. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30A-8a(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">PLIGA<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was created in 1974, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30A-1 to -20, to impose assessments on New Jersey property-casualty insurers to be used to pay claims against carriers that had become insolvent. <em>N.J.SA </em>17:30A-2a. The Legislature selected PLIGA as the statutory mechanism to collect the additional assessments to be imposed on automobile insurance carriers for the JUA\u2019s benefit and to remit the same to the Auto Fund. <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:30A-5b and -8a. The Legislature obligated PLIGA to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-7\">(9) Assess member insurers in amounts necessary to make loans pursuant to paragraph (10) of this subsection. [and to]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-9\">(10) Make loans in the amount of $160 million per calendar year, beginning in calendar year 1990, to the New Jersey Automobile Insurance Guaranty Fund created pursuant to section 23 of P.L.1990, c.8 (C. 17:33B-5), except that no loan shall be made pursuant to this paragraph after December 31,1997.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-10\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>17:30A-8a(9) and (10).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-11\">In <em>State Farm, </em>the Supreme Court described the assessment procedure as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-12\">These assessments, denominated by the Act as \u201cloans,\u201d are paid into the Auto Fund. <em>N.J.SA </em>17:30A-8a(10). They are to be set at rates designed to net $160 million per year for eight years (1990 through 1997); for 1990, the assessments represented 2.7% of net premiums of the property-casualty insurers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number><em>[State Farm, supra, </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>at 44, 590 A.2d 191.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Since the annual FAIRA assessments on PLIGA members were based on estimates of the preceding calendar year\u2019s premiums, the assessments were made subject to a \u201ctrue-up\u201d procedure, whereby the correct amount of the annual FAIRA assessment was adjusted or \u201ctrued-up\u201d the following year, based upon each insurer\u2019s actual net direct written premiums for the assessed year. <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:30A-8a(9). With respect to the 1997 calendar year assessment, the \u201ctrued-up\u201d assessment as to each carrier will not be determined until sometime during 1998. The same truing-up methodology has been used in each year since calendar year 1990. PLIGA does not treat or regard the \u201ctrued-up\u201d assessment as a new assessment. Rather, it is treated as relating back to and being a component of the previous year\u2019s estimated assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">On June 11,1997, PLIGA issued the eighth and last $160 million assessment under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30A-8a(9), and directed statements to all of its members, reflecting their pro <em>rata </em>share of the total. Appellants sought a stay of the enforcement of the assessments, but on July 25, 1997, this court refused the stay and also denied the Commissioner\u2019s emergent application for summary disposition of appellants\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">On appeal, appellants contend that the 1997 assessment was beyond the power of the Commissioner, because there was no proof that the money was needed to further defray MTF liabilities. For the reasons which follow, we find this contention to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">1. Assessments on member insurers of $160 million in each of eight calendar years from 1990 through December 31, 1997, were made mandatory in FAIRA. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:33A-8a(9) and (10).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">2. The MTF was created in 1990 by FAIRA, <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:33B-11, to be operated by the Commissioner as an interim successor to the JUA. During the phase-out of the JUA, the MTF was to provide passenger automobile insurance for individuals unable to secure coverage in the voluntary market. Appellants\u2019 members <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>are members of the MTF and \u201cshall share in its ... losses[.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:33B-lla.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">3. The Good Driver Protection Act of 1994 (GDPA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:1B-21.1 to -21.15, requires that the 1996 and 1997 insurance industry payments assessed by and made through PLIGA and loaned to the Auto Fund to finance the JUA\u2019s deficit be redirected to the MTF, to be used to meet its \u201ccurrent and anticipated financial obligations.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:1B-21.12; <em>see also Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee Statement, </em>Senate, No. 1250\u2014 L.1994, c. 57 (discussing the potential fiscal impact of the GDP A).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">4. Neither FAIRA nor the GDPA require the Commissioner to make a preliminary showing that the 1997 assessment was needed by the MTF. <em>See In re Musick, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>206, 216, 670 A.2d 11 (1996) (holding that courts may intervene only where \u201can agency action is clearly inconsistent with its statutory mission.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Consequently, the nub of the controversy on this appeal is whether the Legislature intended FAIRA to effect eight successive calendar year assessments of $160 million each, totalling $1,280 billion, or seven calendar year assessments of $160 million each, totalling $1,120 billion. Appellants rely upon the Fiscal Estimate prepared by the Office of Legislative Services which was annexed to FAIRA in its bill form before the General Assembly. The Fiscal Estimate provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-8\">The bill establishes a new assessment on property-casualty insurers in amounts necessary to loan $160 million per calendar year, for seven years, beginning in 1990 and continuing through 1997, for a total of $1,120 billion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">As a result, the Legislators had before them Assembly Bill No. 1 of 1990, the wording of which directed PLIGA to assess member insurers in amounts necessary to make loans of $160 million per calendar year beginning in 1990, with no assessment and loan to be made after December 31, 1997. The Legislators simultaneously had before them a fiscal note stating that the bill required such assessments to be made in each calendar year for seven years, beginning in 1990 and continuing through 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>The mathematical dichotomy contained in the divergent language of the bill and the fiscal note should be obvious. As. drawn, the bill clearly provided for assessments of $160 million per year in each of the calendar years \u201cbeginning in calendar year 1990,\u201d for a total of $1.280 billion. The number of calendar years beginning in 1990 and ending in 1997 is eight. The Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>State Farm, supra, </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>at 44, 590 A.2d 191, is identical. <em>See also In re Loans of N.J. Prop. Liability Ins. Guaranty Ass\u2019n, </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>69, 70, 78-79, 590 A.2d 210 (1991) (stating that loans were mandated \u201cfor 1990 through 1997\u201d). However, the fiscal note calculates the number of calendar years to be seven.. The author of the fiscal note obviously misread the wording of Assembly Bill No. 1 of 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">We cannot accept appellants\u2019 contention that the Legislators\u2019 intent is best evidenced by the fiscal note. The express language of a statute is the preferred indicator of legislative intent. <em>Strasenburgh v. Straubmuller, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>527, 539, 683 A.2d 818 (1996). We must therefore first consider the statute\u2019s plain language. <em>Kimmelman v. Henkels &amp; McCoy, Inc., </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>123, 128, 527 A.2d 1368 (1987). Where that language is clear, there is no need for interpretation. <em>Lopez v. Santiago, </em>125 <em>N.J.Super. </em>268, 270, 310 A.2d 500 (App.Div.1973). While we may refer to the bill\u2019s fiscal note to ascertain legislative intent if necessary, it is the express language of the bill as enacted into law that must govern. <em>Perez v. Pantasote, Inc., </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>105, 114, 469 A.2d 22 (1984); <em>In re M.G., </em>307 <em>N.J.Super. </em>348, 353, 704 A.2d 1025 (App.Div.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">We are not at liberty to speculate that the Legislature intended the language of its fiscal note to govern where the conflicting terms of the statute are so plain and obvious. There is no ambiguity in the wording; the statute speaks for itself and will be construed accordingly. <em>Bunk v. </em>Pori <em>Auth. of N.Y. &amp; N.J., </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>176, 194, 676 A.2d 118 (1996); <em>Rosenthal v. State Employees\u2019 Retirement Sys., </em>30 <em>N.J.Super. </em>136, 140, 103 A.2d 896 (App.Div.1954). Our sole function is to enforce the statute as written. <em>Strasenburgh, supra, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>at 539, 683 A.2d 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>We have considered all other contentions raised by appellants and find that they are equally without merit. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(l)(E). Under the circumstances, the June 11, 1997, assessment by PLI-GA of its member insurers pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30A-8 is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b617-16\"> Appellants are trade associations consisting of property and casualty insurance companies licensed to do business in New Jersey and all other states.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b619-13\"> PLIGA is a \"private, nonprofit, unincorporated, legal entity,\u201d to which anyone writing insurance in New Jersey must belong as a member, as a condition of doing business in the State. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30A-6 and -5(f); <em>see also, N.J.S.A. </em>17:30A-2b (listing types of insurers exempted from membership requirement).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
