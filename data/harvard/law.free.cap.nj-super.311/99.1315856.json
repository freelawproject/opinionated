Technically, the appeal is jurisdictionally defective. Appeals may be taken only from judgment or orders and not from opinions or decisions. <em>See, e.g., Heffner v. Jacobson, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>550, 553, 498 A.2d 766 (1985); Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment on <em>R. </em>2:2-3 (1998). However, we elect to ignore the technical defect, rule on the substantive provisions of the appeal, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">\u201cThe permit to carry a gun is the most closely-regulated aspect of gun-control laws.\u201d <em>In re Preis, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>564, 568, 573 A.2d 148 (1990). The legislative goal is to protect the public by precluding unfit persons from possessing guns. <em>See State v. Cunningham, </em>186 <em>N.J.Super. </em>502, 508, 453 A.2d 239 (App.Div.1982); <em>Burton v. Sills, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>86, 91, 248 A.2d 521 (1968). Consequently, to obtain a purchaser identification card, an individual must be a \u201cperson of good character and good repute in the community in which he lives.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:58-3e. A gun permit applicant\u2019s identity in the community then is a controlling criterion for determining whether the permit should be granted. To that end, the Gun Control Law in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:58-3d authorizes the Chief of Police where a gun permit applicant \u201cresides\u201d to consider the applicant\u2019s statutory qualifications. In all other instances, the applicant must apply to the Superintendent of the State Police.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">The trial court concluded Berkeley did not have a bona fide residence in Bloomfield. It, therefore, ruled the Bloomfield Chief of Police had no jurisdiction to consider Berkeley\u2019s gun permit application.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Berkeley admits that he is an out-of-state resident but claims, because he has a \u201csecondary residence\u201d in Bloomfield, the trial court erred in not granting him a permit. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">We conclude the Legislature intended the word \u201cresides\u201d as used in <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:58-3d to be synonymous with the term \u201cdomicile.\u201d There can be no dispute a gun permit applicant\u2019s contacts with a municipality undergirds the legislative intent behind authorizing a municipal police chief to assess the applicant\u2019s fitness for possession of a gun. However, only when an applicant has substantial contacts with the municipality is there means available for making the assessment. Consequently, where an applicant claims dual residency and the applicant\u2019s identity in or connection with a municipality is superficial, the ability of the local police chief is severely limited. The applicant\u2019s contacts with a municipality to adequately afford opportunity to assess permit qualifications require \u201celements of permanency, continuity and kinship with the physical, cultural, social and political attributes\u201d of a community. <em>See State v. Benny, </em>20 <em>N.J. </em>238, 251, 119 A.2d 155 (1955) (elements recited evidence domicile not residence). Only when an applicant\u2019s identity with a community is evidenced by the recited elements can the local police chief have an adequate opportunity to assess the fitness and suitability for a gun permit. In absence of those substantial contacts, we conclude it was the legislative intent to place consideration of a gun permit application in the hands of the State Police.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The undisputed evidence discloses Berkeley has very limited, inconsequential contacts with Bloomfield. While he operates an instructional studio in Bloomfield, he stays there overnight no more than twice a week and only when his work runs late. On the other hand, he (1) has a New York driver\u2019s license with a New York City address where he apparently lives the majority of the time; (2) files his income tax returns from the same New York City address; and (3) last registered to vote in New York and has never registered to vote in New Jersey. Given the substantial evidence of his contacts with New York and limited contacts with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Bloomfield, we conclude Berkeley does not \u201creside\u201d in Bloomfield within the intendment of the Gun Control Law. <em>See Mercadante v. City of Paterson, </em>111 <em>N. J.Super. </em>35, 40, 266 A.2d 611 (Ch.1970), <em>aff'd, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>112, 275 A.2d 440 (1971) (holding that \u201c[n]othing less [than domicile] will create ... \u2018identity with the community.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
