Simpson from defendant Ann Sullivan Scher on December 3, 1989. Over four years later, Simpson<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>action under Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A: 1-101 to:ll-108.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He claims entitlement to damages for breach of an express warranty based on the seller\u2019s representation that the horse was sound. Simpson asserts that at the time of the sale Scher knew the horse might have ringbone disease, a condition which could adversely affect the horse\u2019s resale value and, at sometime in the future, its ability to compete.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Scher<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> successfully moved for summary judgment in the Law Division. Plaintiffs appeal, contending there are material issues of fact which should be resolved by a jury. Scher argues that her statements regarding the horse were either true or merely statements of opinion and not express warranties. In the alt\u00e9rnative, she contends there is insufficient evidence of fraud, and, consequently, the action is barred by the Code\u2019s four-year statute of limitations, <em>N.J.S. A. </em>12A:2-725.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\n<em>I.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">We find that the evidence, viewed most favorably for plaintiffs, establishes the following facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">Scher, a professional riding instructor and horse trainer since 1974, owned a stable in West Orange which housed about fifty horses and was known as Suburban Essex Equestrian Center. In her career she had bought or sold over a hundred horses. In 1986 she began using Dr. Brendan W. Furlong and Dr. Donald Bruno, two veterinarians who practiced together, for advice on the health of horses she wanted to purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">In the spring of 1989, Scher purchased five horses in Belgium, including The Mighty Quinn, for $110,000. She paid $20,000 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>ship the horses to New Jersey, and they arrived here by the end of June. In making this purchase, she relied on Dr. Bruno\u2019s examination of the horse in Belgium and on his opinion, although he did not provide her with any details regarding what the examination revealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Within a few days of The Mighty Quinn\u2019s arrival, Scher called Richard Widger, the operator of a large stable in Rockleigh, from whom she had purchased over fifty horses since 1980. Scher had acquired The Mighty Quinn for resale and wanted Widger\u2019s assistance in that regard. They agreed that if he found a purchaser she would pay him a commission of $5,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Plaintiff David B. Simpson has been a lawyer since 1965, specializing in business transactions. Between 1981 and 1989, he had purchased six horses for his children from Widger. In July 1989, the two horses that Simpson was boarding at Widger\u2019s farm became unridable. As a result, Simpson approached Widger, asking him to assist in finding a suitable horse for his daughter Catherine. In August 1989, Widger told Simpson about The Mighty Quinn, a horse which he believed Catherine could use in competitive shows.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">After seeing the horse, Simpson decided to have it moved to Widger\u2019s farm, where he and his daughter could spend some time observing and testing its capabilities and potential as a show horse. During the time the horse was at Widger\u2019s farm, Simpson decided to have the horse examined for soundness by a veterinarian. The examination, which included x-rays of the horse\u2019s legs, was performed on October 24, 1989, by Dr. Furlong, who had cared for all of Simpson\u2019s horses.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">There is a substantial conflict about what Dr. Furlong observed on the x-rays and about what he said in that regard to Widger and then to Simpson over the telephone in Widger\u2019s presence. For present purposes we will assume that Dr. Furlong\u2019s analysis of the x-rays of The Mighty Quinn\u2019s left front foot should have resulted in findings which accorded with those of plaintiffs\u2019 experts, Drs. Paxton and Mcllwraith.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Dr. Paxton indicated the x-rays showed \u201cchanges ... of the left front pastern and foot.\u201d He added that the changes were \u201cobvious and significant in prognosticating the gelding\u2019s condition, performance capabilities, value and future salability.\u201d He also noted \u201cthe <em>potential </em>for their expansion into articular ringbone with resulting lameness____\u201d (Emphasis added). He concluded that the 1989 x-rays showed that the horse\u2019s <em>\u201clong-term </em>prognosis for soundness was guarded.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Dr. Mcllwraith also observed that the 1989 \u201cradiographic changes are indicative of the <em>potential </em>for expansion into articular ringbone which <em>could </em>lead to lameness.\u201d (Emphasis added). He would have advised the purchaser \u201cthat such radiographic changes would deter future purchasers, notwithstanding that such changes <em>might not progress or cause actual lameness.\u201d </em>He also noted \u201cchanges\u201d in bone structure on the distal aspect of the second phalanx; however, they were within \u201cnormal range.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">According to Widger, Dr. Furlong said the horse was sound but that the x-rays had shown \u201cremodeling.\u201d Widger asked, \u201cTell me something in layman\u2019s terms, between 1 and 10, making 10 the worst, how would you ... value this horse?\u201d He said the doctor replied, \u201cbetween 5 and 6.\u201d Widger immediately conveyed this information to Simpson in a telephone call from the doctor\u2019s office and then handed the telephone to the doctor who gave Simpson the same information, and added the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-9\">[Yjou\u2019ve bought horses from Mr. Widger that had worse x-rays ... Bart and Mo. And ... everything went all right with them, so it\u2019s a gamble whether they might ... be problems down the road.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">According to Simpson, Dr. Furlong said the horse was sound, but \u201cthere was something which he called a change \u2014 I think he used the term \u2018change.\u2019 \u201d Simpson further recounted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-11\">And I asked him what he meant. I didn\u2019t understand any of the technical jargon. What he said to me was ... that the change was some sort of irregularity of some sort.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARd1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>He could not recall whether Dr. Furlong had used the word \u201cremodeling,\u201d but he was aware that the changes had shown up on x-rays.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Widger then took the telephone and advised Simpson not to consummate the purchase. Although Simpson asserted that Widger recommended the purchase, he also admitted he knew there was a problem and that he decided to have the horse returned to defendant\u2019s stable, which was done by Widger that day. Catherine testified that after the doctor\u2019s examination she \u201cbecame emotionally upset when Mr. Widger told me that there was some problem and that might mean I couldn\u2019t get the horse.\u201d Simpson admitted that shortly after the examination, Widger brought another horse to his farm for Catherine to consider instead of The Mighty Quinn. The other horse proved unsatisfactory and Simpson decided to pursue the purchase of The Mighty Quinn.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Before describing the subsequent conversations between Scher and Simpson upon which Simpson rests his case of warranty breach and fraud, we must describe what the evidence shows with respect to what Scher knew about ringbone and what she learned from Widger and Dr. Bruno regarding the outcome of Dr. Furlong\u2019s examination of the horse.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">When Widger returned the horse to Scher, he told her that Dr. Furlong found \u201cproblems with the x-rays,\u201d \u201cchanges.\u201d He also described the doctor\u2019s five to six rating of the horse\u2019s value. Finally, he told her that he had advised Simpson to withdraw from the purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">Later that week, when Dr. Bruno visited Scher\u2019s stable on other business, she asked him \u201cif there was anything to worry about with the horse____\u201d He told her Dr. Furlong had found an \u201cirregularity on a bone.\u201d However, she asked Dr. Bruno about the cause of the irregularity, and he said it was from \u201ccalcium\u201d and might have been caused by the horse striking \u201ca jump.\u201d During her deposition, she testified that Dr. Bruno\u2019s comments did not seem significant since he had just \u201cvetted\u201d the horse in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Europe. She understood he was referring to calcification of a bone, but she \u201cdidn\u2019t take it as though my horse had a disease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Scher understood ringbone as meaning a \u201ccalcification on one of the bones in the front of the hoof.\u201d She had never had one of her horses diagnosed with the disease that did not also limp. She would not have purchased a horse for resale that had ringbone.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Simpson, motivated by Catherine\u2019s intense desire to own The Mighty Quinn, returned to Seher\u2019s stable and engaged her in the conversations upon which his action is based. He told Scher that Dr. Furlong had said \u201cthere was a problem with the x-rays.\u201d He emphasized that the horse was expensive and that he was \u201cconcerned because I heard something I didn\u2019t fully understand and it made me a little nervous.\u201d According to Simpson, Scher assured him \u201cthat the horse was a good horse, that the horse was a sound horse and that the horse was appropriate for me to buy, that I would not have a problem with the horse.\u201d He also testified that \u201cthe substance of our conversation was that this horse was a good horse and was worth the money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Despite Scher\u2019s reassurances, Simpson did not decide to purchase The Mighty Quinn until he received and reviewed a letter from Dr. Debarsy, who had been the horse\u2019s veterinarian in Belgium when it was sold to Scher. The letter said, \u201cThe X-rays of 1989 show absolutely no deterioration from those taken in 1987. I conclude that a Sale Transaction can be made on my evidence that there is no sign of clinical lameness on this above-mentioned animal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">The purchase of The Mighty Quinn was concluded on December 3, 1989, at a price of $70,000. Thereafter, the horse competed in many equitation events, on occasion winning \u201cprize monies.\u201d However, by 1994 ringbone was identified as having manifested itself to the point that the horse would evidence lameness at times.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">Dr. Paxton, asked to examine the horse for \u201ca chronic, intermittent, low grade lameness in the left front leg\u201d which had been noted by the horse\u2019s trainer who \u201cwas concerned that it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>affect the gelding\u2019s performance in some up-coming shows,\u201d described the horse\u2019s condition as of February 23,1994, in this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-6\">\u201cQuinn\u201d had a very noticeable enlargement on the front and side of the pastern, just above the coronary band on the left forelimb. He was moderately lame after the pastem/fetlock were flex tested. He was also lame when he was lunged left on a hard surface (a grade 3 out of 5 lame).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">Radiographs were taken by me on February 23,1994. The radiographs showed significant chronic changes (osteophytes and bone remodeling) consistent with ringbone in the middle and distal phalangeal joints.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-8\">At the time, a prognosis for long term soundness was guarded to poor because of the condition and its further deterioration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">Dr. Mcllwraith reviewed the 1989 and 1994 x-rays and essentially concurred with Dr. Paxton\u2019s findings. He observed that from 1989 to 1994 the \u201cradiographic changes did progress----\u201d He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-12\">Although Dr. Furlong\u2019s [original] report does note remodeling, there is no indication in the report that the potential significance of remodeling was explained to the prospective purchaser. The use of the term \u201cremodeling\u201d implies evidence of an overaetive or abnormal bony response (usually associated with trauma). This would be appropriate for the prospective purchaser to fully understand the significance of the radiographic findings and thereby be in a position to make a decisi\u00f3n as to whether or not to purchase the horse and understand the effect on the resale value of the horse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-13\">\n<em>II.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b403-14\">Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code, <em>N.J.S.A </em>12A:1-101 to:11-108, governs the sale of animals in commerce. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-102, -105(1). In deciding whether statements by a seller constitute express warranties, the reference point is <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-313 which, in relevant part, provides the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-15\">(1) Express warranties by the seller are created as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-16\">(a) Any affirmation of fact or promise made by the seller to the buyer which relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the affirmation or promise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-17\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-18\">(2) It is not necessary to the creation of an express warranty that the seller use formal words such as \u201cwarrant\u201d or \u201cguarantee\u201d or that he have a specific intention to make a warranty, but an affirmation merely of the value of the goods or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>statement purporting to be merely the seller\u2019s opinion or commendation of the goods does not create a warranty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">In Ms deposition, Simpson said Scher used these phrases in describing The Mighty Quinn: \u201cgood horse,\u201d \u201csound horse,\u201d \u201cappropriate for [Mm] to buy.\u201d He also testified that \u201cthe substance of our conversation was that tMs was a good horse and was worth the money.\u201d In a certification, he added that he told Scher he wanted to be sure he would be able to resell the horse after Catherine went to college.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">To the extent that Scher affirmed the value of the horse, it is clear that no warranty was created under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-313(2), <em>supra, </em>since that section expressly excludes affirmation of value from the concept of express warranty. The words \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cappropriate for purchase\u201d added notMng to what was clearly the essence of the seller\u2019s representation, wMch was that The Mighty Quinn was sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">The concept of soundness in a horse is somewhat complex. At oral argument plaintiffs\u2019 counsel conceded that the horse was sound; however, he was using the word to describe the horse\u2019s capabilities to perform at the time of sale. In essence, the plaintiffs\u2019 position is that the horse was unsound because of potential problems indicated in the x-rays of its left front leg. Although Dr. Furlong described the condition in Ms deposition as ringbone, he also clearly stated the horse was then sound. The plaintiffs\u2019 experts both described the condition as having the potential for expansion into articular ringbone wMch could lead to lameness. They conceded the horse was otherwise sound in the sense of its ability to perform when plaintiff bought it.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">Soundness in a horse has been described m these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-9\">A <em>sound </em>horse is free from any abnormality in the form or function of any part. A <em>serviceably sound </em>horse is one capable of doing his job although he may have some minor unsoundness or blemish not serious enough to incapacitate him. No other quality is more important than soundness in determining a horse\u2019s value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">[John M. Kays, <em>The Horse, A Complete Guide to Its Care and Handling </em>3 (3rd ed., Arco Publishing, Inc.1982) (emphasis added).]</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>The single most important factor in <em>determining </em>the value of any horse is his degree of soundness. The veterinarian considers any abnormality in the form or function of any part an unsoundness. Not many horses can be certified as 100 per cent sound according to this interpretation. <em>The practical horseman seeks serviceable soundness. </em>He regards the more minor troubles \u2014 those that do not incapacitate a horse for his job but only mar his looks \u2014 more as blemishes than as true unsoundnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 75 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Ringbone appears to be generally regarded as \u201ca serious unsoundness because it so often results in severe lameness and inability to do any job.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 76. On the other hand, it has also been observed that some cases of ringbone \u201cdon\u2019t seem to bother the horse very much.\u201d Carin A. Smith, D.V.M., <em>Easy Health Care For Your Horse </em>171 (Prentice Hall Press, 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">That The Mighty Quinn was serviceably sound is not questioned in this case. The horse was capable of performing as a show horse and did so for some years without problem. On the other hand, it was certainly not sound in the sense of being a hundred percent free of abnormality of form: the 1989 x-rays revealed abnormal boney growth.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">In <em>Norton v. Lindsay, 350 F.2d </em>46 (10th Cir.1965), the plaintiff, a purchaser of a race horse, obtained summary judgment against the seller on the ground that there had been a breach of an express warranty that the horse was sound. Prior to sale, the horse had received an operation called \u201chigh nerving\u201d which precluded it from racing. In affirming, the court had this to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsN\">We agree with the trial judge that the affirmation of fact here was the words that \u201cthe horse was sound.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-10\">The word \u201csound\u201d when used with reference to many animals and especially a horse has a special and particular connotation. The statement that a horse is \u201csound\u201d implies \u201cthe absence of any defect or disease which * * * will impair the animal\u2019s natural usefulness for the purposes for which it is purchased * In other words, using the word \u201csound\u201d in describing the horse in this ease clearly constituted an express warranty of fitness as a race horse, which was the purpose for which it was purchased.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-11\"><em>[Id. </em>at 49 (footnote and citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>The <em>Norton </em>court\u2019s view of the meaning and legal effect of the word \u201csound\u201d in the context of horse sales finds support in 2 <em>Williston On Sales </em>\u00a7 15-6, at 375 (5th ed.1995) and was recognized as appropriate in New Jersey over 130 years ago in <em>Perrine v. Serrell, </em>30 <em>N.J.L. </em>454 (Sup.Ct.1864). Perrine purchased a horse from Serrell who had warranted the horse as sound. \u201cOn the afternoon of the day on which the colt was sent to [Perrine] ... he coughed considerably. He was well taken care of and nursed. He grew worse from day to day, and in a month afterwards died from inflammation of the trachea and lungs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 457. Perrine prevailed on his suit for breach of warranty. While the point was not in issue, the court\u2019s opinion indicated no doubt that the representation was one of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Other courts have taken a different tack. For example, in <em>Sessa v. Riegle, </em>427 <em>F.Supp. </em>760 (E.D.Pa.1977), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>568 F.2d 770 (3rd Cir.1978), the court held that a representation of soundness could be an opinion or commendation rather than an express warranty, depending on the circumstances of the sale. <em>Id. </em>at 765. In finding that the statement was merely opinion in the context of its case, the court distinguished but did not disagree with the result in <em>Norton. Id. </em>at 765 n. 3. However, the court did say this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-6\">In other words, because horses are fragile creatures, susceptible to myriad maladies, detectable and undetectable, only where there is an \u201cunderstanding\u201d that an ignorant buyer, is relying totally on a knowledgeable seller not \u201cto make a mean deal,\u201d are statements as to soundness taken to be anything more than the seller\u2019s opinion or commendation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">[Id. at 766 (footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">The views expressed by the Sessa court appear unduly restrictive. However, they are useful in pointing out the problem of defining what is meant by a representation that a horse is sound. In our view, the proper principle of law to be drawn from the aforementioned authorities is that \u201csound\u201d in the context of horse dealing means \u201cserviceably sound.\u201d Indeed, that is in essence what the court held in <em>Norton, supra. </em>Given that definition, the representation of the defendant Scher in this case was true and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>cannot be the basis of a cause of action for breach of express warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">\n<em>III.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Plaintiffs contend that when a seller warrants that a horse is sound that warranty should be taken as including a representation going beyond present serviceability. In other words, they claim the representation should be construed as meaning that the horse has no disease or condition which <em>might </em>interfere with its serviceability or salability during the useful life of the animal. In that connection they argue that Scher, based on her knowledge of ringbone, her understanding of calcification as a possible indicator of the disease, and the information she had received from Widger and Dr. Bruno, believed at the time of sale that the horse <em>might </em>have ringbone which <em>might </em>cause lameness and that an informed buyer would have rejected the horse. Even if we were to accept those propositions, which we do not, plaintiffs would not be entitled to prevail because of the untimely filing of their action and their inability to prove fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">An action on an express warranty under the Uniform Commercial Code must be filed within four years of the sale. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-725. This action was not so filed. However, the presence of fraud may toll the running of the statute. <em>Cf. Joseph v. Lesnevich, </em>56 <em>N.J.Super. </em>340, 355, 153 A.2d 349 (App.Div.1959); <em>Kohler v. Barnes, </em>123 <em>N.J.Super. </em>69, 79, 301 A.2d 474 (Law Div.1973). There is no suggestion here of active concealment after a fraud was committed. Rather, the charge is that the fraud went undiscovered until after the statute of limitations had run. In that case, the period of limitations begins to run \u201cwhen plaintiff should have discovered the fraudulent scheme----\u201d <em>B.F. Hirsch, Inc. v. Enright Refining Co., </em>577 <em>F.Supp. </em>339, 344 (D.N.J.1983), <em>aff'd in part, vacated in part on other grounds, </em>751 F.2d 628 (3rd Cir.1984) (citation omitted); <em>cf. Diamond v. New Jersey Bell Tel. Co., </em>51 <em>N.J. </em>594, 242 A.2d 622 (1968). We will assume that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>plaintiffs had no reason to discover the alleged fraud before the examination of the horse by Dr. Paxton in 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\u201cA misrepresentation amounting to actual legal fraud consists of a material representation of a presently existing or past fact, made with knowledge of its falsity and with the intention that the other party rely thereon, resulting in reliance by that party to his detriment.\u201d <em>Jewish Ctr. of Sussex County v. Whale, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>619, 624, 432 A.2d 521 (1981) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Viewing the evidence most favorably for plaintiffs, the most that can be inferred is that Scher knew that the presence of ringbone was a <em>possibility </em>which <em>might </em>affect the horse\u2019s serviceability and resale value. Possibilities are not \u201cpresently existing\u201d facts. Nor should we lose sight of the rule that fraud must be proven by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Stochastic Decisions, Inc. v. DiDomenico, </em>236 <em>N.J.Super. </em>388, 395, 565 A.2d 1133 (App.Div.1989), <em>certif. denied, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>607, 583 A.2d 309 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Even if we assume that Scher\u2019s statement was a knowing, material misrepresentation of an existing fact, made with the intent that Simpson rely on it, the action would still fail because of the absence of reliance as a matter of law resulting from these factors: (1) Simpson obtained an independent examination of the horse by Dr. Furlong; (2) after Scher said the horse was sound, Simpson did not agree to the purchase until he had reviewed Dr. Debarsy\u2019s opinion respecting the significance of the x-rays (this was a second independent examination); and (3) although Scher might have had a greater appreciation of the possible significance of the x-ray findings than Simpson did, she did not withhold any fact with respect to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">In <em>Byrne v. Weichert Realtors, </em>290 <em>N.J.Super. </em>126, 675 A.2d 235 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>259, 686 A.2d 761 (1996), an action for fraud based on the failure to disclose termite infestation in a house sale, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-9\">In instances in which a party undertakes an independent investigation and relies on it, there can be no reliance. Thus, where a purchaser has obtained the services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>of a pest control business to conduct a termite inspection and has relied on the results of the inspection, the purchaser may not proceed against the previous owners and their agent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 137, 675 A.2d 235 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The <em>Byrne </em>court went on to note an exception to this rule upon which the plaintiffs rely. The court recounted that even though the purchasers had obtained an independent examination, they learned from it only that there was minor termite infestation. The seller obtained an inspection which revealed major infestation and substantial structural damage. He did not disclose that information to the purchasers even though he was aware of the superficial nature of the inspection which they had obtained, and he persisted in representing that the problem was minimal. In those circumstances, the court held that a jury could find that the purchasers had relied upon the seller\u2019s representation regarding the extent of the damage even though they had obtained an independent examination. <em>Id. </em>at 137-39, 675 A.2d 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Plaintiffs also cite <em>Golden v. Northwestern Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>229 <em>N.J.Super. </em>405, 551 A.2d 1009 (App.Div.1988), with respect to their claim of a right to rely on what Scher said despite their independent investigations. However, the following observations in that case support Scher\u2019s position:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-8\">The mere fact that an insurer makes an investigation does not absolve the applicant from speaking the truth nor lessen the right of the insurer to rely upon his statements, <em>unless the investigation discloses facts sufficient to expose the falsity of the representations of the applicant or which are of such a nature as to place upon the insurer the duty of further inquiry. However, the law governing independent investigations seems clearly to have settled the principle that when one undertakes to make an independent investigation and relies upon it, he is presumed to have been guided by it and be bound accordingly. One cannot secure redress for fraud when he acted in reliance upon his mm knowledge or judgment based upon an independent examination.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 415, 551 A.2d 1009 (citations omitted)(emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">Plaintiffs contend the evidence established the existence of a question of fact on the issue of reliance. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">Simpson obtained an independent examination of The Mighty Quinn. The results of that examination were revealed to him by both Widger and Dr. Furlong, and were confirmed by Dr. Debar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>sy. Simpson knew there was a problem shown by the x-rays of the horse\u2019s left foreleg. Indeed, based upon the x-ray results and Dr. Furlong\u2019s comments thereon, he initially returned the horse to Scher and had Widger present another horse for possible purchase. Scher\u2019s factual information regarding the horse\u2019s actual condition was all secondhand and was no greater than that received by Simpson or available to him by further inquiry of Dr. Furlong. Scher did not fail to disclose any fact regarding the condition of the horse. At most, she withheld an opinion that the possibly existent condition might affect the horse\u2019s resale value.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">When deciding a motion for summary judgment under <em>R. </em>4:46-2, a judge is required to consider whether the evidence presented, \u201cwhen viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party,\u201d is sufficient to permit a \u201crational factfinder to resolve the alleged disputed issue in favor of the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 540, 666 A.2d 146 (1995). While credibility determinations are \u201cto be made by a jury and not the judge,\u201d if there is a \u201csingle, unavoidable resolution of the alleged disputed issue of fact, that issue should be considered insufficient to constitute a \u2018genuine\u2019 issue of material fact for purposes of <em>Rule </em>4:46-2.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 540, 666 A.2d 146 (citations omitted). In other words, if \u201ca rational jury can reach but one conclusion\u201d on the alleged disputed issue of fact based on the \u201cevidential materials presented,\u201d then the evidence \u201ccreates no \u2018genuine\u2019 issue of material fact precluding the grant of summary judgment under <em>Rule </em>4:46-2.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 540-41, 545, 666 A.2d 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The only evidence in this case of reliance is Simpson\u2019s statement that although he relied upon the opinions of the veterinarians, he also relied on what Scher said. He admits that Dr. Furlong, whom he had retained, told him the horse was \u201csound.\u201d Scher said no more than that. Dr. Furlong had the benefit of his professional examination and his ability to read the x-rays. Scher had only secondhand information about a horse which appeared to be fit in all respects. <em>Byrne </em>and <em>Golden </em>are clearly distinguish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>able cases. In <em>Byrne, supra, </em>the seller withheld information which he knew was inconsistent with the information obtained by the purchasers in their superficial, independent examination. 290 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 130-33, 675 A.2d 235. In <em>Golden, supra, </em>the insured had made specific statements about his health which were false. 229 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 408-12, 551 A.2d 1009. Neither of those circumstances is present here. Simpson had the benefit of a complete physical examination by a veterinarian of his choice, the same veterinarian who had cared for his prior horses and had, on occasion, examined horses Simpson was interested in purchasing. Although he claims some degree of lack of understanding with respect to the opinions he received from Dr. Furlong, defendant Scher is not to be faulted for Simpson\u2019s failure, if it was that, to demand clarification from the doctor. Consequently, under the principles of <em>Byrne </em>and <em>Golden </em>plaintiffs are not entitled to claim reliance upon the statements of Scher. The undisputed circumstances here precluded a finding of reasonable reliance by Simpson and required the entry of summary judgment. <em>Cf. DSK Enterprises, Inc. v. United Jersey Bank, </em>189 <em>N.J.Super. </em>242, 251, 459 A.2d 1201 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>598, 468 A.2d 232 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">\n<em>IV.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">One other aspect of this case must be mentioned since the judge\u2019s handling of it requires reversal of a portion of the judgment which we have not yet discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Scher filed a counterclaim against Simpson and a third-party complaint against his wife, Nancy. Those pleadings sought $1,625 for boarding and training The Mighty Quinn. Scher received judgment unsupported by findings of fact or conclusions of law. Given the conflicting evidence on this point, the judge\u2019s violation of <em>R. 1:7-4 </em>and <em>R. </em>4:46-2(c) requires reversal of this aspect <em>of </em>the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings on the counterclaim and third-party complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-15\"> Although Catherine Simpson is named as a plaintiff, she was not directly involved in the transaction. She is the daughter of David and the one for whom he purchased the horse.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b398-10\"> Although the complaint asserts a right to relief based on other theories, plaintiffs neither relied upon them below nor suggest their relevance on appeal. All are agreed that the rights of the parties are governed by the Uniform Commercial Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b398-11\"> The actions against the other defendants were dismissed and are not the subject of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
