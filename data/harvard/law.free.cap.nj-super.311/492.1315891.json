Hammell and owned by Warriner Construction Company (\u201cConstruction Company\u201d). The van was traveling south on the Garden State Parkway. A car driven by defendant Louise J. Marciano, traveling north on the Parkway, crossed the median and collided with Construction Company\u2019s van, injuring Hammell, Einwechter, Warriner, and Marciano.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">Einwechter, Warriner, and Hammell were employees of Construction Company and were in the course of their employment at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">Marciano was insured under an automobile liability policy issued by Allstate Insurance Company with policy limits of $50,000 per person and $100,000 per accident. Allstate acknowledged Marciano\u2019s liability and tendered the limits of her policy to settle the claims against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">Construction Company\u2019s van was covered by a business automobile insurance policy issued by The Harleysville Insurance Companies. The Harleysville policy had UM/UIM limits of $1,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>The New Jersey UM7UIM endorsements of the Harleysville policy define an insured in part as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-5\">3. Anyone else \u201coccupying\u201d a covered \u201cauto\u201d or a temporary substitute for a covered \u201cauto.\u201d...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">4. Anyone for damages he or she is entitled to recover because of \u201cbodily injury\u201d sustained by another \u201cinsured.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">The \u201cOther Insurance\u201d condition of the \u201cBusiness Auto Conditions\u201d section of the Harleysville policy provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-8\">a. For any covered \u201cauto\u201d you own, this Coverage Form provides primary insurance____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">\u201cYou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d are defined to mean an insured named on the declarations page. Construction Company is a named insured. Hammell, Einwechter, and Steven Warriner are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">Steven Warriner was insured under a Pennsylvania National Insurance Company (\u201cPenn\u201d) policy insuring an automobile which he owned. That policy had UWUIM policy limits of $300,000. The \u201cOther Insurance\u201d section in the \u201cUninsured Motorists Coverage\u201d of the Penn policy provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-11\">If there is other applicable insurance available under one or more policies or provisions of coverage:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-12\">2. Any insurance we provide with respect to a vehicle you do not own shall be excess over any collectible insurance providing coverage on a primary basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-13\">By orders for partial summary judgment, the Law Division ruled that Einwechter\u2019s and Warriner\u2019s wives are eligible for compensation under the UIM coverage of Construction Company\u2019s policy for their <em>per quod </em>claims and that the Harleysville policy is primary with respect to Steven Warriner\u2019s UIM claim. Defendants Huron and Harleysville appeal both issues. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-14\">There are no reported cases in New Jersey that address whether an employer\u2019s business auto policy covers the <em>per quod </em>claim of an injured employee\u2019s spouse. Some cases, however, mention without comment that a spouse filed a <em>per quod </em>claim under the policy covering the employed spouse\u2019s injuries. <em>See, e.g., Harris v. Security Ins. Group, </em>140 <em>N.J.Super. </em>10, 12, 354 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>A.2d 704 (App.Div.1976). In <em>Tichenor v. Santillo, </em>218 <em>N.J.Super. </em>165, 173, 527 A.2d 78 (App.Div.1987), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-5\">A <em>per quod, </em>claim is only maintainable by reason of a spouse\u2019s personal injury. It depends upon and is incidental to the personal injury action. Our courts have characterized it as a derivative claim, not a separate cause of action. Such claims must be joined with the primary claim in a single action. The derivative claim can rise no higher than the personal injury claim of the other spouse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">New Jersey courts have generally stated that in determining UIM coverage, reasonable effect should be given to the expectations of the employer and employee. <em>See, e.g., CookSauvageau v. PMA Group, </em>295 <em>N.J.Super. </em>620, 627, 685 A.2d 978 (App.Div.1996), <em>certif. denied, </em>150 <em>N.J. </em>29, 695 A.2d 671 (1997). In the present case, the language of the Harleysville policy which provides coverage for \u201c[ajnyone for damages he or she is entitled to recover because of \u2018bodily injury\u2019 sustained by another \u2018insured\u2019 \u201d is undoubtedly intended to cover an uninjured spouse\u2019s <em>per quod </em>claim. Harleysville concedes that both Michael Einwechter and Steven Warriner are insureds, although not \u201cnamed ins\u00fcreds\u201d under the Harleysville policy. Their wives\u2019 <em>per quod </em>claims are therefore also covered by the policy. <em>Cf. French v. New Jersey Sch. Bd. Ass\u2019n Ins. Group, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>478, 492, 694 A.2d 1008 (1997) (\u201c \u2018In appellate review of an insurance policy, the court construes the policy as any other contract to give effect to the parties\u2019 intentions at the time the contract was made. Where the terms of such a contract are clear, they are to be accorded their plain and ordinary meaning.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Leader Nat'l Ins. Co. v. American Hardware Ins. Group, </em>249 <em>Neb. </em>783, 545 N.W.2d 451, 455 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">The interpretation of <em>Aubrey v. Harleysville Insurance Co., </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>397, 658 A.2d 1246 (1995), on which Huron and Harleysville rely is an erroneous extension of that ease. <em>See French, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 487, 694 A.2d 1008 (\u201c[W]e intended the <em>Aubrey </em>principle to be an indication of the fair expectations of parties when there are no surer indicators of policy language or statutory policy that would provide direction concerning when a UIM policy is \u2018held\u2019 by a claimant.\u201d). Summary judgment was therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>properly granted on the ruling that Einwechter\u2019s and Warriner\u2019s wives are eligible for compensation for their <em>per quod </em>claims under the UIM coverage of the Construction Company\u2019s insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Policy language also determines which policy is primary. When determining \u2018\u201cthe issue of whether [UIM] coverage is primary, co-primary, or excess, we look to the terms of each policy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Di Ciurcio v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>299 <em>N.J.Super. </em>426, 432, 691 A.2d 396 (App.Div.1997) (quoting <em>American Reliance Ins. Co. v. American Cas. Co., </em>294 <em>N.J.Super. </em>238, 240, 683 A.2d 205 (App.Div.1996), <em>certif. denied, </em>150 <em>N.J. </em>29, 695 A.2d 671 (1997)). \u2018\u201c[W]e cannot emphasize too strongly that when an insurance policy is clear and unambiguous ... the court is bound to enforce the policy as it is written.\u2019 \u201d <em>Royal Ins. Co. v. Rutgers Cas. Ins. Co., </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>409, 416, 638 A.2d 924 (App.Div.1994) (quotation omitted), <em>quoted in French, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 492, 694 A.2d 1008.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">The Harleysville policy issued to Construction Company provides primary UIM coverage for any auto which it owns. The Penn policy issued to the Warriners provides excess UIM coverage for any auto that they do not own for which there is other primary insurance. In the December 1994 accident, the vehicle in which Michael Einwechter, Steven Warriner, and Steven R. Hammell were riding was owned by the Construction Company. Accordingly, it is clear from the language of the Harleysville and Penn policies that Harleysville provides primary coverage for Steven Warriner\u2019s UIM claim and Penn provides excess coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">Defendants\u2019 reliance on <em>Magnifico v. Rutgers Casualty Insurance Co., </em>No. A-853-95 (App.Div. Dec. 19, 1996), <em>certif. granted, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>407 (1997) and <em>Frankel v. Motor Club of America Insurance Co., </em>298 <em>N.J.Super. </em>250, 689 A.2d 728 (App.Div.1996), is misplaced. These cases are distinguishable because, in both, the person claiming coverage under a policy insuring the vehicle in which he or she was riding was not an employee of the vehicle\u2019s owner. Moreover, in <em>Magnifico, supra, </em>this court reaffirmed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>when two policies provide UIM coverage, the terms of the policies determine which policy is primary. <em>Magnifico, supra, </em>No. A-853-95 at 8. The order for summary judgment on the issue of primary coverage was therefore correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
