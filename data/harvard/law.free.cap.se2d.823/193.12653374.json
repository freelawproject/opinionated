McIntyre and Silver Oak Land Management, LLC (collectively Appellants) appeal the order of the circuit court affirming a $540,000 civil penalty imposed upon them by the Securities Commissioner of South Carolina. Because the Commissioner's administrative enforcement action deprived Appellants procedural due process, we reverse and vacate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Attorney General of South Carolina, acting as the Commissioner pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=S.C.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2035-1-601\">\n    S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 35-1-601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Supp. 2017), began this administrative enforcement action by serving Appellants with a Cease and Desist order on April 19, 2013, alleging thirty-nine acts of securities fraud related to Appellants' offer, sale, and management of interests in numerous limited liability companies (LLCs). Besides ordering Appellants to cease and desist from violating the S.C. Uniform Securities Act (the Act), the order reserved the right to levy a $10,000 civil penalty for each violation of the Act, as well as the cost of \"the investigation and proceedings,\" unless Appellants chose to let the order become effective \"by operation of law,\" as provided by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=S.C.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2035-1-604\">\n    S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 35-1-604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (Supp. 2017), in which case they would have to pay a $50,000 civil penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Appellants chose not to let the order stand and instead requested a hearing. The Commissioner appointed an assistant attorney general as the Hearing Officer. After four days of hearings, the Hearing Officer issued a Report and Recommendation,\n   concluding the LLC investments were not securities and the Cease and Desist order should be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Commissioner disagreed, finding the LLC investments were securities covered by the Act and ordering the Hearing Officer to issue another Report and Recommendation as to whether Appellants had violated the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Hearing Officer's second Report and Recommendation found Appellants had committed seventy-eight violations of the Act. After reviewing this Report and Recommendation, the Commissioner concurred in its findings but \"reiterated\" his own findings from the previous order and made new factual findings. The Commissioner reduced the number of violations to fifty-four and imposed\n   the maximum civil penalty of $10,000 for each violation, for a total penalty of $540,000. This order also required Appellants to pay the costs of the investigation and proceedings, and there was no provision allowing Appellants to contest the amount of the costs or be heard in response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Appellants petitioned the circuit court for review of the Commissioner's decision, contending the administrative proceeding violated their due process rights, the LLC investments were not securities, and substantial evidence did not support the Commissioner's findings. The circuit court affirmed the Commissioner's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Appellants claim the Commissioner denied them procedural due process by not promulgating rules for the hearing procedure. As a result, Appellants had no notice of the availability, order, or scope of opening and closing arguments; the order or burden of proof; the standard for admissibility of evidence; the existence of subpoena rights; or any other fundamental aspects of the hearing. Appellants point to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=S.C.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2035-1-605\">\n    S.C.

It was another bid dispute amidst the Procurement Code, but this time the disappointed bidder claimed its right to due process guaranteed by Article I, section 22 was violated because the Legislature-not the agency-had failed to establish procedures for hearings before the Chief Procurement Officer (CPO).\n   <em>\n    Unisys Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"223293\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/346/158/\">\n    346 S.C. at 173-74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"223293\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/346/158/\">\n    551 S.E.2d at 272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The supreme court reasoned because the procedure set forth by the Review Panel established adequate due process, there could be no substantial prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 175,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"223293\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/346/158/\">\n    551 S.E.2d at 272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As mentioned,\n   <em>\n    Unisys\n   </em>\n   found the lack of procedural safeguards at an administrative hearing was cured by the availability of de novo review by the Procurement Review Panel.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 175,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"223293\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/346/158/\">\n    551 S.E.2d at 272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Two features of the Act prevent this cure from working here. First, rather than de novo review, judicial review of the Commissioner's ruling is made using the substantial evidence standard, and-importantly-the factual findings of the Commissioner are \"conclusive\" if supported by competent, material,\n   and substantial evidence.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=S.C.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2035-1-609\">\n    S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 35-1-609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Supp. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Second, as the Act was administered here by the Commissioner, the Hearing Officer's ruling was merely advisory and intermediate. It is unclear what statutory authority empowers the Commissioner to conduct a review of the Hearing Officer's ruling, but it is clear Appellants had no opportunity to present evidence at this stage or otherwise be heard. This diluted whatever fairness and impartiality the procedure before the Hearing Officer may have had. Unlike\n   <em>\n    Unisys\n   </em>\n   , where the internal appeal to the Panel expanded the bidder's due process and cured its earlier curtailment, the Commissioner's review diminished Appellants' right to be heard. By silently reserving the right to not only reject the Hearing Officer's factual findings and rulings but to make its own findings without notice, hearing, or any further opportunity for input, the Commissioner undermined its own ad hoc procedure. A party is not entitled to a hearing at each stage of agency review, but a meaningful hearing must occur at some stage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ross v. Med.

But there is more: the rules must be made after \"notice and comment,\" a requirement critically absent from the statutory language in play in\n   <em>\n    Tall Tower\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Unisys\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .

Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 35-1-601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 609 (Supp. 2017), and, consequently, the APA's requirement that notice and comment occur before an agency's rules can become law, the Legislature required that notice and comment precede the Commissioner's rulemaking to remove any temptation\n   of the Executive Branch to amass underground regulations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 35-1-605(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Rather than complying with the Legislative directive, the Commissioner chose not to promulgate any rules regulating the conduct of or procedure appropriate for administrative hearings. This leaves the Commissioner with the awkward argument that because \u00a7 35-1-605(a)(1) uses the word \"may,\" it is not required to adopt any rules of procedure at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We find this position curious, and one that cannot survive scrutiny. That scrutiny occurs within the framework of the due process guarantees of South Carolina Constitution Article I, \u00a7 3 and \u00a7 22. We will take up \u00a7 22 first, as it applies specifically to agency actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A.\n     <em>\n      S.C. Constitution Article I, Section 22\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In 1966, the Legislature appointed a commission chaired by then Senator (later Governor) John C. West to study and propose amendments to the South Carolina Constitution. Among its recommendations, the West Committee recognized the creeping rise of the administrative state, noting agency decisions often \"are more significant than laws enacted by the General Assembly or decisions made by the courts.\"\n   <em>\n    Final Report of the Committee to Make a Study of the South Carolina Constitution of 1895\n   </em>\n   , at 21 (1969).

The Legislature's use of the word \"may\" in this context did not render the Commissioner's obligation optional. The plain meaning of \u00a7 35-1-605(a)(1) is that the Commissioner did not have to implement the Act at all, but if he chose to \"carry out\" the grant of power delegated to him by the Legislature, he would have to do so by the promulgation of rules that had been exposed to the light of public notice and comment. Otherwise, the government would be depriving a person of his property by a \"mode of procedure\" not authorized or \"prescribed\" by the Legislature. Worse, here the Commissioner deprived Appellants of significant property without\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   prescribed mode of procedure, an affront to the most basic conceptions of the rule of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1 WILLIAM BLACKSTONE, COMMENTARIES *46 (\"All laws should be therefore made to commence\n   <em>\n    in futuro\n   </em>\n   , and be notified before their commencement; which is implied in the term 'prescribed.' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Commissioner stresses that \"may\" is permissive rather than mandatory, an argument foreclosed both by the context in which \"may\" appears and the very next command of our constitution, Article I, \u00a7 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We must construe statutory words in context. \"May\" often denotes the permissive, but not always.\n   <em>\n    Robertson v.

For example, we doubt the Commissioner would argue \"may\" is permissive when it appears in \u00a7 35-1-603(c) (Supp. 2017), which states: \"[t]he Securities Commissioner may not be required to post a bond in an action or proceeding under this chapter.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Commissioner's argument that \"may\" as used in \u00a7 35-1-605(a)(1) is permissive is also answered by Article I, \u00a7 23 which provides: \"The provisions of the Constitution shall be taken, deemed, and construed to be mandatory and prohibitory, and not merely directory, except where expressly made directory or permissory by its own terms.\" S.C. Const. art. I, \u00a7 23. Taking \u00a7 22 and \u00a7 23 of Article I together, we hold that while \u00a7 35-1-605(a)(1) gave the Commissioner the discretion to implement or not implement an administrative enforcement scheme for violations of the Act, that discretion does not extend to conducting administrative hearings without first adopting procedural rules for the hearings after notice and comment.

The flexibility the cases refer to are a recognition of the many ways-large and small-a government can deprive a person of his property interests. The extent of the procedural protections due process requires corresponds to the extent of the potential deprivation.

The Commissioner imposed a civil penalty of $540,000, an eye-popping amount that would bankrupt all but the wealthiest of citizens.

Nor was the risk of criminal exposure fanciful: by the time of the administrative hearing, Appellants' conduct had been referred to the criminal division of the South Carolina Attorney General's Office. The Attorney General later indicted Appellant McIntyre for one count of violating \u00a7 35-1-508(a) and three counts of Breach of Trust with Fraudulent Intent related to his management of the LLCs. In 2016, McIntyre pled guilty to two counts of Breach of Trust with Fraudulent Intent, was sentenced to concurrent terms of ten years imprisonment suspended upon five years of probation, and ordered to pay restitution and perform community service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   While Appellants had the opportunity to cross-examine adverse witnesses and present favorable ones, without notice of set procedural rules the exercise before the Hearing Officer was riddled with procedural irregularities and plagued by a lack of order creating an intolerable risk of erroneous deprivation. No one knew what the applicable burden of proof was until after the hearing, when the Hearing Officer issued his first recommendation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Santosky v.

Appellants objected to much of the Commission's evidence, on grounds including relevance, hearsay, and authentication. The parties and the Hearing Officer spent considerable\n   time debating whether the rules of civil procedure, or evidence, or any rules at all applied. There was also substantial befuddlement over whether the parties-or the Hearing Officer for that matter-had subpoena power. Although Appellants successfully subpoenaed witnesses, no party to a proceeding carrying such high stakes should be forced to prepare their case amidst the suspense that they may not have the ability to compel the attendance of witnesses. Without rules, especially as to evidence, there were no assurances as to the reliability of the evidence considered by the Hearing Officer, aggravating the risk Appellants would be wrongfully deprived of their property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p334\">\n    424 U.S. at 334-35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p334\">\n    96 S.Ct. 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
