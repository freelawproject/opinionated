We disagree, and affirm.</p><p id=\"p-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-248(C) provides that a person guilty of second-offense cocaine distribution may \"be sentenced to imprisonment for life or for any period not less than five years, three years of which shall be a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment to be served consecutively with any other sentence.\" Subsection (C) further provides, however, that this mandatory minimum sentence \"shall not be applicable if the court finds\" that all of the factual predicates listed in subdivisions (4)(a) through (4)(e) of this subsection have been established. <em>Id</em> . Here, only the second factual predicate prescribed in subdivision (4)(b) of subsection (C) is at issue, which states: \"[t]he person did not ... possess a firearm ... in connection with the offense ....\" <em>Id</em> .</p><p id=\"p-7\">Recently in <em>Hall v.

Four times during a one-month period a confidential informant went to Stone's residence and purchased cocaine from him. Shortly after the controlled buys, the police executed a search warrant at Stone's residence. During the search, the police found, among other contraband, cocaine on Stone's person and crack cocaine in his bedroom, totaling approximately one ounce. The police also discovered a loaded AK-47 assault rifle next to his bed and a loaded AK-47 magazine in a nightstand adjacent to the firearm. This search accounted for one of Stone's cocaine distribution convictions on his guilty pleas, while the confidential informant's controlled buys accounted for Stone's other four cocaine distribution convictions-for which the three-year mandatory minimum sentences are at issue here.</p><p id=\"p-12\">The stipulated evidence thus established that Stone had been in actual or constructive possession of a firearm, i.e., an AK-47 assault rifle, at his residence during the time period when the four controlled drug buys between Stone and the confidential informant took place at that location. <em>See</em> <em>Stone</em> , <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201473619\">2018 WL 1473619</extracted-citation>, at *3-*4 (analyzing issue of constructive possession). Absent any other evidence, Stone, upon his request for application of Code \u00a7 18.2-248(C) 's safety valve exemption from the mandatory minimum sentences, plainly failed to carry his burden of establishing that he did not possess the firearm in connection with these four cocaine distribution offenses. Indeed, as the circuit court indicated in finding that Stone did not meet his burden on this issue, it was reasonable to draw the affirmative inference from the stipulated evidence that Stone in fact possessed the firearm for the protection of his illegal drug operation being conducted out of his residence. <em>See</em> <em>Thomas v.
