About 15 former students and interested individuals, led by Annie Mosby, formed the Harvey School Historical Society (\"the Historical Society\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"to restore the school to its original condition\" and to register it as a historical site. 2 J.A. at 804. The Historical Society operated as a non-profit organization. Its mission was \"to purchase, restore, preserve, and maintain the Harvey Colored School as a historical site.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 801-02. Mosby lived in California and directed the Historical Society's activities from there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Seeking tax-exempt status, the Historical Society became an \"auxiliary\" of the Mount Lebanon Missionary Baptist Church (the \"Church\") in 2003.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 800, 811-12, 817-18. The record is unclear regarding the precise nature of this informal relationship. Practically speaking, however, the relationship appears merely to have allowed the Historical Society to meet in the Church building. The Church provided no financial support to the Historical Society, and the two entities maintained separate bank accounts. The Church neither participated in the decisions that the Historical Society made nor exercised any control over the Historical Society.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2012, Mosby entered into an agreement with William Johnson, an unlicensed contractor, to relocate and renovate the School. Having no construction experience, Mosby relied entirely on Johnson to plan and perform the renovation. While she was briefly present on site at the beginning of the project, Mosby lived in California and did not exercise any control over Johnson or over any aspect of his working conditions. Johnson initially worked with one other individual on the job, but he later asked Mosby for permission to hire Jeffreys as well. Mosby agreed. Johnson was the \"boss\" on the job,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 522, 700, and exclusively managed Jeffreys on the worksite. Johnson kept records of Jeffreys's work hours and reported them to Mosby for payment. Mosby never met Jeffreys and did not know his name prior to his injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   While working for Johnson, Jeffreys was badly injured when a beam fell from the roof of the school building and struck him on the neck. He filed a claim for workers' compensation benefits against Mosby, the Church, and the Historical Society - but not against Johnson. Because none of the defendants had workers' compensation insurance, the Uninsured Employer's Fund (\"UEF\") was also made a party. Jeffreys argued that Mosby, the Church, and the Historical Society were his direct employers and thus owed him compensation. In the alternative, Jeffreys contended, each defendant was his statutory employer pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-302 because he had been performing work within their trade, business, or occupation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A deputy commissioner agreed that Jeffreys had been the direct employee of the Historical Society as well as Mosby, who was acting as the Historical Society's \"agent,\" and that the Historical Society was in turn \"a part of the Church, making the Church an employer of\" Jeffreys as well. 2 J.A. at 879-81. The deputy commissioner entered an award against the Church. The full Commission disagreed in part, holding that Mosby was not Jeffreys's direct employer because she had lacked any meaningful control over his work or over how he performed it. However, the Commission affirmed the deputy commissioner's award against the Church because no party had appealed that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Court of Appeals affirmed the Commission's finding that Mosby was not Jeffreys's direct employer, reversed the Commission's finding that the UEF had waived its argument regarding the Church and the Historical Society, and remanded the case for further factfinding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Uninsured Emp'r's Fund v. Jeffreys\n   </em>\n   , Record No. 1676-15-3,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201637823\">\n    2016 WL 1637823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 26, 2016) (unpublished). On remand, the Commission held that \"there was insufficient evidence to conclude the Historical Society and the Church were the claimant's employer.\" 2 J.A. at 1034. Neither had exercised any control over Jeffreys. Instead, Johnson had \"recruited\" Jeffreys, had told Jeffreys \"what to do each day, [had] kept track of his hours and [had been] the 'boss' on the project.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1035. Moreover, the Commission added, \"Johnson was not an employee of Mosby either.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Johnson \"was free to adopt the methods he needed to accomplish the result\" and to decide \"what materials were needed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Johnson was, at most, \"an independent contractor,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1036, and thus, Jeffreys, who worked under Johnson, could not have been a direct employee of any of the individual defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Having held that none of the three individual defendants were Jeffreys's direct employer, the Commission turned to the statutory-employer argument. \"There is no evidence the Church and Historical Society were in the construction business,\" the Commission stated, \"[h]ence there is no statutory employer situation at issue here.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Jeffreys appealed\n   again to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the Commission's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On appeal to us, Jeffreys contends that the Court of Appeals and the Commission erroneously held that the Church and the Historical Society were not his statutory employers. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Workers' Compensation Act requires an employment relationship of some kind to exist between a claimant and the party allegedly liable for compensation. The usual scenario is a true employer-employee relationship in which the employer controls the employee's jobsite conditions, employment tasks, and working hours. In 1991, however, the General Assembly enacted Code \u00a7 65.2-302, which created a new category of employment relationship called \"Statutory employer.\" In relevant part, that section provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   A. When any person (referred to in this section as \"owner\") undertakes to perform or execute any work which is a part of his trade, business or occupation and contracts with any other person (referred to in this section as \"subcontractor\") for the execution or performance by or under such subcontractor of the whole or any part of the work undertaken by such owner, the owner shall be liable to pay to any worker employed in the work any compensation under this title which he would have been liable to pay if the worker had been immediately employed by him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   B. When any person (referred to in this section as \"contractor\") contracts to perform or execute any work for another person which work or undertaking is not a part of the trade, business or occupation of such other person and contracts with any other person (referred to in this section as \"subcontractor\") for the execution or performance by or under the subcontractor of the whole or any part of the work undertaken by such contractor, then the contractor shall be liable to pay to any worker employed in the work any compensation under this title which he would have been liable to pay if that worker had been immediately employed by him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   C. When the subcontractor in turn contracts with still another person (also referred to as \"subcontractor\") for the performance or execution by or under such last subcontractor of the whole or any part of the work undertaken by the first subcontractor, then the liability of the owner or contractor shall be the same as the liability imposed by subsections A and B of this section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Code \u00a7 65.2-302(A)-(C).\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Lawrence J. Pascal, Virginia Workers' Compensation Law and Practice \u00a7 2.08[3][a]-[b], at 2-35 to -39 (4th ed. 2011).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Subsection A addresses the scenario in which \"any person\" contracts with an independent contractor to perform work within the \"trade, business or occupation\" of that \"any person.\" Code \u00a7 65.2-302(A). This situation often occurs when a business outsources its own unique \"trade, business or occupation,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , to an independent contractor, for example, when a roofing company hires an independent contractor to repair a roof. In these situations, we have applied what has become known as the normal-work test, which asks whether the activity in which the independent contractor engages is \"\n   <em>\n    normally\n   </em>\n   carried on through employees rather than independent contractors.\"\n   <em>\n    Shell Oil Co. v.

When this takes place, Party X becomes the statutory employer of Party Y's employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Subsection B involves a three-tiered scenario: A \"person\" hires a contractor to perform work\n   <em>\n    outside\n   </em>\n   the scope of\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   person's \"trade, business or occupation.\" Code \u00a7 65.2-302(B). The contractor then hires a subcontractor to do some or all of that work. In this scenario, we have applied what has become known as the subcontracted-fraction test.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cooke v. Skyline Swannanoa, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2076427\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/226/154/#p158\">\n    226 Va. 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 158-59,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=307%20S.E.2d%20246\">\n    307 S.E.2d 246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983). An example of this scenario would be where a banker - whose business is banking rather than construction - enters into a contract with a general contractor to build a home, and the general contractor in turn relies on subcontractors (e.g., firms employing framers, brick masons, electricians, etc.) to complete the job.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The general contractor, not the banker, becomes the statutory employer of the subcontractors' employees.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Cinnamon v.

We frequently apply this simple principle\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   but guard against doing so simplistically.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Our caution stems from the unique nature of the Workers' Compensation Act. The Act reflects a legislative \"quid pro quo\" that gave workers the right to assert no-fault liability against their employers (a right that they had never possessed) and took from them the right to sue their employers in tort for negligence (a right that they had possessed under the common law).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The liberal-construction principle, if misapplied, could upset this delicate balance. A view of the Act's coverage that is too broad would authorize an award of compensation benefits but would bar a tort recovery, and a view that is too narrow would authorize a tort recovery but would bar an award of compensation benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Jeffreys contends that he lost his claim for compensation benefits because the Court of Appeals and the Commission had failed to interpret Code \u00a7 65.2-302 liberally in his favor. This result is illiberal, however, only because Jeffreys has no viable negligence claim against the Church or the Historical Society. If he had such a claim and had asserted it, the Church and the Historical Society - not Jeffreys - would be insisting that Code \u00a7 65.2-302 be construed broadly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Code \u00a7 65.2-307(A) ; Pascal,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 2.08[3][a], at 2-36 (4th ed. 2011). A precedent-setting construction of the Act cannot depend on whether the injured worker is before the Commission seeking an expansive application of the Act's coverage or before a circuit court seeking a restrictive application.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   A uniform principle of law, by its nature, cannot fluctuate based upon the forum in which it is advocated or the identity of its advocates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Rightly applied, the liberal-construction principle means only that an interpretation of the Workers' Compensation Act should take into account the humane, beneficent purposes embedded in the legislative quid pro quo. That interpretative preset does not \"permit a liberal construction to change the meaning of the statutory language or the purpose of the Act,\"\n   <em>\n    American Furniture Co. v.

Rather, the members of the Historical Society engaged in fundraising activities and activities designed to encourage community support for their project. Correspondence between Mosby and members of the Historical Society established that the Historical Society intended to hire contractors to dismantle, move, and rebuild the school, and the evidence presented in this case did not imply that members of the Historical Society intended to participate in this project.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   We acknowledge that the restoration of the Harvey School necessarily involved certain construction-related activities. The complete reconstruction of the school building, however, fell outside of any routine restoration work. While the Historical Society was formed to \"restore\" the school, its \"trade, business, or occupation\" did not include the complete reconstruction of the building.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   For these reasons, we conclude that the reconstruction of the Harvey School was not the Historical Society's \"trade, business, or occupation.\" The complete reconstruction of the school was beyond the restoration project envisioned by the Historical Society, and its members were not involved in the reconstruction project or other construction activities.

For purposes of Code \u00a7 65.2-302, there was no dispute that the developer's trade, business, or occupation included building the condominiums and developing the surrounding property.

To Jeffreys, these statements suggest that the Commission and the Court of Appeals misunderstood the proper legal standard. We find no merit in this assertion because \"we will not fix upon isolated statements of the [Court of Appeals or the Commission] taken out of the full context in which they were made, and use them as a predicate for holding the law has been misapplied,\"\n    <em>\n     Yarborough v.
