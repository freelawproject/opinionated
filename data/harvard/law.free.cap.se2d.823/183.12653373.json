Odom (Husband) appeals the family court's divorce decree, arguing the family court erred in (1) finding that Husband's limited liability company, Twin Oaks Villas, LLC (the LLC), transmuted into marital property; (2) imposing a constructive trust on the LLC; and (3) including property in the\n   marital estate that the parties did not own as of the date of filing. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Husband and Wife married on April 27, 2006. This was both parties' third marriage. They had no children together during their eight-year marriage; however, each party had two adult children from prior marriages. Wife filed for divorce on May 30, 2013, citing a one-year continuous separation as of December 15, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Prior to the parties' marriage, Husband formed two businesses: the LLC and Twin Oaks Personal Care, Inc. (the Corporation). The LLC owned a building in North Charleston, South Carolina. The Corporation managed and ran an assisted living facility in the LLC's building. Husband was the sole member of the LLC and the sole stockholder in the Corporation. In 1994, Husband approached Wife, a family friend at the time, for a $60,000 loan to refinance the entities. In 2003, Wife left college to work for the entities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Wife testified that during the marriage she assisted Husband in making business decisions for the LLC, worked without pay at times, invested in the entities in lieu of putting funds in a retirement account, and assisted in obtaining a $2.4 million Housing and Urban Development (HUD) loan for the LLC. She also testified that during the marriage she devoted\n   her time and money into the entities as an investment for herself and her children and believed Husband regarded the entities as marital property. Wife and Wife's son (Son) testified Husband held Wife out as a fifty-fifty partner in the Corporation and the LLC during the marriage. Wife testified Husband assured her he would complete the necessary paperwork to transfer fifty percent ownership to Wife after he obtained a HUD loan during the marriage; however, Husband never transferred the shares to Wife. Husband claimed that when the parties separated on December 15, 2012, Wife's involvement with the Corporation and the LLC ceased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 15, 2008, Husband entered into an installment sales contract with Husband's Uncle, Ruben Odom (Uncle), for Husband to acquire 30.05 acres of land (the Ruben Odom Property) from Uncle for $60,092.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Husband used marital funds to pay a $10,000 down payment and for two of the three $16,679.99 monthly installment payments to Uncle, as lienholder. In June 2010, Husband notified Uncle of his inability to pay the outstanding $17,522.31 balance, and the parties refinanced the monthly payments to $282.20. However, Husband again defaulted on monthly payments, and Uncle filed a complaint for foreclosure on the Ruben Odom Property. Using marital funds, Husband paid Uncle a total of $48,445 under the installment contract but still owed $11,647.46. On April 18, 2013, Husband, without Wife's knowledge, executed a quitclaim deed which conveyed the Ruben Odom Property to Uncle in lieu of foreclosure. On July 3, 2013, Husband filed a corrective quitclaim deed, to correct the property description on the Ruben Odom Property deed. Prior to Uncle's April 3, 2013 complaint for foreclosure, Husband, without Wife's knowledge, conveyed 251 acres of nonmarital property-worth $452,939-to SJW Holdings, LLC, his ex-wife's LLC, to hold in trust for Husband's daughters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On July 9, 2013, the family court entered an order restraining the parties from disposing of or encumbering or reducing in value, any properties or assets, including the LLC. However, on December 18, 2013, Husband entered into an agreement to sublease the entities' operations, building, and land for $6,250 a month without Wife's knowledge. On October 28,\n   2014, prior to the conclusion of mediation, Husband abruptly left the mediation and willfully failed to disclose his whereabouts during litigation. Husband failed to appear for the merits hearing, present evidence, or respond to Wife's requests for admissions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On August 17, 2015, the family\n   court issued a final order, including both entities and the Ruben Odom Property in the marital estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 7, 2016, in response to a motion by Husband to alter or set aside the judgment, the family court entered an amended final order. The court found the Ruben Odom Property constituted marital property and awarded Wife a $48,445-equal to the total marital funds invested in the property-interest in the property. Based on evidence that the parties worked jointly as partners throughout the marriage and that Husband promised Wife an interest in the business, the court found the Corporation and the LLC each transmuted into marital property, as well as the $6,250 monthly rent payment. The court awarded Husband possession, use, and ownership of the entities; awarded Wife a one-half interest in the entities; and ordered a judgment in favor of Wife in the amount of $590,018 to effectuate a fifty-fifty division. The court awarded Wife an equitable interest in the entities by virtue of a constructive trust and imposed a judicial lien on the entities, in favor of Wife, to secure the $590,018 judgment. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES ON APPEAL\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I.

The record reflects Wife provided a benefit to the LLC in the form of a HUD loan. Wife testified the $25,000 she invested to upgrade the LLC's buildings' telephone system and the $17,400 she invested to make noncritical building repairs were both necessary to procure the HUD loan. The HUD loan, which Wife helped procure and later repay, was obtained for the benefit of the LLC, because the LLC, not the Corporation, was appraised in connection with the HUD loan in 2009. Based on the 2009 appraisal of $3.2 million, the parties obtained a $2.4 million HUD loan. Taking into account all debts, the LLC was valued at $1,130,649 in 2012.

Wife testified Husband assured her he would complete the necessary paperwork for a share\n   change after the completion of the HUD loan.
