The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff <em>Held, </em>that the defendants\u2019 exceptions must be overruled.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-9\">Tout, for personal injuries occasioned to the plaintiff by a defect in a highway in the defendant town. At the trial, in the Superior Court, before <em>Corcoran, </em>J., the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions. The facts, so far as material to the point decided, appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b407-10\">G. <em>T. Dewey &amp; T. G.

There was another stone at this place, and another from five to twelve feet west of the culvert, and another eighty-five feet west of the culvert. There \u25a0were also two stones east of and near to the culvert. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>material part of the notice was as follows: \u201c The said defect consisted of several cider barrels lying on the southerly side of said highway, and under a railing at said culvert, within a foot or so of the wheel tracks, and a large stone lying on the opposite side of said way, and very near the travelled part of said way, and said way being at this place less than fourteen feet wride.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">It cannot be required of a notice in all cases that, when it is applied to the ground, it then should identify the objects referred to. Sometimes those objects have disappeared in the course of nature, as happens with snow and ice; sometimes they have been removed by third persons, as was admitted in this case with regard to the barrels, and as was alleged with regard to the stone. The barrels were a proper object to refer to for the purpose of identifying the place of the stone, and the mode of reference excluded the stones east of the culvert, and fitted a stone thirty-nine feet west of it better than it did one twelve or one eighty-five feet west of the culvert, neither of which would have been so nearly opposite the barrels.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The considerations which we have mentioned, if not enough to save the notice, a question on which we express no opinion, at least are enough to warrant a finding of good faith. When it is added that the notice was signed by lawyers, and sent evidently with a view to hold the town, any other inference would be absurd. The town cannot have been misled. At most, it was insufficiently instructed. See <em>Liffin </em>v. <em>Beverly, </em>145 Mass. 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
