In answer to interrogatories, A., who was the principal defendant\u2019s daughter, stated that she had a mortgage of the piano given to her by the principal defendant to secure a promissory note also given to her by the principal defendant, but she was not asked, and did not state, what was due on the mortgage; and B., who was the principal defendant\u2019s brother, stated that he took a mortgage of the piano from the principal defendant for $75 lent her at the time, which she had never repaid to-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>him, but which she still owed. The principal defendant, who was the only witness at the trial, testified that she bought the piano for $400, and had paid for it in full; that she gave a mortgage of it to A. for $400, of which $150 was paid by A. at the time, and the remaining $250 was due A. for work performed by her for the principal defendant; that the principal defendant had paid no part of the $400 to A.; that she afterwards gave a bill of sale of the piano to A.; and that, previously to the sale to A., the principal 'defendant gave a second mortgage of the piano to B., who paid her $75 at the time, which she had not repaid to him. The court, sitting without a jury, found that the mortgages were valid subsisting mortgages at the time the attachment was made; and that there was then due to A. upon her mortgage $150, and to B. upon his mortgage $75. <em>Held,, </em>that, if the plaintiff could contradict the answers of the trustees, the findings of the court were justified by the evidence, and, if he could not contradict the answers, there was nothing to impair the validity of the mortgages; and\" that it was competent for the court to find, from the principal defendant\u2019s testimony as to the consideration of the mortgage to A., the amount due on it to A.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-5\">Trustee process. Writ dated May 19, 1891, upon which the plaintiff attached, as the property of the principal defendant, and as in her possession, a certain piano, then in the house occupied by her, upon which, at the date of the attachment, May 20, 1891, there were of record two mortgages given by her, one to Sarah F. Heald, dated December 21, 1889, for the nominal consideration of $400, and one to Frank H. Howe, dated May 17, 1890, for the nominal consideration of $75. Sarah F. Heald and Frank H.

Hayward v. <em>George, </em>13 Allen, 66. <em>Goulding </em>v. <em>Hair, </em>133 Mass. 78. Instead of that, the trustees answered, \u201c No funds,\u201d which was in effect submitting themselves to examination touching the validity of their mortgages and the amounts due upon them, and so the plaintiff seems to have understood it. <em>Goulding </em>v. <em>Hair, ubi supra; Simmons </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>144 Mass. 385, 389. <em>Emery </em>v. <em>Seavey, </em>148 Mass. 566. He interrogated them, and they answered under oath, and the questions and answers form' a part of the bill of exceptions. There is nothing in the answers tending to show that the mortgages were not valid. On the contrary, Frank H. Howe, one of the alleged trustees, answered that he took a mortgage on a piano from the principal defendant for seventy-five dollars lent her at the time, which he had never been repaid, and for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>which she was still indebted to him. Sarah F. Heald, the other trustee, answered that she had a mortgage on a piano given to her by the principal defendant, to secure a note given to her, by the principal defendant. She did not state how much was due on the mortgage, and the interrogatories did not call for it. If we assume that the plaintiff could contradict the answers of the alleged trustees, then, taking all the testimony in the case, the findings of the court were justified by it, although a portion of the evidence of the principal defendant may have tended to show that the mortgages were paid by a surrender of the piano. If the plaintiff could not contradict the answers of the trustees, then there was nothing to impair the validity of the mortgages. The answer of Howe stated how much was due him on his mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">It was competent for the court to find, from the principal defendant\u2019s testimony as to the consideration of the mortgage, the amount due on it to Sarah F. Heald. Her testimony on that point tended to sustain, and not to contradict, the answers of the trustees, by showing that there was a valid mortgage, and related to a matter on which the trustees had not been interrogated and had made no statement. - Pub.
