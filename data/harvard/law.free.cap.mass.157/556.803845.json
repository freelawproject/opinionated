Sts. c. 207, \u00a7 25, means the oral charge which may be made to a proper magistrate or court, and which is to be reduced to writing by the magistrate or court.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-9\">Tort, for assault and battery. The defendant pleaded justification as a duly qualified police officer, and recited in his answer \u201c that the plaintiff was arrested by the defendant on October 10, 1890, for being intoxicated and committing a breach of the peace in a public place, . . . and the plaintiff, having been arrested by the defendant as aforesaid, assaulted the defendant with a weapon dangerous to life.\u201d The arrest was without a warrant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-10\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before Thompson, J., the defendant testified that he arrested the plaintiff both for being intoxicated and committing a breach of the peace, and that, while having him in custody and taking him to the lockup, the plaintiff made an assault upon him with a knife, and cut his cheek with the knife; that the next morning he took the plaintiff before the Police Court of Chelsea, and stated to the court the facts as to the plaintiff\u2019s intoxication and breach of the peace, and the assault with the knife; that he was ready to make complaint in writing against him for drunkenness, breach of the peace, and assault with the knife, and ready to testify, but the court received the complaint for the assault with the knife, and the plaintiff was held and tried thereon, and no written complaint was made for drunkenness or for a breach of the peace.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-11\">The arrest was made under the Pub. Sts. c. 207, \u00a7 25, which provides that \u201c whoever is found in a state of intoxication in a public place, or is found in any place in a state of intoxication committing a breach of the peace or disturbing others by noise, may be arrested without a warrant by a . . . police officer, and kept <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>in custody in some suitable place until he is so far recovered from his intoxication as to render it proper to carry him before a court or trial justice. The officer may then make a complaint against him for the crime of drunkenness.\u201d The plaintiff requested the judge to instruct the jury that the word \u201c complaint\u201d in the closing clause of the Pub. Sts. c. 207, \u00a7 25, meant an accusation of crime or offence in writing subscribed by\u2019 the complainant, which request was refused. The judge instructed the jury \u201c as matter of law, that if the officer went to the court and complained to the court \u2014 and it need not be in writing \u2014 that the plaintiff was guilty of a breach of the peace, and of drunkenness, and that he arrested him for both, and had him before the court to be dealt with, . . . and stated that the plaintiff made an assault upon him with a knife, the officer had performed his whole duty, so far as the making of the complaint was concerned, if he was there ready to subscribe to such a complaint as the court might reduce to writing, and to appear as a witness in the case to testify.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-5\">The jury returned a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b581-6\"><em>J. E. Hanly, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b581-7\"><em>J. F. </em>Wheeler, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b581-8\">Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATl\">The word \u201c complaint,\u201d as used in the statutes of this Commonwealth in reference to criminal offences, sometimes means the formal written charge of crime to which the accused person is to answer, and sometimes it means the oral charge which may be made to a proper magistrate or court, and which is to be reduced to writing by the magistrate or court. It is used in the latter sense in Pub. Sts. c. 207, \u00a7 25. The officer may make the arrest without a warrant, and, after the person arrested is so far recovered from his intoxication as to render it proper to carry him before a court or trial justice, the officer is to make a complaint against him for the crime of drunkenness. By Pub. Sts. c. 212, \u00a7 15, \u201c Upon complaint made to any such magistrate that a criminal offence has been committed, he shall examine on oath the complainant and any witnesses produced by him, shall reduce the complaint to writing,\u201d etc. A similar use of the word \u201c complaint,\u201d as signifying merely an oral charge, which is to be reduced to writing by the magistrate or court, is found in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>Pub. Sts. c. 211, \u00a7 2, and also in c. 89, \u00a7 18. It was not necessary for the defendant to make his complaint in writing, and the plaintiff\u2019s request for instructions was properly refused. <em>Conant </em>v.
