The prayer was that the company be enjoined from issuing bonds to a large amount, excepting with and subject to a stipulation that the bonds should be subordinated to the rights and priority of the plaintiffs and other holders of the first preferred stock during the pendency of the suit, and that on a final hearing the injunction should be made perpetual.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-5\">Among other defences in the defendant\u2019s answer and demurrer was the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-6\">\u201cAnd the defendant says that the plaintiffs have brought in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Missouri a suit in equity, which is now pending in the said court, in which suit this defendant is one of the defendants; and that the plaintiffs in their bill in the said suit in Missouri pray that this defendant, and its officers and agents in that behalf, be restrained and enjoined from issuing any of this defendant\u2019s consolidated mortgage bonds, which are the same bonds the issuing of which the plaintiffs seek to enjoin by this suit.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-7\">A copy of the bill was annexed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-8\">Hearing before <em>Barker, </em>J., who reserved the case for the determination of the full court, such decree to be entered as justice and equity may require.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b32-9\"><em>J.

The most that we can do, if they have the right they claim, is to reduce it to <em>res judicata. </em>Whether they have that right is a question of Missouri law touching the internal affairs of a Missouri corporation. The objection to our proceeding with the case was taken at the outset, and we are of opinion that it must prevail. We assume, for the purposes of decision, that we have jurisdiction in such a sense that, if we proceeded to a decree upon the merits, it would be binding in Missouri. But it seems to us clear that, as among the States of this Union, the plaintiffs ought to resort in the first instance to that court which alone can declare the law of the case with authority, and can compel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>obedience to it by force. It would be a misuse of our powers to attempt to control the action of those courts in a case like this, by an adjudication which would depend upon them for enforcement, and which they might say had mistaken the Missouri law. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Mutual Ins.
