Jones, who, as the amended declaration alleges, was instantly killed, on April 22, 1889, and died without conscious suffering. An administrator of his estate was appointed on June 3, 1889, and within thirty days thereafter he gave' the defendant a notice in the form required by the statute. The demurrer was sustained in the Superior Court, and judgment ordered for the defendant, and the plaintiff appealed. The judgment was rendered before the decision of this court in <em>Daly </em>v. <em>New Jersey Steel &amp; Iron Co. </em>155 Mass. 1. In the opinion in that case it was said, \u201cThe language of the statute [1887] is undoubtedly quite obscure in this provision respecting notice,\u201d etc., and the difficulty of construing it, and of reconciling the decision in that case with that in <em>Gustafsen </em>v. <em>Washburn &amp; Moen Manuf. </em>Co. 153 Mass. 468, was noticed. We see, however, no sufficient season for reconsidering either of these decisions. If the construction put upon the statute by these decisions does not conform to the intention of the Legislature, the statute can be so amended as to leave no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>doubt of its meaning. See St. 1892, c. 260. The case cannot be distinguished from <em>Daly </em>v. <em>New Jersey Steel </em>&amp; <em>Iron Co. </em>The entry must be,</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed; demurrer overruled</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>*</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b76-13\"> A similar decision was made in Suffolk, on the same day, in the case of</p>\n<p id=\"AWG\">Ellen Dickerman <em>vs. </em>Old Colony Railroad Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-14\">Tort, under the St. of 1887, c. 270, for causing the death of George H.

Dickerman was duly appointed administrator of the estate of George H. Dickerman, and, on October 9,1890, gave to the defendant the notice required by the statute.
