Sts. c. 68, \u00a7 16, to the First District Court of Bristol, alleging that the defendant, on November 17, 1891, at Easton, \u201c did go about from place to place carrying and exposing for sale oleomargarine and butterine,\u201d the defendant \u201c not having then and there any license, appointment, or other authority according to law to so carry and expose for sale said oleomargarine and butterine, against the peace,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-15\">At the trial in the Superior Court, on appeal, before the jury were impanelled, the defendant moved to quash the complaint, for the following reasons: \u201c 1. It describes no offence known to the law. 2. As a complaint under the law against hawkers and pedlers, Pub. Sts. c. 68, \u00a7 16, it cannot be sustained, because the provisions of that law do not now apply to the sale of oleomargarine and butterine.\u201d Braley, J. overruled the motion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-16\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b416-17\"><em>J.

The defendant contends, and the government concedes, that it is based upon the Pub. Sts. c. 68, \u00a7 16. The St. of 1886, c. 317, \u00a7 4, requires that every person who conveys\" oleomargarine or butterine in carriages or otherwise, for the purpose of selling the same in any city or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>town, shall be licensed by the inspectors of milk of such city or town to sell the same within the limits thereof. But the remainder of the section makes it clear that it was intended to apply only to sales from carriages or other vehicles. As the present complaint has no allegation that the defendant carried or exposed the articles in a carriage or other vehicle, it could not be sustained as a complaint under the St. of 1886, c. 317, \u00a7 4, and we consider it as based upon the Pub. Sts. c. 68, \u00a7 16. So considered, it cannot be sustained. Oleomargarine and butterine are provisions. The word includes all articles of food. The articles with which it is charged the defendant went about, and which he exposed and sold, are therefore included among those \"which any person may go about selling or exposing for sale under the authority of the Pub. Sts. c. 68, \u00a7 1; and the acts charged are not prohibited by the Pub. Sts. c. 68, \u00a7 16. The complaint therefore alleges no offence, and the defendant cannot be convicted under it. His bill of exceptions is inartificially drawn, but we construe it as intended to raise the question here decided. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Washburn, </em>128 Mass. 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
