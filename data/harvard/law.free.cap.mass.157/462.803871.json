In the Superior Court, the defendant moved to quash the indictment for the following reasons: \u201c 1. Because no crime or offence is fully, plainly, substantially, and formally described or set out therein. 2. Because it sets out no crime or offence against the laws of the land or the statutes of this Commonwealth. 3. Because it is insufficient and bad in law on the face of it. 4. Because it is vague, indefinite, uncertain, and ambiguous. 5. Because no indictment has been found in the case in which the alleged perjury was committed.\u201d This motion was disallowed; and the defendant appealed to this court. The facts material to the point decided appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b486-11\"><em>T. H.

Keane . . . falsely to depose, say, and give evidence upon his oath,\u201d etc. The defendant contends that the indictment is bad, because it does not charge that he \u201c corruptly \u201d did the acts set forth. But, without now determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>whether this objection would have been good if properly taken, it is not open on the motion to quash, because, if the indictment is defective, the defect is merely formal and should have been assigned specifically, under the rule laid down in Pub. Sts. c. 214, \u00a7 25. If it had been thus specifically assigned, the district attorney might have thought it better to wait till a new indictment could be found, before subjecting the Commonwealth to the expense of a trial on the merits. Under this statute, if a defendant relies on a formal defect in the indictment, he must point it out; and if he goes to trial without having done so, the objection is no longer open to him. The present case falls within this rule. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schaffner, </em>146 Mass. 512. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jenks, </em>138 Mass. 484. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mur</em>ray, 135 Mass. 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">We can take no notice of the other objections urged in the defendant\u2019s brief, because no facts to support them are before us. <em>Motion to quash rightly disallowed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
