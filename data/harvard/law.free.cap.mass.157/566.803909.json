The judge declined to rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>on this motion until the principal defendant\u2019s evidence had been put in. That was done, and the principal defendant then renewed his motion to dismiss, which the judge took under advisement. The plaintiff asked leave to amend her writ, in case the judge should rule that the action was not maintainable on the ground taken by the principal defendant. Subsequently, the judge denied the motion to amend, and allowed the motion to dismiss; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b591-5\"><em>T.

If it was in the power of the court to allow an amendment which would change the nature of the proceedings, and give jurisdiction to render a judgment against the principal defendant, he having answered generally and without objection until after the plaintiff\u2019s evidence had been introduced, it was within the discretion of the court to refuse to allow such an amendment, and to the exercise of the discretion no exception lies.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
