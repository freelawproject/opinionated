Sts. c. 100, \u00a7 25, requesting a person not to sell liquor to her husband, it is not necessary that the notice shall be signed in her own proper handwriting.

Sts. c. 100, \u00a7 25, the plaintiff must have given \u201cnotice in writing, signed by . . . her,\u201d in order to recover. A notice in writing was given bearing her name, but her name was written by another person, at her request and in her presence, she knowing and understanding the contents and object of the notice. The question is, whether this was a good notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-13\">The defendant chiefly relies upon the rule for the construction of statutes given in Pub. Sts, c. 3, \u00a7 3, cl. 25, which is as follows : \u201c The words ' written \u2019 and ' 1 in writing \u2019 may include print<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>ing, engraving, lithographing, and any other mode of representing words and letters; but when the written signature of a person is required by law, it shall always be the proper handwriting of such person, or, in case he is unable to write, his proper mark.\u201d The argument is that the \u201c written signature \u201d of the plaintiff was required in this ease, though the statute only says \u201c signed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">This rule for the construction of statutes was copied literally from the Gen. Sts. c. 3, \u00a7 7, cl. 20, and it originated in Rev. Sts. c. 2, \u00a7 6, cl. 19, the first portion, as to the words \u201c written \u201d and \u201c in writing,\u201d being an adoption of the decision in <em>Henshaw </em>v. Foster, 9 Pick. 312. No explanation of the meaning intended by the latter portion of the rule is given by the commissioners in their report on the Revised Statutes. But in giving a construction to a rule of this description, regard must be paid to the state of the law in respect to signatures, as it was at the time the rule was enacted, and to the usages which then prevailed. It was and still is very generally held that when a document is required by the common law or by statute to be \u201c signed \u201d by a person, a signature of his name in his own proper or personal handwriting is not required. For example, in the case of wills, it has long been well established that neither the testator nor the attesting witnesses need sign in that manner. <em>Nickerson </em>v. <em>Buck, </em>12 Cush. 332. <em>Lord </em>v. <em>Lord, </em>58 N.

In like manner, a deed signed with the grantor\u2019s name, in his presence and by his request, though by a stranger, is sufficiently well executed. The signing in such case is deemed to be the grantor\u2019s act. <em>Gardner </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>v. <em>Gardner, </em>5 Cush. 483. <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Goodridge, </em>6 Cush. 117. <em>Burns </em>v.

See <em>Merrifield </em>v. <em>Parritt, </em>11 Cush. <em>590; Commonwealth </em>v. Ray, 3 Gray, 441; <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Lynde, </em>1 Allen, 402; <em>Greenfield Bank </em>v. <em>Crafts, </em>4 Allen, 447; <em>Boardman </em>v. <em>Spooner, </em>13 Allen, 353, 358; <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Drake, </em>100 Mass. 174; <em>Wellington </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>121 Mass. 157; <em>Dublin </em>v. <em>Judge, </em>11 Irish Law, 8; Story on Agency, \u00a7 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">In England, in some instances, depending on the construction of particular statutes, a signature in the proper handwriting of the person has been held necessary. <em>Hyde </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>2 Bing. N. C. 776. <em>Toms </em>v. <em>Cuming, </em>7 M. &amp; G. 88. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>28 L. T. (N. S.) 232. In other cases, however, statutes calling for signatures have not received so strict a construction, and a signing in other forms has been held sufficient. <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Justices of Kent, </em>L. R. 8 Q. B. 305, 307. <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Brumfitt, </em>L. R. 3 C. P. 28. <em>In re Whitley, </em>32 Ch. D. 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">It has never been supposed that the statutory rule of construction now under consideration, as to written signatures, had so wide a scope as to set aside the established doctrines of law as to signatures, and to require a signature in the proper handwriting of a person in all cases where a document is to be signed by him; and such a construction should not be given to it, unless that clearly appears to have been the intention of the Legislature. We think it was intended to require a signature in the proper handwriting of a person only in those cases where, by express language, or by usage, or by implication arising from the nature of the document to be signed, a written signature is required by law, as the direct personal act of the person whose name is to be signed. Numerous instances of this character are to be found in the Constitution and statutes. For example, a certain oath is required to be taken and subscribed by every person chosen or appointed to any office (Amend, to Mass. Const., Art. VI.); and the oaths of the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, and Councillors are to be taken and subscribed in the presence of the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>houses of assembly. Const. Mass. pt. 2, c. 6, Art. I. For various statutes respecting the taking and subscribing of oaths by different officers, by insolvent debtors, and by poor debtors, see Pub. Sts. c. 14, \u00a7 55; c. 18, \u00a7\u00a7 10,14 ; c. 21, \u00a7\u00a7 3,.4; c. 27, \u00a7 88; c. 157, \u00a7 76; c. 158, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 6 ; c. 162, \u00a7 38. Various certificates also are to be made by different public officers, which according to usage bear their signatures in their own handwriting, such as certificates of the acknowledgment of deeds, and of the taking of oaths. See Pub. Sts. c. 27, \u00a7 88 ; c. 120, \u00a7 6 ; c. 150, \u00a7 5 ; c. 157, \u00a7 77 ; c. 162, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, 17, 19, 40; c. 169, \u00a7\u00a7 40, 48. Commissioners to take acknowledgments in other States and in foreign countries must file in the office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth impressions of their seals, together with their oaths of office and their signatures. This must necessarily imply signatures in the proper handwriting of such commissioners. Another illustration is found in the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution, though this was not adopted till after the establishment of the statutory rule under consideration. This amendment provides that no person shall have the right to vote or be eligible to office who shall not be able to read the Constitution in the English language, and write his name. A signature in the proper handwriting of the voter or officer is plainly contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Without going further, it is apparent that there are many instances where it may well be deemed that a \u201c written signature \u201d is required by law, without including the ordinary cases of wills, deeds, contracts, notices, demands, and other documents, where the nature of the case does not require such formality.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">It is further urged by the defendant that there are various statutes in which it is expressed in terms that required signatures may be made either by the person himself, or by an attorney or agent or some one in his behalf, and that the omission of any such clause in Pub. Sts. c. 100, \u00a7 25, raises an implication that a signature by the person himself was intended to be required. See Pub. Sts. c. 52, \u00a7 21; c. 78, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3, 4, 5 (statute of <em>frauds); </em>c. 120, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3 ; c. 127, \u00a7 1 (statute of <em>wills); </em>c. 167, \u00a7 63 ; c. 174, \u00a7 3; St. of 1888, c. 155. These statutes, however, so far as they have been construed judicially, have not usually been held to imply that signatures made under circumstances like those disclosed in the present case are not to be deemed to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>the signature of the person whose name is written, as is shown by the decisions relating to deeds, wills, and the statute of frauds, already cited. There are many instances where, by express provisions of statute, or by rules of law, a person is required to make a demand or give a notice, and where by express requirement or by implication his name is to be signed. See, e. g., Pub. Sts. c. 6, \u00a7 17, as to voters; c. 121, \u00a7\u00a7 8, 11, 12, as to notices to quit; c. 122, \u00a7 3, as to easements ; c. 181, \u00a7 11, as to foreclosures; c. 190, \u00a7 33, as to offers under mill act; c. 191, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4, as to mechanic\u2019s liens; c. 192, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 10, 24, as to chattel mortgages, pledges, and liens; c. 197, \u00a7 15, as to acknowledgments to bar the statute of limitations. Ordinarily, and in the absence of anything to show the contrary, it can hardly be supposed that the Legislature meant to require in all such cases a signature in the proper handwriting of the person. The maxim applies, <em>Qui facit per alium facit per se. In re </em>Whitley, 32 Ch. D. 337, 339-341.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b467-7\"><em>C. A. De Courcy, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b467-8\"><em>J. P. </em>Sweeney, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">In the case before us, the statute did not in terms require the plaintiff\u2019s \u201c written signature,\u201d but only that the notice should be \u201c signed.\u201d Signing does not necessarily mean a written signature, as distinguished from a signature by mark, by print, by stamp, or by the hand of another. There is no reason that we can see why a signature in the proper handwriting of the plaintiff should be required. The ruling at the trial was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
