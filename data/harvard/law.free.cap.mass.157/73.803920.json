This period was after he was allowed from one to four dollars, as previously stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-5\">The defendant requested the court to rule:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-6\">First. \u201c A father is legally entitled to the wages of his minor son, and his marriage without the consent of his father does not of itself work his emancipation and entitle him to his earnings. If the defendant\u2019s father claimed and took his wages, and thereby deprived the defendant of the means of supporting his wife, he cannot be convicted.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-7\">Secondly. \u201c A marriage in another State in violation of the laws of this State will not have the effect to emancipate here the minor party to such marriage.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-8\">The judge refused so to rule, but did instruct the jury that the marriage in Maine without the father\u2019s consent was valid in this Commonwealth, and imposed upon the defendant all the duties and responsibilities of the marital relation; that his wife would be entitled to receive support from him; that the defendant would be entitled as of right to such portion of his wages as to enable him to support his wife; that the father could only claim the rest; and that it was for the jury to say whether the defendant had any income, and if so, whether his neglect to support his wife was upon all the evidence unreasonable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-9\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b98-10\"><em>J.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHU\">The exceptions recite that the \u201c defendant was nineteen at the time of his marriage, and twenty when the complaint was made.\u201d The age of the wife nowhere appears, but it was not contended that she was under the age of consent. If the marriage had been solemnized within the Commonwealth, it would have been valid. Pub. Sts. c. 145, \u00a7 6. <em>Parton </em>v. <em>Hervey, </em>1 Gray, 119. It is not contended that the marriage was void by the laws of Maine, but we cannot take judicial notice of the statutes of Maine, and the common law of that State must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>presumed, in the absence of evidence, to be the same as the common law of Massachusetts. See <em>Hiram </em>v. Pierce, 45 Maine, 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Section 10, c. 145, of the Public Statutes was intended to define the cases in which a marriage should be deemed void which was solemnized in another State by persons resident in this Commonwealth who went into the other State for the purpose of having the marriage solemnized there, and afterwards returned to and resided in this Commonwealth, but the present case is not within this section. The general rule of law is, that a marriage contracted elsewhere, if valid where it is contracted, is valid here, although the parties intended to evade our laws, unless the statutes declare such a marriage void, or the marriage is one deemed \u201c contrary to the law of nature as generally recognized in Christian countries.\u201d <em>Sutton </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>10 Met. 451. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>4 Cush. 49. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>113 Mass. 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">The consequences of this marriage must be the same as if it had been solemnized in this Commonwealth, and the presiding justice, therefore, correctly ruled that this marriage \u201c imposed upon the defendant all the duties and responsibilities of the marital relation.\u201d The real question is whether, when a minor son marries without the consent of his father, and the- father never consents to it, and needs the son\u2019s wages for his support and the support of his family, the father is entitled to the son\u2019s wages during minority in preference to the wife, who also needs the wages for her support. The ruling was, that the \u201c wife would be entitled to receive support from\u201d her husband, and that he \u201c would be entitled as of right to such portion of his wages as to enable him to support his wife; that the father could only claim the rest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">It seems to be settled that the marriage of a minor son, with the consent of his father, works an emancipation, and it is not clear that the marriage of a minor son without his father\u2019s consent does not have the same effect, although the decision in <em>White </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>24 Maine, 531, is <em>contra. </em>It has been said: \u201c The husband becomes the head of a new family. His new relations to his wife and children create obligations and duties which require him to be the master of himself, his time, his labor, earnings and conduct.\u201d <em>Sherburne </em>v. <em>Hartland, </em>37 Vt. 528, 529. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>seems to be little doubt that, when an infant daughter marries, she is emancipated from the control of her parents. <em>Aldrich </em>v. Bennett, 63 N. H. 415. <em>Burr </em>v. Wilson, 18 Tex. 367. <em>Porch </em>v. Fries, 3 C. E. Green, 204. <em>Northfield </em>v. <em>Brookfield, </em>50 Vt. 62. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Wilmington, </em>5 B. &amp; Aid. 525. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Everton, </em>1 East, 526. See, however, <em>Babin </em>v. <em>Le Blanc, </em>12 La. An. 367. The meaning of emancipation is not that all the disabilities of infancy are removed, but that the infant is freed from parental control, and has a right to his own earnings. In <em>Taunton </em>v. <em>Plymouth, </em>15 Mass. 203, 204, it was intimated that the marriage of an infant son with the consent of the father entitled the son to his own earnings for the support of his family, and in <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Caldwell, </em>12 Cush. 512, it was said that an infant husband is liable for necessaries'furnished for himself and his family. It is clear, we think, that it is the duty of an infant husband to support his wife, and that, if he have property and a guardian, it is the duty of the guardian to apply the income, and, so far as is necessary, the principal of his ward\u2019s property, to the maintenance of the ward and his family, under the Pub. Sts. c. 139, \u00a7 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">We are of opinion that these considerations make it necessary to hold that an infant husband is entitled to his own wages, so far as they are necessary for his owrn support and that of his wife and children, even if he married wifliout his father\u2019s consent, and that the ruling of the court was sufficiently favorable to the defendant. Whether sound policy does not require that, in every case in which the marriage is valid, an infant husband should be entitled to all his earnings, need not now be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
