J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ajm\">The selectmen of the town of Marblehead, by the authority of the town, pursuant to the Pub. Sts. c. 82, \u00a7 10, made application to the county commissioners that \u201c Bessom Pasture \u201d might be taken for the enlargement of a burial ground belonging to the town. The vote of the town authorizing the application described the land to be taken as the \u201c Bessom Pasture . . . owned by William B. Wyman.\u201d The petition of the selectmen also described its boundaries, one of which was \u201cnorthwesterly by the harbor adjoining said burying ground.\u201d The answer of the county commissioners states \u201c that the land taken as by said adjudication was and is known as the Bessom Pasture, and that no question of it was made on the trial.\u201d The justice by whom the petition for certiorari was heard has \u201c found as a fact that the vote of the town included the land below high-water mark,\u201d etc. On this finding, which is plainly warranted by the facts we have recited, it must be held that the adjudication of the county commissioners is valid, if flats lying between high and low water mark on the sea, which are private property and belong to the same owner as the adjacent upland, can be taken in connection with the upland for the enlargement of a burial ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">The commissioners have adjudged \u201cthat necessity requires the enlargement of said Waterside Cemetery in the manner following,\u201d etc.; and they describe the land to be taken, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>includes the flats, and they adjudge that this land shall be a part of the burying ground. If the commissioners adjudge that it is necessary to take for the enlargement of a burial ground land on the sea between high and low water mark which is private property, we cannot say as matter of law that it is not necessary. If the flats cannot be filled or any structure built upon them without the license of the Board of Harbor and Land Commissioners, (Pub. Sts. c. 19, \u00a7 9,) still there may be reasons why they should be a part of the burial ground for its protection, of which the county commissioners are the judges. The interests of the public in land covered by the tides are not affected by the change of ownership, nor does that change in and of itself work any obstruction to navigation, and private property in such land is not exempted from being taken for a public use if it is necessary. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
