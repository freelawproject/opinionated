Austin, my dwelling-house on Orange Street, together with the furniture, and all household articles contained therein; also the land under and adjoining the same, with full power sell and execute a deed of the premises should she wish so to do.\u201d If by this clause Phebe D.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Agq\">The question in this case is, whether Phebe D. Austin, widow of Edward C. Austin, took a fee simple in his dwelling-house and adjoining land under the first article of his will, or only an estate for her life. It is apparent that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>person who wrote the will knew how to use apt words for the creation of a life estate, because the fifth clause begins as follows : \u201c The residue of my estate, after the payment of these legacies and my just debts, I give and bequeath to my said wife, to her sole use and benefit during her life,\u201d etc. We think it equally plain that the testator did not have in mind, as included in this residue, an estate in remainder in his dwelling-house and adjoining land, after the death of his wife, because his wife could not possess and enjoy such an estate in remainder during her life. The words of the first clause are sufficient to give the wife an estate in fee, when it does not appear from the rest of the will that the testator intended to devise to other persons what remained of this estate on her decease. This distinguishes the present case from <em>Kent </em>v. Morrison, 153 Mass. 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Considering all the provisions of the will, we think that it appears that the testator intended to devise to his wife an estate in fee in the real property described in the first article of the will. See <em>Wait </em>v. Belding, 24 Pick. 129; <em>Gleason </em>v. <em>Fayerweather, </em>4 Gray, 348; <em>Fearing </em>v. <em>Swift, </em>97 Mass. 413, 415; <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>108 Mass. 159; <em>Spooner </em>v. <em>Lovejoy, </em>108 Mass. 529, 532; <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Ladd, </em>153 Mass. 126; <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>156 Mass. 379; Gen. Sts. c. 92, \u00a7 5. <em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
