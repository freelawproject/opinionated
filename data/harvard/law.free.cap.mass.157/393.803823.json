Trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Braley, </em>J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>One Berube was called as a witness by the government, and testified through an interpreter that he went with Mary Tall\u00f3n on a certain night in October, 1891, to the defendant\u2019s house in South Somerset, and when they had entered the house a conversation in the French and English languages took place between Mary Tall\u00f3n and the defendant; and that the defendant\u2019s wife acted as interpreter for them on this occasion, and the questions were put by the defendant to Tall\u00f3n and by her to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-5\">It was in evidence that the defendant\u2019s wife was a Frenchwoman, and could converse in the French and English languages; that Mary Tallon was French, and could neither speak nor understand the English language; and that the defendant could neither speak nor understand the French language; and it was not shown that Berube could understand language addressed to him in English except imperfectly. It was also in evidence, that, on two occasions when the defendant had conversed with Berube, after the death of Mary Tallon, the conversations were carried on in the French and English languages through an interpreter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-6\">For the purpose of showing that Mary Tallon went to the defendant\u2019s house intending to have an abortion performed on her, and that the defendant agreed to perform the abortion, Berube was allowed, against the defendant\u2019s objection, to state in detail the conversation between the defendant and Mary Tallon on the night in question ; and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-7\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b418-8\"><em>A.

Each acts upon the theory that the interpretation is correct. Each impliedly agrees that his language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>may be received through the interpreter. If nothing appears to show that their respective relations to the interpreter differ, they may be said to constitute him their joint agent to do for both that in which they have a joint interest. They wish to communicate with each other, they choose a mode of communication, they enter into conversation, and the words of the interpreter, which are their necessary medium of communication, are adopted by both, and made a part of their conversation as much as those which fall from their own lips. They cannot complain if the language of the interpreter is taken as their own by any one who is interested in the conversation. Interpretation under such circumstances is <em>prima facie </em>to be deemed correct. How far either would be bound by it if the interpreter should prove false, may depend on a variety of circumstances which it is unnecessary in this case to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">In a case like the present, we are of opinion that either party, or a third person who hears the conversation, may testify to it as he undei\u2019stands it, although for his understanding of what was said by one of the parties, he is dependent on the interpretation which was a part of the conversation. The fact that a conversation was had\" through an interpreter affects the weight, but not the competency, of the evidence. <em>Camerlin </em>v. <em>Palmer Co. </em>10 Allen, 539. 1 Greenl.
