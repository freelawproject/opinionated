The respondents were found guilty, and served out their sentences in the house of correction and jail respectively, but were discharged without paying the costs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b285-13\"><em>Ira </em>Golly, Solicitor, for the county.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b285-14\">Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ar2\">\u201cAll legal costs attending the arrest, examination, or conveyance of any offender, except when the same is directed or approved in writing by the counsel of the state, or county commissioners, shall be paid by the complainant.\u201d G.

H. 21; <em>County of Strafford </em>v. <em>City of </em>Dover, 61 N. H. \u2014. Fines for the violation of police offences or of the by-laws of towns are for the us\u00e9 of the towns. <em>County of Hillsborough j. City of </em>Manchester, 49 N. H. 57, 61. The fines being for the use of the town, the town being liable for the prison charges, and the selectmen having authority to discharge the prisoner, the legislature have not undertaken to impose the expense of such prosecutions upon the county unless they were directed or approved by some other authority than that of the town. In this case the complaints were made by the selectmen of Grantham, acting in their official capacity. The complaints not having been authorized or approved by the counsel for the state, or the county commissioners, the county is not liable. Whether the selectmen had pow.er to bind the town is a question we do not consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b286-8\">Clark, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
