L. </em>Co., <em>Tr. </em>Facts found by a referee. That action, and another brought by O\u2019Neil against, the same defendant and the same trustee, were entered at the May-term of the police court, 1884. Both suits were brought by the same attorney. O\u2019Neil\u2019s writ was served on the trustee before that of Mansfield. Judgment was rendered for the plaintiff against Dunn in Mansfield\u2019s action, and it was understood that the trustee\u2019s disclosure in O\u2019Neil\u2019s case should be used in both cases. No appearance was entered on the docket for the trustee, who had no counsel. The disclosure was taken in O\u2019Neil\u2019s case, and one Barry appeared as claimant of the funds in the hands of the trustee, and filed a bond. On the issue between O\u2019Neil and Barry there was a trial; and judgment being rendered for the claimant discharging-the trustee, O\u2019Neil appealed. The justice and the claimant understood there would be no hearing on the liability of the trustee in Mansfield\u2019s action, but that the question, being the same in both cases, would be settled for both on O\u2019Neil\u2019s appeal, and that the-question in the second suit would await and be determined by the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>result in the first. Mansfield\u2019s attorney, not having the same understanding, obtained from the clerk and caused to be served on the claimant an order of notice requiring him to appear at the July term and maintain bis claim. At the July term, the claimant did not appear, and nothing was done. September 14, Mansfield\u2019s attorney moved that the trustee be charged, and the justice directed this entry to be made on the docket in Mansfield\u2019s action,\u2014\u201c Tee charged subject to previous suit in favor of O\u2019Neil.\u201d The meaning of this order, as understood by the justice, was, that the trustee should be charged if O\u2019Neil prevailed on his appeal, and not otherwise. On that appeal, the judgment of the police court was affirmed. The clerk, by direction of the justice, refused to issue against the trustee an execution demanded by Mansfield.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b584-5\"><em>J. B.
