The payments were made, and the deed was taken September 17 of that year. The referee, to whom the cause was sent, reported that the plaintiff was deceived and damnified by the false and fraudulent representations of the defendant; but when the plaintiff ascertained that fact, aside from false representations as to a certain boiler, did not appear in the reported facts.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Axr\"><em>F.
