G. L., <em>c. </em>192, <em>s. </em>2. It is not necessary to consider whether, as suggested in the arguments, the controversy respecting the appointment of the defendant as guardian arises-from a diversity of religious creeds, or whether theology is to be regarded in the appointment of a guardjan. There are in this case no facts raising any question of religious education; nor are the alleged reasons of appeal sustained by the facts proved. The finding that there was occasion for the appointment of a guardian, and that the defendant is a suitable person for the trust, does not show that the decree is erroneous, or that the appellant is legally aggrieved by it. <em>Waldron </em>v. Woodman, 58 N. H. 15; <em>Lunt </em>v. <em>Aubens, </em>39 Me. 392. It does not appear that there is any person more suitable than the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b624-10\">Allen, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
