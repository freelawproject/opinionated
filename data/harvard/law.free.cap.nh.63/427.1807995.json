Assumpsit cannot be maintained. The only course open to the plaintiffs was to cut off the water, or acquiesce in his claim. <em>Aqueduct Co. </em>v. <em>Page, </em>52 N.

The water-right claimed by him is also claimed by the plaintiff in interest; and the suit is brought to settle the disputed aqueduct title. The fiction of a promise implied by law contrary to the fact may be invented and used, for the sake of the remedy, to enforce the performance of a legal duty. , <em>Sceva </em>v. <em>True, </em>53 N.

The law does not leave this disputed title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>unsettled for want of an adequate method of procedure, but no fiction is required by adequacy or convenience of the plaintiff\u2019s remedy.
