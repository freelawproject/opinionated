Having knowledge of the sale, and being informed by the vendees that they took possession and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>would run the mill, they continued their work, upon the faith of the vendees\u2019 promise to be responsible for future wages, and to pay wages previously earned if there should be a profit. They had the benefit of all the notice any change of possession could have given, and were so far parties to the sale as to have no cause to complain of any want of completeness in the change of possession. There was no need of a more thorough change to inform them of a contract of which they had all the knowledge they could desire, and to which they assented by deriving from it a valuable security. <em>Coburn </em>v.
