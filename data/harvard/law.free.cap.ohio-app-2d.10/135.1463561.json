Hence, that judgment became final and conclusive when the time for appeal expired. The first assignment of error is, therefore, without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The second assignment of error is that the trial court erred in overruling the plaintiff\u2019s motion to vacate the summary judgment, and this contention raises the only question of any consequence in the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Stated specifically, the single issue presented herein is whether the failure of a trial court to conform its judgment to a pronouncement of law by the Supreme Court of Ohio, when a motion to vacate is filed during the same term of court, constitutes an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">In responding to this issue, we recognize that a motion to vacate cannot be employed to extend the time for perfecting an appeal. We are also aware of the wide discretion which a court has over its judgments during term. See 32 Ohio Jurisprudence 2d 250, Section 558. However, such power is not unlimited. 3 Ohio Jurisprudence 2d 764, Section 791. Where a trial court\u2019s action is predicated upon a misconstruction of law, the judgment may not stand. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Stonom, </em>41 Ohio Law Abs. 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">If there existed some doubt as to the applicability of <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Commercial Motor Freight, Inc., </em>174 Ohio St. 498, to the facts upon which the trial court entered judgment in the present case, we would not disturb its ruling on the motion to vacate. But the law provided in the syllabus of the <em>Robinson case </em>appears to apply directly to the judgment entered by the trial court in the instant case. Under such circumstances, we are of the opinion that the trial court should have granted the motion to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">An involvement somewhat comparable to the present situation arose in the case of <em>Leatherman </em>v. <em>Maytham, </em>66 Ohio App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>344, where the trial court did not follow statutory law in ruling upon a motion to vacate filed during the same term of court. In that case, at page 348, the court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">\u201c* * * when the court\u2019s attention was called to the statute during the same term at which said award was made, the court had power to correct the mistake that had been made, and it was clearly its duty to do so; and its failure in that behalf was an abuse of discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Whether or not we agree therewith, the trial court, as well as this court, is bound by the law as interpreted by the Supreme Court of Ohio. Hence, the trial court, having been afforded an opportunity during term to do so, should have vacated its judgment in favor of <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Commercial Motor Freight, Inc., </em>174 Ohio St. 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Since the judgment sought to be vacated in this case is in conflict with law pronounced by the Supreme Court of Ohio upon the same subject, judicial subordination precludes as from finding that substantial justice has been done.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The judgment will, therefore, be reversed and the cause remanded to the trial court for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b151-9\">Sher.ee, P.
