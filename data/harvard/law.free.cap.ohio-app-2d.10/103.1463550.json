In repeatedly ruling on evidence and procedure, in making comment prejudicial to the defendant in the presence of the jury, and in invading the province of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">2. In controlling and administering the trial and interpret<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>ing the law in contravention of named provisions of the federal and state Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">3. and 4. In refusing defendant\u2019s request to charge and for errors in the general charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">5. In prohibiting defendant in defendant\u2019s final argument to claim entrapment and the court\u2019s failure to give requested charge on that subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">6. and 7. In overruling defendant\u2019s first motion for new trial and for failure to direct a verdict for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">8. and 9. The verdict is contrary to law and is not sustained by sufficient evidence, and, by separate appeal, in overruling defendant\u2019s motion for new trial based upon a claim of newly discovered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">The facts as shown by the transcript, the bill of exceptions and the exhibits are that the defendant was arrested on July 23, 1964, at 5715 Brookpark Road in the city of Parma, Ohio, and charged with promoting a numbers game or lottery known as clearing house in violation of Section 2915.13, Revised Code. The case as thus charged was pending for trial on the merits on November 20, 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">The defendant testified that, on November 20, 1964, he was at the \u201cBeef and Bottle\u201d (a lounge bar in Parma which the record shows the defendant patronized on frequent occasions) having dinner with a girlfriend and that upon leaving he saw Detective Bennett seated at the bar. He, the defendant, testified that he had only seen the officer once or twice before, one of which occasions was at the time of his arrest on July 23, 1964. After the defendant recognized the police officer, he engaged him in a conversation for more than a half hour on the subject of gambling. As set out in defendant\u2019s brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-11\">\u201cThere ensued an exchange of conversation and drinks during which the subject of gambling was discussed * * *. Defendant told Bennett that the Cleveland Press ran the requisite information to determine the winners in clearing house but only in editions delivered on the east side of town. * #</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">Defendant testified that the officer was amazed to know that he (Birns) was correct in his statement and that the defendant of,'V red to demonstrate the truth thereof by bringing out papers purchased at several locations for the officer to examine- De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>fendant then arranged that he would call the officer the following week and bring the papers with him to demonstrate the truth of his statement. The meeting was to be at the \u201cBeef and Bottle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">The defendant called Detective Bennett at the station house on Monday (November 23,1964) at about 3 p. m. and said he had the newspapers. They agreed to meet at the \u201cBeef and Bottle\u201d at about 7:45 p. m. Detective Bennett, with Detective Eschweiler, then equipped themselves with sound equipment to record the conversation between the defendant and Bennett, Eschweiler to listen in his automobile at the side of the restaurant and attempt to record the conversation on a tape recorder. When the defendant reached the restaurant on November 23 at about 8:15 p. m., Bennett was sitting at the bar. The defendant testified that they had five, six or seven drinks and that he showed the newspapers to Bennett who was amazed. The defendant expressed his philosophy on the subject of gambling, that is, that it was not morally wrong to gamble, and that everybody engages in such conduct. The defendant testified that Bennett, after continuing the conversation, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-5\">\u201c \u2018You know\u2019 he says, \u2018I have got four and a half or five and a half kids and I\u2019m only making $6,500 a year.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Defendant further testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">\u201cThat didn\u2019t sound good to me. I thought maybe at that moment, why would he tell me \u2014 I\u2019m thinking like this, why would he tell me he has got five and a half kids and making $6,500 because there was nothing incriminating said, in all my conversation at the bar and I was wondering about that and I then sent for the waitress to bring a menu because I didn\u2019t have dinner yet and when the waitress brought the menu, just trying to be polite, I says \u2018Mr. Bennett, I am going to eat. Would you care to eat or dine with me?\u2019 He said, \u2018Yes, I would love to.' ***\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">The defendant stated that when the salads were on the table, \u201cI went first. Mr. Bennett came about twenty to twenty-five seconds later. He came to the table and sat down. * # # Well when he sat down, then I was thinldng about his five and one half kids that he mentioned and only making $6500 a year. I says \u2018Look here is a Christmas gift for your family so they will have a nice Christmas,\u2019 He looked at me and he says <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>\u2018Gee.\u2019 He hesitated. He says \u2018Gee Whiz. What am I supposed to do for this?\u2019 I says\u2018Nothing.\u2019 I says\u2018I wouldn\u2019t want yon to jeopardize your family or your kids or your job.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The defendant testified he laid the two hundred dollars on the table for Bennett. He also testified that after some general conversation Bennett went to the men\u2019s room. After he came back, he laid the money on the table and said \u201cNow, Shon, \u25a0 tell me what you want me to do for this two hundred dollars.\u201d The defendant answered \u201cNothing. I have told you before that I didn\u2019t want you to jeopardize your family, your job or your kids.\u201d When pressed further as to what was expected of the police officer who, under the circumstances, was not satisfied with defendant\u2019s explanation, defendant said \u201cLook, if you can be helpful O. K.\u201d After further conversation on this subject, a man walked slowly toward the table and Bennett said \u2018 \u2018 Hello Frank \u2014 are you working tonight?\u201d (This was Eschweiler.) The defendant then testified that all this didn\u2019t look good to him.. He said \u201cLook, I am getting out of here.\u201d He got his coat to. leave and was then arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">The testimony of the defendant in attempting to explain how he came to give Bennett two hundred dollars (as an alleged Christmas gift on the 23rd of November, with Christmas more than a month away), when he knew that Bennett (an almost total stranger to him) was a potential or probable witness for the state in the numbers case then pending against him, was, with the exception of a few minor details, completely corroborated by Bennett. The officer\u2019s testimony on the discussion about his family was to the effect that he had just taken pictures of his children, which he displayed to Birns who then inquired about his family. Bennett, besides his work as a police officer, was in the photography business with his wife in Parma.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">On the state of the record, including Birns\u2019 testimony, the issue of the defendant\u2019s guilt on either or both charges is clearly supported. The purpose of the defendant in giving two hundred dollars in cash to one known to him as a police officer who participated in his arrest on a numbers charge, which case was then pending for trial on the merits, it being undisputed that until his arrest the officer was a total stranger to him, and where-there was no indication or the slightest suggestion of solicita-, tion, for one under such circumstances to seek the company of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>the officer for the purpose of explaining his philosophy on the subject of gambling and without more, with the statement \u201cLook, here is a Christmas gift for your family so they will have a nice Christmas, \u2019 \u2019 is sufficient to support a guilty verdict. This evidence being given by the defendant (who has served time in a tax evasion case and in a number of other cases) also disclosed that the officer was taken by surprise when the money was offered, when, he, the defendant, testified: \u201cHe looked at me and he says \u2018Gee.\u2019 He hesitated. He says \u2018Gee Whiz. What am I.suppose to do for this?\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">The defense of entrapment is not available to a defendant who creates in his own mind (without inducement by another seeking to entrap him into committing an unlawful act) the purpose to commit a criminal act and acts in furtherance of his own purpose. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gutilla, </em>94 Ohio App. 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">On the face of such a record, the defendant\u2019s claim of error in assignment No. 5 must be overruled, there being no evidence to suggest even entrapment. The court was correct in refusing to charge the law on that subject. Also, for the reasons set out above, claimed errors Nos. 6, 7, 8 and 9 must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Assignment of error No. 1 is concerned with matters of procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">In considering the fact situation, the conclusions reached are based not only on the testimony of Detective Bennett, corroborated by the defendant\u2019s testimony, but also that of Officer Eschweiler, who had been assigned to the duty of listening to the conversation between the defendant and Bennett over certain electronic equipment. After the defendant had insisted on carrying on a discourse on gambling with an arresting officer in the numbers case, the police officer involved, either with or without the orders of the Chief of Police of the city, but at least with his knowledge and consent, took steps to use the electronic device of the city for transmitting conversations to others at a distance. Bennett concealed the transmitter on his person and the receiver, with a tape recorder, was placed in Eschweiler\u2019s personal automobile which was parked near the \u201cBeef and Bottle\u201d Restaurant on Pearl Road. The testimony is uncontradicted that the conversation between Birns and Bennett was clearly received and understood by Eschweiler but that the tape recording was garbled and not understandable because of the use of improper equipment. It picked up street noises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>and the police radio. The jury was permitted to hear the tape with the use of earphones so that they were completely informed as to the conditions of the tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">One other factor brought out in the record is that when Birns was arrested on July 3rd, there was, in the place where he was arrested, equipment used in conducting a numbers lottery, including tapes and money found in Birn\u2019s hat. Such property was not offered or received in evidence in this case. There is no doubt that Birns brought into the case the matter of his involvement in numbers operations so that evidence as to the manner in which such a lottery is operated was clearly proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">On the motion for new trial because of newly discovered evidence, it was disclosed that while Detective Eschweiler was in his private automobile listening to the conversation between Detective Bennett and the defendant, one Donald E. Hale, driving his automobile on Ridgefield Road, ran into and struck the automobile in which Eschweiler was seated listening to the Bennett-Birns conversation. Eschweiler got out of his car, talked with Piale about the damage, and testified that he called the station for an officer to investigate the accident and that Officer Henry Gabriel responded in a very few minutes and took charge of the investigation, as is shown by that officer\u2019s activity report filed in the Parma Police Department November 23, 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">The basis of this motion for new trial is that the state did not bring the incident of this collision to the attention of the defendant, thereby depriving him of due process. Such claim is based on the alleged fact that, since Eschweiler\u2019s testimony was corrobatory in character and as the evidence of the defendant tends to show that the accident happened while Eschweiler was listening to Birns and Bennett over the electronic transmitter and that he left his listening post in his automobile for from twenty-five to forty-five minutes to investigate the accident, if the fact of the accident had not been concealed, it could have been presented to the jury to challenge Eschweiler\u2019s credibility. The state\u2019s evidence, as shown by many reliable factors, is that Eschweiler did not leave his listening post for more than five minutes and that the parts of the conversation to which he testified he had heard over the transmitter. The court, in overruling defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence, stated that the facts as it found them to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>he if presented to the jury would not within reasonable probability cause the jury to come to a different result. The credible evidence on the collision, as shown by the record, clearly supports such result.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">One other factor requires this result. The defendant\u2019s testimony is not in serious conflict with that of Bennett who participated in the conversation with Birns or that of Eschweiler who listened over the broadcasting equipment. In addition to what the defendant testified on direct examination, as above set out, he testified on cross-examination as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-5\">\u201cQ. My question is this, sir: When you bought those papers did you buy them so that you could take them to the Beef &amp; Bottle and show them to Detective Bennett? A. That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-6\">\u201cQ. That was the only reason \u2014 you bought them? A. That is right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">\u201cQ. And on the night in question when you came in the Beef &amp; Bottle with those newspapers under your arm, your intention was to show these papers to Bennett and explain them to him with regard to the clearing house digits; is that correct? A. I brought those papers out to show him that his area didn\u2019t carry it and the other area did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-8\">\u201cQ. I see. At that time did you have any intentions of giving him a Christmas present? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-9\">\u2018 \u2018 Q. When you went inside the bar and saw him there at the bar, and discussed with him showing him the manner the number was picked, the stocks and bonds, and so forth, at that time did you have any intentions of giving him a Christmas present? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-10\">\u201cQ. How much money did you take with you when you went there? A. You mean how much money do I carry with me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-11\">\u201cQ. My question is, how much money did you have in your pocket on the 23rd of November, 1964, when you went to the Beef <em>&amp; </em>Bottle to meet Detective Bennett? A. Well, I don\u2019t re- <em>&lt; </em>call exactly what I had, but I had money with me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-12\">\u201cQ. Can you approximate how much money you had in your pocket? A. I could have had four or five hundred dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-13\">\u201cQ. Pour or five hundred dollars? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-14\">\u201cQ. Now, the twenty tens that you gave Detective Bennett, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>did you have them in a bundle? A. I had them with my other money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-5\">\u201cQ. But did you have this separated from your other money? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\">\u201cQ. Then when you gave Detective Bennett this money how did you know you gave him two hundred dollars? A. Well, he wasn\u2019t at the table. I proceeded to the table first. It took him about twenty to twenty-five seconds to come back after that, and the only reason I done that is when he started telling me that he had four and a half or five and a half kids, and only\u2014 emphasized the word \u2018only\u2019 \u2014 making sixty-five hundred dollars a year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-7\">\u201cQ. No, my question is this, sir: I believe the testimony is that you threw twenty ten dollar bills to Detective Bennett there at the table. Now, you have told us that you had about five hundred or some odd dollars in your pocket. When did you separate the two hundred dollars that you gave Bennett in the Beef <em>&amp; </em>Bottle, if at all? A. Well, I just told you that I got to the table first.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-8\">\u201cQ. What did you do when you got to the table first? A. I went into my pocket and counted out two hundred dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-9\">\u201cQ. I see. In other words, at that point, when you were there at the booth and as Detective Bennett was behind you\u2014 A. Not as Detective Bennett was behind me. He was at the table yet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-10\">\u201cQ. But you didn\u2019t know where he was? A. He could have been giving a few more signals. I wouldn\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-11\">\u201cQ. Well, let\u2019s understand each other. A. I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-12\">\u201cQ. You and Detective Bennett were standing at the bar; is that correct? A. We were.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-13\">\u201cQ. And you left the bar first and went to your booth; is that correct? A. I can explain that to you, too. When I got\u2014 I\u2019m going to explain it so you understand. I just can\u2019t give you a yes answer. I want to explain it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-14\">\u201cQ. Go ahead. A. We was at the bar. We had our five or six drinks. I was through having conversation with bim at that time. I ordered some food from the waitress, and only out of politeness I asked him would he care to have something to eat. That is all there was. He had not accepted the food you would never have heard anything about this, but before I got to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>table he started telling me about his family and his kids, and to me, the way he said it, \u2018I\u2019m only making sixty-five hundred dollars a year,\u2019 to me it looked like a beg.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-4\">\u201cQ. I see. At any rate, when you left the bar first to go to your booth, that is when you separated the money? A. That is when I counted the money out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">\u201cQ. Yes. And you don\u2019t know where Detective Bennett was at that time because your attention was directed to counting the money, wasn\u2019t it? A. No, I didn\u2019t see him in my presence. I didn\u2019t count the money in his presence because he wasn\u2019t there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-6\">\u201cQ. And when you sat down did you have this money in your hand or had you put it back in your pocket? A. I had that money in my hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-7\">\u2018 \u2018 Q. And you held this money in your hand during the time of the preliminary conversation with Detective Bennett at the booth? A. No. Just a minute. When he sat down, the salads are on the table. That is when I took the money and I laid it down on the table. I said, \u2018This is a Christmas gift for your .kids and your wife. See that they have a nice holiday,\u2019 because I didn\u2019t know he had five and a half kids and only making sixty-five hundred dollars, unless he told me. I thought it was a beg, so I thought it was holiday time, so I says, \u2018Here, have your family have a nice Christmas.\u2019 There was nothing said at the bar in reference to anything incriminating, but when he got that money, that is when all his \u2014 the things started.\u201d \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">As thus stated by the defendant, it is clear that the state\u2019s case is supported by the defendant\u2019s own testimony, and upon such evidence the ease was correctly submitted to the jury. The absence of Eschweiler from his listening post for five minutes or less, when the conversation covered a period of time from about 8:15 to 9:30 p. m., was not, upon the record as above stated, a factor preventing defendant from being afforded due process according to law. The motion for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence was, therefore, properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">For the reasons stated, the judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b126-11\">.
