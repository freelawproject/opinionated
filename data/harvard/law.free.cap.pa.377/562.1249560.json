The chancellor held that (1) the latter was a valid agreement, (2) the evidence did not prove that a term had been omitted from the written agreement by mutual mistake, and (3) the written agreement superseded the earlier account stated. The chancellor also held that the defendant had not proved his counterclaim, and dismissed the complaint. Upon consideration of defendant\u2019s exceptions to the ruling on the counterclaim, they were sustained and a final decree was entered dismissing the complaint and setting forth the amount due the defendant out of the remaining partnership assets.</p>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-5\">Plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b583-6\"><em>ISamuel </em>Finestone, with him <em>W.
