An occupancy of land by a telephone company with its poles under a parol license from the owner of the land, lacks the essential qualities of an easement inasmuch as an easement is only established where there are two tenements owned by distinct proprietors, one to which the right is attached and another on which it is imposed.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b430-6\">2. When a person excuses what would otherwise be a trespass on the ground of a parol license, such license must be clearly established.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b430-7\">3. In an action of ejectment to compel a telephone company to give up the occupancy of land which it had used for its poles, the case is for the jury, where the plaintiff testifies that the company had received a parol license to erect the poles only on the condition that they were to be removed at the request of the owner; that the owner had absolutely refused to sign any agreement relating to the poles, or to accept any compensation; that the defendant company had accepted a license from an adjoining owner to bo terminated on sixty days\u2019 notice; and that an agent of the company in charge of the location of the poles had declared that when he was getting the consent of the owner that the latter had stated that the company must get off when he gave notice.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b430-8\">Argued March 11, 1912.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A80n\">Appeal, No. 2, March T., 1913, by defendant, from judgment of C.

We request -that the offer be coupled with an offer to prove that.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-4\">Mr. Snyder: We offer to prove that G. H. Warren, special agent of the company, a person with whom Mr. Bradley has had dealings for over two and a half years upon this very question, who maintains his office in Philadelphia with his name as special agent on the door, who has called upon Mr. Bradley on the ground at Swatara Station, gone over the situation, and at all times has acted as the agent of the American Telegraph and Telephone Company, and who has never denied his agency, made this offer to Colonel Bradley, both orally and by letter, which we intend in due course to offer in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-5\">Mr. Geyer: We object to this offer as framed unless the letter quoted be made part of the offer, so we may frame the proper objection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-6\">Mr. Snyder: I make the letter part of the offer. There is no objection to that.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-7\">The Court: The letter being made part of the offer, we understand there is no objection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-8\">Mr. Geyer: Yes, there is objection. We desire to make an objection to the offer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-9\">Mr. Snyder: For the purpose of proving that the defendant company itself, through its agent, has admitted on more than one occasion that it has no rights upon these premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-10\">Mr. Geyer: If the court please, this is objected to as being incompetent and irrelevant. If the letter \u2014 and we take it the letter indicates the tone of the conversation\u2014 is admissible for any purpose it would be either as a declaration against interest or on the ground that it constitutes a' surrender or an extinguishment. It is not offered for the purpose of constituting a surrender, and on its face does not purport to be so, but it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>offered as an admission by the defendant company of the plaintiff\u2019s rights. We object to it because it is, and on its face purports to be, an admission made by a special agent who has not been shown to have the authority to make the admission in question which would bind the defendant company. It is further objected to for the reason that it is not admissible as a declaration against interest, not being a declaration of a fact, but being in its nature a declaration of a conclusion of law. I further object to it as not being evidence, or being such species of declarations excluded because of public policy, because it was made during a. series of conferences with respect to a compromise of the difficulties between the plaintiff and the defendant and was therefore privileged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-4\">The Court: The objection is overruled for the present and exception noted for the defendant. When we have heard all the testimony relative to the letter and the official position of the person writing it, the effect of it will be determined.

Colonel, before introducing the letter, you may tell what conversation you had with Mr. Warren relative to the right of the American Telegraph &amp; Telephone Company to maintain those poles upon the land? A. As I just said, I received this bill in the letter from Mr. Hoffer, who is superintendent of quarries at Swatara, and I took that right up with the company, and in reply to that why Mr. Warren called at our office on Ninth and Girard avenue, Philadelphia. Now we talked the matter over.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-6\">The Court: \u201cQ. Is Mr. Warren\u2019s office also in Philadelphia? A. Yes, sir; in the Bourse Building. We talked the matter over in a general way and stated to Mr. Warren the records do not show that you have any right on this property, the searches do not develop that. Now you have no right to occupy my land without a compensation. If I want to send a telegraph or telephone message I got to pay for it, and I want <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>you to pay me for the use of that ground and we will enter into an agreement of some kind; but before that, I want you to give me a letter showing that you have no rights there. Mr. Warren said all right. He went back and wrote the letter, and that is the one referred to. Q. Was there anything said at that time, Colonel, about the right of the company to maintain its poles, or was there not? A. We had a general conversation in reference to the poles and their location; and the right to maintain the poles specifically touched upon at that time I do not recall.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-3\">The Court: What is the date of that letter?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-4\">Mr. Snyder: January 21, 1909. \u201cQ.

Now if it is to be a declaration made by Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Fulford in the absence of Mr. Denny, your honor will see that it is different, that it differs in a number of respects from the offer, and we would ask for another offer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-3\">Mr. Snyder: I propose to ask the witness whether any other conversation was had with Mr. Fulford relative to the erection of those poles, for the purpose of establishing the terms under which they were erected.

The burden was therefore shifted to the defendant to show a right to the occupancy of the plaintiff\u2019s property. This it undertook to do by the introduction of evidence tending to establish a parol license. The right asserted lacks the essential quality of an easement that there must be two tenements owned by distinct proprietors, one to which the right is attached and another on which it is imposed: Washburn\u2019s Easements and Servitudes (3d ed.), sec. 3; Grant v. Chase et al., 17 Mass. 443; Dark v. Johnston, 55 Pa. 164; nor can it exist in parol: Huff v. McCauley, 53 Pa. 206. The whole of the defendant\u2019s case, therefore, has its foundation in the allegation of a parol permission to construct the line. The letter of John Q. Denny, the owner of the land, to Mr. Seiler, dated November 19, 1890, cannot be regarded as a grant vesting in the defendant an interest in the land or a right of way over it. It does not on its face purport to confer any right. It was not addressed to the defendant nor to any person representing it, nor does it describe any location by reference to which a right could be maintained. It is a declaration to a friend of the writer\u2019s who lived in the immediate vicinity and was familiar with Mr. Denny\u2019s affairs that he had given permission to some person connected with the \"Long Distance Telephone\u201d to place some poles on his property \"across from your station.\u201d This communication was handed to Mr. Zimmerman, who had the negotiation with Mr. Denny but was never delivered to Mr. Seiler. Zimmerman delivered it to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Mr. Fulford who had charge of the construction of the line. That it was not intended to be a grant of a right of way is clear from the defendant\u2019s own evidence. Mr. Denny refused to sign any paper to that effect and refused to be bound by any consideration, but told Zimmerman they could plant some poles so long as they did no damage by cutting trees. The letter was intended simply to notify Seiler that the writer had made an arrangement with Zimmerman because Denny told Seiler everything that \u201cturned up down there,\u201d he and Seiler being very familiar. Denny\u2019s recollection was that Zimmerman was the first man to approach him with reference to placing the poles, but other evidence in the case tended to show that the permission was given directly to Fulford, the man in charge, at a later date, and that it was done on the premises in the presence of Seiler. The recollection of Denny was not distinct, and the testimony of Seiler as to the circumstances under which the permission was given to build the line across the lot was apparently, more satisfactory to the jury than that of Denny, and according to Seiler\u2019s testimony the permission was a limited one. Seiler introduced Denny to Fulford; the three walked out to the ground and Fulford .showed Denny where he wanted to place the poles; they then returned to Seiler\u2019s office when Fulford wanted Denny to sign a contract or paper that he would give him permission to go on the land. Denny said he would not sign a contract; that he would not sign any paper, but told him to put up his poles and if he wanted him off he would notify him to get off; that he could erect.the poles but they were to be removed when notice was given to that effect. Under the evidence then the case turned on the question of fact whether a perpetual license was granted or a license at the will of the owner of the land, and this question was submitted to the jury in a clear and fair charge by the learned trial judge. A part of the evidence introduced by the plaintiff consisted of a letter written by G. H. Warren, special agent of the defendant, dated January 21, 1909. This letter grew out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>of a negotiation, between the plaintiff and the agent with reference to the right to maintain the poles on the ground and in regard to the number of poles standing on the plaintiff\u2019s land. It was written after a conversation between the plaintiff and the special agent which led the latter to investigate the records of the company to ascertain by what right the company had maintained its poles there and contained the statement that on investigation it was found that no rights were conveyed to the defendant by the plaintiff or any former owner of the property on and along which certain poles were located and asking for a conference for the purpose of agreeing on compensation for the use of the land. It is strongly urged by the appellant that this was inadmissible because written by an agent who was not shown to have authority to bind the company. That Mr. Warren had general supervision of the subject of right of way and the negotiation for the adjustment of claims and other difficulties which might arise with reference thereto is clearly shown. No other person had connection with that part of the business. This brought him into negotiation with the plaintiff in regard to the right of way controversy. The negotiation continued for a length of time and this letter was written while that negotiation was pending. It only asserted what appears in other parts of the case and about which we do not understand that there is any dispute. The defendant does not claim to have any writing which gives it the privilege of using the plaintiff\u2019s land. Its whole case depends on a parol license. The special agent was therefore making no concession nor was he yielding any right on which the defendant could rely. The agent merely stated the result of his examination and related the matters of fact. It is suggested that the letter contained conclusions of law, but this is not the effect of the document. The defendant was not precluded from showing that it had some sort of title and rights not evidenced by documents on file, but no effort was made to establish any other claim than that which is said to have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>given to Zimmerman by Denny, If it were out of the case the situation of the parties would not be changed. The defendant was put to the necessity under the pleadings of showing its title and no other was presented or pretended except the parol license. Objection was also made to the admission of the contract made by the defendant with the McCormick estate in connection with the testimony of Seiler that Fulford said to him while he was obtaining the consent of Denny to set the poles on his land that Denny\u2019s situation was the same as McCormick\u2019s and that \u201che would have to get off when he (Denny) gave them notice.\u201d This declaration if made while Fulford was getting the contract from Denny was part of the res gestee and admissible on that account. Moreover, the statement related to the transactions over which he had exclusive control and which existed by parol only according to the contention of both of the parties, and the acts and declarations of the agent were therefore binding on the defendant. The corporation must act through its agents, and where it gives an agent control of a branch of its business his declarations within the bounds of his authority while transacting the business affect his principal: United Brethren Mutual Aid Society v. McDermond, 12 W. N. C. 73; Ardesco Oil Company v. Richardson, 63 Pa. 162; Union R. R. &amp; Transportation Co. v. Riegel, 73 Pa. 72. But irrespective of the letter of Warren and the McCormick agreement there is evidence which supports the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the poles were to be erected on the condition that they were to be removed at the request of the owner of the land. The refusal of the owner to sign any agreement or to accept any compensation, the act of the defendant in accepting a license from an adjoining owner to be terminated on sixty days\u2019 notice and the evidence of Seiler as to the terms arranged with Fulford all support the plaintiff\u2019s position. If the company acquired possession under such circumstances and on such a condition it is not now in a situation to assert that having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>erected its poles it has an executed license in perpetuity. It would be a fraud on the owner to enter in that manner and afterward hold possession under a .claim of a different title. When a person excuses what would otherwise be a trespass on the ground of a parol license, such license should be clearly established. The line is near to the highway, the defendant has had long use of the plaintiff\u2019s land without compensation and we think no hardship is exhibited or circumstance established which would create an equitable estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-3\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
