L. c. 266, \u00a7 120F) and of one count of criminal harassment (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43A[a]). On appeal, now represented by counsel, the defendant does not contest the conviction for harassment. What he claims is that \u201c[ajlthough the Commonwealth may have proved that unauthorized access to a computer system occurred on at least one occasion, the Commonwealth failed to prove that the elements of unauthorized access occurred fifteen separate times.\u201d We agree that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>evidence presented to the jury did not warrant fifteen convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Because of a lack of direct authority discussing how the number of offenses under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 120F, is to be determined, we will address that issue prior to discussing the particular facts here involved. The statute describes the offense as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-6\">\u201cWhoever, without authorization, knowingly accesses a computer system by any means, or after gaining access to a computer system by any means knows that such access is not authorized and fails to terminate such access, shall be punished by imprisonment in the house of correction for not more than thirty days or by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-7\">\u201cThe requirement of a password or other authentication to gain access shall constitute notice that access is limited to authorized users.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 120F, inserted by St. 1994, c. 168, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">The defendant and the Commonwealth agree on two principles: one, that each unauthorized \u201clogin\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to a computer system constitutes a separate offense, and two, that the number of documents accessed upon any given \u201clogin\u201d is not relevant in determining the number of convictions. We are in accord.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">The first principle that each separate unauthorized \u201clogin\u201d to a computer system is a separate offense finds support in <em>Ebel-ing </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>237 U.S. 625, 629 (1915). There, the defendant was charged with numerous counts under \u00a7 189 of the Criminal Code<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> providing penalties for \u201c[wjhoever shall tear, cut, or otherwise injure any mail bag, pouch, or other thing used or designed for use in the conveyance of the mail . . . .\u201d The Supreme Court held that the offense as to each separate bag was complete when that bag was cut. Similarly, here, the of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>fense is complete as to each separate act of gaming unauthorized access (e.g., by \u201clogin\u201d) to a computer system.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The second principle is that each unauthorized \u201clogin\u201d to a computer system must be distinguished from the subsequent accessing of individual documents during that \u201clogin.\u201d In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>395 Mass. 20, 21-23 (1985) <em>(Donovan), </em>the defendants attached a \u201cphony\u201d night deposit box to a bank and received deposits from seven different bank customers. The jury found the defendants guilty on seven indictments for larceny. In reversing and holding that there was only one larceny, the Supreme Judicial Court quoted from <em>State </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>407 A.2d 307, 309 (Me. 1979), in turn quoting from 2 Anderson, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law &amp; Procedure \u00a7 451 (1957): \u201cThe stealing of property from different owners at the same time and at the same place constitutes but one larceny.\u201d <em>Donovan, </em>395 Mass, at 30. The <em>Donovan </em>court considered analogous the cases interpreting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1708 (1982), the Federal statute proscribing theft from the United States mail. Those cases, cited in <em>Donovan, </em>395 Mass. at 30-31, hold that taking several letters from a mail depository simultaneously is one criminal act even though the letters are separate. Thus, whether a defendant should be charged with multiple counts of mail theft or a single count depends largely on whether the defendant stole multiple letters or packages at the same time or at different times. See <em>Johnston </em>v. <em>Lagomarsino, </em>88 F.2d 86, 88 (9th Cir. 1937). We think the same reasoning applies here: when a defendant, without authorization, logs into a computer system and during that one \u201clogin\u201d looks at, prints, copies, or otherwise accesses multiple documents, there is only one violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">We now turn to the evidence elicited at the defendant\u2019s trial. The defendant and his former wife, Doris, had gone through a bitter divorce, and at the time of trial were still contesting the question of custody of their daughter. As the harassment conviction is not being appealed, we need not detail the events that led to that conviction other than to state that relations between the defendant and Doris remained hostile.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">The unauthorized access to Doris\u2019s electronic mail messages (e-mail) was disclosed when the defendant, on August 6, 2003, sent an e-mail to Nancy, the former wife of Doris\u2019s fianc\u00e9, David. That e-mail included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>\u201cI found you through emails shared by David to Doris. My daughter Lauren, informed me of my ex wife\u2019s password which has now been changed. I have in my possession, three emails from you to David, that David shared with Doris. The original email and his edited reply. I would gladly share them with you but they are on paper, not in a file. If you wish to know more, I would gladly give you the dates and details of them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Nancy was a witness at trial. She testified that, at her request, she received from the defendant copies of numerous e-mails containing highly personal communications between David and Doris as well as one from her (Nancy\u2019s) daughter to David, who is her daughter\u2019s father.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Copies of the e-mails from the defendant to Nancy and of the eighteen e-mail printouts mailed to her by the defendant were exhibits at trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On the bottom right-hand comer of each of the eighteen e-mail printouts appears a mechanically printed date. The earliest comer date is \u201c3/30/03\u201d and the latest is \u201c7/14/ 03.\u201d Several printouts have the same date in the bottom right-hand comer. Thirteen different comer dates appear on the copies of the eighteen printouts the defendant sent to Nancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">The fifteen counts of the criminal complaint charging the defendant with violations of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 120F, were identical and stated that the defendant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">\u201con 11/07/2002 THRU 10/31/2003: (1) without authorization, did knowingly access a computer system; or (2) after gaining access to a computer system, and knowing that such access was not authorized, did fail to terminate such access, in violation of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 120F. (PENALTY: house of correction not more than 30 days; or not more than $1000 fine; or both.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">We note that the November 7, 2002, date is the date of the earliest e-mail between Doris and David that was sent to Nancy. The November 7, 2002, printout has \u201c5/13/03\u201d on the bottom right-hand comer.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>At trial the comer dates were never mentioned by the prosecutor, the defendant, the judge, or by any of the witnesses. The number of violations was hardly mentioned. The prosecutor in her opening spoke of the pattern of conduct directed against Doris Piersall and stated, \u201cAnd I want you to keep in mind the unauthorized access of a computer system. Forget that there\u2019s fifteen counts. You will hear testimony of how many times and what\u2019s going on.\u201d At trial there was no testimony concerning multiple accesses or \u201clogins\u201d by the defendant; only the e-mails were discussed. In her closing, the prosecutor did not mention multiple accesses. Her only mention of numbers was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">\u201cWell, he downloaded her emails. Eighteen of them. Take a look at them. . . . They\u2019re love notes. . . . And whether or not you taught your four year old daughter your password doesn\u2019t give your ex-husband permission to go into your email. That computer system, and download them. All of those emails, and send them to anybody else.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The judge\u2019s complete instructions on the computer charges are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He, too, made no mention of the number of violations or how to determine them. In discussing the verdict slips, he said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">\u201cThere will be jury verdict forms, and I\u2019ve \u2014 I\u2019ve done this. There\u2019s three of them. And they are self-explanatory. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>And there is one \u2014 rather than submit to you fifteen on each count, one on each count, I\u2019ve done one on count one, on the unauthorized access to the computer. So that\u2019s on one. And then I\u2019ve done another form for the remaining counts, two to fifteen. Third, there\u2019ll be a jury verdict form for harassment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">In its brief, the Commonwealth points to the comer dates on the printouts and argues that the jury could infer that each date reflects a separate \u201clogin.\u201d Recognizing that there are only thirteen different comer dates, the Commonwealth urges that the number of the defendant\u2019s convictions be reduced to thirteen and that such thirteen convictions be affirmed. One difficulty with that solution is that the jury were never instructed as to how to determine the number of violations. There was no instruction to the jury that they were to consider each \u201clogin\u201d as opposed to each e-mail as a separate access. Had there been sufficient evidence of multiple \u201clogins,\u201d we would have held that the absence of proper instmctions created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice entitling the defendant to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The difficulty, however, is more serious, as we cannot agree that the comer dates alone, without any testimony, expert or otherwise as to their import, provided sufficient evidence of separate \u201clogins.\u201d While many jurors may be computer literate, many may not be. Moreover, each comer date may not reflect a separate \u201clogin\u201d to the victim\u2019s e-mail.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There was no evidence permitting the jury to consider each comer date as a separate \u201clogin,\u201d or to view the occurrence of the same comer date on several printouts as reflecting one \u201clogin.\u201d Not only was there no discussion of the significance of the comer dates, but the prosecutor made no mention of them and only referred to the eighteen e-mails. It was only the defendant who, in his closing, questioned the number of counts. We consider the evidence presented to the jury to have been insufficient to enable them to determine how many times the defendant gained unauthorized access to a computer system. Accordingly, the multiple convictions must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">The defendant does not urge that there was insufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>evidence for conviction of one count of the crime. Indeed, his August 6, 2003, e-mail to Nancy clearly provides sufficient evidence of an unauthorized access.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">In conclusion, the judgment of conviction of the first count of unauthorized access to a computer system is affirmed. On counts two through fifteen charging like offenses, the judgments are reversed, the verdicts are set aside, and judgments shall enter for the defendant. The case is remanded to the District Court for a determination whether the sentence imposed on the single conviction for unauthorized access to a computer system is still appropriate<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and, if not, for vacation of the sentence imposed and for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b275-11\">Compare 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030(a)(5)(A)(ii) and (iii) (Supp. 2003) which, in addition to access, requires that the access result in damage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b275-12\">By \u201clogin,\u201d we refer to the statutory language of using a \u201cpassword or other authentication to gain access\u201d to a computer system.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b275-13\">Act of Mar. 4, 1909, c. 321, \u00a7 189, 35 Stat. 1088, 1124 (current version at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1706 [2000]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b277-10\">Nancy\u2019s testimony on direct examination seemed to indicate that she received the eighteen e-mails electronically and had printed them out.

And for the purpose of the statute, a computer system would mean any system that you would have to get into in order to access another computer. I hope that\u2019s clear.
