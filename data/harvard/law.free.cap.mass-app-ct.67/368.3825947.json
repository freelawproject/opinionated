A Juvenile Court judge revised an existing order for mandatory postadoption visitation by permitting visitation only at the discretion of the adoptive parents. Both the biological parents and the children appeal the revised order. We conclude that, due to changed circumstances, the revision was permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-15\"><em>Background. </em>In 1998, the Department of Social Services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>(DSS) filed a care and protection petition on behalf of four children: Edgar, who was bom on August 3, 1991; Sara, who was bom on April 30, 1993; and two younger children who are not part of this appeal. In 2001, after a trial, the judge terminated the biological parents\u2019 parental rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge also ordered bi-weekly posttermination visits for three months and monthly visits for the following three months, after which visits were left to the discretion of DSS. The children had their last visit with their biological parents in June, 2002. In April, 2003, DSS identified preadoptive parents willing to adopt all four children and placed them together into that preadoptive home. Ultimately, all four children were adopted by their preadoptive parents on November 19, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">On August 1, 2003, the judge, who was then unaware of the children\u2019s recent April, 2003, placement, issued findings of fact relative to the earlier decrees terminating parental rights. Based on these findings, he ordered that Edgar and Sara have at least two postadoption visits each year with their biological parents (original order). Further visitation, as well as all visitation in regard to the two younger children, was left to the discretion of prospective adoptive parents. The biological parents appealed the decrees, and on March 2, 2004, this court affirmed. <em>Adoption of Edgar, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 1119 (2004). See note 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">On June 30, 2004, DSS moved for reconsideration of the original postadoption visitation order, requesting that all decisions regarding visitation be left to the discretion of the adoptive parents. The biological parents and Edgar and Sara opposed that motion. The judge conducted an evidentiary hearing on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>motion on August 18, 2004, at which the preadoptive mother testified. <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge allowed the motion on September 15, 2004, revising the postadoption visitation order to read: \u201cVisits and contacts by all four children with their biological parents are best left in the hands and discretion of their adoptive parents.\u201d Edgar, Sara, and the biological parents appealed the revised order.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>At the outset, we note that central to the arguments presented by the parties is <em>Adoption of Vito, </em>431 Mass. 550, 557 (2000), where the Supreme Judicial Court held that a judge may order postadoption visitation in connection with termination proceedings if it is in the child\u2019s best interests. While it appears that there is no reported decision that addresses the circumstances posed here \u2014 the revision of a post-termination or postadoption visitation order \u2014 <em>Vito </em>and other case law provide the principles that guide our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">First, the source of the judicial power to order postadoption contact is rooted in the \u201ccenturies-old equitable authority of courts to act in the best interests of children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 559. \u201cThis equitable authority does not derive from the statutory adoption scheme, [G. L. c. 210,] but it must necessarily be attentive to the policy directives inherent in that scheme, as well as to constitutional limitations on intrusions on the prerogatives of the adoptive family.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 561-562.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Second, in evaluating the best interests of a child with respect to postadoption visitation, a judge should focus on \u201cemotional bonding and other circumstances of the actual personal relationship of the child and the biological parent, [and not on] the rights of the biological parent nor the legal consequences of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>their natural relation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 562. Third, \u201c[ajdoptive parents have the same legal rights toward their children that biological parents do.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201c[I]n ordinary circumstances adoption is meant to sever most enforceable obligations involving the biological parent with the child.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, a judge should generally avoid \u201cunnecessary involvement of the courts in long-term, wide-ranging monitoring and enforcement of the numerous postadoption contact arrangements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 563. Fourth, in considering whether to impose postadoption contact, judges should be mindful that such practice may have the deleterious impact of reducing the pool of prospective parents. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Fifth, a judge should recognize when visitation would \u201cusually be unwarranted,\u201d and when it \u201cmay be warranted.\u201d <em>Adoption of Vito, supra. </em>\u201cWhere a child has \u2018formed strong, nurturing bonds with his preadoptive family, and there is little or no evidence of a significant, existing bond with the biological parent, judicial exercise of equitable power to require postadoption contact would usually be unwarranted.\u2019 <em>Ibid. </em>In contrast, \u2018[cjases warranting a postadoption contact order are more likely to occur where no preadoptive family has yet been identified, and where a principal, if not the only, parent-child relationship in the child\u2019s life remains with the biological parent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Adoption of Terrence, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 832, 839 (2003), quoting from <em>Adoption of Vito, supra </em>at 563-564. \u201cIn such cases, the judge has the equitable authority to ensure that contact in the best interests of the child is maintained during an appropriate transitional period posttermination, ... or even postadoption. The purpose of such contact is not to strengthen the bonds between the child and his biological mother or father, but to assist the child as he negotiates, often at a very young age, the tortuous path from one family to another.\u201d <em>Adoption of Vito, supra </em>at 564-565.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Sixth, \u201c[tjransitional provision for posttermination or post-adoption contact in the best interests of the child\u201d should be based on the <em>\u201ccurrent </em>dynamics\u201d and \u201cemotional ties\u201d between the child and the biological parent. <em>Id. </em>at- 565 (emphasis supplied). \u201c[T]he fluid nature of the best interests of the child standard requires that all evaluations of such nature be made based on the current best interests of the child.\u201d <em>Adoption of Pierce, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 342, 349-350 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Seventh, \u201c[o]nce it is established that a parent is unfit, the decision whether to grant postadoption [or posttermination] visits must be left to the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Adoption of Terrence, supra, </em>quoting from <em>Adoption of John, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 431, 439 (2001). <em>See Adoption of Saul, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 546, 555 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">In light of these principles, we conclude that the judge did not abuse his discretion in revising the visitation order in September, 2004. While the propriety of that order rests upon the new set of circumstances that were presented to the judge as the basis for the motion for reconsideration, reference to the circumstances extant for the earlier July, 2003, order reinforces and provides context for our determination that the judge\u2019s revised order should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">In his September, 2004, order, the judge observed that when the original postadoption visitation order was issued in July, 2003, the evidence was that Edgar and Sara were in one foster home, and the two younger children were in another. Neither home was preadoptive, and although DSS planned to search for a single adoptive family, the chance of success appeared to be \u201cunlikely.\u201d While the biological parents displayed a \u201cpoor track record of not following directions and Orders from the Court,\u201d as well as being \u201cdeceptive reporters,\u201d the judge, citing <em>Adoption of Vito, </em>431 Mass. at 562, determined that visitation was then appropriate for Edgar and Sara based upon his analysis of the \u201cemotional bonding and other circumstances of the actual personal relationship of the biological parents and the children.\u201d The judge found that the biological parents had visited regularly with Edgar and Sara, that Edgar and Sara \u201cenjoyed their visits,\u201d that they were \u201cthe most attached\u201d of the four children to their biologic\u00e1l parents, and that they had expressed a desire to go home.\u201d The judge also found that there was no evidence to suggest that any of the children had \u201can appreciable bond with a foster parent.\u201d Based upon these considerations, the judge found that limited postadoption visits were then in Edgar and Sara\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">The balance of these considerations had drastically shifted by the time of the judge\u2019s September, 2004, revised order, as the judge himself noted. By then, Edgar and Sara had not seen their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>biological parents in two years. Unexpectedly (and happily), an adoptive home had been found where all four children could live together, and they were all adjusting well to their new family and environment. Indeed, the children were \u201cthriv[ing]\u201d in the care of their adoptive parents, who they called \u201cMom\u201d and \u201cDad.\u201d,The adoptive mother \u201cdemonstrated in her testimony that she has good insight, and understands the character traits and needs of each of the children.\u201d The adoptive mother had expressed concern that mandatory visits for Edgar and Sara \u201cmight trigger behavioral repercussions or a relapse to the sort of problems [Edgar and Sara] were having when they arrived\u201d in the adoptive parents\u2019 home. There was no evidence that the biological parents\u2019 circumstances had changed in any meaningful way. Again, citing the <em>Adoption of Vito, supra </em>at 562, court\u2019s directive to focus \u201con emotional bonding and other circumstances of the actual personal relationship of the child and the biological parent,\u201d the judge concluded that mandatory contact postadoption was no longer appropriate and that future visitation ought to be determined by the adoptive parents. See <em>Adoption of Greta, </em>431 Mass. 577, 588-589 (2000); <em>Adoption of Terrence, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Quite properly, the judge\u2019s September, 2004, revised order reflected the principle that given changed circumstances and evolving best interests, court orders regarding conditions of visitation are subject to revision. See <em>Adoption of Vito, supra </em>at 563 (\u201c[w]hat may be in [a child\u2019s] best interest at [an earlier age] says little about his best interests [as he gets older]\u201d); <em>Adoption of Gwendolyn, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 130, 139 (1990). Edgar and Sara, and the biological parents, argue that there was really no change in circumstances, since the original July, 2003, order was issued in the hope that all four children would be adopted by the same family. Therefore, they contend, that visitation order contemplated the very situation in which the children now live. This argument misapprehends the nature of the judge\u2019s inquiry. In deciding on postadoption visitation, the judge is to evaluate the present state of emotional bonding and the relationships of the children with their biological parents and must take into account whether there is an identified preadoptive family or whether there is a preadoptive family with whom the child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>has \u201cstrong, nurturing bonds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 562-564. Here, whatever the judge may have hoped for when he entered the July, 2003, order, he based his order then on the fact that the children were not living with preadoptive parents with whom they had a bond, but did have a parent-child relationship with their biological parents. It is undisputed that these circumstances had changed by September, 2004, when the judge revised his original order.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Finally, the children and the biological parents argue that the judge erred in revising the order for postadoption visitation because there was no showing of a \u201cmaterial and substantial change in circumstances,\u201d as required by G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 6D, inserted by St. 1999, c. 3, \u00a7 21. Quite apart from the fact that, as detailed above, there was such a change, the children and the biological parents are mistaken in seeking to apply the provisions of G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 6D, to this case. Section 6D, by its very terms, only applies to a court-approved agreement for postadoption contact.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Adoption of Vito, supra </em>at 559. It is a specific statutory remedy for enforcement of agreements for postadoption visitation that are entered into knowingly and voluntarily by the parties. This case however involves not an agreement among parties, but a court order for postadoption contact. Its source is the court\u2019s equitable powers, and as such, it can only stand so long as it continues to be equitable. See <em>Adoption of Vito, supra </em>at 559-560.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Here, because of changed circumstances, the judge did not abuse his discretion in determining that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>no longer in the children\u2019s best interests to have court-ordered postadoption visitation and that the adoptive parents were in the best position \u201cto monitor [Edgar\u2019s and Sara\u2019s] changing needs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 563. See <em>Adoption of Gwendolyn, supra. </em>Accordingly, the revised order leaving postadoption visitation to the discretion of the adoptive parents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b397-7\">This court, in an unpublished memorandum and order pursuant to rule 1:28 affirming the decrees, noted</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-8\">\u201ca long history of abuse and neglect of the four children; the parents\u2019 chronic transiency and their failure to meet the children\u2019s basic needs including housing; the mother\u2019s mental illness and her inability to handle her finances; the father and the mother\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s history of substance abuse and their failure to comply with [DSS\u2019s] service plans; and the parents\u2019 continuing failure to resolve their problems despite the services made available to them by [DSS] and several other agencies and resources.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-9\"><em>Adoption of Edgar, </em>60 Mass.

The judge stated in his posthearing memorandum that, \u201c[ajccording to their attorney, [Edgar] wants to have ongoing contact with his parents, with a visit once a year [and] ....</p>\n<p id=\"aep-dedup-1\">[Sara] wants another \u2018goodby visit.\u2019 \u201d Although Edgar was summonsed to appear at the August 19, 2004 hearing, according to the unchallenged testimony of his adoptive mother (which was accepted by the judge), Edgar \u201cdid not want to come to Court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b398-11\">On November 15, 2004, DSS and Edgar and Sara entered into a stipulation agreeing that, if the children were adopted before the children\u2019s appeal from the September 15, 2004, postadoption visitation order were resolved, DSS would not argue that the appeal should not be decided because the children had been adopted. Four days later, as noted <em>supra, </em>the children were adopted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b402-6\">General Laws c. 210, \u00a7 6D, states: \u201cIn an enforcement proceeding, the court may modify the terms of the agreement if the court finds that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances and the modification is necessary in the best interests of the child. A court-imposed modification of a previously approved agreement may limit, restrict, condition or decrease contact between the birth parents and the child but in no event shall a court-imposed modification serve to expand, enlarge or increase the amount of contact between the birth parents and the child or place new obligations on adoptive parents.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The biological parents also argue that DSS erred procedurally by requesting revision of the order through a Mass.R.Civ.P. 60(b), 365 Mass. 828 (1979), motion. DSS responds that it was simply asking for modification of the order and was only analogizing to a rule 60(b) situation in explaining its request. Ultimately, the parties agree that a judge has the power to revise a postadoption visitation order under some circumstances. Because we conclude that those circumstances were met in this case, we need not address this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>The biological parents also argue that two of the judge\u2019s findings in the September 15, 2004, memorandum were unsupported by the record. Because these two findings are unrelated to the state of the children\u2019s emotional bonding and personal relationships with their biological parents, they are not essential to the judge\u2019s ruling, or our conclusion on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
