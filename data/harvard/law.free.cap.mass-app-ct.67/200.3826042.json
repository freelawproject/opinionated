The commission\u2019s decision was based on G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40, the State Wetlands Protection Act, and art. 27 of the Barnstable Wetlands Protection By-law (by-law). On review in the nature of certiorari (G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4), a judge of the Superior Court concluded that the commission\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence and annulled it. We think the commission acted lawfully and reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The plaintiffs, Charles and Francene Rodgers (plaintiffs), own a house at 621 Old Post Road in Cotuit, situated on a 2.7 acre lot with 200 feet of frontage on Cotuit Bay. They filed a notice of intent with the commission on September 19, 2002, for the construction of a pier 121 feet long to be built in three sections, with an attached ramp, and an eight foot by ten foot float extending into the bay. That submission was made in conformity with G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40, and art. 27 of the by-law. The proposed pier was to be constructed at or near a \u201cShellfish Relay Area,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> so designated by the town\u2019s shellfish biologist and deputy shellfish constable and the director of the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries. The area was designated a \u201c4\u201d zone in terms of shellfish productivity (out of a scale of 1 to 10).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">During the course of the proceedings before the commission, the plaintiffs modified the design of the pier. They redesigned the pier so that its elevation would be about two and one-half feet higher (eight and one-half feet above the mean low water level), and the over-all length of the pier was shortened by twelve feet. There was considerable resistance to the project from area residents and shellfishermen, many of whom signed a petition in opposition. Those who opposed the pier were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>concerned that it would significantly impede the recreational use of the coastline, including sailing and shellfishing.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">At the December 10, 2002, hearing, there was protracted testimony from several objecting parties concerning \u201cprop dredging problems\u201d caused by the construction of a pier. According to the testimony, prop dredging creates large holes in the ocean floor around the pier. One shellfisherman opined that the holes would be so deep that \u201cif you\u2019ve got waders on and you hit one of those holes, you\u2019re not coming back up.\u201d One of the commissioners expressed his concern that prop dredging stirs up the fine sediments of the ocean substrata, which might hamper the growth and development of different kinds of fish and shellfish.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The commission found that although the shellfish surveys submitted in evidence indicated low numbers of shellfish at the site of the proposed pier, those survey results were \u201can ineffective measure of the productivity and importance of the shellfishery\u201d because \u201c[t]he shellfishing at the locus is subjected to periodic commercial and recreational harvesting.\u201d The commission also recognized that the site has historically been \u201cimportant in providing quahogs for the [tjown\u2019s recreational and commercial harvests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">The commission made the following additional findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">\u201c6. The site is found significant under [G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40,] to the interest of protection of land containing shellfish, and significant under Article 27 of the Town of Barnstable General Ordinances to the interests of shellfish and recreation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-9\">\u201c7. The Commission took testimony and correspondence from recreational shellfishermen who cited likely adverse impacts to the shellfishery should the project ensue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-10\">\u201c8. The Director of the MA Division of Marine Fisheries stated that the locus\u2019 \u2018use as a shellfish propagation area will be compromised if the construction of a pier with its attendant use by boats is permitted.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-11\">\u201c9. Article 27 of the Town of Barnstable General Ordinances regulates recreation, which it defines to include shellfishing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>\u201c10. Based on the testimony provided, the Commission finds it more likely than not that the proposed pier will inhibit and impede access to the shellfishery by recreational shellfishermen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-5\">\u201c11. Inhibiting and impeding access is found to pose a significant adverse impact to the recreation interest as protected by Article 27.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-6\">\u201c12. The locus is but one of approximately 8 parcels which are located along the northerly shore of the Shellfish Relay Area. None of the eight has a pier. The Commission finds the project will have a significant cumulative effect upon recreation and shellfish as regulated under Article 27, as it will lead to the likelihood of additional piers constructed within the Relay Area.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">On February 4, 2003, the commission denied approval of the proposed pier under G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40, \u201cin the interest of protection of land containing shellfish, and under [art. 27] in the interest of shellfish[ing] and recreation.\u201d The plaintiffs appealed the commission\u2019s decision to the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) pursuant to G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40, which issued a superseding order of conditions (superseding order) on November 17, 2003, permitting the project. The commission filed an appeal from that order with the DEP, requesting an adjudicatory hearing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiffs also filed this action in the Superior Court, seeking, inter alla, relief in the nature of certiorari. In ruling on the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings, the judge found that the commission\u2019s decision was preempted by the DEP\u2019s superseding order and unsupported by substantial evidence, \u201cannulled\u201d the commission\u2019s decision, and ordered entry of judgment for the plaintiffs. Only the appeal by the town and the commission from the Superior Court judgment is before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">2. <em>Standard of review. </em>When considering a case in the nature of certiorari, \u201cthe standard of review may vary according to the nature of the action for which review is sought.\u201d <em>Forsyth Sch. for Dental Hygienists </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Dentistry, </em>404 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Mass. 211, 217 (1989). See <em>T.D.J. Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of N. Andover, 36 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 124, 128 (1994). \u201cIn order to overturn [an agency\u2019s decision], the applicants must establish that it was arbitrary and capricious or unsupported by substantial evidence. See <em>Lovequist </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of Dennis, </em>379 Mass. 7, 18 (1979); <em>FIC Homes of Blackstone, Inc. </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of Blackstone, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. [681,] 684-685 &amp; n.4 [1996].\u201d <em>Dubuque </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of Barnstable, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 824, 828-829 (2003). \u201cIf the agency has, in the discretionary exercise of its expertise, made a choice between two fairly conflicting views, and its selection reflects reasonable evidence, a court may not displace [the agency\u2019s] choice.\u201d <em>Conservation Commn. of Falmouth </em>v. <em>Pacheco, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 737, 739-740 n.3 (2000) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">3. <em>The Barnstable by-law. </em>It is settled that the town, under its by-law, could set wetland protection standards that were more demanding than those set forth in the statutory scheme. <em>Lovequist </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of Dennis, </em>379 Mass. at 15. <em>DeGrace </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of Harwich, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 132, 135-136 (1991). <em>T.D.J. Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of N. Andover, 36 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 125-126.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The town\u2019s by-law includes a wetlands protection provision in art. 27. Section 1 of art. 27 sets out the purpose of the bylaw, which includes protection of shellfish and recreation. Section 6 of art. 27 empowers the commission \u201cto deny a permit ... for failure to avoid or prevent unacceptable significant or cumulative effects upon the wetlands values protected by this by-law [and] where it is deemed that the denial is necessary to preserve the environmental quality of resource areas.\u201d Article 27 does not define shellfish, thus adopting the definition of shellfish included in 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.34 (1997),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but does define recreation in \u00a7 14 as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">\u201cAny leisure activity or sport taking place in, on, or within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>100 feet of a resource area which is dependent on the resource area and its values directly or indirectly for its conduct and enjoyment. Recreational activities include, but are not limited to, the following: noncommercial fishing and shellfishing, hunting, boating, swimming, walking, painting, birdwatching and aesthetic enjoyment. Structures and activities in or within 100 feet of a resource area shall not have a significant effect on public recreational values JJ</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">In contrast, the Code of Massachusetts Regulations refers to recreation only as an aspect to be taken into account by a conservation commission or DEP in deciding whether land can be considered significant to the protection of land containing shellfish. See 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.34(3) (1997). Thus, even though the by-law does not provide more stringent protection of shellfish than the State statute and related regulations,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> it does regulate the protection of recreational pursuits more austerely. See <em>Hobbs Brook Farm Property Co. Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of Lincoln, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 142, 149-150 (2005) (a town by-law identified protected values and requirements that were not specifically contained in either the relevant State statute or the related regulations; the town by-law was thus \u201cmore stringent than the act and related regulations\u201d). Since the commission\u2019s decision is based at least in part on its determination that the proposed pier would inhibit recreation under art. 27, it cannot be preempted by the DBF\u2019s superseding order. See <em>F1C Homes of Blackstone, Inc. </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of Blackstone, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. at 687.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">4. <em>Commission\u2019s findings. </em>An agency\u2019s finding \u201cmust be set aside if \u2018the evidence points to no felt or appreciable probability of the conclusion or points to an overwhelming probability of the contrary.\u2019 \u201d <em>New Boston Garden Corp. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>383 Mass. 456, 466 (1981), quoting from <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Concord, </em>355 Mass. 79, 92 (1968). A finding is based upon substantial evidence if \u201cexperience <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>permits the reasoning mind to make the finding; [i.e.,] whether the finding <em>could </em>have been made by reference to the logic of experience\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cThe substantiality of evidence must take into account whatever in the record fairly detracts from its weight.\u201d <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Pharmacy, </em>350 Mass. 246, 253 (1966), quoting from <em>Universal Camera Corp. </em>v. <em>National Labor Relations Bd., </em>340 U.S. 474, 488 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Here, the commission\u2019s findings regarding recreation were based on substantial evidence. The commission took into account the redesigned pier, the testimony and correspondence from area shellfishermen, and the testimony and reports of experts. Although the plaintiffs might be correct that there are few shellfish at the locus, area residents were clearly concerned about interference with their recreational pursuits. The definition of recreation in art. 27 does not require that recreational shellfishing be productive or successful. Additionally, the locus was part of, or close to, a shellfish relay area that had received contaminated shellfish in the past for rehabilitation. The commission considered this as a factor in protecting the recreational shellfishing interest in the area. The commission also noted during the hearing that it was \u201crare that we get such numbers of individuals willing to come out for public comment to oppose a particular application.\u201d The definition of recreation in art. 27 provides the commission with some flexibility in balancing recreational interests. A rational mind could logically infer from the number and strength of the opposing patties that many area residents and recreational shellfishermen had an avid and active interest in the area that would be adversely affected by the pier. See, e.g., <em>Titcomb </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Sandwich, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 725, 731-732 (2005) (where the spirit of the by-law was permissive, the zoning board\u2019s decision to allow a nonconforming use could be upheld). See also <em>Dubuque </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of Barnstable, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. at 828 (noting that the commission is permitted to balance the interests of the public with the interest of the individual applicant).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The plaintiffs argue that the commission\u2019s finding \u201cthat the project will have a significant cumulative impact upon shellfish-ing as regulated under Article 27\u201d establishes that the commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>sion had an ad hoc agenda to oppose the construction of all piers in the area. \u201cIf the agency has acted for reasons that are extraneous to the prescriptions of the regulatory scheme, but are related, rather, to an ad hoc agenda, then that agency has acted arbitrarily because the basis for action is not uniform, and, it follows, is not predictable.\u201d <em>Fafard </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of Reading, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 565, 568 (1996). We need only to refer to the town\u2019s Guidelines for New Private Piers (guidelines) to determine that the commission\u2019s decision is not arbitrary. The guidelines provide that, in applying art. 27, the commission should consider \u201cthe number, spacing, and lengths of adjacent piers,\u201d and further gives the commission the ability to resolve conflicting interests by determining \u201cthe most significant interest in the location concerned.\u201d Article 27 itself provides in \u00a7 6 that the commission may consider the cumulative effects of a project upon wetland values protected by the by-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">As previously noted, the Superior Court judge disagreed with the commission\u2019s findings and conclusions. With respect to the recreational use of the locus, he concluded that the pier \u201cwould have no impact on recreation, navigation or boating\u201d and that the commission\u2019s findings \u201cin large part are not reflective of what the evidence was before the [cjommission.\u201d Specifically, the judge took issue with finding 7 because it was based on comments that were \u201cnon-specific to the area\u201d and anecdotal; finding 10 because shellfishermen would not be impeded by the redesigned pier; comments of the commissioners during the hearing that indicated some uncertainty whether the site of the proposed pier was a shellfish relay area; and finding 12 because he felt it was \u201cnot based upon any evidence in the record since there are no piers in the area.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">These points, even if correctly criticized by the judge, were relatively obscure in comparison to the commission\u2019s detailed and specific findings that the proposed construction would have an adverse impact on the interests protected under the by-law. On this record, we cannot say that the commission\u2019s decision was unsupported by substantial evidence or arbitrary. Ordinarily, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>judicial review of an agency decision takes place, as here, on the basis of an administrative record. The commission was faced with a proposal that affected the interests of many shellfishermen. One could debate the rightness or wrongness of the commission\u2019s balancing of the interests involved, but in the case of administrative agency adjudication, we give substantial deference to the agency\u2019s findings of fact and interpretation of its regulations. <em>Conservation Commn. of Falmouth </em>v. <em>Pacheco, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. at 739 n.3. We conclude that the commission did not err in denying the plaintiffs\u2019 request for an order of conditions to build their pier.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The judgment is reversed, and a new judgment is to enter upholding the decision of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b229-7\">The town\u2019s shellfish biologist and deputy shellfish constable explained that \u201c[sjhellfish [r]clay [a]reas are designated as such based primarily on the fact that they are suitable habitats for the long term survival and growth of selected transplanted shellfish.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b229-8\">During the hearing, the commission\u2019s chairperson read into the record a letter from the town\u2019s shellfish biologist and deputy shellfish constable reporting the results of a shellfish survey performed at the site of the proposed pier. These results were similar to another survey commissioned by the plaintiffs.
