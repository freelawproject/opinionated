L. c. 94C, \u00a7 47(a). Tricoche claims that the Commonwealth failed to make out a sufficient case for forfeiture because the Commonwealth neither established that the automobile was used in the business of distributing narcotics nor provided prima facie evidence of the involvement of the BMW automobile in distribution on three or more separate dates. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-14\">The case was submitted to the judge upon agreed facts as follows. The Haverhill police narcotics unit received information that Deborah Costantino, the resident of 134 Summer Street, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>apartment 2, in Haverhill, was a cocaine seller. At the direction of the police narcotics unit, Trooper Stephen Gondella went to Costantino\u2019s apartment to make an undercover cocaine purchase. Trooper Gondella had with him a sum of marked money provided by the police narcotics unit to make the cocaine purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Trooper Gondella entered Costantino\u2019s apartment and had a conversation with her. Costantino stated that she would be willing to sell him cocaine worth one hundred dollars. Trooper Gondella handed Costantino one hundred dollars. Costantino then made a telephone call to an individual whom she identified as her dealer and asked the dealer to deliver the drugs to her apartment. Shortly thereafter, the surveillance team observed John Tricoche operating a dark-colored BMW, which he parked in front of Costantino\u2019s apartment building. Tricoche exited the BMW and walked over to the side of Costantino\u2019s apartment building. At that time, Costantino informed Trooper Gondella that her dealer had arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Costantino left her apartment and walked outside the building. She proceeded to the same side of the building where Tricoche had gone. Moments later, the surveillance team observed Tricoche jogging back to his BMW, while Costantino walked back inside her apartment building. Surveillance was maintained on Trichoche as he left the area in the BMW. After returning to her apartment, Costantino handed Trooper Gondella two plastic twists containing \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine. At that point, Trooper Gon-della notified the \u201cTake-Down Team\u201d that the cocaine purchase had been completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">Tricoche was stopped in his BMW at the intersection of Main Street and Fountain Street in Haverhill. Located in one of Tricoche\u2019s pockets was eighty dollars of Trooper Gondella\u2019s marked money. Tricoche was placed under arrest, and his BMW was towed to the police station. Costantino was later arrested at her apartment. Tricoche ultimately pleaded guilty to a charge of distributing cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\"><em>Discussion. </em>General Laws c. 94C, \u00a7 47(a)(3), as amended by St. 1989, c. 653, \u00a7 73, provides that the following are subject to forfeiture: \u201c[a]ll conveyances, including aircraft, vehicles or vessels used, or intended for use, to transport, conceal, or otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>facilitate the manufacture, dispensing, distribution of or possession with intent to manufacture, dispense or distribute, a controlled substance . ...\u201d In a forfeiture proceeding, the Commonwealth has \u201cthe burden of proving to the court the existence of probable cause [to believe],\u201d G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 47(d), as amended by St. 1989, c. 653, \u00a7 79, \u201cthat at least on one occasion the conveyance was used or intended for use in the manner described in [\u00a7 47](a)(3).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>One 1976 Cadillac DeVille Auto., </em>380 Mass. 411, 415 (1980). Once the Commonwealth demonstrates such probable cause for forfeiture,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201c[the] claimant shall then have the burden of proving that the property is not forfeitable\u201d because it was not used in the manner alleged. G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 47(d). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>426 Mass. 475, 481 n.7 (1998) (Commonwealth \u201chas the initial burden of showing the existence of probable cause for forfeiture of the subject property, after which the burden of proof is on the claimant of the property to establish that it is not forfeitable\u201d). Even if the property was used in a manner that would subject it to forfeiture, the claimant may defeat forfeiture by showing that the use falls within certain specified \u201cexceptions to forfeiture,\u201d G. L. c. 94C \u00a7 47(d), including that the use occurred without the claimant\u2019s knowledge. G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 47(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">In this case, the judge determined correctly that the Commonwealth had met its burden of proof under \u00a7 47(a)(3). The facts establish that the BMW was used to transport cocaine for distribution. The surveillance team observed Tricoche operating the BMW and going to and from Costantino\u2019s apartment. In addition, Costantino recognized the BMW when Tricoche parked it in front of her apartment, and Costantino told the undercover trooper that her dealer had arrived. Tricoche also had in his possession marked money used by the trooper to purchase the cocaine. In short, fairly read, the record shows that Tricoche drove to Costantino\u2019s apartment in his BMW in order to distribute cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">While Tricoche admits that the BMW was used for transport<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>ing narcotics on that one occasion, he argues, citing to G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 47(c)(3),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that the judge impermissibly ordered forfeiture of the BMW because the Commonwealth did not prove that the vehicle was \u201cused in the business of distributing] cocaine,\u201d and had not presented prima facie evidence of \u201cbusiness\u201d use by showing involvement in distribution on three or more separate dates. His contentions are not persuasive because G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 47(c)(3), does not apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">General Laws c. 94C, \u00a7 47(c)(3), which is patterned after the Federal \u201cinnocent owner provision,\u201d see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>One 1986 Volkswagen GTI Auto., </em>417 Mass. 369, 373 (1994), creates, as we have noted, an exception to the forfeiture the Commonwealth has the initial burden of establishing. G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 47(d). \u201cThe intent of the [forfeiture statute] is to deprive criminals of the tools by which they conduct their illegal activities . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>One 1986 Volkswagen GTI Auto., supra </em>at 374, quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Premises Known as 526 Liscum Drive, Dayton, Montgomery County, Ohio, </em>866 F.2d 213, 217 (6th Cir. 1989). At the same time, reflecting a concern that drug-related forfeiture laws not be \u201cused to take away the property of innocent third parties,\u201d or, for example, to penalize the \u201cowner of an automobile [who] was an unwitting participant,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>One 1987 Mercury Cougar Auto., </em>413 Mass. 534, 541 (1992), the \u201cinnocent owner\u201d provision \u2014 G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 47(c)(3) \u2014 permits a claimant to rebut forfeiture by presenting evidence to show absence of knowledge. Here, not only did Tricoche fail to present any evidence of absence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>knowledge so as to trigger \u00a7 47(c)(3), cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>One 1987 Mercury Cougar Auto., </em>413 Mass, at 536 (claimant opposing summary judgment motion seeking forfeiture must set forth specific facts and may not rest on mere allegations or denials in pleadings), but the undisputed facts in the record show that Tricoche knowingly used the automobile to \u201ctransport, conceal, or otherwise facilitate . . . the distribution of ... a controlled substance.\u201d G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 47(a)(3). Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertions, \u00a7 47(a)(3) does not require that the vehicle be used in an ongoing distribution \u201cbusiness\u201d to be subject to forfeiture. In sum, Tricoche has not presented any facts or argument that would suggest that the \u201cinnocent owner\u201d provision has any application here. The Commonwealth met its burden of proof to support the forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b703-7\">The Commonwealth\u2019s burden is \u201csimilar to its burden in seeking an indictment and less than its burden at a probable cause hearing to determine whether someone should be held for trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fourteen Thousand Two Hundred Dollars, </em>421 Mass. 1, 9 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b704-6\">General Laws c. 94C, \u00a7 47(c)(3), as amended by St. 1989, c. 653, \u00a7 78, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-7\">\u201cNo conveyance . . . shall be' subject to forfeiture unless the owner thereof knew or should have known that such conveyance or real property was used in and for the business of unlawfully manufacturing, dispensing, or distributing controlled substances.
