(father), in a subsequent proceeding. The father claims that the Probate and Family Court lacked jurisdiction over the issue of custody as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>relates to the parties\u2019 older child, who was bom in Puerto Rico. Without the father\u2019s consent, the defendant, E.S. (mother), removed that child to Massachusetts where she has family, there obtaining an abuse prevention order on allegations of abuse by the father that were, in a later proceeding, credited by a judge of the Probate and Family Court following trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The father did not appeal the October 22, 2001, judgment of divorce nisi awarding to the mother sole legal and physical custody of that child and of a second child who was bom to the parties in Massachusetts, following their separation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Instead, well over a year later, on December 17, 2002, the father filed a complaint for modification in the Probate and Family Court alleging a change in the children\u2019s circumstances and requesting sole legal and physical custody and the right to remove the children to Puerto Rico, as well as modification of his support obligations. On the day scheduled for trial on the modification complaint (and other consolidated matters, see <em>infra), </em>the father filed a motion pursuant to G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 12(a), seeking recognition and enforcement in the Probate and Family Court of a judgment of the Superior Court of Bayam\u00f3n, Puerto Rico, dated April 18, 2001, granting him custody of the older child. The father also filed a \u201cmotion to dismiss,\u201d in essence challenging the authority of the court to exercise jurisdiction with respect to the older child. After a trial, the probate judge rejected the father\u2019s jurisdictional arguments. Treating the motion as an alternative claim for relief, the judge then proceeded to address the merits of the father\u2019s complaint and denied the father\u2019s request to modify the divorce judgment and remove the children to Puerto Rico.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Our resolution of the issues differs somewhat from that of the probate judge, whose decision we affirm. We conclude that, under applicable provisions of the Massachusetts Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (MCCJA), G. L. c. 209B, and the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act (PKPA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A (1994 &amp; Supp. 2006), Massachusetts had jurisdiction to issue an initial custody determination; such jurisdiction was properly exercised in connection with the mother\u2019s divorce action.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number><em>Background, facts and proceedings. </em>The parties were married in Puerto Rico on April 15, 1996, and the first of the two children was bom there on March 26, 1997. The marriage was unhappy and, as found by the probate judge, beginning in 1999, the father was \u201cphysically, verbally, and emotionally abusive to the [mother] and the children.\u201d* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The parties separated on October 15, 1999; on October 18, the father filed a custody petition in Puerto Rico, alleging that the mother had abandoned the child.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Following a hearing in Puerto Rico (not attended by the mother), the father was awarded temporary custody of the child until January 31, 2000, when the order expired.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After a brief reconciliation that ended in January, 2000, the mother became pregnant with the parties\u2019 younger son. See note 2, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number><em>supra. </em>They separated again, and on March 1, 2000, the mother relocated to Massachusetts without the older child, initially renting a room in her sister\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">In July, 2000, then some six months pregnant, the mother returned to Puerto Rico. On July 25, 2000, she asked that the father allow her to spend some time with the older child. Rather than return the child to the father at the end of the day, as she apparently had promised, the mother removed the child to Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The next day, July 26, 2000, the mother \u2014 citing a two-year history of physical and emotional abuse by the father against her and the child \u2014 obtained in the Probate and Family Court an abuse prevention order against the father that also awarded her custody of the older child.* <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">Meanwhile, in Puerto Rico, the father sought to initiate criminal proceedings against the mother. On August 28, 2000, a judge of \u201cthe Court of First Instance, Bayam\u00f3n Part,\u201d issued a warrant for the mother\u2019s arrest on the ground of an asserted violation of the Puerto Rico Penal Code.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On January 18, 2001, the mother was arrested on the warrant and detained at the Barnstable house of correction.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">Upon the mother\u2019s arrest, the older child was briefly placed in the custody of the Department of Social Services (department).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That same day, the father traveled to Massachusetts to retrieve the older child and was interviewed by the department concerning the allegations of abuse the mother had made against him in connection with the restraining order of July 26, 2000. The next day, January 19, 2001, the maternal grandmother filed in the Probate and Family Court a petition for temporary guardianship, in which she asserted the need to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>protect the children from abuse by the father. The father filed an opposition to the petition. A hearing was held, and on January 19, 2001, a judge of the Probate and Family Court<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> granted temporary custody of both children to the maternal grandmother, to expire on April 19, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">In his findings on the order for temporary guardianship, the probate judge found that Puerto Rico was then the home State<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> of the older child and that Massachusetts was the home State of the younger child.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The probate judge entered his order pursuant to the emergency jurisdiction provision of the MCCJA, G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 2(a)(3), on findings that an emergency existed and that the older child may have been subject to mistreatment and neglect by either or both parents.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">On February 12, 2001, the father filed a petition for habeas corpus in the Superior Court of Bayam\u00f3n, Puerto Rico, request<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>ing that the court grant him custody of and \u201cpatria potestas\u201d over the older child.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The older child had not lived in Puerto Rico for the six-month period preceding the filing of this petition, and thus Puerto Rico was not then the child\u2019s home State.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">On April 13, 2001 \u2014 by which time the older child had lived in Massachusetts for nearly nine consecutive months \u2014 the mother filed a complaint for divorce in the Probate and Family Court, requesting, among other things, custody of the children. The father, who concedes he was served with process, filed an answer to the complaint stating that the Probate and Family Court lacked jurisdiction over the custody of the older child. Referring to the facts that the child was bom in Puerto Rico and that \u201cthe cases [regarding custody of the child] started in the court of Puerto Rico and in the jurisdiction of Puerto Rico [in] October 18, 1999,\u201d the father claimed in his answer that \u201c[p]ursuant to the provisions of sec. 1738A of the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act of 1980, Puerto Rico is the state with jurisdiction over the [older child].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">A judgment of the Superior Court of Bayam\u00f3n dated April 18, 2001 (and bearing a certificate of authentication dated April 19, 2001),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> granted the father\u2019s petition for custody and patria <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>potestas over the older child and ordered that the child be brought immediately to the jurisdiction of Puerto Rico.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">In the meantime, the mother\u2019s divorce action proceeded in Massachusetts; temporary orders issued June 20, 2001, awarding her sole legal and physical custody of the children and directing the father to pay $100 per week for support of the mother and the children. In a memorandum and order on the motion for temporary orders issued the same day, the probate judge determined that Massachusetts had \u201csubject matter\u201d jurisdiction over the older child\u2019s custody on the basis that \u201cno custody order had been in effect from another jurisdiction on either July 26, 2000 [when the abuse prevention order first issued], or [on] August 23, 2000 [when the restraining order was renewed],\u201d and also \u201cpursuant to G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 2(a)(3)\u201d (conferring emergency jurisdiction if the child is physically present in the Commonwealth and \u201cit is necessary in an emergency to protect the child from abuse or neglect\u201d).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>On October 22, 2001, after a hearing before the probate judge (not attended by the father), a judgment of divorce nisi issued that, among other things, awarded the mother sole legal and physical custody of the children, ordered the father to pay $100 per week as child support (plus an additional $25 per week towards established arrearages), and divided the parties\u2019 property. The father (who concedes that he received a copy of the divorce judgment) did not appeal from the divorce judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Also in October, 2001, a judgment entered dismissing the maternal grandmother\u2019s guardianship petition. A year later, on November 22, 2002, the maternal grandmother filed a second petition for temporary guardianship of the parties\u2019 children. In this petition, she alleged that the children had been neglected by the mother and also had been physically and possibly sexually abused by the mother\u2019s live-in boyfriend. The probate judge issued an order for temporary guardianship that same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Thereafter, on December 16, 2002, the father filed the within complaint seeking modification of the divorce judgment. In the complaint, the father acknowledged that the mother had earlier been awarded sole legal and physical custody of the children; he alleged as changed circumstances that, among other things, the children had been placed with the maternal grandmother as a result of an ongoing investigation in Massachusetts of abuse and neglect. The father requested that the divorce judgment be modified by granting him sole legal and physical custody of the children and the right to remove them to Puerto Rico. The mother responded with a complaint for contempt against the father alleging that he had failed to pay support as ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">On June 26, 2003, the day scheduled for trial of the pending consolidated actions \u2014 the father\u2019s complaint for modification, the mother\u2019s complaint for contempt, and the maternal grandmother\u2019s petition for guardianship \u2014 the father, through counsel, filed a \u201cmotion to domesticate foreign decree under G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 12(a),\u201d requesting that the Puerto Rico habeas corpus judgment granting him custody of the older child be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>given full faith and credit. He also filed a motion to dismiss the modification and guardianship proceedings, alleging that the Probate and Family Court lacked jurisdiction under the MC-CJA, G.L. c. 209B, \u00a7 <em>2(d), </em>and the PKPA, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(a). According to the father, because the Puerto Rico Superior Court\u2019s resolution of the custody issue (see note 15, <em>supra) </em>predated that of the probate judge\u2019s June 20, 2001, determination that Massachusetts had jurisdiction, the guardianship and modification actions should be dismissed and the Puer-to Rico court\u2019s April 18, 2001, judgment enforced.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Following trial on the consolidated actions, the probate judge denied the father\u2019s request for modification of the divorce custody order, dismissed the petition for guardianship, and adjudged the father in contempt for wilfully neglecting and refusing to pay child support. The judge concluded that the Probate and Family Court was not precluded from exercising jurisdiction with respect to the older child<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and, on the merits of the complaint for modification and removal, that the father <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>had failed to demonstrate that a change in custody and the removal of the children to Puerto Rico would be in their best interests. The father appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Claimed lack of jurisdiction. </em>The father argues, among other things, that, because Puerto Rico was the older child\u2019s home State and had \u201creasserted\u201d its \u201cjurisdiction over the matter\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> after emergency jurisdiction in Massachusetts was no longer necessary, the Puerto Rico habeas corpus judgment is entitled to full faith and credit and the probate judge erred in maintaining jurisdiction over the older child. The father asks that the Puerto Rico judgment \u201cbe ordered registered in [Massachusetts], thus ordering compliance with its rulings, and ordering the return of [the older child] to Puerto Rico with the father.\u201d The father\u2019s arguments are premised on the assumption that the Probate and Family Court lacked \u201csubject matter\u201d jurisdiction and therefore was not competent to adjudicate the custody matter in the context of the parties\u2019 divorce action.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">We think the question is not whether, strictly speaking, the Probate and Family Court had \u201csubject matter\u201d jurisdiction \u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>in the sense of having been vested by the Legislature with the power to decide the custody issue, see <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>377 Mass. 616, 617 (1979)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> \u2014 but rather whether, under applicable provisions of the PKPA and MCCJA, the Probate and Family Court should have exercised jurisdiction to issue the divorce judgment awarding custody.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> This requires a two-stage inquiry: first, whether Massachusetts was the home State when the mother\u2019s divorce action was filed, thus giving the Probate and Family Court \u201cauthority to exercise jurisdiction\u201d under the MCCJA, <em>Khan </em>v. <em>Saminni, </em>446 Mass. 88, 91 (2006); second, whether the court should have exercised such jurisdiction under provisions of the MCCJA and PKPA. See, e.g., <em>id. </em>at 95-96 (Trinidad court was vested with authority to adjudicate a custody issue under its laws; that Massachusetts was the home State \u201cis not determinative of jurisdiction\u201d). See also <em>Custody of Brandon, </em>407 Mass. 1, 5 (1990); <em>Bak </em>v. <em>Bak, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 608, 614-615 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Under the MCCJA, \u201c[a]ny [Massachusetts] court which is competent to decide child custody matters has jurisdiction to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>make a custody determination\u201d if Massachusetts was the home State of the child on the commencement of the divorce action.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 2(a)(l)(i). The probate courts are competent to decide custody matters, as they have been vested by the Legislature with \u201cexclusive original jurisdiction ... of actions relative to the care, custody, education and maintenance of minor children.\u201d G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 4, as amended by St. 1975, c. 400, \u00a7 54. \u201cHome state\u201d is defined as \u201cthe state in which the child immediately preceding the date of commencement of the custody proceeding resided with ... a parent ... for at least 6 consecutive months.\u201d G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 1. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(b)(4), (c)(2)(A). See also <em>Custody of Brandon, </em>407 Mass. at 7, 14 (\u201cSection 2[a][1] of G. L. c. 209B grants jurisdiction based solely on residence in the Commonwealth for at least six months of the child and a parent or person acting as a parent. . . . Section 1738A[c][2] of the [PKPA] grants \u2018home state\u2019 jurisdiction under the same six-month requirement found in G. L. c. 209B\u201d). Here, the mother and the older child had been living in Massachusetts for nearly nine consecutive months (and the mother had been a Massachusetts resident for over thirteen months) when she commenced the divorce action on April 13, 2001; thus, the Probate and Family Court had home State jurisdiction to make the custody determination in connection with the divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Notwithstanding that the Probate and Family Court had jurisdiction to decide the custody issue, we must next consider whether the exercise of jurisdiction was appropriate. To satisfy the requirements of both the MCCJA and the PKPA, the custody proceeding must not have commenced \u201cduring the pendency of a proceeding in a court of another state\u201d exercising jurisdiction consistently with applicable provisions of the MCCJA and PKPA. See G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 (2)(d); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(g).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>Prior to commencement of the divorce action on April 13, 2001, only the father\u2019s habeas corpus petition, filed February 12, 2001, was pending. To be subject to enforcement in Massachusetts, that petition, which gave rise to the Puerto Rico court\u2019s custody determination, must have been filed at a time when Puerto Rico had home State jurisdiction \u2014 that is, Puerto Rico must have been the home State of the child \u201cwithin six months before the date of the commencement of the [habeas corpus] proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(c)(2)(A)(ii). See note 23, <em>supra. </em>Because the child left Puerto Rico with the mother on July 25, 2000 \u2014 at a time when there was no outstanding order awarding custody and patria potestas to the father or prohibiting the child\u2019s removal<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> \u2014 Puerto Rico was no longer the child\u2019s home State and had not been within the six months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>preceding the February 12, 2001, filing of the habeas corpus action.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Even if Puerto Rico was no longer the child\u2019s home State, however, the judgment on the habeas corpus petition could still be subject to enforcement (and the Probate and Family Court precluded from \u201cmodifying\u201d that judgment) if Puerto Rico had \u201ccontinuing jurisdiction\u201d under the PKPA at the time the judgment was made. That is, if Puerto Rico had made a prior child custody determination consistently with provisions of the PKPA, jurisdiction \u201ccontinues as long as the requirement of subsection (c)(1) of this section continues to be met and such State remains the residence of the child or of any contestant.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(d). See note 23, supra; <em>Hillier </em>v. <em>Hillier, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 486, 488-489 (1996) (although Massachusetts was the home State pursuant to G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 2, the Probate and Family Court was precluded from exercising jurisdiction under the PKPA, where a Florida court had continuing jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The father makes no proper appellate argument that the court in Puerto Rico was entitled to invoke the continuing jurisdiction provision of the PKPA when it issued the habeas corpus judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>ment on April 18, 2001.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> See <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>Carelli, </em>39 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>App. Ct. 81, 85 (1995). Although he alluded to the issue in his motion to dismiss, he abandoned the issue on appeal. In light of the father\u2019s abandonment of any argument concerning continuing jurisdiction, and the views of the Bayam\u00f3n Superior Court judge as to the basis for that court\u2019s jurisdiction, see note 25, <em>supra, </em>we consider the issue no further.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">When the mother filed the divorce action on April 13, 2001, the older child had been living with her in Massachusetts for nearly nine months, and the child was not the subject of a previously issued valid judgment or order of the Puerto Rico courts awarding custody to the father. When the father filed his habeas corpus petition on February 12, 2001, the older child had not resided in Puerto Rico for the six months preceding the filing. Whether couched in terms of subject matter jurisdiction or home State jurisdiction as defined by the PKPA and MCCJA, we conclude that Massachusetts had jurisdiction over the custody issue and that it was properly exercised.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">2. <em>Modification. </em>Contrary to the father\u2019s contention, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>probate judge did not abuse his discretion by declining to modify the divorce judgment to award the father sole legal and physical custody of the children or to allow the father to remove the children to Puerto Rico. See G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, as amended by St. 1993, c. 460, \u00a7 60 (\u201cUpon a complaint after a divorce . . . the court may make a judgment modifying its earlier judgment as to the care and custody of the minor children of the parties provided that the court finds that a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties has occurred and the judgment of modification is necessary in the best interests of the children\u201d); G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 30 (the Massachusetts \u201cremoval statute\u201d). See also <em>Rosenthal </em>v. <em>Maney, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 266 (2001) (best interests of the child always remain the paramount concern in a removal case). Although the evidence reflects that the mother had experienced significant parenting problems in the past and the children were removed from her custody for periods of time arising in part because they had allegedly been abused by her former boyfriend (against whom there is an abuse prevention order on behalf of the children), the judge found that the children now live with the mother in her own apartment, that the mother (who works) receives assistance from her mother in caring for the children, that the mother\u2019s home is clean and organized, and that the children are \u201cwell-dressed and clean and doing well in school and day care respectively.\u201d In addition, the judge found that the mother is no longer in an abusive relationship with her former boyfriend, she \u201chas engaged in counseling to explore preventing future relationships involving domestic violence,\u201d and has been \u201csuccessful at not re-engaging in relationships involving domestic violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The judge also made findings concerning the physical and emotional abuse inflicted by the father on the mother and the older child during the marriage. See note 2, <em>supra. </em>The judge concluded that the father had failed to show that \u201cthe quality of the children\u2019s lives would at all be improved by a move to Puer-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>to Rico, emotionally, physically, or developmentally,\u201d or that the removal of the children to Puerto Rico was in the best interests of the children. To the contrary, the judge found that \u201c[i]n light of the parties\u2019 violent history, removal of the children from the Commonwealth is not in either child\u2019s best interest.\u201d There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">\n<em>Modification judgment dated October 23, 2003, affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Indeed, the father visited the children in Massachusetts in December of that year, and again during January and February, 2002.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Findings of the probate judge, issued following a trial on the father\u2019s complaint for modification and consolidated matters, in which both parties testified, detail a history of physical and verbal abuse, and threats by the father.

See discussion, <em>infra. </em>Later, however, following trial on the father\u2019s modification complaint, the Massachusetts probate judge found that the mother had long been the victim of serious physical abuse inflicted by the father, see note 2, supra, and that on the day of the parties\u2019 October, 1999, separation, he broke down the door to a room in the parties\u2019 residence in which the mother had locked herself with the child, took the child, and kept the child from the mother for two months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b212-8\">The father has not included a copy of the order in the record.

The probate judge learned from the judge in Puerto Rico that the arrest warrant against the mother had been based upon the temporary order issued in Puerto Rico in October, 1999, granting the father custody of the older child and that under Puerto Rico\u2019s rules of civil procedure, such temporary orders expire if they do not proceed to a permanent order within ninety days \u2014 here, in January, 2000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b215-9\">Under the current laws of Puerto Rico, the concept of \u201cpatria potestas\u201d (literally, \u201cpaternal power,\u201d see Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1206 [8th ed. 2004]) no longer connotes that the father is the head of the family. See 31 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 591 (1993) (\u201cpatria potestas over unemancipated children belongs to both parents, jointly\u201d). Today, the attributes of patria potestas are consonant with the Massachusetts concept of legal custody. Apart from physical possession or custody, patria potestas imparts to a parent or guardian certain rights and obligations concerning the child, including the obligation to provide the child with reasonable sustenance, clothing, shelter, education, and health care consistent with his or her financial means; to supervise the child\u2019s education and development; to prevent predictable harm or injury to the child\u2019s physical, mental, emotional, and moral health; and to have the care and guardianship of the child.

Neither the mother nor the maternal grandmother appeared at the hearing. The Bayam\u00f3n court judge found that the mother had \u201cunlawfully deprived [the older child] of his liberty when she removed him from the jurisdiction of Puerto Rico, thus depriving [the] father with patria potestas of custody of said minor.\u201d The judge noted that, although the temporary custody order had expired, the father continued thereafter to have physical custody of the child, until he was removed to Massachusetts by the mother without the father\u2019s consent or knowledge. The judgment also notes that the father had never been a resident of Massachusetts, he had not been served with the various abuse prevention orders, and the department found no basis for the allegations that the father had abused or neglected the child. The judgment concludes that the Probate and Family Court abuse prevention order dated July 26, 2000, was issued without jurisdiction over the father\u2019s person and thus lacked legal validity. Therefore, in the Bayam\u00f3n court judge\u2019s view, the maternal grandmother was unlawfully exercising custody over the older child, which had been awarded to her \u201cby virtue of\u201d the July 26 order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Although not included in the record appendix, the probate judge summarized the June 20, 2001, memorandum in a later memorandum of law dated June 30, 2004, that is before us; counsel and the judge also read from it at the trial on the father\u2019s complaint for modification and we have before us the transcript of that trial (but not of the divorce trial). We also note that the father states in his motion to dismiss that the Probate and Family Court \u201cassert[ed] . . . jurisdiction in the June 20, 2001 Memorandum of Law.\u201d As summarized by the probate judge in his later memorandum, in determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>whether to exercise jurisdiction, he had on January 23, 2001, conducted a telephone conference with \u201cJudge El\u00edseo Gaetan-y-Mejia of the Court of Puerto Rico regarding the matter of custody of [the older child].\u201d See note 12, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b218-6\">At the commencement of trial, counsel for the children (who had been appointed to represent their interests in the guardianship proceedings) objected to the probate judge\u2019s hearing the father\u2019s motions because they had been filed late and counsel was not prepared to address them. Counsel also argued, in essence, that the father\u2019s challenge to jurisdiction was too late, in that the father had filed an answer and submitted to the jurisdiction of the court in proceedings in which the judge had entered custody orders from which the father had taken no appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">In colloquy with counsel for the father and the children, the probate judge also made reference to the \u201chome State\u201d of the older child and, in voicing his understanding of the father\u2019s position, noted that at the time of the divorce action the children had been residing in Massachusetts for more than six months. See G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 2(a)(1) (a \u201ccourt which is competent to decide child custody matters has jurisdiction to make a custody determination by initial or modification judgment if. . . the commonwealth . . . is the home state of the child on the commencement of the custody proceeding\u201d). The judge indicated that due to the late filing of the father\u2019s motions, he would treat the motions as requests for rulings of law after he had completed the trial on the merits of the father\u2019s modification complaint, but that he would take testimony on a limited basis with respect to the motions as they related to the question of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b218-8\">The probate judge\u2019s memorandum of decision stated, \u201cThis court\u2019s exercise of subject matter jurisdiction has been determined on the basis of the Massachusetts Child Custody Jurisdiction Act.

At this point, [the older child] had been residing in Massachusetts, his home state, for approximately nine months at the initia-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>tian of the custody proceedings. . . . [The older child] has lived in Massachusetts since July of 2000. Custody of [the younger child] clearly will be determined in Massachusetts. The family unit has a stronger connection with Massachusetts than Puerto Rico.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A6g\">The memorandum also appears to suggest that Massachusetts had home State jurisdiction based on the Probate and Family Court\u2019s grant of temporary guardianship to the grandmother. In fact, insofar as the January 19, 2001, order of temporary guardianship rested on the court\u2019s emergency jurisdiction (which had been exercised at a time when Puerto Rico was the older child\u2019s home State, see discussion, <em>supra), </em>the guardianship order was not an adequate basis for establishing Massachusetts as the home State. See G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 2(ti)(3)(ii); <em>MacDougall </em>v. <em>Acres, </em>427 Mass. 363, 370 (1998); <em>Mannor </em>v. <em>Mannor, </em>46 Mass.

See G. L. c. 208, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 5. This argument appears to be grounded (in large part) in the theory that the Probate and Family Court lacked personal jurisdiction over him as he had not been a resident of Massachusetts. Putting to one side the fact that the father did not appeal from the judgment of divorce nisi, to the extent he is challenging the divorce itself, he filed an answer to the mother\u2019s complaint and admitted that the mother had resided in Massachusetts for more than twelve consecutive months (see G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 5); he also stated specifically, \u201cI agree to the divorce.\u201d Even assuming that the issue is properly before us, there was no error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b220-6\">In <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Roe </em>(decided prior to enactment of the PKPA), Justice Kaplan writes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-7\">\u201cThe terminology of subject matter jurisdiction is awkward here, as it points to \u2018competency\u2019 \u2014 whether the court has been vested by the Legislature with power to decide cases of given substantive content, e.g., contract, tort, custody of children.

See, e.g., comment to Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) \u00a7 208, 9 (Part IA) U.L.A. 685-686 (Master ed. 1999) (Whether a court should decline to hear a parent\u2019s request to modify another State\u2019s order is a matter of local law.

The Bayam\u00f3n judge notes that after the October order expired the child remained in the father\u2019s physical custody; she finds that the mother, by removing the child to Massachusetts, deprived the father of patria potestas, but she does not conclude that a valid order awarding custody to the father was in place. The judgment goes on to state that the July 26, 2000, abuse prevention order was issued by the Probate and Family Court without jurisdiction over the father\u2019s person and thus \u201clacks legal validity.\u201d Finally, the judgment concludes that the grandmother \u201cis unlawfully exercising custody of the minor, which had been awarded to her by the \u2018Probate and Family Court\u2019 by virtue of the mentioned [abuse prevention] order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">It does not appear from this judgment that the Bayam\u00f3n court judge was exercising continuing jurisdiction, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(g); rather, it appears that the judge determined (erroneously) that, pursuant to the PKPA, Puerto Rico had original home State jurisdiction and Massachusetts did not have home State jurisdiction. Our view is supported by the fact that the father\u2019s habeas corpus petition is based solely on his claim that \u201cunder secs. 1738A(b)(4) and 1738A(c)(2)(A),\u201d Puerto Rico is the child\u2019s home State.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Although Puerto Rico has not adopted the UCCJA, the PKPA is applicable to custody determinations made by the Puerto Rico courts, which are obligated to \u201cgive full faith and credit to the rulings of the different courts of the United States in custody proceedings where the PKPA requirements and standards are met.\u201d <em>Perron </em>v. <em>Corretjer, </em>13 P.R.

During a two-week visit with the children to the home of her parents in Puerto Rico, the mother decided to separate from the husband and on September 3, 1982, filed, in Puerto Rico, a petition for custody; an order issued September 17, 1982, awarding her temporary custody. On September 10, the father filed a divorce action in New Jersey, in which he also sought custody; on September 21, the New Jersey court exercised jurisdiction, awarded the father temporary custody, and ordered the mother to return the children to New Jersey. <em>Id. </em>at 770-773. Although holding that \u201cthe children\u2019s \u2018home State\u2019 is and has been New Jersey,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 782, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico went on to observe, at 784-785, that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(e) requires reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard before a custody determination is made, and that the mother had received only five days\u2019 notice prior to the temporary custody hearing. The court concluded that the New Jersey decree \u201cdoes not meet at this stage the due process requirement of the PKPA, and, consequently, should not be given full faith and credit by our courts under this statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 786-787. (As to the consideration of due process, we observe that the mother here was served with notice of the habeas corpus proceeding on March 28, 2001, only nine days prior to the hearing on the petition, held on April 6, 2001.)</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">On the basis of the facts of record in the instant case, the home State requirements of the PKPA not having been met, the Puerto Rico habeas corpus judgment should not be given full faith and credit.

See note 20, <em>supra, B.J.P. </em>v. <em>R.W.P., </em>637 A.2d 74, 79 (D.C. 1994) (\u201cjurisdictional limitations imposed by the UCCJA are not equivalent to declarations of subject matter jurisdiction\u201d and are waivable).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">We note, moreover, that in the divorce proceedings, the father contested what he described as the Probate and Family Court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction over the custody issue, and the probate judge appears (on this somewhat inadequate record) to have addressed it; the father did not appeal from the adverse decision and initially acknowledged the validity of the custody order through his filing of the complaint for modification. On this basis, even if viewed as a question of traditional \u201csubject matter jurisdiction,\u201d it is arguable that the father was precluded from relitigating his jurisdictional contention in the context of the modification and guardianship actions.
