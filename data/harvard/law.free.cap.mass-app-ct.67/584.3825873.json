L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H (the \u201canti-SLAPP\u201d statute). We conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-16\">1. <em>Background. </em>The defendant, Anita Wood, brings this interlocutory appeal from the denial of a special motion to dismiss, made pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. See <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>436 Mass. 517, 521-522 (2002). Wood\u2019s motion sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>dismissal of claims against her by the plaintiff, Albert R. Kalter, a Braintree chiropractor who treated Wood on May 24, 2004. Kalter\u2019s claims were based on a June 10, 2004, letter Wood had sent to her medical insurance carrier, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts (BCBS), alleging inappropriate conduct, sexual and otherwise, in the course of treatment at Kalter\u2019s office. Wood had sent identical letters on that same date to the Brain-tree police department and to the Division of Professional Li-censure, office of investigations. Kalter concedes, and we assume without deciding, that Wood\u2019s letters to the Braintree police and the licensing authority were exercises of her right of petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He takes issue, however, with that sent to BCBS.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Kalter\u2019s complaint against Wood seeks damages for libel, intentional interference with advantageous business relationships, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Wood\u2019s special motion to dismiss all the claims asserted that her grievance letter to BCBS constituted protected petitioning activity. A Superior Court judge denied Wood\u2019s motion, concluding that Wood\u2019s letter to BCBS did not constitute petitioning activity protected under the anti-SLAPP statute because BCBS is not a governmental entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Kalter is a member of BCBS\u2019s provider network; he furnished chiropractic services to Wood pursuant to his contract with BCBS.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Kalter also serves as a peer review services consultant for BCBS. Under the heading \u201cGrievance Program,\u201d BCBS benefits description materials inform its insureds that \u201c[y]ou have the right to a review when you disagree with a decision by [BCBS] to deny payment for services, or if you have a complaint about the care or service you received from [BCBS] or a network provider.\u201d The materials further explain that the insured has a right to a review through the BCBS internal formal grievance program, and for decisions by BCBS denying cover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>age for services deemed not medically necessary, a right to an external review and appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">BCBS responded to Wood\u2019s grievance by forwarding a copy to Kalter, requesting his written response within ten days and suspending him from providing consultant services to BCBS, pending investigation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>We review the judge\u2019s decision denying Wood\u2019s special motion to dismiss for abuse of discretion or other error of law. See <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>434 Mass. 543, 550 (2001); <em>Plante </em>v. <em>Wylie, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 151, 157-158 (2005). Discerning no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Under the procedure set forth in <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prod. Corp., </em>427 Mass. 156, 167-168 (1998), to prevail on her special motion to dismiss, Wood must first show that Kalter\u2019s claims against her are based on her protected petitioning activities alone and have no substantial basis other than or in addition to the petitioning activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Because Kalter\u2019s claims against Wood are based on her June 10, 2004, letter to BCBS, the threshold inquiry is whether Wood\u2019s letter to BCBS amounted to the \u201cexercise of [a] right of petition,\u201d defined in \u00a7 59H as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-9\">\u201cany written or oral statement made before or submitted to a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other governmental proceeding; any written or oral statement made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other governmental proceeding; any statement reasonably likely to encourage consideration or review of an issue by a legislative, executive, or judicial body or any other governmental proceeding; any statement reasonably likely to enlist public participation in an effort to effect such consideration; or any other statement falling within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>constitutional protection of the right to petition government.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, inserted by St. 1994, c. 283, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Quite correctly, Wood does not contend that her letter to BCBS falls within the first category delineated in \u00a7 59H, as a statement \u201cmade before or submitted to\u201d a governmental body. Rather, she relies on the fact that her letter to BCBS was identical to letters sent to two governmental entities, the Braintree police department and the Division of Professional Licensure. Because the letters to the latter two entities are conceded to be protected petitioning activity, Wood maintains that her identical letter to BCBS falls within the same protection. For this proposition, Wood relies primarily on our recent opinion in <em>Wynne </em>v. <em>Creigle, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 246 (2005). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Of paramount importance in <em>Wynne </em>v. <em>Creigle, supra, </em>was the context in which the admittedly protected statements were subsequently repeated. There, we concluded that the defendant\u2019s statements to the media were \u201cmirror images\u201d of other admittedly protected statements made in the course of a governmental investigation and so were made \u201cin connection with\u201d that investigation. <em>Id. </em>at 254. As the defendant in <em>Wynne </em>also had sought redress by petitioning the Legislature (and the Governor), we deemed her statements to the media as made \u201cin connection with\u201d legislative proceedings. <em>Ibid. </em>In combination, the circumstances giving rise to Ms. Creigle\u2019s statements to the media, the fact that they were mirror images of those previously made in a governmental investigation, and the reality that they were in furtherance of her efforts to influence legislation in her favor, brought her remarks within the anti-SLAPP statute\u2019s protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">We conclude that notwithstanding the identity in content of the letter to BCBS and those to the two government entities, the letter to BCBS is not protected. The letter to BCBS does not fall under the second category delineated in \u00a7 59H, as a statement \u201cmade in connection with\u201d an issue under governmental consideration or review. Nor does it amount to a \u201cstatement reasonably likely to encourage consideration or review of an is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>sue\u201d by a governmental authority within the ambit of the third category in \u00a7 59H.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">To fall within the protection of the second category in the \u00a7 59H definition of the right to petition, the statement must be made in connection with an issue under governmental consideration or review. See generally <em>Kobrin </em>v. <em>Gastfriend, </em>443 Mass. 327, 331 (2005) (statute is to be interpreted according to the Legislature\u2019s intent, ascertained from all its words, and considered in light of the statute\u2019s purpose). Here, the fact that Wood\u2019s letter to BCBS replicated protected statements sent to two governmental entities is not alone dispositive. See <em>Wynne </em>v. <em>Creigle, supra. </em>Individuals who petition the government are not necessarily free to engage in gratuitous publication of the petition elsewhere without consequence. Wood\u2019s letter to BCBS was not made in connection with an issue under review by the Braintree police or the Division of Professional Licensure. Indeed, there was no pending governmental investigation into Wood\u2019s allegations against Kalter when Wood sent her letter to BCBS. In consequence, we do not consider her letter to BCBS as falling within the statute\u2019s protection for statements \u201cmade in connection with an issue under consideration or review\u201d by a governmental entity. See <em>Global NAPs, Inc. </em>v. <em>Verizon New England, Inc., </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 600, 607 (2005); <em>Plante </em>v. <em>Wylie, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. at 159 (construing the \u201cmade in connection with\u201d category of \u00a7 59H to include a statement made in an attempt to settle a pending governmental proceeding). Contrast <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>434 Mass, at 549 (biologist\u2019s response to inquiries by State and Federal environmental officials in connection with governmental review of a developer\u2019s permit applications was protected petitioning activity); <em>Wynne </em>v. <em>Creigle, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. at 253-254 (defendant\u2019s statements to the press concerned an issue already under consideration by two governmental bodies and were mirror images of what was said in a governmental forum).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Contrary to the dissent, we do not view Wood\u2019s letter to BCBS as a \u201cstatement reasonably likely to encourage consideration or review of an issue\u201d by a governmental authority within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>the third category of protected activity set forth in \u00a7 59H. Such a conclusion depends entirely on the attenuated logic that the statutory requirement to maintain a grievance program, as imposed on health insurance providers such as BCBS in G. L. c. 1760, renders Wood\u2019s complaint about the individual treatment provided by Kalter an \u201cissue under consideration or review\u201d by a governmental body. We decline to read the anti-SLAPP statute and the statutes regulating certain aspects of health insurance carrier practices so broadly as to immunize any statement, however defamatory, made to an insurance carrier by an insured.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The statutory obligation on health insurance providers to maintain a grievance program and the regulatory oversight of that obligation is not the type of governmental activity contemplated by the anti-SLAPP statute. Nor is Wood\u2019s letter to BCBS regarding the individual treatment provided to her by Kalter the type of \u201cstatement reasonably likely to encourage consideration or review of an issue by a [governmental] body\u201d addressed in the anti-SLAPP law.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">The statutory mandate that requires BCBS to establish a grievance program is directed to activities of the insurance carrier, not those of the carrier\u2019s network of provider doctors such as Kalter. See G. L. c. 1760, \u00a7 13. Read in its entirety and in context, c. 1760 makes plain that the object of its oversight is the quality of care and coverage offered to the insured by a carrier, not the service rendered by an individual provider doctor in a given instance. The definition of \u201cgrievance\u201d in \u00a7 1 is limited to \u201cany oral or written complaint submitted to the carrier . . . by an insured . . . concerning any aspect or action of the <em>carrier </em>relative to the <em>insured, </em>including, but not limited to, review of adverse determinations regarding scope of coverage, denial of services, quality of care and administrative operations\u201d (emphases added). G. L. c. 1760, \u00a7 1, inserted by St. 2000, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>c. 141, \u00a7 27. By the plain statutory language, the grievance mechanism addresses the relationship between the insurance carrier, here BCBS, and the insured patient, Wood. Nowhere does it address any aspect or action of a provider doctor such as Kalter. That the thrust of c. 1760 is directed at the relationship between insurer and insured is further fortified by the focus on such grievable matters as \u201creview of adverse determinations regarding scope of coverage, denial of services, quality of care and administrative operations.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In context, the quality of care addressed in c. 1760 is that furnished by the insurer, not that rendered by an individual provider doctor to an individual insured patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">We recognize that in the materials given to insureds such as Wood, BCBS invited Wood to include in any grievance matters relating not only to its denial of payment for services, but also those regarding the care or service received from a network provider such as Kalter. However, the fact that an insurer chooses to make its grievance program broader than what is statutorily mandated does not render the grievance in its broader aspects a matter of governmental oversight.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Nor is the degree of statutory oversight of the grievance program sufficient to render Wood\u2019s particular complaint about Kalter a \u201cstatement reasonably likely to encourage [governmental] consideration or review of an issue\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 59H. The regulatory scheme requires an insurer such as BCBS to maintain and report certain information to the office of patient protection, established within the Department of Public Health by G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 217. G. L. c. 1760, \u00a7 <em>1(b). </em>However, the information required to be reported by BCBS merely involves numerical summaries of grievance outcomes; assessments of the quality of services provided by the carrier (not the individual provider doctor); and statistical and demographic information regarding grievants. See <em>ibid. </em>None of the informational reporting requirements makes reference to the name of the doctor, the name of the patient, or the substance of the complaint. Nor does the fact that c. 1760, \u00a7 13, mandates carriers to maintain records of patient grievances and carriers\u2019 responses thereto for inspection by the Commissioner of Insurance render complaints such as Wood\u2019s grievance about Kalter a \u201cstatement reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>likely to encourage consideration or review of an issue by [the government].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The anti-SLAPP statute \u201cprovides broad protections for individuals who exercise their right to petition from harassing litigation and the costs and burdens of defending against retaliatory lawsuits.\u201d <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>436 Mass. at 520. In serving this worthy purpose, \u00a7 59H walks an uneasy line between protecting the right of citizens to petition government for redress of grievances and preserving the longstanding common-law right of individuals to seek redress in court for defamation and other civil wrongs. Mindful as we are of this precarious balance, we are not convinced, as is the dissent, that failing to extend the anti-SLAPP statute to communications such as Wood\u2019s grievance to BCBS will have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on patients\u2019 utilization of carrier grievance programs. Even were that so, we view the decision to extend the statute\u2019s protections that far as a determination for the Legislature, not for this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Because we conclude that Wood\u2019s letter to BCBS is not petitioning activity within the meaning of the anti-SLAPP statute, we need not address the second prong of the <em>Duracraft </em>test to determine whether Kalter has demonstrated that Wood\u2019s petitioning activity is devoid of any reasonable factual support or arguable basis in law, and that Wood\u2019s acts caused actual injury to Kalter. See \u00a7 59H; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>434 Mass. at 552-554.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We affirm the judge\u2019s denial of Wood\u2019s special motion to dismiss, and remand the matter to the Superior Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">\n<em>Order denying special motion to dismiss affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Wood\u2019s letter to the Braintree police department prompted a visit to Kalter\u2019s office by a police detective.

L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. That statute provides a special protection that insulates \u201cpetitioning activity\u201d against even otherwise meritorious claims. See <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prod. Corp., </em>427 Mass. at 165 (\u201cThe focus of the statutory test... is <em>not </em>on the plaintiffs claim, but rather on the petitioning activity that the special movant asserts bars the plaintiffs claim . . .\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b619-9\">We also need not address Wood\u2019s contention, which is not based on the antiSLAPP statute, that her letter to BCBS was a provision of information to a medical peer review committee for which she may not be held liable as it was furnished in good faith and on reasonable belief. See G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 203(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b619-8\">Brown, J.</author>\n<p id=\"apv-dedup-1\">(concurring in part and dissenting in part). I concur with the majority that Anita Wood\u2019s letter to Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts (BCBS) was not a \u201cstatement made in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>connection with an issue under [governmental] consideration or review,\u201d G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, as we construe that portion of the \u201canti-SLAPP\u201d statute\u2019s definition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">But what I take from <em>Wynne </em>v. <em>Creigle, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 246 (2005), is the importance of the context in which Wood\u2019s letter to BCBS\u2019s grievance program was made, considered in light of the anti-SLAPP statute\u2019s purpose. See <em>id. </em>at 253-254. As noted by the majority, Wood\u2019s letter to BCBS was identical to those protected statements she made to the Braintree police department and the Division of Professional Licensure, all complaining about the quality of Albert R. Kalter\u2019s health care services and his inappropriate conduct in the course of rendering those services. The contents of the BCBS letter and its intended recipient, BCBS\u2019s grievance program, make clear that Wood sent a copy of the same letter to BCBS in furtherance of resolving her grievance concerning the caliber of BCBS\u2019s provider. Wood\u2019s letter to BCBS, in addition to mirroring the content of her petitions to two governmental entities, also mirrored their purpose, as sent \u201cin furtherance of the objective served by governmental consideration of the issue under review \u2014 namely, the resolution of grievances.\u201d <em>Plante </em>v. <em>Wylie, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 151, 159 (2005). Contrast <em>Global NAPs, Inc. </em>v. <em>Verizon New England, Inc., </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 600, 606-607 (2005) (despite a pending arbitration appeal, disparaging remarks to a newspaper about a competitor were deemed neither connected to, nor in furtherance of, governmental consideration or review).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Wood emphasizes that her complaint to BCBS was the first step, pursuant to BCBS\u2019s State-mandated grievance program, in procuring governmental review of the quality of care provided by Massachusetts medical insurance carriers. In considering the context in which the BCBS letter was sent, the BCBS grievance program deserves a closer look.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Massachusetts health insurance carriers are required by law to maintain grievance programs, in order to provide \u201cadequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>consideration and timely resolution\u201d of patient complaints concerning coverage and quality of care. See G. L. c. 1760, \u00a7 13(a), inserted by St. 2000, c. 141, \u00a7 27. The office of patient protection was established by the Legislature, pursuant to G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 217, to administer and enforce the standards and procedures by which health insurance carriers implement their grievance programs, and to collect information derived from these programs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> *See G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 217(a)(1); G. L. c. 1760, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 7, 13, 14.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To this end, G. L. c. 1760, \u00a7 7, inserted by St. 2000, c. 141, \u00a7 27, requires carriers to report to the office of patient protection information that includes, under \u00a7 <em>7(b)(1), </em>\u201cindependently published information assessing insured satisfaction\u201d with the quality of health care services provided by the carrier and, under \u00a7 <em>7(b)(4), </em>\u201ca report detailing, for the previous calendar year, the total number of: (i) filed grievances, grievances that were approved internally, grievances that were denied internally, and grievances that were withdrawn before resolution; and (ii) external appeals pursued after exhausting the internal grievance process and the resolution of all such external appeals.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As to each category of grievance, \u00a7 <em>7(b)(4) </em>also requires the carrier to identify, to the extent such information is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>available, \u201cthe demographics of such insureds, which shall include, but need not be limited to, race, gender and age.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> General Laws c. 1760, \u00a7 13(a)(1), further mandates that carriers maintain records of patient grievances and the carriers\u2019 responses thereto for a period of seven years, for inspection by the Commissioner of Insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Taken in this context, Wood\u2019s letter to the BCBS grievance program, complaining about the quality of care she received from one of its providers, takes on increased significance, as representing not merely a means to redress her own personal wrong, but as an integral part of the regulatory scheme by which the Department of Public Health oversees patient protection and, in particular, the quality of health care plans and services being offered to various segments of the population by various carriers. In view of all the circumstances, Wood\u2019s letter to the BCBS grievance program, though not directly connected to a pending matter under governmental review, should be considered under \u00a7 59H to be a \u201cstatement reasonably likely to encourage consideration or review\u201d of the quality of the health care services being offered by BCBS, as well as of the quality of BCBS\u2019s responsiveness to its insureds, by the governmental entities charged with oversight and accreditation of health insurance carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">BCBS itself is not a governmental entity; on that point, the judge was correct. But to the extent the Department of Public Health is charged with oversight of the quality of health care plans and services provided by Massachusetts carriers, the accomplishment of its statutory purpose is largely dependent on the State-mandated administration by individual carriers of their grievance programs, in order to implement the legislative goal of prompt resolution of such grievances, and of annual reporting of numerical and demographic information derived from those programs to the office of patient protection. I am mindful of the overriding purpose of the anti-SLAPP statute, in recogniz<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>ing that subjecting patients who file grievances to defamation and other suits would likely have a chilling effect on patients\u2019 utilization of carrier grievance programs, even though such programs are themselves statutorily mandated. Erosion of patient confidence in carrier-administered grievance programs would undermine the efficacy of the statutory scheme whereby governmental monitoring is achieved through annual reporting and review of grievance statistics, and ultimately frustrate State oversight of the quality of health care plans and services provided through these carriers. See, e.g., <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>434 Mass. 543, 549 (2001) (discussing the chilling effect of a suit brought against a biologist for providing information to State and Federal agencies charged with environmental protection, about the effect of plaintiff\u2019s proposed development on bird habitats); <em>Kobrin </em>v. <em>Gastfriend, </em>443 Mass. 327, 335-336 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Based on the foregoing, Wood\u2019s letter to the BCBS grievance program should be treated as protected petitioning activity under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, as a \u201cstatement reasonably likely to encourage consideration or review of an issue by a legislative, executive, or judicial body or any other governmental proceeding.\u201d As a result, the denial of the defendant\u2019s special motion to dismiss, on the basis that her letter to BCBS\u2019s grievance program was not petitioning activity, should be reversed. However, because Kalter claims that Wood lacked \u201cany reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law\u201d for her petitioning activity, see \u00a7 59H; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>434 Mass. at 552-554, and that her actions caused him actual injury, see \u00a7 59H, I would remand the matter to the Superior Court so that the parties\u2019 factual disputes could be resolved by the judge, in order to determine whether Kalter met his burden. See <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>434 Mass. at 546 n.7, 553-554 (\u201cThe resolution of such factual disputes, based on the conflicting pleadings and affidavits submitted on a special motion to dismiss, is for the motion judge,\u201d applying the preponderance of the evidence standard to determine whether the defendant lacked any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law for her petitioning activity).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b620-8\">Although I agree with the majority on this point, I would note that arguably, under the reasoning articulated in <em>Wynne </em>v. <em>Creigle, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 254 (2005), it is not entirely clear why Wood\u2019s \u201cmirror-image\u201d letter to BCBS would not constitute such a statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The office of patient protection is also responsible for assisting patients directly with questions or concerns about their grievance rights. See G. L c. 111, \u00a7 217(a)(3); G. L. c. 1760, \u00a7 13(a)(3). In addition, the office of patient protection is charged with making information collected by it accessible to consumers through maintenance of an Internet site, to include the \u201chealth plan report card\u201d developed pursuant to G. L. c. 118G, \u00a7 24, information pertaining to quality assurance, and information on health plan premiums, finance, and policy. See G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 217(a)(2). In addition to its direct role in collecting, monitoring, and disseminating information for consumers and patients, the office of patient protection advises the Commissioner of Public Health and other oversight agencies \u201con actions, including legislation, which may improve the quality of managed care health insurance plans.\u201d G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 217(a)(6), inserted by St. 2000, c. 141, \u00a7 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b621-6\">A grievance is broadly defined, in G. L. c. 1760, \u00a7 1, inserted by St. 2000, c. 141, \u00a7 27, as \u201cany oral or written complaint submitted to the carrier which has been initiated by an insured, or on behalf of an insured with the consent of the insured, concerning any aspect or action of the carrier relative to the insured, including, but not limited to, review of adverse determinations regarding scope of coverage, denial of services, quality of care and administrative operations, in accordance with the requirements of this chapter.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b621-7\">As a general matter, external appeals are available for review of a carrier\u2019s adverse determinations based on failure to meet the requirements for coverage for particular health care services. See G. L. c. 1760, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b622-7\">This is no mere formality. Failure to file the requisite information may expose the carrier to a fine of $5,000 per day, under G. L. c. 1760, \u00a7 8. Compliance with the reporting requirement is also incorporated into the minimum standards required for carrier accreditation by the Division of Insurance, as administered by the bureau of managed care under G. L. c. 1760, \u00a7 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
