The defendant, who relied on an entrapment defense at trial, here contends (appealing both his conviction and the denial of his motion for a new trial) that the judge should have granted him a new trial on the grounds that she had erred at trial by (1) refusing to direct a verdict of not guilty because the Commonwealth failed to present sufficient evidence to prove that he was predisposed to commit the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt; (2) refusing to give a requested jury instruction on the role of a government informant in an entrapment case; (3) refusing to admit the government informant\u2019s hearsay statement concerning his motive to work for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); and (4) refusing to permit the admission of evidence concerning the circumstances of the government informant\u2019s death. We affirm the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial as well as the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\"><em>Background. </em>The jury could have permissibly found the following pertinent facts favorable to the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In 1999, State Trooper Thomas Nartowicz was assigned, in an undercover capacity, to an FBI task force that was investigating local motorcycle clubs suspected of selling narcotics. The task force used a cooperating informant named William Don\u00e1is to introduce Nartowicz to members of the Longriders Motorcycle Club (Longriders Club) in Ludlow. Don\u00e1is had previously infiltrated the Longriders Club for the task force, in January, 1998, to determine whether illegal drugs were being sold there. At trial, it was established that Don\u00e1is had agreed to cooperate with the authorities after being arrested for a traffic incident.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The government paid Don\u00e1is in excess of $100,000 for his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>work over a period of several years (through early 2001), and he received other benefits, including housing and a motor vehicle.* <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">During the course of the investigation, Don\u00e1is introduced Nartowicz to the defendant, who was a former president of the Longriders Club. Shortly thereafter, on June 4, 1999, Nartowicz attempted to arrange a $500 purchase of cocaine from the defendant at the Longriders Club\u2019s clubhouse, using Don\u00e1is as an intermediary.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although the defendant was unable to obtain cocaine at that time, he directed Nartowicz (but not Don\u00e1is) to join him in the clubhouse\u2019s bathroom. There, after locking the door, he gave Nartowicz his money back and chastised him for not giving the defendant more time to procure the cocaine. The defendant also informed Nartowicz that he did not do business over the telephone, and that if anyone refers to anything (which Nartowicz understood to mean cocaine) over the telephone, he hangs up. The defendant assured Nartowicz, however, that he could probably obtain \u201csomething\u201d (which Nartowicz again took to mean cocaine) to sell to him later that same night. Nar-towicz declined the offer on the ground that he could not wait around at that time, but said that he might contact the defendant through Don\u00e1is in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">On July 8, 1999, Nartowicz again met Don\u00e1is and the defendant at the Longriders Club\u2019s clubhouse to buy cocaine. After securing the premises, the defendant asked Nartowicz for $650 as the price for his cocaine. When Nartowicz protested the increased price, the defendant explained that the price for the cocaine was higher \u201cbecause he was getting it from a different guy now; and that the . . . other guy was in jail and they [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>police] were attempting to deport him.\u201d After Nartowicz paid the defendant the $650, the defendant told Nartowicz that he was meeting his new cocaine supplier at 8:30 p.m., and that Nar-towicz could meet him later to receive the \u201cstuff\u201d at Christy\u2019s bar in Springfield.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Later that night, Nartowicz went alone to Christy\u2019s bar and waited for the defendant. The defendant eventually arrived, sat down next to Nartowicz and, with a smile, told him that he \u201cwas going to like the stuff that he [the defendant] had,\u201d referring to the cocaine. After finishing a beer, the defendant said he was \u201cready\u201d and directed Nartowicz outside, where the defendant deposited the cocaine, wrapped in a package, into Nartowicz\u2019s saddlebag on the side of his motorcycle.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant cautioned Nartowicz to drive carefully with the \u201cstuff\u201d and told Nartowicz that they could make the transaction a \u201cweekly thing.\u201d Nartowicz responded that he hoped the price would be reduced if they did arrange for a weekly purchase. The defendant then remarked that \u201cthe price fluctuates.\u201d Don\u00e1is was not present at Christy\u2019s that night. (At trial, Nartowicz identified the package he had received from the defendant, which he had turned over to a fellow officer soon after receiving it for laboratory analysis; the analysis disclosed the powder in the package to be seventeen percent cocaine).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">On October 9, 1999, Nartowicz attended a social event sponsored by the Longriders Club at the American Legion hall in Chicopee. Again, Don\u00e1is was not present. The defendant approached Nartowicz and asked where he had been lately. After Nartowicz responded that he had been \u201caround,\u201d the defendant replied, \u201cI thought we were going to do more business\u201d (referring to the July 8 cocaine sale, the only \u201cbusiness\u201d Nartowicz had ever conducted with the defendant). Nartowicz did not converse or interact further with the defendant thereafter. The defendant was indicted on September 27, 2001, for the July 8, 1999, sale of cocaine to Nartowicz.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">At trial, the defendant relied on an entrapment defense, arguing that the government, through its agent, Don\u00e1is, had induced him to sell cocaine. He contended that he had undergone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>rehabilitation for a cocaine addiction in 1997 and was no longer addicted or predisposed to use or sell cocaine at the time that the government, through Don\u00e1is, infiltrated the Longriders Club in January, 1998. The defense offered numerous witnesses (all friends and associates of the defendant) who testified about Don\u00e1is\u2019s persistent attempts to persuade the defendant to use and procure cocaine and about Don\u00e1is\u2019s \u201cintimidating [physical] appearance.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defense also presented evidence that Don\u00e1is was a cocaine addict. However, the judge refused to admit evidence showing that the cause of Don\u00e1is\u2019s death in 2003 resulted from an overdose of cocaine.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\"><em>Discussion. Entrapment. </em>The defendant principally argues that his new trial motion should have been allowed because the judge erred in refusing to direct a verdict in his favor, where the Commonwealth allegedly failed to prove his predisposition to engage in cocaine trafficking beyond a reasonable doubt prior to his interaction with a government agent. In other words, he contends that his entrapment defense should have succeeded as matter of law because the Commonwealth failed to prove that he possessed the requisite criminal intent to sell drugs independent of the government\u2019s inducement. He relies on the established proposition that entrapment occurs \u201cwhen the criminal design originates with the officials of the Government, and they implant in the mind of an innocent person the disposition to commit the alleged offense and induce its commission in order that they may prosecute.\u201d <em>Sorrells </em>v. <em>United States, </em>287 U.S. 435, 442 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">In order for an entrapment defense to be raised, evidence of inducement by a government agent must be presented at trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Koulouris, </em>406 Mass. 281, 284 (1989). \u201cMere evidence of solicitation is not enough to show inducement,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number><em>ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>361 Mass. 644, 651-652 (1972), and, as the Supreme Judicial Court has noted, \u201c[a]rtifice and stratagem may be employed [by the government] to bring to book those engaged in crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harvard, </em>356 Mass. 452, 459 (1969), citing <em>Sorrells </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 441. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 304, 306 (1992) (\u201cIt is not unlawful for the government to set out bait for someone who takes the lure with alacrity\u201d). The defendant did, however, offer sufficient evidence to meet the low threshold entitling him to an instruction on entrapment simply by testifying that Don\u00e1is, a government agent, induced him to sell the drugs to Nartowicz. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>361 Mass. at 651-652.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Once an entrapment defense is adequately raised, the prosecution is required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was already predisposed to commit the crime. See <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>United States, </em>485 U.S. 58, 62-63 (1988); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>361 Mass, at 652; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>382 Mass. 379, 383-386 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shuman, </em>391 Mass. 345, 351 (1984). The central inquiry then becomes, \u201c[W]as the defendant, initially not ready or willing to break the law, enticed or ensnared by the Commonwealth into overcoming his reluctance or resistance and doing so? Or did the Commonwealth merely provide the defendant, already ready and willing \u2014 already \u2018predisposed\u2019 \u2014 to commit the crime, an opportunity to do so?\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaBonte, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 190, 194 (1987). Predisposition may thus be found upon proof that \u201cthe accused [was] ready and willing to commit the crime whenever the opportunity might be afforded,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>361 Mass. at 651, quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Groessel, </em>440 F.2d 602, 605 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>403 U.S. 933 (1971), and the finding can be based upon the \u201c[words and] conduct of the defendant as related to the indictment at issue [during his meetings with the undercover officer] ... if the evidence is of sufficient significance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 652.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence \u2014 particularly that which exposed the defendant\u2019s manifested willingness to engage in a drug transaction on June 4, 1999, and admitted ability to obtain drugs on short notice at that time \u2014 if believed, negated any rational inference that when the defendant sold the cocaine to Nartowicz on July 8, 1999, he lacked predisposition because he was \u201can innocent party . . . beguile[d] . . . into committing crimes which he otherwise would not have attempted,\u201d <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>356 U.S. 369, 376 (1958); or \u201cthat he acted out of fear,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tracey, </em>416 Mass. 528, 537 (1993); or that he acted only in response to \u201c[the informant\u2019s] presumed suffering\u201d or other importuning by the informant that \u201cplay[ed] on sympathy or other emotion,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>382 Mass, at 385 (quotations omitted); or that he was subject to inducements that were \u201cshocking or offensive per se,\u201d or was effectively \u201ccorrupted\u201d by the government\u2019s undercover activities, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harvard, </em>356 Mass. at 460, quoting from <em>Waker </em>v. <em>United States, </em>344 F.2d 795, 796 (1st Cir. 1965); or that he was enmeshed by \u201cmethods so outrageous or wicked as to deny him due process,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaBonte, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. at 195; or that he was reluctantly \u201cpersuade[d] ... \u2018to turn from a righteous path to an iniquitous one.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gifford, </em>17 F.3d 462, 468 (1st Cir. 1994), quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Coady, </em>809 F.2d 119, 122 (1st Cir. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">Moreover, the jury were not required to believe the \u201cvery feeble\u201d <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaBonte, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. at 195) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>defense version of events<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> regarding the defendant\u2019s purported lack of predisposition<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> to sell drugs on July 8, 1999, and were entitled to discredit any or all of the defendant\u2019s and his witnesses\u2019 testimony to the effect that (a) Don\u00e1is readdicted the defendant around October, 1998, by providing him with cocaine and joining him in its consumption; (b) Don\u00e1is thereafter persisted in frequently asking, even imploring, him to procure cocaine for them to share, which the defendant adamantly refused to do (on one occasion vociferously and publicly) until June 4, 1999, when he reluctantly agreed to do so with $100 of his own money and $35 from Don\u00e1is; (c) the defendant could find no cocaine to buy that evening and tried to return Don\u00e1is\u2019s money in the clubhouse bathroom, where he found Nartowicz (going under the alias \u201cVinny\u201d), who claimed that it was his, and not Don\u00e1is\u2019s, money and whose request that the defendant still try to obtain some cocaine that night the defendant firmly rejected; (d) the defendant at no time agreed with \u201cVinny\u201d or Don\u00e1is to purchase cocaine for or sell cocaine to \u201cVinny\u201d; (e) on July 8, 1999, after again reluctantly agreeing with Don\u00e1is to try to procure cocaine, with $500 of his own money, in order to share it with Don\u00e1is, and after finding some at a certain person\u2019s home, the defendant went to Christy\u2019s bar to meet Don\u00e1is but instead encountered \u201cVinny,\u201d whose loud and boisterous demand that he turn over the drugs \u201cspooked,\u201d \u201cscared,\u201d and \u201cpanicked\u201d the defendant, who precipitously took \u201cVinny\u2019s\u201d offered money, \u201cthrew the stuff in his [\u201cVin-ny\u2019s\u201d] [saddlejbag and . . . took off\u201d because he \u201cfelt under the gun.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">The prosecution, for its part, presented compelling evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>of the defendant\u2019s predisposition to commit the crime charged, when viewed (as the judge was obliged to do in acting on the defendant\u2019s motions for required findings of not guilty) in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Monteagudo, 427 Mass. 484, 488 (1998). His exchanges with Nartowicz on June 4, 1999, and July 8, 1999, demonstrated a level of drug dealing experience, ability, sophistication, and eagerness that contradicted any impression that the government had corrupted an \u201cinnocent mind.\u201d Massachusetts courts have recognized a variety of activities and characteristics as being strong evidence of a narcotics defendant\u2019s predisposition, including the ability to procure illegal drugs for sale on short notice (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaBonte, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. at 194; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gratereaux, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 3 [2000]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Remedor, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 694, 704 [2001]); familiarity with the terms of the drug trade and with market conditions in that trade (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaBonte, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gratereaux, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Remedor, supra); </em>haggling over the price of illegal drugs (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaBonte, supra </em>at 191, 194; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. at 306); discussion of having a continuing drug transaction relationship or future drug sales (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaBonte, supra </em>at 191; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon, supra </em>at 306; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gratereaux, supra); </em>and committing the crime \u201creadily and without reluctance,\u201d see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monteagudo, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Remedor, supra. </em>Here, the defendant manifested every one of those indicia of predisposition. As earlier noted, \u201c[i]t is not unlawful for the government to set out bait for someone who takes the lure with alacrity.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertion that he was always reluctant and was effectively coerced into selling cocaine to Nartowicz, the prosecution\u2019s evidence established (if believed) that at the time the police were investigating him, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>was already engaging in the drag business, took precautions to avoid police detection, and had already dealt with several sources of supply from which he could readily procure cocaine \u2014 powerful evidence that he was engaged in narcotics dealings with others that had nothing to do with the government. As Nartowicz testified, the defendant refused to discuss business over the telephone and was conversant with the fluctuating price of cocaine. Further, during the bathroom meeting with Nartowicz on June 4, 1999 \u2014 when the defendant took pains to lock the door and to exclude Don\u00e1is \u2014 the defendant made an offer, without the slightest solicitation, to obtain and sell Nar-towicz cocaine in the immediate future (since he had failed to procure cocaine earlier that evening), strong evidence of his enthusiastic predisposition. Finally, the defendant\u2019s conduct during the July 8, 1999, transaction \u2014 refusing to negotiate a lower price (thus reflecting a purpose to maximize his profit from the transaction), offering to make regular, \u201cweekly\u201d cocaine sales to Nartowicz, and continuing to present the demeanor of one in complete charge of the drag deal \u2014 was uniformly inconsistent with his feeble story of either acting out of a desperate effort to avoid pressure from Don\u00e1is or having his will so dominated that he could not help himself.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">When considering a claim that the prosecution has failed to prove lack of predisposition beyond a reasonable doubt, the court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth in order to determine whether a rational jury could have returned a guilty verdict. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monteagudo, </em>427 Mass, at 488, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>James, </em>424 Mass. 770, 784-785 (1997). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. at 306. Here, it is clear to us that a rational jury could have credited the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>as amply sufficient to find the defendant guilty of trafficking in cocaine on July 8, 1999, because that evidence overwhelmingly demonstrated his predisposition to commit the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">The defendant attempts to overcome this reality by reliance on a statement taken out of context from the distinguishable case of <em>Jacobson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>503 U.S. 540, 549 (1992), which he claims established the supposed principle that the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that \u201cthe defendant was disposed to commit the criminal act prior to first being approached by Government agents.\u201d We are unpersuaded. The literalness that the defendant ascribes to those words was clearly modified by the <em>Jacobson </em>Court\u2019s example and statement (made immediately after the quoted passage) that a defendant\u2019s \u201cready commission of the criminal act,\u201d after being offered the opportunity to sell drugs and accepting the offer, \u201camply demonstrates the defendant\u2019s predisposition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 549-550. That example is the very situation involved here, where the defendant not only enthusiastically accepted the chance to sell cocaine to a new customer, but spoke freely about his general practices in and knowledge of the drug trade, including taking the precaution of never doing business over telephones, doing business behind locked doors, and staying abreast of price fluctuations for cocaine, as well as having ready access to multiple drug suppliers. The <em>Jacobson </em>Court\u2019s explicit endorsement of the Federal government\u2019s investigatory guidelines for offering suspects an inducement to commit a crime similarly finds application here,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and the radically differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>ent facts in <em>Jacobson </em>further undercut the defendant\u2019s attempted application of that case to his situation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AAYc\">Under the core teaching of <em>Jacobson, </em>the jury were free to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>disbelieve the defendant\u2019s version of events and to adopt the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence of his predisposition to commit the crime charged. Such an inference could be permissibly and readily drawn from the circumstances of the defendant\u2019s attempted sale to Nartowicz on June 4, 1999, his \u201cready commission\u201d of the actual cocaine transaction on July 8, 1999, his stated willingness to continue to make such sales on a weekly basis, and his seeking out Nartowicz on October 9, 1999, to express apparent surprise and regret that more cocaine transactions had not ensued between them.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, we see no error in the judge\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motions for required findings of not guilty and for a new trial, to the extent they depended on his entrapment defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\"><em>Jury instruction. </em>A related but secondary contention is the defendant\u2019s complaint that the judge erred in refusing to give his requested jury instruction on the role of government agents in entrapment cases, on the ground that the standard Massachusetts instruction as given the jury by the judge contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>no provision on inducement by government informants. (It is, of course, settled law that a defendant is not entitled to have an instruction phrased in the exact language he requests so long as the charge, taken as a whole, adequately conveys to the jury the applicable legal requirements. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>433 Mass. 266, 271 [2001]).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">The judge correctly instructed the jury in the words of the Superior Court Criminal Practice Jury Instructions \u00a7 3.4 (1999), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-6\">\u201cThe defendant contends that a government agent <em>or someone acting at the agent\u2019s discretion </em>induced him into committing trafficking [sic] cocaine. There is nothing improper about the police setting traps, such as with undercover methods, to catch those who are already disposed towards committing a crime. However, the state cannot tolerate having its officers instigate crime by implanting criminal ideas in innocent minds. The issue is not whether the government agent brought about this particular offense, but rather, whether the government agent brought about this defendant\u2019s predisposition to the crime. No entrapment exists if a person is ready and willing to commit a crime whenever the opportunity presents itself and a government agent merely provides the opportunity or facilities to do so.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">After the judge had completed her charge, defense counsel, without objecting to any part thereof, requested that the court \u201cconsider\u201d a further instruction on the role of government informants in entrapment cases, specifically that \u201cgovernment inducement may be offered [through] a cooperating informant acting at the direction of a government agent.\u201d The judge said that she thought her instruction as given was adequate, to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>defense counsel responded, \u201cThank you.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertion on appeal, he did not make or preserve an objection to this portion of the judge\u2019s charge. That fact, combined with his failure to present any arguments that the judge\u2019s action constituted an abuse of discretion (see note 25, infra) or created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, dooms his contention.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">In any event, the defendant\u2019s stated concern \u2014 that the jury would have been so misled by the instruction as to focus solely on the conduct of the government officials and not on the conduct of the government informant, Don\u00e1is, in considering whether the criminal design had been implanted in the defendant\u2019s mind \u2014 is implausible. The jury could not have failed to have been aware, from the defendant\u2019s and his witnesses\u2019 testimony as well as that of the drug task force officers, that Don\u00e1is was a government informant acting at police direction to facilitate Nartowicz\u2019s introduction to and dealings with the defendant. Moreover, reasonable jurors could not have failed to understand from the judge\u2019s instructions, as applied to the facts of the case, that the issue of entrapment was to be determined by reference to the conduct of <em>either </em>\u201ca government agent <em>or </em>someone [i.e., Don\u00e1is] acting at the government agent\u2019s discretion\u201d (emphasis added) \u2014 clear guidance that was plainly stated by the judge at the beginning of the charge on entrapment.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\"><em>Government informant\u2019s hearsay statements. </em>The defendant also argues that the judge erred in refusing to admit statements allegedly made by Don\u00e1is in 2000 to his then girlfriend, subsequent to the crime charged, explaining why he became a government informant. At trial, the defense had sought to offer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>testimony from Don\u00e1is\u2019 girlfriend that Don\u00e1is had told her that he became associated with the FBI after a gun he had sold was implicated in a murder in Hartford, Connecticut, and that the FBI threatened to prosecute him for the crime if he did not cooperate with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">Faced with a \u201crank hearsay\u201d objection from the prosecutor, defense counsel argued to the judge (during voir dire on the subject) that the testimony was offered solely as nonhearsay proof of Don\u00e1is\u2019s \u201cdesperate\u201d state of mind, which motivated his unremitting efforts to entrap the defendant, rather than for the truth of the facts asserted. The judge nonetheless refused to admit the evidence on the grounds that it was both cumulative and irrelevant. The defendant has failed to assert, much less establish, any abuse of the judge\u2019s broad discretion (see note 25, <em>infra) </em>in deciding whether evidence is relevant, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>382 Mass. 448, 463 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tobin, 392 </em>Mass. 604, 613 (1984), or cumulative. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Urrea, </em>443 Mass. 530, 544 (2005).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">Instead, the defendant presents us with an argument, not made below, that is essentially inconsistent with the rationale he proposed to the judge for admission of the girlfriend\u2019s proffered statement. Relying on the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s holding in <em>Ruszcyk </em>v. <em>Secretary of Pub. Safety, </em>401 Mass. 418 (1988), he now claims that the statement should have been permitted as a hearsay exception because it was a vicarious admission, a statement by an agent binding his principal (here, the Commonwealth) that demonstrated why Don\u00e1is went to such lengths to lure the defendant into committing the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">His effort is unavailing. A party who has made an objection to a judge\u2019s ruling on an evidentiary matter at trial after specifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>cally stating the ground therefor is not entitled to urge different grounds on appeal of the court\u2019s overruling of the objection. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tyree, </em>387 Mass. 191, 213 (1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1175 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Noeun Sok, </em>439 Mass. 428, 435 (2003); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Seap Sa, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 420, 427 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Moreover, even were the defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Ruszcyk </em>properly before us, it is misplaced. In that case, the court abrogated the common-law rule excluding admissions of an agent against his principal unless the agent\u2019s actual authority to make the statement was established. <em>Ruszcyk </em>v. <em>Secretary of Pub. Safety, </em>401 Mass. at 422-423. Instead, the court allowed the introduction of such statements if there were evidence that making them was within the scope of the agent\u2019s employment, subject to the trial judge\u2019s discretion to exclude them if their probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the opposing party (to be determined on a case by case basis). <em>Ibid. </em>Here, the proffered testimony was not shown to relate to any matter within the scope of Don\u00e1is\u2019s agency with the FBI, but rather addressed only the issue how the agency relationship had (allegedly) come about in the first place.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\"><em>Death of William Don\u00e1is. </em>The defendant\u2019s final claim on appeal is that the judge erred in refusing to admit evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>Don\u00e1is\u2019s death, allegedly from a cocaine overdose in October, 2003, which the defendant offered to prove by means of a certified copy of an autopsy report from the medical examiner in Jacksonville, Florida.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The judge agreed with the Commonwealth that the circumstances of Don\u00e1is\u2019s death were too remote to be probative and, in any event, were irrelevant to the trial issues.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Again, the defendant essays no argument that the judge\u2019s ruling constituted an abuse of her wide discretion to determine the relevance of evidence and whether it was too remote. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tobin, </em>392 Mass. at 613; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>430 Mass. 111, 116 (1999). The exercise of such discretion is accorded substantial deference by appellate courts in the absence of a clear showing (not made here) of its abuse \u2014 a very heavy burden<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> \u2014 or palpable error, i.e., a decision that clearly transcends \u201cthe outer bounds of . . . discretion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bonds, </em>445 Mass. 821, 835 (2006).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We are persuaded that evidence of Don\u00e1is\u2019s death \u2014 over four years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>after the date of the crime for which the defendant was indicted and two years after Don\u00e1is had ceased to be a government agent \u2014 had such an attenuated relation to the defendant\u2019s trial as to justify the judge\u2019s implicit conclusion that it had little, if any, rational tendency to prove a material issue in the case against the defendant.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>425 Mass. 491, 494-497 (1997) (judge abused discretion by permitting repeated references in prosecutor\u2019s closing argument to victim\u2019s pregnancy and birthday, and by permitting victim\u2019s sister to testify about her hospital vigil prior to victim\u2019s death, because they were not relevant to any issue in case).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">\n<em>Order denying defendant\u2019s motion for new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b875-6\">The trial judge sentenced the defendant to three years in State prison.

The defendant, himself, testified that Don\u00e1is simply \u201cask[ed]\u201d him if he wanted cocaine or would buy cocaine (albeit whenever he would see Don\u00e1is), and admitted that on at least one occasion, he vigorously rebuffed Don\u00e1is\u2019s solicitation to procure cocaine (\u201cI chewed him out.

He denied that he had ever agreed to sell anything to Nartowicz. This satisfied the minimal burden a defendant must meet in order to be entitled to an entrapment instruction, even when the evidence of inducement is insubstantial and self-serving, or even implausible.

Rep. No. 97-682, at 551 (1982). In accordance with the guidelines, the FBI task force in the instant case had accumulated information from a variety of sources that the defendant was distributing cocaine as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>member of the Longriders Club prior to the incident here.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">In connection with the task force\u2019s investigatory efforts in this case, the defendant called FBI Special Agent Cliff Hedges, who testified on cross-examination that the task force had targeted the defendant as the result of an accumulation of reports, particularly from several members of another motorcycle club, which identified the defendant as the Longriders Club\u2019s chief cocaine trafficker. The judge allowed Hedges\u2019s testimony (without details as to his sources), on the approved reasoning that such background extrajudicial information explaining the state of police knowledge and how the defendant came to the authorities\u2019 attention, if carefully circumscribed, may be admitted so long as it is not used for the truth of the statements that served as the basis of the police knowledge. The judge correctly cited <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosario, </em>430 Mass. 505, 508, 509 (1999), in her ruling. Her limiting instruction to the jury (which the defendant\u2019s counsel explicitly requested and thanked the judge for) \u2014\u25a0 specifying that the \u201cinformation [reported by Hedges] is not given to you so you can consider it for its truth . . . [but] to explain why the agents began their investigation. It does not go to the predisposition or the state of mind of the defendant\u201d \u2014 may be presumed to have been followed by the jury, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hanlon, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 810, 822 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Correia, </em>65 Mass.

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hanlon, supra. </em>The defendant has presented no coherent argument demonstrating either \u201cpalpable error\u201d in (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robertson, </em>408 Mass. 747, 750 [1990], quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>382 Mass. 448, 463 [1981]) or the lack of an honest conscientious, intelligent basis for (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jaime, </em>433 Mass. 575, 579 [2001]) the judge\u2019s exercise of discretion in making the challenged ruling. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>387 Mass. 464,472 (1982). Finally, the defendant\u2019s appellate objection to Hedges\u2019s testimony based on <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36 (2004), similarly lacks substance and violates Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), being grounded in an unsupported and entirely speculative contention that the reports about the defendant to Hedges and the task force investigators had to have been \u201ctestimonial\u201d as the product of supposed police interrogation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b885-7\"><em>Jacobson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>503 U.S. at 550, involved a defendant as to whom the government initially had no information regarding illegal activities, who was the target of twenty-six months of repeated mailings and communications from government agents to induce him to purchase illegal materials (child pornography) through the mails, efforts which the Court describes as having \u201cexerted substantial pressure on\u201d the defendant to make the illegal purchases <em>(id. </em>at 552), and which amounted to the government\u2019s \u201cimplant[ing] in the mind of an innocent person the <em>disposition </em>to commit the alleged offense\u201d so that it could prosecute \u201can otherwise law-abiding citizen who, if left to his own devices, likely would have never run afoul of the law\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>(emphasis in original). <em>Id. </em>at 553-554, quoting from <em>Sorrells </em>v. <em>United States, </em>287 U.S. at 442.

And the proffered statement was far from reliable, defense counsel himself having conceded during voir <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>dire that its truth was irrelevant and the prosecutor having vigorously disputed the accuracy of the statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b891-7\">Donais had moved to Florida sometime in 2001 and ceased to have a cooperating role with the government soon thereafter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b891-8\">The prosecutor had also objected to the autopsy report as hearsay. The defendant here argues that it should have been deemed authenticated as an official record, but he provides no decisional authority supporting that position, nor was any relevant authority on the point provided to the judge at the voir dire on the document. In addition, the autopsy report does not address whether Don\u00e1is ingested the cocaine by mistake, ruse, while incapacitated, or by force. The defense presented no evidence regarding the 2003 death on the issue whether Don\u00e1is possessed this cocaine knowingly or intentionally, further diminishing the probative value of the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b891-9\"> \u201cIn order to find an abuse of discretion, \u2018it is necessary to decide that no conscientious judge, acting intelligently, could honestly have taken the view expressed by [her].\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>445 Mass. 195, 209 (2005), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jaime, </em>433 Mass. 575, 579 (2001).

This is unsurprising, in light of the substantial trial evidence of Donais\u2019s cocaine use during the relevant time period and the fact that the defendant himself testified that two years constituted sufficient time within which to develop a cocaine habit, go through rehabilitation, become sober and productive, then resuccumb to cocaine addiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
