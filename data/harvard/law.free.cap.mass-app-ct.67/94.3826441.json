We hold that in the circumstances of this case, the jury could find that he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-16\">The defendant, James Namey, was convicted as a joint venturer of receiving stolen property over $250 in value, G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 60, and possession of burglarious instruments, G. L. c. 266, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>\u00a7 49.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He appeals, claiming that (1) the \u201cCommonwealth never established or presented evidence that the defendant was present at the scene of the crime of receipt\u201d; (2) receiving stolen property was not proved \u201cbecause the mere presence as a front seat passenger in a stolen car does not satisfy the statutory requirement of knowing possession\u201d; and (3) possession of burglarious instruments was also not sufficiently proved \u201cwhere the only evidence of such was flight and concealment from police and [there was] no evidence that [the defendant] possessed the tools.\u201d We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\"><em>Facts. </em>On January 10, 2004, Philip Goddard, the owner of a black 1995 Toyota Camry automobile in better than average condition, parked and locked his vehicle at a metered parking space in Boston\u2019s Back Bay neighborhood. When he returned about one hour later, the car was gone.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">At trial, Officer Galvin of the Hingham police department testified that approximately one month later, on February 12, 2004, around 5:00 p.m., he observed a black Toyota Camry traveling southbound on Route 228 at the intersection of Main Street (Route 228) and Friend Street in Hingham. Glancing at the car, he saw the driver, an African-American male with a shaved head, and one passenger, a dark-haired Caucasian male whom he later identified as the defendant, duck down upon spotting the officer. As a result of these actions, the officer ran a computerized check on the license plate and learned of the car\u2019s stolen status. Following the car, he radioed ahead to Officer Foss for assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Officer Foss of the Hingham police department testified that after he received a call from Officer Galvin, he observed the black Toyota Camry traveling southbound on Route 228 and pulled behind it, with his blue lights and siren activated. The car came to a stop, but as soon as Officer Foss began to leave his cruiser, with his gun drawn, the car sped off. Officer Foss jumped back into his cruiser and pursued the speeding Camry, which reached speeds of eighty-five miles per hour notwithstanding the heavy traffic conditions. After traveling southbound on Route 228 for about two and one-half miles, dangerously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>passing other cars by crossing into oncoming traffic, the car turned right onto Route 53. Out of public safety concerns, Officer Foss pursued the car only for about one mile before slowing down and keeping the car within sight. Officer Foss observed that the vehicle, once on Route 53, again increased its speed. It struck another car, then took a right turn and continued down Gardner Street. Officer Foss stopped his pursuit to render assistance to the person whose car had been hit.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Meanwhile, Officer Galvin picked up the chase, observing the vehicle on Gardner Street in Hingham where it was coming at him. After the car passed him, Officer Galvin reversed direction and, shortly thereafter, found the vehicle crashed into a tree next to a house at 111 Gardner Street. When he arrived, the occupants had fled the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The Canary was heavily damaged at the front end with both airbags deployed. Police observation revealed that the vehicle\u2019s ignition had been \u201cpopped\u201d and that the door lock on the passenger side was \u201ceither out or damaged.\u201d A photograph taken at the scene and admitted in evidence depicted a hole, where the ignition should be, in the car\u2019s dashboard.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">A canine unit of the police arrived and began searching the immediate area. The police dog tracked a scent into the wooded area behind the house. After proceeding for about one-half mile along a clear-cut path in the woods, the dog turned to an area covered by leaves and trees. A man jumped up and began running away. After police officers ordered him to stop, he continued running, finally obeying their command twenty-five to thirty feet later. The man was arrested and Officer Galvin identified him as the passenger he had observed in the black Camry.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">Officer Galvin further testified that the police found several hypodermic syringes on the passenger side floor of the vehicle as well as more hypodermic syringes in the trunk of the car. Also discovered was a map of the local area in the front seat, as well as a black wig, a white ski hat, and several tools, including screwdrivers, pliers, a flashlight, and a dent puller, on the rear seat behind the front passenger side.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>The defendant testified that the driver, Mike Kimblough, <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> whom he had known \u201cfor a while,\u201d picked him up in Boston\u2019s South End neighborhood during the afternoon of February 12, 2004, to drive to a party on Cape Cod.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant said that when he entered the car, he did not notice anything wrong with the passenger door lock. He further denied seeing a hole in place of the car\u2019s ignition and said that the area was covered with a bandana, making it impossible for him to see. As to any objects located in the back seat, he thought they were the driver\u2019s personal items and did not pay any attention to them. The defendant testified that he did not realize the car was stolen until the driver so informed him when they were initially stopped by the police.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Notwithstanding this information, the defendant did not attempt to leave the car when it first came to a stop; he testified he did not have time to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\"><em>Receiving stolen property. </em>General Laws c. 266, \u00a7 60, provides in pertinent part that \u201c[wjhoever buys, receives or aids in the concealment of stolen . . . property, knowing it to have been stolen . . . shall ... be punished.\u201d In order to prove the defendant guilty of receiving stolen property, the Commonwealth must prove three elements beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) \u201cThat the property in question was stolen\u201d; (2) \u201cThat the defendant knew that the property had been stolen\u201d; and (3) \u201cThat the defendant knowingly had the stolen property in his (her) possession.\u201d Model Jury Instructions for Use in the District Court, Instruction 5.32 (1997). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Yourawski, </em>384 Mass. 386, 387 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cromwell, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 662, 664 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The defendant seeks to add another element, contending that \u201c[t]he unlawful receipt of stolen property is a single, specific act occurring at a specific time and place,\u201d which the Commonwealth must prove when proceeding on a joint venture theory. Thus, he further argues, he cannot be convicted of receiving stolen property as a joint venturer because that would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>require him to be present at the scene of the crime, and the Commonwealth failed to prove that he was present when the principal received the stolen car.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">We decline the invitation to expand upon the elements of the crime. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cromwell, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. at 664-666 (declining to add proof of ownership to elements of receiving stolen property).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\"><em>Knowledge and possession (receiving stolen property). </em>The defendant next contends that the Commonwealth did not present sufficient evidence that he knowingly possessed the stolen motor vehicle.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">\u201cThe defendant\u2019s presence as a passenger in the stolen car [does] not alone satisfy the statutory requirement of knowing possession of the vehicle . . . , but his presence supplemented by other incriminating evidence justified submission of the issue to the jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 191, 193 (1979). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 956, 957 (1978).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">The evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Platt, </em>440 Mass. 396, 400 (2003), reveals the following: (1) the car\u2019s ignition had been \u201cpopped,\u201d leaving a hole in the dashboard; (2) the door lock on the front passenger side where the defendant sat was \u201ceither out or damaged\u201d; (3) visibly located in the back seat of the car were two disguises, a dent puller, and other tools, including screwdrivers and pliers; (4) in the front seat of the car was a map of the local area.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">From the significant damage to the car, a fact finder could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>find, under these circumstances, that the defendant possessed sufficient knowledge that the car in which he was seated was, in fact, stolen. See <em>Commissioner of Pub. Safety </em>v. <em>Treadway, </em>368 Mass. 155, 160 (1975) (requirement of knowledge for receiving stolen goods satisfied by evidence that defendant believed or suspected that goods were stolen); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dellamano, </em>393 Mass. 132, 138 (1984), quoting from <em>Commonwealth v. Boris, </em>317 Mass. 309, 315 (1944) (\u201cthe attending circumstances known to a defendant are important as tending to show that he possessed knowledge that the goods had been stolen, <em>or at least as inducing a belief that they had been stolen\u201d); Commonwealth v. Youngworth, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 30, 34-35 (2002), cert. denied, 538 U.S. 1064 (2003) (knowledge prong supported by the fact that stolen motor vehicle that had been in defendant\u2019s garage for at least four days bore hole in place of ignition).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Next, we must determine whether the defendant, as a passenger, had constructive possession of the car; that is, whether the defendant had sufficient dominion and control of the vehicle to be considered to be in possession of it. Possession has been found where the defendant, as a passenger, uses the motor vehicle with others in conjunction with committing a crime, supporting the inference that he has some ability and intent to control the manner in which the car is being used. Thus, in <em>Commonwealth s. Johnson, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. at 193, there was sufficient evidence that the passenger had dominion and control of a motor vehicle when he and the driver fled in it after an aborted housebreak. In <em>Commonwealth s. Subilosky, </em>352 Mass. 153, 166 (1967), all four occupants of a stolen vehicle used in a bank robbery were found to be in possession of it for purposes of proving larceny of a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Conversely, \u201c[a] person\u2019s presence in a vehicle as a passenger, without more, is insufficient to prove that he possessed the vehicle.\u201d <em>Commonwealth s. Darnell D., </em>445 Mass. 670, 673 (2005), citing <em>Commonwealth s. Campbell, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 215, 217 (2003). In <em>Darnell D., </em>it was unknown which seat the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>defendant occupied in the car that made a number of turns after the defendant had turned around and looked at a police officer who was following the car in an unmarked vehicle. The evidence was insufficient to establish the defendant\u2019s possession of the stolen motor vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 673-674. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. at 217 (evidence lacking as to how the defendants came to be in car, how long they had been there, and what their relationship with driver was; also, no evidence that car\u2019s keys were in their possession).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">In the present case, there was evidence that the defendant was more than a mere passenger. The facts were that two disguises (one for each occupant) were located in the back seat of the car, along with a number of tools, one of which \u2014 the dent puller \u2014 was of burglarious character<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>; and a map of the area was located on the front seat. An additional factor is the similarity of objects (hypodermic needles) found at the feet of the defendant and also in the car\u2019s trunk, demonstrating some degree of access to and control over the car by the passenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">In addition, there was an abundance of consciousness of guilt evidence. \u201cActions and statements that indicate a defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt, together with other evidence, are sufficient to prove his guilt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doucette, </em>408 Mass. 454, 461 (1990), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cordle, </em>404 Mass. 733, 741 (1989). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montecalvo, </em>367 Mass. 46, 55 (1975). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Darnell D., </em>445 Mass, at 674 (\u201ca conviction may not be based on consciousness of guilt alone\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">First, Officer Galvin testified that both the driver and the passenger ducked down after looking at him from the passing car. Second, the defendant did not attempt to leave the car after it came to a stop for Officer Foss and before speeding off again. Third, after the car crashed into a tree, the defendant fled and hid in the woods. Fourth, after the police discovered him, he again ran away for another twenty-five to thirty feet, despite the police officer\u2019s order to stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">It was not a leap of conjecture to conclude on the basis of all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>of these factors that the driver and passenger of the stolen motor vehicle were in league together, staking out the area in preparation for committing another crime, thus placing them closer to the paradigm of <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Subilosky </em>than of <em>Darnell D. </em>and <em>Campbell. </em>As such, the evidence was sufficient to allow a rational trier of fact to find that the defendant knowingly possessed the stolen motor vehicle.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\"><em>Knowledge (possession of burglarious instruments). </em>The defendant makes a similar argument concerning the sufficiency of the evidence with regard to the charge of possession of burglarious instruments; namely, that the sole evidence against him was his flight and concealment. As already noted, consciousness of guilt is insufficient by itself to convict. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Darnell D., </em>445 Mass. at 674. Further, the defendant\u2019s presence in the stolen vehicle alone would not warrant a conclusion that he knowingly possessed the burglarious instruments contained within. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boone, </em>356 Mass. 85, 87 (1969) (defendant\u2019s presence in car that had firearm under driver\u2019s seat not sufficient to show he knowingly possessed firearm). In this case, however, there was additional evidence, as noted above, indicating the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the burglarious implements. The two disguises, the dent puller, as well as several other tools, including screwdrivers and pliers, were in the back seat of the car within plain view<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>; a map of the local area was on the front seat. In light of all these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>factors, submission of this issue to the jury was warranted. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, 1 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 192, 194 (defendant\u2019s presence in car together with further incriminating evidence, e.g., his participation in burglary, his flight from police both in vehicle and on foot, and his giving false name, sufficient to send issue of possession of burglarious tools located in trunk to jury).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b123-8\">The defendant was found not guilty of possessing a hypodermic needle, G.

App. Ct. 253, 257 (2000), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beverly, </em>389 Mass. 866, 870 (1983). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 565, 569 (2000). Actual and constructive possession, however, require \u201cknowledge plus ability and intention to control.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fernandez, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 530, 532 (2000).

We note that the Commonwealth\u2019s case did not deteriorate but was, in fact, strengthened, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>432 Mass. 214, 230 n.12 (2000), by, among other evidence, the defendant\u2019s testimony that he had known the driver \u201cfor a while.\u201d See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Land, </em>30 Cal.
