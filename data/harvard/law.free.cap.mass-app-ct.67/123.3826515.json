General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 91 A,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> caps the amount of \u201cearned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>income\u201d a pensioner, such as Gorman, may receive from third-party employment, and if that cap is exceeded, the pensioner must return to the Commonwealth pension monies in an amount corresponding to the excess over the cap.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">At issue is whether CRAB correctly determined that Gorman\u2019s earned income for purposes of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 91 A, was the amount of wages stated in box 1 of his W-2 form,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> without any reduction for unreimbursed travel expenses. Gorman contends that his earned income for purposes of calculation under \u00a7 91A should be reduced because such unreimbursed travel expenses were subject to deduction on his income tax returns. We hold that CRAB properly calculated earned income based on the W-2 stated wages and that amount was not reducible for potential tax deductions. The determination of tax liabilities, including but not limited to taxable income adjusted for deductions or credits on Federal and State income tax returns, does not control the calculation of pension overpayments and recoupment under \u00a7 91 A.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>Gorman is a retired State police officer receiving a disability pension from the Commonwealth. Following his retirement, Gorman commenced employment with Walters State Community College in Morristown, Tennessee (Walters State).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 91 A, a pensioner, such as Gorman, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>must report \u201cthe full amount of his earnings from earned income\u201d to PERAC, and if the pensioner receives more earned income than is allowable under \u00a7 91 A,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *the pensioner must reimburse the Commonwealth for that excess. For calendar years 1998 and 1999, Gorman complied with the pertinent filing requirement and reported his income by providing PERAC with various of his tax filings, including his W-2 wage statement and tax returns. Those tax forms showed that Gorman\u2019s wages from his employer, Walters State, were in excess of the earned income allowance set under \u00a7 91 A. The tax forms submitted by Gorman to PERAC also listed claimed deductions for unreimbursed travel expenses for the 1998 and 1999 tax years of $5,422 and $6,027, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Based on these filings, PERAC calculated that Gorman\u2019s 1998 and 1999 earned income exceeded the allowable amounts under \u00a7 91A by $10,101.87 and $8,202.78, respectively, and PERAC directed the State Board of Retirement to inform Gorman that he was responsible for returning approximately $18,000 in excess retirement payments for the two years.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In reaching these determinations, PERAC did not credit Gorman with his claimed deductions for travel expenses, opining that, \u201c[a]mounts paid by an employer for services rendered, whether later reduced for tax purposes as unreimbursed business expenses on a federal income tax or not, are earned income to Mr. Gorman within the provisions of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 91A.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Gorman appealed PERAC\u2019s decision to CRAB, which referred the matter to the Division of Administrative Law Appeals (DALA). After a hearing, the DALA agreed with Gorman, finding that the unreimbursed travel expenses should not have been counted as part of Gorman\u2019s earned income. PERAC filed objections to the DALA\u2019s findings, and CRAB reversed, siding with PERAC. CRAB held that the term \u201cfull amount of earnings from earned income,\u201d as used in \u00a7 91 A, \u201cmeans all earnings, not earnings reduced by expenses that the retiree claims for income tax purposes.\u201d It noted that if the payments had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>been made to Gorman \u201cas reimbursement for expenses documented by receipts, they would not be earned income.\u201d Gorman, however, had not made such a showing. Gorman then appealed CRAB\u2019s decision to the Superior Court, which again reversed, concluding that the unreimbursed travel expenses were not earned income for the purposes of \u00a7 91 A. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">2. <em>The CRAB construction of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 91A, \u201cearned </em>income.\u201d We consider whether CRAB\u2019s interpretation of earned income for purposes of \u00a7 91A\u2014 essentially as being equivalent to Gorman\u2019s reported wages without deduction for claimed expenses \u2014 is reasonable. Decisions of administrative agencies are afforded great deference, but \u201c[w]here an agency determination involves a question of law, it is subject to de nova judicial review.\u201d <em>Flemings </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>431 Mass. 374, 375 (2000). Nevertheless, \u201c[wjhere an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute is reasonable, the court should not supplant it with its own judgment.\u201d <em>Boston Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>441 Mass. 78, 82 (2004), citing <em>Flemings, supra </em>at 375.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The term \u201cearnings from earned income\u201d in \u00a7 91A is not defined. However, in 1998, PERAC issued a memorandum in which it defined \u201cearned income\u201d as \u201cimplying] some labor, management or supervision in production thereof\u201d (the first clause). PERAC elaborated that for an individual operating a business for profit, earned income would include \u201c[pjrofits derived from the operation of a business through some labor, management or supervision of production of such profits . . . <em>regardless of how a retiree categorized such income for income tax or other </em>purposes\u201d (emphasis supplied) (the second clause). PERAC Memo #64/1998 (hereinafter referred to as PERAC #64 memorandum).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> PERAC\u2019s interpretation of the meaning of \u201cearned income\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 91A, as described in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>this memorandum, was considered by the Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>441 Mass. at 82, and found to be a reasonable interpretation of the statutory language. Cf. G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1. <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The PERAC #64 memorandum and the holding in <em>Boston Retirement Bd., supra, </em>addressed profits derived from a pensioner\u2019s operation of a business. In this case what is at issue are employee wages, not business profits. However, as applied to pension distribution overages under \u00a7 91 A, the analysis in the PERAC #64 memorandum is pertinent to wages, not just business profits. Indeed, both parties in this appeal cite the memorandum as authority and rely on it. We agree that the PERAC #64 memorandum informs the resolution of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">With the PERAC #64 memorandum as backdrop, the parties frame the analytic debate in this appeal in terms of whether Gorman\u2019s unreimbursed travel expenses should be considered under the first or second above-quoted clause of the PERAC #64 memorandum. Gorman argues that payments for his unre-imbursed travel expenses do not fall within the first clause because they are not derived from \u201clabor, management or supervision in production thereof\u201d and, thus, cannot be considered part of his earned income. CRAB argues that because the expenses were included as income on Gorman\u2019s tax forms, they are countable under the second clause of the PERAC #64 memorandum as earned income, \u201cregardless of how [Gorman] categorized such income for income tax or other purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>We agree with CRAB that expense deductions claimed on a Federal or State income tax return (such as Gorman cites here) cannot, as matter of law, trump the pension overage standards in \u00a7 91A and the calculation of earned income under that statute. It is reasonable for PERAC and CRAB to rely on a pensioner\u2019s statement of income as shown on a W-2 form, and these governmental pension agencies cannot be called upon to conduct a tax-based analysis of what part of these \u201c[w]ages, tips, [and] other compensation\u201d as stated on an employee\u2019s W-2 tax form (see note 3, supra) may or may not be subject to deduction under the Federal Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq. (2002), or State law, G. L. c. 62. Nor do we see anything in these tax code provisions that compels the conclusion that earned income for G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 91A, calculations can only reasonably be construed if linked to adjustments to wages or other W-2 compensation that may result on account of a taxpayer\u2019s claimed business expense deductions. Further consistent with this analysis is that \u00a7 91A refers to the <em>\u201cfull amount </em>of . . . earnings from earned income.\u201d G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 91A (emphasis supplied). \u201cFull\u201d means, in this context, the entire amount, without accounting for possible adjustments or deductions.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">For these reasons, CRAB\u2019s determination that counting Gorman\u2019s W-2 declared wages as earned income is a reasonable interpretation of \u00a7 91A and is in accord with the purposes underlying the pension recoupment standards set forth in that section. See <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>441 Mass. at 82 (court will not supplant with its own judgment the construction of a statute adopted by the administrative agencies charged with enforcing that statute). The judgment of the Superior Court is reversed insofar as it held that CRAB erred in including the plaintiff\u2019s unreimbursed travel expenses as earned income. A new judgment shall enter affirming CRAB\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b151-15\">General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 91A, as appearing in St. 1996, c. 306, \u00a7 50, provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>\u201cEvery person pensioned or retired under any general or special law for disability . . . shall in each year . . . file with [PERAC] a statement . . . certifying the full amount of his earnings from earned income during the preceding year.

Those deductions are not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b154-7\">PERAC later incorporated the substance of the PERAC #64 memorandum into its regulations. See 840 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.14(4)(2004), which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-8\">\u201cThe term \u2018earnings from earned income\u2019 [in \u00a7 91A] shall mean income that implies some labor, management or supervision in the production thereof, not income derived from ownership of property. . . .
