L. c. 142A. The trial judge, sitting jury-waived, found the defendant guilty on both counts. The defendant appeals, claiming error in the denial of his motions to exclude certain evidence and for a required finding of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-15\"><em>Background. </em>The defendant, the sole officer of a corporation called American Sunroom, was charged with collecting deposit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>payments from two customers and failing to provide them with completed sunrooms. The underlying facts are not in dispute. Customer John Rogers provided the defendant with a deposit and a progress payment, which together totaled more than $16,000. Customer Carolyn Harrison paid the defendant a deposit and a progress payment, which together totaled $7,300. While some work was done on Rogers\u2019s sunroom, work was never commenced on Harrison\u2019s; both customers engaged the company approximately eight months before it filed for protection under the bankruptcy laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The Commonwealth filed two criminal complaints, identified for our purposes as complaint no. 2948 and complaint no. 3148. Both are dated June 16, 2004, identify the offense as \u201c142A/ 19/A HOME IMPROVEMENT CONTRACTOR VIOLATION c,\u201d and are discussed in greater detail below.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The defendant\u2019s motion in limine to exclude certain evidence was based on the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to comply fully with court-ordered discovery until the eve of trial. The defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty was based on the wording of the complaints and on the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to prove a knowing and wilful violation of G. L. c. 142A.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>Because the Commonwealth failed to provide any evidence of a wilful and knowing violation of G. L. c. 142A by the defendant, it was error to deny the defendant\u2019s motion for required finding of not guilty. We therefore dispose of the remaining issues summarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">1. <em>The motion in limine. </em>\u201c \u2018When confronted with the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to comply with its discovery obligations,\u2019 a judge is afforded considerable discretion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Janvrin, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 917, 919 (1998), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fossa, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 563, 567 (1996). A defendant seeking relief as a result of delayed disclosure has the burden of showing that he was prejudiced by the delay. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fossa, supra </em>at 568, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagliardi, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 225, 228 (1990). We are satisfied that the defendant did not discharge his burden to demonstrate an abuse of discretion in the judge\u2019s conclusion that no prejudice resulted from the Commonwealth\u2019s tardy production of documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>2. <em>The wording of the complaints. </em>The complaints failed to cite any specific statutory provision defining a violation of law. Their only reference to a specific section of G. L. c. 142A, namely \u00a7 19, was merely a reference to the statute\u2019s penalty provisions, and not to language that provided the defendant with notice of the prohibited acts with which he was charged.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If the complaints had contained no other reference to the acts with which the prosecution sought to charge the defendant, we would conclude that they failed to satisfy art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, the defendant was adequately placed on notice by descriptive language in each complaint. For example, complaint no. 2948 stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-5\">\u201c[0]n 8/28/2003 did knowingly and willfully (DEFENDANT WAS GIVEN SEVERAL PAYMENTS TO START A SUNROOM AND NEVER DID), contrary to a provision of G. L. c. 142A, and in violation of G. L. c. 142A, 19. (PENALTY: imprisonment not more than 1 year; or not more than $2,000; or both).\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>This language, and the charge as a whole, may not qualify as a model complaint, but it informed the defendant of his alleged offense \u201cwith sufficient clarity to show a violation of law and to permit the defendant to know the nature of the accusation against him.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Green, </em>399 Mass. 565, 566 (1987).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *Accordingly, the wording of the complaints did not require a finding of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">3. <em>Failure to prove a knowing and wilful violation of the statute. </em>The defendant is on much firmer ground in seeking to have his convictions set aside where he argues that the Commonwealth was required to prove a \u201cwilful and knowing\u201d violation of the statute, and failed to do so. Section 17(2) of G. L. c. 142A, in relevant part, describes the following prohibited act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\">\u201c(2) abandoning or failing to perform, without justification, any contract or project engaged in or undertaken by a registered contractor or subcontractor. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">This provision, read independently, simply describes the prohibited act and does not refer to a required state of mind. However, at the conclusion of \u00a7 17, the statute provides for three distinct categories of penalty arising from the commission of any of the seventeen prohibited acts described in the section:</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">(1) administrative sanctions pursuant to G. L. c. 142A, \u00a7 18,</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">(2) criminal prosecutions \u201cas prescribed in section nineteen,\u201d and (3) per se determination of a parallel violation of G. L. c. 93A.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Criminal prosecution thus depends on the reference to G. L. c. 142A, \u00a7 19. In the case of licensed contractors, as cited above, \u00a7 19 provides: \u201c[a]ny person who <em>knowingly and willfully </em>violates any of the provisions of this chapter ...\u201d (emphasis supplied). The legislative scheme \u2014 providing strict liability for administrative sanctions and for violations of consumer protection law under G. L. c. 93A, while in contrast requiring scienter for criminal prosecution \u2014 is set forth unambiguously.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Moreover, we conclude from our review of the record that the Commonwealth prosecuted the defendant on a theory of strict liability. At the conclusion of the prosecution\u2019s case the defendant moved for a required finding of not guilty. The prosecution thereupon conceded that the words \u201cknowingly and willfully\u201d appeared in \u00a7 19, but then insisted: \u201cI don\u2019t know if my brother and [I] are reading the same statute because it says nothing [sic] intent there. This is not a question of intent. This is a question of abandoning work.\u201d At the conclusion of all the testimony, the prosecution conceded that it relied on \u00a7 17(2) rather than electing to proceed under a theory of larceny where \u201cthe Commonwealth could never prove, can\u2019t prove and couldn\u2019t prove, intent at the time.\u201d The record provides no evidence to support a finding of a wilful and knowing violation of any provision of \u00a7 17 by the defendant. Further, the record does not support the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion that the judge inferred a wilful and knowing violation; to the contrary, it is evident that the judge based her finding of guilty, and denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty, on the Commonwealth\u2019s theory of strict liability.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>Because the record contains no evidence to support a finding of a wilful and knowing violation of c. 142A, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>because the imposition of criminal liability under the statute requires such a finding, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Au8a\">\n<em>Findings set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ar3\">\n<em>Judgments for defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b339-6\">General Laws c. 142A, \u00a7 19, inserted by St. 1991, \u00a7 453, provides in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-7\">\u201cAny contractor or subcontractor who shall knowingly, willfully, or negligently operate without obtaining a certificate of registration as required by this chapter and who is not otherwise exempt from the registration requirement or any contractor or subcontractor who continues to operate after revocation of or during suspension of, or who fails to renew his certificate of registration, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars or imprisonment not exceeding two years, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-8\">\u201cAny person who knowingly and willfully violates any of the provisions of this chapter, with respect to which a greater penalty is not otherwise provided by the provisions of this chapter or by any other law may be punished by a fine of not more than two thousand dollars or by imprisonment for not more than one year or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-9\">\u201cSuch fines and imprisonment shall be in addition to any administrative penalty otherwise applicable thereto and may be sought in an action brought by the attorney general or the district attorney.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b339-10\">Article 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights provides that \u201c[n]o subject shall be held to answer for any crimes or offence, until the same is fully and plainly, substantially and formally, described to him.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b339-11\">Complaint no. 3148 substituted the words \u201cCOLLECTED TWO INDI<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>VIDUAL PAYMENTS TO START THE JOB\u201d for \u201cWAS GIVEN SEVERAL PAYMENTS TO START A SUNROOM\u201d but was otherwise identical.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b340-12\">The record also indicates that the prosecutor orally informed the defendant at a pretrial conference and again on the day of trial that the Commonwealth was proceeding under G. L. c 142A, \u00a7 17(2). Because we conclude that the written complaint passes constitutional muster, we do not address the sufficiency of the oral communication except to note that, as a rule, the Commonwealth\u2019s ability to prove proper notice is seriously undermined without a recorded charge. The better practice, manifestly, is a written complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b340-13\">Specifically, the final two one-sentence paragraphs of \u00a7 17, which are unnumbered, state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-14\">\u201cViolations of this section shall subject the violator to the administrative sanctions of section eighteen and to criminal prosecution as prescribed in section nineteen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-15\">\u201cViolations of any of the provisions of this chapter shall constitute an unfair or deceptive act under the provisions of chapter ninety-three A.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Although the Commonwealth took the position below and in its brief that G. L. c. 142A, \u00a7 17(2), imposed criminal strict liability, it properly conceded at oral argument that the \u201cknowingly and willfully\u201d language of \u00a7 19 is applicable to this criminal prosecution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b341-8\">At the conclusion of testimony, the following colloquy (here excerpted and compressed) transpired between defense counsel and the judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-9\">Defense counsel: \u201cJudge there has to be some sort of intent on [the defendant\u2019s] part, or the Company\u2019s part, to wilfully and knowingly ah, not do the work. . . . he\u2019s really charged under 19. In the second paragraph it mentions willingly [sic] and knowingly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Judge: \u201cWell, I\u2019m not sure I agree with you there. . . . At the end of 17 the statute merely says that violations of this section shall subject the violator to criminal prosecution as prescribe^] in section 19. So it I believe refers directly to the, to the sentencing structure of 19, but it doesn\u2019t pull along with it all the language of 19, and I, I could be wrong.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-7\">Defense counsel: \u201cWell I, I, I read it differently, Judge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-8\">Judge: \u201c[M]y opinion is that the Commonwealth has to prove that the contractor was registered, that he abandoned or failed to perform without justification any contract beyond a reasonable doubt, and that\u2019s all they have to prove.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
