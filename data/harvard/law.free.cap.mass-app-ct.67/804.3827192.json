Further, the by-law provides that, while in the channel, these watercraft must operate at \u201cheadway speed,\u201d the slowest speed of operation that will maintain steerage.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The combined effect of these restrictions is that a jet ski or other personal watercraft may only pass through Provincetown Harbor in a designated 200-foot wide \u201clane\u201d at headway speed and proceed to the ocean waters beyond the bounds of the harbor.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">The town justifies adoption of the by-law in light of the nature and use of Provincetown Harbor, and particular safety concerns and risks that would be presented were there to be widespread and unregulated use of personal watercraft and jet skis in the harbor. Provincetown Harbor is an active and popular swimming place and port of call for boating. Many small recreational craft move about the harbor. In addition, because Provincetown\u2019s harbor has a deep navigable channel, large commercial boats, ferries, and whale watching boats also move within the harbor. Given that Provincetown Harbor is so very busy, populated by people swimming and fishing and many boats large and small traveling about, the town asserts that the restrictions were crafted in order to lessen the danger personal watercraft and jet skis pose to people swimming in the harbor, and to reduce the risk of boat crashes as these individually operated watercraft bob and weave in the harbor waters \u2014 a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>risk that is enhanced by the turbulence and waves flowing from the wake of the larger ships moving in the harbor. The town also justifies the by-law as reducing the environmental impact of engine discharge from personal watercraft, and as ameliorating the nuisance effect of the loud noise which echoes from their water-jet propulsion engines.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Soon after adoption, the by-law was the subject of legal challenge by the plaintiffs, Mad Maxine\u2019s Watersports, Inc. (Mad Maxine\u2019s), a business that rents personal watercraft for customers\u2019 use in Provincetown Harbor, and Geneva Cook, an individual who has used, and says she wants to continue to use, personal watercraft within the harbor. The plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit sought a declaration that the by-law was in violation of various provisions of the Federal and State Constitutions, including art. 89, \u00a7 6, of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution (the Home Rule Amendment), and the public trust doctrine, which, as further described herein, involves the rights of the public to conduct activities on waters and underlying tidelands of the Commonwealth below mean low water mark.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">In the Superior Court, the town moved for a summary judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>ment that the by-law was validly enacted and enforceable. That summary judgment motion was allowed. The two challenges to the validity of the by-law presented in this appeal<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 8pose pure questions of law predicated on the Home Rule Amendment and the public trust doctrine governing sovereign rights over Massachusetts waterways and below tidelands. For the reasons that follow, we hold that the Provincetown by-law is a lawful home rule provision and does not violate the public trust doctrine. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">1. <em>The Home Rule Amendment. </em>Under the Home Rule Amendment, \u201c[a]ny city or town may, by the adoption, amendment, or repeal of local ordinances or by-laws, exercise any power or function which the general court has power to confer upon it, <em>which is not inconsistent with the constitution or laws enacted by the general court </em>. . . .\u201d (emphasis supplied). Art. 89, \u00a7 6, of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution. Considerable latitude is given to municipalities in enacting local bylaws. Only enactments that present a \u201csharp conflict between the local and State provisions\u201d will be held invalid. <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Provincetown, </em>384 Mass. 179, 181 (1981), quoting from <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>363 Mass. 136, 154 (1973). \u201cThe sharp conflict necessary to repugnancy \u2018appears when either the legislative intent to preclude local action is clear, or, absent plain expression of such intent, the purpose of the statute cannot be achieved in the face of the local by-law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Provincetown, supra, </em>quoting from <em>Grace </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>379 Mass. 43, 54 (1979). In other words, \u201csharp conflict\u201d requires either a contravention of the statutory purpose or an intent by the Legislature to preclude local regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">The plaintiffs contend that the Provincetown by-law is in sharp conflict with, and would defeat the purposes of, a State statute, G. L. c. 90B, \u00a7 9A. That statute provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-7\">\u201cNo person shall operate a jet ski, surf jet or wetbike[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>(a) on waters of the commonwealth unless the person is sixteen years of age or older, (b) within one hundred and fifty feet of a swimmer, shore or moored vessel, except at headway speed, (c) on waters of the commonwealth of less than seventy-five acres, (d) without wearing an approved personal flotation device or (e) between sunset and sunrise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">G. L. c. 90B, \u00a7 9A, inserted by St. 1989, c. 681, \u00a7 1. According to the plaintiffs, the Provincetown by-law infringes an affirmative right to use a personal watercraft on Commonwealth waterways, which right inherently lies within the above quoted provisions of \u00a7 9A, and which right, by virtue of its Statewide statutory application, displaces local authority under home rule. Specifically, the plaintiffs submit that because \u00a7 9A restricts the operation of personal watercraft on waters of the Commonwealth less than seventy-five acres, the converse applies: that is, if the waters are greater than seventy-five acres, then, say the plaintiffs, there is an absolute right to operate a personal watercraft or jet ski on the broader waterways.* <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> From there, the plaintiffs extrapolate to the proposition that the Provincetown by-law is an unlawful regulation under the Home Rule Amendment because the by-law effectively bans the free operation of personal watercraft in Provincetown Harbor, cutting off the inherent right of watercraft use the plaintiffs see as implicitly residing in G. L. c. 90B, \u00a7 9A.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">The first, and insurmountable, problem with the plaintiffs\u2019 novel theory of a sharp conflict between the Provincetown bylaw and the Commonwealth\u2019s law, G. L. c. 90B, \u00a7 9A, is that the entire theory rests on a nonexistent absolute right (to operate personal watercraft) that is nothing more or less than virtu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>ally imagined as lying within \u00a7 9A.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Section 9A is not subject to the reading the plaintiffs would engraft upon it. The section, whether on its face or by implication, cannot be read as conferring an absolute and unregulable right on individuals to operate jet skis or other personal watercraft in waterways of greater than seventy-five acres. Rather, the plain words of G. L. c. 90B, \u00a7 9A, are more reasonably construed as setting forth minimum regulatory guidelines and standards for the operation of personal watercraft. \u201c[T]he primary source of insight into the intent of the Legislature is the language of the statute.\u201d <em>International Fid. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>387 Mass. 841, 853 (1983). The plain terms of \u00a7 9A codify quotidian regulatory details consonant with the setting of minimum standards for personal water<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>craft use and operation, e.g., the minimum distance to be maintained as a buffer between the watercraft and a swimmer or other vessel, hours of approved use, a minimum age of sixteen years for an operator, and a requirement of wearing approved flotation devices. Given this micro level of detail in \u00a7 9A, the plain language of the statute supports the minimal standards construction. \u201cWhere the language of a statute is plain, it must be interpreted in accordance with the usual and natural meaning of the words.\u201d <em>Anderson Street Assocs. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>442 Mass. 812, 816 (2004), quoting from <em>Gurley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 363 </em>Mass. 595, 598 (1973). Accordingly, we reject the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the Provincetown by-law is an invalid home rule regulation, because the by-law is not in \u201csharp conflict\u201d with G. L. c. 90B, \u00a7 9A.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">We turn next to the related basis of challenge to this home rule regulation by Provincetown, which is that the by-law is void because the field of regulation of personal watercraft is exclusive to the sovereign Commonwealth. A by-law enacted by any town exceeds that town\u2019s power under the Home Rule Amendment if \u201cthe legislative intent to preclude local action is clear.\u201d <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Provincetown, </em>384 Mass. at 181, quoting from <em>Grace </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>379 Mass. at 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">However, the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that local action is precluded, and that exclusive sovereignty rests in the Commonwealth alone, is addressed and resolved adversely to the plaintiffs by the Legislature\u2019s express delegation in G. L. c. 90B, \u00a7 15, inserted by St. 1960, c. 275, \u00a7 2, which provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-7\"><em>\u201c(a) </em>The provisions of this chapter shall govern the numbering, operation, equipment and all other matters relating thereto of any vessel subject to the provisions of this chapter or of any rule or regulation made under authority hereof....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-8\">\u201c(h) Nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting any city or town from regulating, by ordinance or bylaw, not contrary to the provisions of this chapter or of any rule or regulation made under authority hereof, other than numbering, of such vessels on such waters of the commonwealth as lie within the city or town, or such activities which take place thereon. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>\u201c(c) No such ordinance or by-law shall be valid unless it shall have been approved by the director [of the division of law enforcement of the Department of Fisheries, Wildlife and Environmental Law Enforcement] and published in a newspaper of general distribution in said city or town not less than five days before the effective date thereof.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">As is clear from \u00a7 15(6) and (c), the Legislature empowered municipalities to \u201cregulat[e] . . . vessels on such waters of the Commonwealth as lie within the city or town, or such activities which take place thereon,\u201d so long as such regulation is not contrary to the provisions of c. 90B or its implementing rules or regulations, and so long as prior notice and approval by the appropriate State official are given. This broad legislative grant to municipalities of the power to regulate \u201cvessels\u201d is expansive enough to include the subset of personal watercraft and jet-skis, as the definition of \u201cvessel\u201d under c. 90B encompasses \u201cwatercraft of every description.\u201d G. L. c. 90B, \u00a7 1, inserted by St. 1960, c. 275, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">Given the G. L. c. 90B, \u00a7 15, delegation to cities and towns, we discern no clear legislative intent to preclude local regulation. Furthermore, the setting of minimum standards by the Legislature on a Statewide basis in G. L. c. 90B, \u00a7 9A, still leaves ample room for municipal regulation of personal watercraft under the Home Rule Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">2. <em>The public trust doctrine. </em>\u201cUnder the public trust doctrine, sovereigns hold shorelands in trust for the use of the public. See <em>Boston Waterfront Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>378 Mass. 629, 631-632 (1979) (providing history of public trust doctrine). . . . The Commonwealth, as successor to the colonial authorities, owns and controls lands seaward of the flats. See <em>Michaelson </em>v. <em>Silver Beach Improvement Ass \u2019n. Inc., </em>342 Mass. 251, 253-254 (1961). These lands are held in trust by the Commonwealth to preserve the general rights of the public. See <em>id. </em>at 253, quoting <em>Home for Aged Women </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 202 </em>Mass. 422, 427 (1909) (\u2018The waters and the land under [waters] beyond the line of private ownership are held by the State, both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>as owner of the fee and as the repository of sovereign power, with a perfect right of control in the interest of the public\u2019).\u201d <em>Fafard </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of Barnstable, </em>432 Mass. 194, 198-199 (2000). The Commonwealth is \u201csovereign[] holding] shorelands in trust for the use of the public,\u201d and \u201c[t]he Commonwealth\u2019s authority with respect to [lands seaward of the flats] is subject only to Federal law, the State Constitution, and the State\u2019s obligations as trustee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 199 (footnote omitted). The plaintiffs argue that Provincetown\u2019s adoption of the by-law is an encroachment upon the public trust. The argument advanced is that the by-law restricts the public\u2019s right of free navigation on the waters of the Commonwealth, and that free navigable waters, such as in Provincetown Harbor, are subject to regulation exclusively under the Commonwealth\u2019s sovereign power.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">This argument fails at the threshold. The exclusive sovereign power recognized in the public trust doctrine is subject to Legislative delegation to municipalities. \u201cThis history of the origins of the Commonwealth\u2019s public trust obligations and authority, as well as jurisprudence and legislation spanning two centuries, [establishes] that only the Commonwealth, <em>or an entity to which the Legislature properly has delegated authority, may administer public trust </em>rights.\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Ibid. </em>There has been such a delegation here by virtue of G. L. c. 90B, \u00a7 15, wherein the Legislature plainly has authorized towns to regulate vessels, including personal watercraft. Specifically in \u00a7 15(6), the Legislature granted cities and towns the authority to regulate \u201cby ordinance or by-law . . . vessels on such waters of the commonwealth as lie within the city or town, or such activities which take place thereon.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> There is, accordingly, no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>encroachment upon the Commonwealth\u2019s sovereignty under the public trust doctrine.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">3. <em>The injunction against juture violations. </em>In the final form of the judgment, a permanent injunction entered restraining the plaintiffs from engaging in further violations of the by-law. The plaintiffs argue that the defendants had waived their claim for injunctive relief oral argument in open court at the hearing on the motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">The record does not clearly reflect whether the request for injunctive relief was indeed waived. In any event, the record on the claim for injunctive relief is undeveloped. On this record, we cannot ascertain whether (or if so, how) the judge determined that the requested order promotes the public interest (or, in the alternative, that the equitable relief will not adversely affect the public). See, e.g., <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>408 Mass. 643, 647 (1990). More fundamentally, on this record, we see no reason to diverge from the usual rule that equitable relief is not ordinarily available to restrain violations of local ordinances or by-laws that may result in criminal proceedings.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>Revere </em>v. <em>Aucella, 369 </em>Mass. 138, 146-147 (1975), appeal dismissed sub nom. <em>Charger Invs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Corbett, </em>429 U.S. 877 (1976) (denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>injunction to enforce local criminal ordinance in the absence of express statutory authority), and authorities cited. Accordingly, we vacate that portion of the amended judgment (paragraphs 1 and 2) which permanently enjoined the plaintiffs from violating the by-law.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Otherwise, the amended judgment in the defendants\u2019 favor, declaring the Provincetown by-law to be valid and enforceable, and dismissing other claims of the plaintiffs, is affirmed.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b833-6\">The by-law at issue, \u00a7 13-4-2 of the Provincetown General By-laws, defines \u201cpersonal watercraft\u201d as \u201ca vessel propelled by a water-jet pump or other machinery as its primary source of propulsion that is designed to be operated by a person sitting, standing or kneeling on the vessel rather than being operated in the conventional manner by a person sitting or standing inside the vessel.\u201d Provincetown General By-laws \u00a7 13-4-2-1-1. There is no dispute that the term \u201cpersonal watercraft\u201d in the by-law includes the jet skis at issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b833-9\">Although \u201cheadway speed\u201d is not defined by the by-law, it is elsewhere defined as \u201cthe slowest speed at which a personal watercraft . . . can be operated and maintain steerage way.\u201d G.

A Federal judge denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, ruling that the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on their claims that the by-law was constitutionally invalid. Following the denial of the preliminary injunction, and after a stipulation of dismissal of the Federal claims and certain of the State law claims, the United States District Court judge, upon request of the parties, remanded the case to the Superior Court for litigation of the remaining State law claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b834-8\">There were also criminal proceedings commenced in the Massachusetts District Court against Christine Maxwell, owner of plaintiff Mad Maxine\u2019s, for failure to pay fines imposed as a result of three citations issued pursuant to the by-law. The criminal proceedings are not at issue here. We take judicial notice, however, that, as the record appendix reflects, Maxwell moved to dismiss the criminal complaint on grounds similar to those advanced in this appeal; namely, that the by-law violated the Home Rule Amendment as inconsistent with G. L. c. 90B, \u00a7 9A. That motion to dismiss was denied by the District Court judge on the basis that the by-law set forth reasonable restrictions and that G. L. c. 90B, \u00a7 9A, did not prohibit local regulation and did not place the exclusive right to regulate personal watercraft with the Commonwealth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b835-8\">The remaining claims advanced by the plaintiffs were the subject of a dismissal stipulation during the proceedings in the United States District Court.

In this appeal, it is the element in \u00a7 9A relating to the acreage of the waterway that is principally cited as posing the sharp conflict between the Provincetown by-law and this State statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b837-5\">In seeking to invoke an absolute usage right, the plaintiffs rely heavily on <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Provincetown, </em>384 Mass. at 181-182, and <em>American Motorcyclist Assn. </em>v. <em>Park Commn. of Brockton, </em>412 Mass. 753, 755 (1992) <em>(American Motorcyclist). </em>Both cases are distinguishable and involve granted statutory rights to operate motor vehicles on the public roadways of the Commonwealth. The statutory provision at issue in <em>Rogers </em>expressly stated that \u201c[e]very person operating a motorized bicycle upon a way <em>shall have the right </em>to use any public ways in the commonwealth . . .\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Provincetown, </em>384 Mass. at 179, quoting from G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 1B, inserted by St. 1976, c. 261, \u00a7 4. At issue in <em>American Motorcyclist </em>was another portion of G. L. c. 90 that refers to the \u201c[r]ight to operate\u201d a motor vehicle \u201cconferred by a license issued under section eight, a learner\u2019s permit issued under section eight B, or by reciprocity to nonresidents under sections three and ten.\u201d <em>American Motorcyclist, </em>412 Mass, at 757, quoting from G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 1. The statute as a whole \u201cestablishes] that those who fulfil the requirements of \u00a7 8 or \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 10 also <em>have a right to operate on the ways of the Com</em>monwealth\u201d and, accordingly, the <em>American Motorcyclist </em>court invalidated a proposed ban on motorcycles on roadways within Brockton parks. <em>Id. </em>at 757 (emphasis supplied). There are, however, no similar statutory rights to operate a watercraft set forth in G. L. c. 90B, and the aforecited cases do not advance the plaintiffs\u2019 theory for invalidating the Provincetown by-law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b837-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the by-law is a total ban on the operation of personal watercraft is incorrect. The by-law is not an outright prohibition, but rather restricts the use of such watercraft to a portion of the harbor to traverse within a defined channel and proceed beyond the harbor\u2019s inner boundaries. Although argued in the extreme by both sides \u2014 the plaintiffs contending that the by-law is an absolute ban, and the defendants contending that it is not such a ban but, even if it were, a total ban by a town would be valid and enforceable \u2014 this by-law and this case does not present the issue \u2014 and we need not reach the question \u2014 whether a municipality could, consonant with G. L. c. 90B, \u00a7 9A and \u00a7 15, adopt a total ban on personal watercraft within its waters under the Home Rule Amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b839-8\">It is not in dispute that here the town complied with the approval and publication requirements of \u00a7 15(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b840-6\">The plaintiffs cite <em>Fafard </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of Barnstable, </em>432 Mass, at 200, in support of invalidating the Provincetown by-law as inconsistent with the public trust doctrine. The Barnstable by-law at issue in <em>Fafard, </em>however, was quite different. The Barnstable by-law sought to vest the power to protect \u201cpublic trust rights in trustlands\u201d in a local conservation commission, which under the Barnstable by-law had authority to promulgate regulations on activities affecting wetlands, and in these undertakings, \u201cto regulate work in and around wetlands more strictly than does the State\u2019s wetlands protection act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 196. The court held that the Legislature had not delegated to municipalities the range and breadth of powers to protect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>public trust that Barnstable sought to exercise by adopting regulations stricter than any imposed by the sovereign Commonwealth under the public trust doctrine. <em>Ibid. </em>Unlike the Barnstable by-law challenged and held invalid in <em>Fafard, </em>the Provincetown by-law here does not purport to administer the public trust in a manner inconsistent with State laws, but rather flows from, and is consistent with, the Legislature\u2019s delegation of power to towns and cities to regulate vessels upon local waterways under G.

L. c. 90B, \u00a7 15(b), is that the regulation must not be \u201ccontrary to the provisions of [c. 90B] or of any rule or regulation made under authority [t]hereof.\u201d For the reasons addressed above, particularly in part 1, the Province-town by-law is not contrary to the provisions of c. 90B, including \u00a7 9A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b841-9\">The by-law provides for enforcement \u201cby the Provincetown Harbormaster or his designee, the Provincetown Police Department, or the Massachusetts Environmental Police,\u201d and monetary fines are specified for violations. In the instant case, the record reflects that the harbormaster initially issued verbal warnings to a supervisor at Mad Maxine\u2019s. When these verbal warnings were unheeded, written citations were issued to Mad Maxine\u2019s. The written citations, pursuant to the by-law, imposed a fine of $100 per violation. Upon Mad Maxine\u2019s failure to pay the fines, criminal proceedings were instituted against the owner of Mad Maxine\u2019s. See note 6, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b842-6\">Enforcement actions and criminal proceedings would still of course be available to address any future violations of the by-law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b842-7\">The defendants have requested an award of appellate attorney\u2019s fees and costs in connection with this appeal. See Mass.R.A.P. 25, as appearing in 376 Mass. 949 (1979). Although we reject the plaintiffs\u2019 primary challenges to the judgment, we do not consider the appeal frivolous. Although it is true that several courts had rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 contentions, we do not believe, as the defendants seem to, that this stripped the plaintiffs of their right to pursue appellate relief in this court. We deny the defendants\u2019 request.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
