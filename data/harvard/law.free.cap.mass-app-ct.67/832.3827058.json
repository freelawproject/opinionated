L. c. 261, \u00a7\u00a7 27A and 27B, for waiver of the entry fee of $300 (see G. L. c. 262, \u00a7 4) on the ground of his alleged indigency. Pursuant to the procedures set forth in G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 29, his inmate account was obtained, showing a six-month average combined balance of $1,430.01, of which he was required (as determined according to G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 29[d][1]) to pay twenty per cent, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>approximately $286, in partial payment of the filing fee. Accordingly, on August 18, 2005, a single justice of this court denied Clark\u2019s motion to waive the entry fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">On August 31, 2005, Clark filed a \u201cmotion and memorandum in support of reconsideration\u201d of the single justice\u2019s August 18, 2005, denial, arguing (for the first time) that the statutory scheme was inapplicable to him as an SDP who, he asserted, was indigent and, in any event, unconstitutionally denied him due process and equal protection. That motion was denied by the single justice on September 6, 2005. On September 9, 2005, Clark filed a \u201cnotice of appeal\u201d from the single justice\u2019s September 6, 2005, denial of his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">We need not discuss the merits of Clark\u2019s statutory and constitutional arguments, however, because his appeal is not properly before us.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When his motion for waiver of the entry (or docketing) fee was denied on August 18, 2005, the single justice\u2019s denial was appealable to a panel of this court. <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Appeals Court, </em>444 Mass. 460, 465 (2005).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> General Laws c. 261, \u00a7 27D, as appearing in St. 1992, c. 133, \u00a7 563, provides (in pertinent part) that, \u201c[u]pan being notified of the denial [of a request for fee waiver,] the applicant . . . shall have seven days thereafter to file a notice of appeal . . . .\u201d Even granting Clark the three days\u2019 grace afforded by Mass.R.Civ.P. 6(d), 365 Mass. 747 (1974),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> such a notice of appeal had to be filed no later than August 29, 2005. No such timely notice of appeal was filed by Clark. An explicit statutory appeal period cannot be extended in the court\u2019s discretion, nor even by contrary rule of court; failing timely to file in such circumstances, for whatever reason, must result in dismissal of the appeal. See <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>414 Mass. 663, 665-666 (1993), and cases cited. The fact that Clark may have been proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>pro se at the time <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is irrelevant; a pro se litigant is bound by the same legal requirements as one represented by counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">There was, thus, no pending appeal, much less any outstanding ruling, to which Clark\u2019s August 31, 2005, motion for reconsideration could relate or attach; it was, as a procedural matter, a nullity, as was, effectively as of that date for appeal purposes, the single justice\u2019s August 18 order. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>George, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 1001, 1002 (1988), <em>S.C., </em>404 Mass. 1002 (1989).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The filing of a motion for reconsideration <em>after </em>a statutory appeal period has expired can have no revivifying effect on a defunct appeal. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>441 Mass. 1014, 1015 (2004); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>443 Mass. 707, 708-709 (2005); <em>Curly Customs, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pioneer Financial, Cl </em>Mass. App. Ct. 92, 97 (2004). Although a judge ordinarily has discretion to reconsider a prior order upon an appropriate motion for reconsideration (i.e., one that is not a mere rehash of prior arguments), it is a precondition that \u201cthe request [be] made within a reasonable time.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, </em>437 Mass. 1022, 1022 (2002). It should be axiomatic that such a motion filed after the statutory appeal period has expired cannot be deemed to have been made within a reasonable time.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b861-7\">Notwithstanding his failure to obtain a waiver of the entry fee, Clark also failed to pay any portion of it. Thus, his \u201cappeal\u201d from the underlying adjudication of sexual dangerousness has never actually been docketed in this court. We do not rely on this procedural failing, however, given the more basic defect discussed <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b861-8\"><em>Hunt </em>was decided over two months before Clark filed his motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b861-9\">The Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure govern single justice proceedings. Mass.R.Civ.P. 1, as appearing in 423 Mass. 1404 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b862-7\">The record does not indicate when Clark\u2019s present counsel began representing him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b862-9\">As to Clark\u2019s due process rights in such circumstances, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cowie, </em>404 Mass. 119, 122-123 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b862-11\">Although not essential to our disposition on the instant facts, we make the following observations for future guidance in similar situations. First, it would have been well within the discretion of the single justice to reject even a timely-filed motion for reconsideration, based upon Clark\u2019s failure to submit the materials and arguments included in that motion (none of them in fact \u201cnewly discovered\u201d or otherwise previously unavailable) with his first motion, see <em>Bendetson </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Revere, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 615, 621 (1994); <em>Clamp-All Corp. </em>v. <em>Foresta, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 795, 808 (2002). Second, the arguments in Clark\u2019s motion for reconsideration were predicated on his asserted \u201cindigency,\u201d which status he never actually established and which appears to be contrary to the definitions of \u201cindigent\u201d and \u201cinmate\u201d in G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 27A (taken together with G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 29). Third, Clark\u2019s argument that G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 29(c), \u201climits\u201d the scope of the G. L. c. 261, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>\u00a7 29(a), to \u201cactions arising out of or resulting from a condition of or occurrence during confinement\u201d ignores the fact that \u00a7 29(c) is neither exclusionary nor comprehensive but merely \u201cincludes\u201d such actions and does not make the statutory scheme inapplicable to persons committed under G. L. c. 123A (who are expressly included in any event by virtue of the definition of \u201cinmate\u201d in G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 27A). Fourth, the constitutionality of the statutory provisions at issue has already been upheld in <em>Longval </em>v. <em>Superior Ct. Dept. of the Trial Ct., </em>434 Mass. 718, 721-723 (2001). Fifth, <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>360 U.S. 252, 257-258 (1959), relied on by Clark, is inapposite, because, inter alla, the required fee there actually deprived the defendant of access to the court (unlike Clark, who is financially able to cover the reduced entry fee). Finally, <em>Rinaldi </em>v. <em>Yeager, </em>384 U.S. 305, 308-311 (1966), also relied on by Clark, is similarly unavailing, because, unlike the New Jersey statute in <em>Rinaldi, </em>the challenged filing fee system here \u2014 modeled on the Federal Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, which has survived constitutional challenge \u2014 has a rational basis, given the dual legitimate legislative concerns (recognized in Longval!) of screening out frivolous claims without unconstitutionally burdening inmates\u2019 access to the courts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
