Kirschner, in response to a neighbor\u2019s complaint that fireworks were being detonated at the premises. During warrantless searches of both the back yard and the interior of the Kirschner residence, the officers found marijuana and evidence of the production of counterfeit driver\u2019s licenses. As a result, the officers applied for and obtained a search warrant, which led to the discovery of what appeared to be applications for counterfeit driver\u2019s licenses signed by the defendants Robert B. Bencal, Meghan E. Lucy, Lauren R. Kroesser, Steven H. MacGregor, and Marc Smith (codefendants).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">Kirschner and the codefendants were charged with making, procuring, or assisting another to make a counterfeit driver\u2019s license (G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24B), and with conspiracy to make or procure a counterfeit driver\u2019s license (G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 7). Kirschner also was charged with possession of marijuana (G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34) and procuring alcohol for a minor (G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 34). After a judge in the District Court denied the defendants\u2019 motions to suppress the evidence found by the police, the defendants were given leave to take this interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-9\">We conclude that the officers were not justified in entering Kirschner\u2019s back yard or the interior of his house. Thus, as to Kirschner, we reverse the denial of his motion to suppress. As to the codefendants, we affirm, concluding, as did the judge, that because they had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the area searched and were not charged as codefendants with Kirschner in a possessory offense, they were not entitled to challenge the officers\u2019 actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-10\">1. <em>Facts. </em>We take the facts from the judge\u2019s findings, supplemented by uncontradicted testimony of the officers, whom the judge explicitly credited. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alvarado, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>423 Mass. 266, 268 n.2 (1996); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>430 Mass. 725, 726 n.5 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">On July 4, 2004, at approximately 3:00 a.m., Hamilton police Officers Stephen Walsh and Michael Wetson were dispatched to 19 Boardman Lane, to respond to a neighbor\u2019s complaint that fireworks were being set off at that address. When the officers arrived, the house \u2014 a large residence, set back and surrounded by woods \u2014 was dark and still, except that part of the driveway was illuminated by the light of the open garage, where many empty alcohol containers were visible.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">As Walsh drove up the driveway, he saw Kirschner jump behind a tree, but when Walsh stepped out of his vehicle, Kirschner came out and spoke with him. hi response to Walsh\u2019s inquiries, Kirschner stated that \u201cunwanted guests\u201d had been setting off fireworks, but that these individuals had disappeared, after initially refusing a request that they leave. Kirschner explained that the reason he was outside was to scare them off. He also stated that he knew one of the \u201cunwanted guests\u201d and identified the street where that person lived.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">Walsh then asked Kirschner to provide identification. With the officers\u2019 permission, Kirschner entered the house to retrieve it, but declined to permit the officers to accompany him. Walsh and Wetson waited outside for about five minutes, during which time they requested the assistance of Wenham police Officer William Foley,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> who arrived shortly thereafter. Wetson checked the registration of the nine cars parked in the driveway and found that all of them were registered to individuals over the age of twenty-one.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">When Kirschner returned, he presented his driver\u2019s license, which indicated that his age was twenty-one. He identified himself as a resident of the house and the son of the homeowner, who was in Maine for the weekend. Kirschner told the officers that there were six or seven invited guests inside the house, whom he declined to name, but who did not include the now departed \u201cunwanted guests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">Walsh decided that they should check the perimeter of the house to see if the \u201cunwanted guests\u201d were still around. Without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>objection from Kirschner, Walsh circled the house to the right, and Foley went around to the left. Because he thought that Kir-schner\u2019s behavior had been \u201cunusual,\u201d Wetson kept Kirschner outside with him \u201cfor the safety of the officers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">Using a flashlight, Foley walked to the rear of the house, calling out \u201cHamilton police.\u201d There was no response and no noise from inside or outside the house. From a distance of five yards away, Foley saw a glass-topped table on an outside deck. On the table were beer bottles, a \u201croach,\u201d and a small quantity of green leaves, stems, and seeds, which Foley judged to be marijuana. Foley also looked through an open door leading from the deck to the kitchen and observed a very large amount of liquor and beer. The officers then returned to the front of the house and questioned Kirschner, eventually arresting him for possession of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">After placing Kirschner under arrest, the officers decided that since Kirschner would be taken away, his guests should be located and removed from the premises. The officers\u2019 objectives were to secure what appeared to be an expensive home and to check on the well-being of the occupants in light of the large number of alcohol containers and the marijuana remains. The officers then entered the house \u2014 Walsh and Foley going through the door on the deck, and Wetson going through the garage. The officers knocked on the doors of rooms and called out, \u201cHamilton police.\u201d No one answered, but eventually, the police found seven individuals, all of whom were sleeping. They also found and seized additional evidence of marijuana use in the vicinity of two of the guests. The officers roused all of the guests and gathered them in the living room. All but one were twenty-one or older.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">The police remained in Kirschner\u2019s home for at least one hour and forty-five minutes after assembling the guests in the living room. Each guest was brought into a bathroom to be patted down and questioned, and all of them were checked for outstanding warrants. A fourth police officer arrived on the scene and administered alcohol breath testing. Of the seven guests, two were arrested for possession of marijuana, and two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>were placed in protective custody. The remaining three were determined not to be impaired and were made to leave.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">While the guests were being questioned, Wetson went from room to room, looking for additional people. Eventually, he made his way into Kirschner\u2019s bedroom where, in a desk drawer that had been left open, he saw two driver\u2019s licenses. Wetson picked up the licenses and examined them, taking them with him when he left the room. After determining that the licenses did not match any of the guests, Wetson \u201ccalled in\u201d the names on the licenses. He learned that one name was not in the system, and the other was two years younger than the license indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">Once the occupants were removed, Walsh, on the basis of the officers\u2019 discoveries, applied for and was granted a warrant to search the Kirschner residence for drugs, drug paraphernalia, and equipment and materials for making false identifications. Walsh and other officers executed the warrant and seized various items, including documents alleged by the Commonwealth to be applications for counterfeit licenses bearing the signatures of the codefendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">2. <em>Kirschner. </em>In reviewing the disposition of a motion to suppress, \u201cwe accept the motion judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sinforoso, </em>434 Mass. 320, 321 (2001), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanna, </em>424 Mass. 92, 97 (1997), but independently review the application of constitutional principles to the facts found. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>James, 421 </em>Mass. 312, 314 (1998). We are mindful that \u201c[t]he right of police officers to enter into a home, for whatever purpose, represents a serious governmental intrusion into one\u2019s privacy.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Molina, </em>439 Mass. 206, 209 (2003), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marquez, </em>434 Mass. 370, 374 (2001). Thus, warrantless entries into a home \u201care per se unreasonable unless they fall within one of the few narrowly drawn exceptions to the . . . warrant requirements [of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amaral, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 230, 233 (1983), citing <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 357 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">The Commonwealth does not dispute that the back yard and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>outside deck, which were shielded by trees and not visible from the street, were within the curtilage of the house and thus \u201csubject to the same protection as the home itself.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Straw, </em>422 Mass. 756, 761 (1996), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Straw, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 738, 746-747 (1995) (Laurence, J., dissenting). We therefore begin by considering whether any of the narrow exceptions to the warrant requirement permitted the police to enter the back yard.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Without reference to any specific exception, the judge concluded that, because the police had responded to a call of fireworks exploding at Kirschner\u2019s home and had been told that \u201cunwanted guests\u201d had set them off, \u201c[i]t was reasonable . . . for the officers to follow up on this report by circumnavigating the house to see whether these \u2018unwanted guests\u2019 were still on the property or its environs.\u201d The Commonwealth contends that the judge\u2019s ruling was properly grounded either in the \u201cemergency\u201d doctrine or in the \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d doctrine. We conclude, however, that neither of these exceptions to the warrant requirement is applicable in the circumstances.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">The emergency exception \u201capplies when the purpose of the police entry is not to gather evidence of criminal activity but rather, because of an emergency, to respond to an immediate need for assistance for the protection of Ufe or property. . . . For the exception to apply, the burden of proof is on the Commonwealth to show that the warrantless entry falls within the exception and that there were reasonable grounds for the . . . police to believe (an objective standard) that an emergency existed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snell, </em>428 Mass. 766, 774-775 (1999), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bates, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 217, 219-220 (1990). The injury sought to be avoided must be immediate and serious, and the mere existence of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>potentially harmful circumstance is not sufficient. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 719, 721 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Here, by the time the police arrived, no fireworks were being detonated, and according to Kirschner, the persons responsible were gone. Moreover, even granting that the setting off of fireworks is an activity that carries some degree of danger, the situation faced by the police did not rise to the level of an emergency.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">The Commonwealth argues that its position is supported by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marchione, </em>384 Mass. 8 (1981); however, that case is readily distinguishable. In <em>Marchione, </em>warrantless entry into a building was deemed justified under the emergency doctrine where the cellar floor was covered with a volatile liquid, and forty gallons of an explosive liquid were being stored in partially open containers in proximity to a homemade incendiary device and an oil burner. Thus, the state of affairs encountered by the police in that case \u201cquite clearly presented an emergency situation requiring immediate action for the protection of fife and property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">By comparison, any danger to person or property that may have been created by the detonation of fireworks in Kirschner\u2019s yard was of far less magnitude, and by the time the police arrived, the danger, such as it was, no longer was operative. Furthermore, even if the officers reasonably believed that the persons responsible might still be on the premises or in the adjacent woods, the possibility that they would resume their activity after having been chased away was too speculative and remote to justify the intrusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">In any event, as the officers explained and the judge found, the police entered the back yard \u201cto see if those responsible were still around.\u201d Thus, their actions were of an investigatory character and are more appropriately analyzed under the \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d exception to the warrant requirement, rather than the emergency doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">A warrantless search for investigatory purposes is justified when \u201c[pjrobable cause and exigent circumstances . . . coalesce.\u201d Grasso &amp; McEvoy, Suppression Matters Under Massachusetts Law \u00a7 14-(1)(a), at 14-1 (2004). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>439 Mass. 616, 619 (2003). However, more than a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>minor crime must be involved to justify the warrantless intrusion into a private residence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiGeronimo, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 714, 728-729 (1995) (no justification for police entry into private residence of suspected drunk driver who had recently caused accident); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kiser, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 647, 651 (2000) (no justification for police entry into apartment in response to complaint that loud music was being played).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">In this case, the officers had probable cause to believe only that a misdemeanor had been committed. See G. L. c. 148, \u00a7 39.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For that reason, if no other, we conclude that the police entry into the back yard to look for the persons who had set off the fireworks was not justified under the exigent circumstances doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">It follows that, because the officers were not lawfully in the back yard, the marijuana seized from the deck must be suppressed. In addition, as to Kirschner, the evidence later discovered by the police inside the house must be suppressed as \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d See <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 488 (1963); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pietrass, </em>392 Mass. 892, 900-901 (1984).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">We observe, however, that even if the officers\u2019 entry into the house is analyzed independently, there was no justification for it. The judge concluded that the officers were entitled to enter the house under the emergency exception<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to the warrant requirement, reasoning that it would have been irresponsible to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>leave the house without clearing it of its occupants and securing it, and that the presence of illegal drugs and evidence of heavy drinking raised the possibility that one or more of the occupants was in medical distress. We think, however, that where Kirschner had informed the police that everyone inside the house was an invited guest, the interior of the house was entirely dark and quiet, and there was no indication that anyone was in acute medical distress, the police had no reasonable basis to believe that there was imminent and serious danger to persons or property requiring immediate action. <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. at 721.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">3. <em>Codefendants. </em>We agree with the judge that the codefendants may not contest the seizure of documents and other materials found in Kirschner\u2019s home. \u201cFourth Amendment rights are personal rights which, like some other constitutional rights, may not be vicariously asserted.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montes, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 789, 793-794 (2000), quoting from <em>Rakas </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>439 U.S. 128, 133-134 (1978). \u201cThe touchstone of rights under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, like those under art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, is a \u2018reasonable expectation of privacy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>429 Mass. 511, 513 (1999), quoting from <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 360 (1967) (overnight guest may have reasonable expectation of privacy in host\u2019s home).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">The codefendants were not among Kirschner\u2019s overnight guests, and they do not assert any expectation of privacy in the dwelling. Nor are they charged as codefendants with Kirschner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>in a possessory offense such that they would be relieved of the burden of showing an expectation of privacy. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Frazier, 410 Mass. 235, 241-246 (1991).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the foregoing reasons, as to the defendant Kirschner, the order denying the motion to suppress is reversed. As to the defendants Bencal, Lucy, Kroesser, MacGregor, and Smith, the order denying the motion to suppress is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b866-10\">Foley was acting under a mutual aid agreement. See G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 8G.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b868-9\">None of the guests is a codefendant in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b869-7\">The Commonwealth also argues that Kirschner implicitly consented to the officers\u2019 entry into the back yard because, in contrast to his refusal to allow them to accompany him into the house when he went to get his identification, he was silent when the officers decided to enter the back yard. We reject this argument, not only because the judge does not appear to have accepted it (he made no explicit findings as to consent), but also because the subsidiary facts found, even when viewed together with the officers\u2019 testimony, do not suffice to establish unambiguous, actual consent and voluntariness. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>444 Mass. 234, 239-244 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b871-8\">Pursuant to this section, the possession, control, use, or explosion of fireworks is prohibited and punishable by a fine of not less than ten dollars nor more than one hundred dollars.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b871-9\">The Commonwealth also argues for the first time on appeal that the police had probable cause to believe that additional evidence of drug activity would be found within the house, and that the possible destruction of such evidence created an exigency permitting the warrantless entry. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dejesus, supra </em>at 619-620. Because the marijuana on the deck was illegally observed and seized, it provided no legitimate basis for entry into the house. In any event, we see no good reason to consider this new argument on appeal. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bettencourt, </em>447 Mass. 631, 633-634 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b871-10\">The judge also characterized the entry as an exercise of law enforcement\u2019s \u201ccommunity caretaking\u201d function, citing to cases in which police officers have been permitted to check on the well-being of parked motorists. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>422 Mass. 504, 508-509, cert. denied, 519 U.S. 877 (1996); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>436 Mass. 369, 372-373 (2002). This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>line of cases is not apt, however. Absent a true emergency \u2014 involving imminent, serious danger \u2014 there is no justification for the warrantless entry into a residence to check on the persons inside. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiGeronimo, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. at 724-729; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. at 721. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sondrini, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 704, 706 n.3 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b872-13\">Even if some degree of concern about leaving the house and the guests was valid, the officers had other options short of making a warrantless entry. They could have asked Kirschner, an adult resident, whether he wanted their assistance in arranging for his guests to leave; they could have sought to contact Kirschner\u2019s father to ascertain what his wishes were; and they could have attempted to speak to the people inside the house by knocking or ringing the doorbell or rousing them by telephone.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b873-7\">The concept of \u201ctarget standing,\u201d upon which the codefendants rely, is inapplicable. \u201cTarget standing,\u201d which has been discussed but not adopted in the Commonwealth, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scardamaglia, </em>410 Mass. 375, 377-380 (1991), allows a defendant to contest the search of someone else\u2019s residence upon a showing that the police deliberately violated the resident\u2019s rights in order to obtain evidence against the defendant. That is not the case here. Moreover, even if the codefendants were granted standing, they would not be relieved of showing that they had a reasonable expectation of privacy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
