L. c. 66, \u00a7 10. In each case, the plaintiff requested disclosure of a limited subset of information that the Department of Industrial Accidents (depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>ment) collects from employers and maintains in its so-called \u201cfirst reports of injury\u201d (first reports). The department responded affirmatively to the requests but indicated that it would redact the names and addresses of injured workers from documents responsive to the requests. After the supervisor of public records (supervisor of records) indicated his agreement with the department\u2019s position, the plaintiffs brought separate actions, which were later consolidated. On cross motions for judgment on the pleadings, the judge concluded that the first reports were public records within the meaning of G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth, and that, because disclosure of the requested names and addresses contained in such records would not constitute an invasion of personal privacy, the names and addresses were not exempt from disclosure under G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (c) (exemption [c]). The department appeals from the judgments requiring it to disclose the requested information.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\"><em>Background. </em>Under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 6, inserted by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 18, employers must promptly notify the department \u201cof any injury alleged to have arisen out of and in the course of employment which incapacitates an employee from earning full wages for a period of five or more calendar days.\u201d This notice, which is to be given on a prescribed form entitled \u201cEmployer\u2019s First Report of Injury or Fatality,\u201d must \u201ccontain the name and nature of the business of the employer, the name, age, sex, and occupation of the injured employee, and the date, nature, circumstances and cause of the injury and such additional information as the division shall prescribe.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The employer must also provide this notice to its workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and to the affected employee. <em>Ibid. </em>The department maintains the first reports, as well as a computer database with statistical summaries, as required by G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The record reflects that, for a number of years prior to 2003, the plaintiffs, each of whom is an attorney practicing in the Commonwealth, had regularly requested, pursuant to G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10, that the department provide certain limited information from the first reports, specifically: the employee\u2019s name and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>address; the date of injury; the employer\u2019s name and address; and the workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier. The department had complied with these requests, providing a computer printout containing only the requested information. Beginning in April, 2003, however, the department took the position that the employees\u2019 names and addresses were exempt from disclosure under G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (c), the privacy exemption to the public records statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Both plaintiffs appealed the department\u2019s response to their public records request to the supervisor of records pursuant to G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10(\u00bf&gt;). The supervisor of records then determined that the \u201cresponsive names and addresses of the injured employees may properly be redacted from the record prior to disclosure\u201d under the second clause of exemption (c), which is intended to protect \u201cintimate details of a highly personal nature.\u201d According to the supervisor of records, because \u201c[t]he records in question disclose the names and addresses of employees who have suffered bodily injury and have applied for assistance under the Workers Compensation Law,\u201d the names and addresses are \u201cpersonal information in which the employee has a legitimate privacy interest[,] . . . information that is not normally shared with members of the general public. Disclosure ... as recipients of workers compensation benefits could have adverse effects on these individuals. The public interest ... is minimal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The plaintiffs brought separate complaints for declaratory and injunctive relief in Superior Court, which were later consolidated; thereafter, the judge heard cross motions for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(c), 365 Mass. 756 (1974).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Acting on this spare material, which she viewed as producing no dispute over material fact and as framing only issues of law, the judge concluded that the workers\u2019 names and addresses, even when associated with the fact of workplace <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>injury, are not \u201cintimate details of a highly personal nature\u201d and disclosure thereof would not constitute an invasion of privacy. Given this, the judge thought it unnecessary to address the interest of the public in disclosure and did not engage in balancing such an interest against any claimed invasion of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">On appeal, the department claims error in the judge\u2019s application of exemption (c) to the public records statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\"><em>Analysis. </em>We begin by noting that G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10, the public records statute, was enacted \u201cto give the public broad access to government documents.\u201d <em>Harvard Crimson, Inc. </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, Inc., </em>445 Mass. 745, 749 (2006). Documents such as the first reports, held by agencies such as the department, are presumed to be public records unless the department can prove with specificity that the documents or parts of the documents fall within one of the fifteen enumerated statutory exemptions. See <em>Matter of a Subpoena Duces Tecum, </em>445 Mass. 685, 687-688 (2006). See also <em>Bougas </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Lexington, </em>371 Mass. 59, 61 (1976). In a court proceeding to enforce compliance with the request of any person to inspect or copy a public record, \u201cthere shall be a presumption that the record sought is public, and the burden shall be upon the custodian to prove with specificity the exemption which applies.\u201d G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10(c), inserted by St. 1973, c. 1050, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>The department maintains that, at least to the extent that the first reports contain employee names and addresses, they are not public records because they are exempt under the second clause of exemption <em>(c). </em>This clause exempts from the expansive statutory definition of \u201cpublic record\u201d those \u201cmaterials or data relating to a specifically named individual, the disclosure of which may constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy.\u201d G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (c), as amended by St. 1977, c. 961, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">In determining whether this exemption applies, two considerations are pertinent. First, \u201c[g]iven the statutory presumption in favor of disclosure, exemptions must be strictly construed.\u201d <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Assistant Commr. of the Real Property Dept. of Boston, </em>380 Mass. 623, 625 (1980). See <em>Worcester Telegram &amp; Gazette Corp. </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Worcester, </em>436 Mass. 378, 383 (2002). At the same time, we must bear in mind that the public records statute \u201cshould not be used as a means of disregarding the considered judgment of the Legislature that the public right of access should be restricted in certain circumstances.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>388 Mass. 427, 436 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Second, the relevant clause of exemption (c) was amended in 1977 to modify the word \u201cprivacy\u201d by adding before it the word \u201cunwarranted.\u201d This amendment \u201cin essence broadened the range of information that might be available as public records.\u201d <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>391 Mass. 1, 7 (1984). See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Collector of Lynn, </em>377 Mass. 151, 156 n.4 (1979) (amendment \u201cincreases the burden on the party relying on exemption [c] to resist disclosure\u201d); <em>Pottle </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Braintree, </em>395 Mass. 861, 864 n.5 (1985) (amendment \u201cnarrows the scope of information which may be exempted\u201d from disclosure). In this regard, however, \u201c[t]he word \u2018unwarranted\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">. . . particularly suggests a . . . balancing of the public\u2019s right to know as reflected in the Commonwealth\u2019s public records law, and the individual\u2019s right to protection against an unwarranted intrusion into his privacy. The exemption of subclause (c) appears to be the only exemption in the definition of \u2018public records\u2019 calling for a balancing of interests rather than for an objective determination of fact.\u201d <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., supra </em>at 9. Accordingly, analysis of the applicability of the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>clause of exemption (c) <em>requires </em>a balancing between the seriousness of any invasion of privacy that may exist and the public\u2019s right to know. See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Collector of Lynn, supra </em>at 156 (\u201cWhere the public interest in obtaining information substantially outweighs the seriousness of any invasion of privacy, the private interest in preventing disclosure must yield to the public interest\u201d). See also <em>Hastings &amp; Sons Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>City Treasurer of Lynn, </em>374 Mass. 812, 818-819 (1978); <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Assistant Commr. of the Real Property Dept. of Boston, </em>380 Mass. at 625.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The motion judge determined that there - was no privacy interest whatsoever implicated in the disclosure of the injured employees\u2019 names and addresses and hence no need to engage in the aforesaid balancing. She used as her primary touchstone the inquiry whether such information constitutes \u201cintimate details of a highly personal nature.\u201d Concluding that the subject information is not comparable to matters that have been determined to fall into that category, <em>id. </em>at 626 n.2 (marital status, legitimacy of children, identity of fathers of children, medical condition, welfare payments, alcohol consumption, family fights, and reputation), the judge determined that disclosure of injured employees\u2019 names and addresses would not be an invasion of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The judge correctly observed that Massachusetts courts have generally concluded that names and home addresses are not inherently private or personal in nature. See, most recently, <em>Cape Cod Times </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Barnstable County, </em>443 Mass. 587, 595 (2005) (names and addresses of adults are not intimate details of a highly personal nature). See also <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Collector of Lynn, </em>377 Mass. at 157-158 (disclosure of names and addresses of tax delinquents, though involving some embarrassment and invasion of personal privacy, does not implicate intimate details of a highly personal nature and seriousness of any invasion of privacy diminished since same information available from other sources); <em>Pottle </em>v. <em>School Comm, of Braintree, </em>395 Mass. at 862 (names, addresses, and job classification of municipal school teachers not exempt under [c]); <em>Brogan </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Westport, </em>401 Mass. 306, 308-309 (1987) (names and absentee records of school committee employees along with dates and generic classification, i.e., \u201csick day,\u201d \u201cpersonal day,\u201d are public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>records subject to mandatory disclosure). She also observed \u2014 apparently on the basis of case law rather than the record before her \u2014 that the names and addresses of the injured employees are available from other sources.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition, she discounted the potential embarrassment or stigma that might attend disclosure of the names and addresses of injured employees as thereby having a known disability. The judge took the view that the generality of the information \u2014 that an \u201cinjury\u201d occurred \u2014 rendered any such adverse consequences highly unlikely.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Whether a privacy interest is implicated in these circumstances requires a somewhat more nuanced examination. While disclosure of the names and addresses of adults does not, per se, establish an invasion of privacy, see <em>Federal Labor Relations Authy. </em>v. <em>United States Dept. of the Navy, </em>941 F.2d 49, 55-56 (1st Cir. 1991), and cases cited, we are mindful of the observation in <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>391 Mass. at 9, that \u201cthe same information about a person, such as his name and address, might be protected against disclosure as an unwarranted invasion of privacy in one context and not in another.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In holding that the names and addresses of Federal employees could not be disclosed to labor unions, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit noted that, while there is a \u201crelatively modest privacy interest . . . assigned to individuals\u2019 bare names and home addresses[,] ... on the other side of the scales, ... a discemable interest exists in the ability to retreat to the seclusion of one\u2019s home and to avoid enforced disclosure of one\u2019s address. While of modest strength, this interest is nonetheless real enough to be worthy of recognition and protection in appropriate circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>stances.\u201d <em>Federal Labor Relations Authy. </em>v. <em>United States Dept. of the Navy, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Here, more than just the employees\u2019 names and addresses would be disclosed \u2014 also disclosed, of necessity, would be the fact that the identified employees are sufficiently disabled to be out of work five or more days. It is, of course, to be expected that lists or compilations of names and addresses will be made or kept for a reason rather than on a random basis, and that they will thus be delimited by what the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has termed a \u201cdefining characteristic.\u201d \u201cThe extent of any invasion of privacy . . . depends upon the nature of the defining characteristics, i.e., whether it is significant that an individual possess them.\u201d <em>National Assn. of Retired Fed. Employees </em>v. <em>Horner, </em>879 F.2d 873, 876 (D.C. Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1078 (1990). See <em>Wine Hobby USA, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States Int. Rev. Serv., </em>502 F.2d 133, 137 (3d Cir. 1974) (prohibiting disclosure of names and addresses of persons registered with United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms to produce wine for family use); <em>Minnis </em>v. <em>United States Dept. of Agric., </em>737 F.2d 784, 786-787 (9th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1053 (1985) (withholding names and addresses of applicants for permits to travel on particular river); <em>Aronson </em>v. <em>United States Dept. of Hous. &amp; Urban Dev., </em>822 F.2d 182, 186-187 (1st Cir. 1987) (withholding names and addresses of individuals entitled to financial reimbursement). The aggregate effect of information, in addition to names and addresses, may intensify the invasion of privacy and weigh against disclosure. See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles, 26 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 415, 425-426 (1988). It would be unsurprising if at least some of the affected employees were to perceive as personally intrusive the prospect of being identified to third parties as injured, disabled, or even as the out-of-work recipients of government benefits. This is particularly so in an era where \u201cmodem data processing technology . . . permits \u2018the aggregation of pieces of personal information into large central data banks.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 421-422, quoting from Special Legislative Commission on Privacy, First Interim Report, 1975 House Doc. No. 5417, at 10, 15 &amp; 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The affected employees here are not public employees who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>\u201chave a diminished expectation of privacy in matters concerning their employment.\u201d <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>388 Mass. at 436 n.15.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Their names and addresses, conjoined with their known disabled status, are not information that they had any part in forwarding to the department \u2014 their employers instead being statutorily required to do so. Compare <em>Cape Cod Times </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Barnstable County, </em>443 Mass. at 589-590, where deputy sheriffs whose names and addresses were disclosed as public record information had voluntarily applied for the position. Moreover, the subject information is not in the department\u2019s database because of any failure on the affected employees\u2019 part to comply with legal obligations. Compare <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Collector of Lynn, </em>377 Mass. at 157. Instead, the information sought here was provided by a third party, the employer, pursuant to a remedial statutory scheme enacted to protect injured employees. See Nason, Koziol &amp; Wall, Workers\u2019 Compensation \u00a7 1.1 (3d ed. 2003). We think such information is more akin to that provided to a State agency in connection with obtaining government benefits. See <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>391 Mass, at 8 (\u201cDisclosure of information provided to [a State agency] in connection with obtaining government . . . benefits would normally be regarded as an invasion of privacy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Finally, while the requested information does not fall within the first clause of exemption (c) (exempting medical and personnel files), we discern at least a distant kinship to that clause notwithstanding the generality of the subject information as to the employees\u2019 disability. See <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>388 Mass. at 430-438 (even cursory medical information regarding former employees seeking disability pension, such as \u201cbad back, heart problem, hypertension,\u201d exempt from mandatory disclosure when related to identifiable individual). See also <em>Brogan </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Westport, </em>401 Mass. at 309 (\u201cInformation as to a named individual\u2019s medical condition inherently is \u2018of a personal nature\u2019 in a way that the fact that a named teacher took a \u2018sick day\u2019 or a \u2018personal day\u2019 on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>a certain date is not\u201d); <em>Viriyahiranpaiboon </em>v. <em>Department of State Police, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 843, 848 (2001) (\u201cmedical information need not concern intimate details of a highly personal nature to bar disclosure\u201d). The information requested here seems to us to fall somewhere between the classification of absences in <em>Brogan </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Westport, supra, </em>on the one hand, and the medical files in <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., supra </em>at 430, on the other: while identification of injured workers as incapacitated for five days or more is more informative as to any medical condition than that they took a sick day, it is less informative than the cursory medical statements relied upon to grant disability pensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">In view of the foregoing, we are satisfied that the judge erred in concluding that no privacy interest whatsoever would be implicated in the disclosure of the requested information. It follows from this that the judge was required to but did not balance that invasion of privacy \u2014 whatever its extent may be \u2014 with such public interest as might be furthered by disclosure. The matter, however, was before the judge on cross motions for judgment on the pleadings. From our examination of the record, it is plain that all that was before the judge on the latter point was contained in the attachments to Ellis\u2019s complaint and referred to in the allegations of paragraph 8 of that complaint.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The department denied the factual allegations of paragraph 8. Neither party offered any evidentiary submissions, there was no statement of agreed facts, and it cannot be said either that the matter was converted into cross motions for summary judgment or that the facts pertinent to the balancing test are undisputed. Putting to one side whether the matter was even in a procedural posture that would have allowed the motion judge to undertake the necessary balancing, we think it improvident in these circumstances to undertake the balancing test analysis ourselves at this juncture. The record, in any event, is simply too thin, the facts too undeveloped, for this to be fruitful in any respect. See, e.g., <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Assistant Commr. of the Real Property Dept. of Boston, </em>380 Mass. at 626-628; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Registrar of Motor </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number><em>Vehicles, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. at 429. Accordingly, we vacate the judgments and remand the cases for such further proceedings as are not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Within fourteen days of the insurer\u2019s receipt of its insured\u2019s first report, it must either begin paying the injured employee weekly benefits or give notice of its refusal to do so. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 7(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b458-7\">It appears from the record on appeal that all that was before the judge in connection with these motions were the complaints, answers, and legal memoranda. Georgiou\u2019s complaint incorporated his March 24, 2003, public records request to the department while Ellis\u2019s complaint incorporated three attachments: his May 12, 2003, public records request and the department\u2019s May 20, 2003, response thereto; his May 29, 2003, appeal to the supervisor of records; and the supervisor\u2019s July 10, 2003, administrative order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b459-7\">The department also claims error in the judge\u2019s purported failure to take into consideration restrictions placed on agency disclosure of personal identifying information by virtue of the Fair Information Practices Act, G. L. c. 66A, \u00a7 2(c) (FIFA). We observe in this regard that the department does not appear to have brought this point specifically to the motion judge\u2019s attention. The record appendix contains no such reference. The legal memoranda before the motion judge that were fortuitously appended to one of the defendants\u2019 appellate briefs suggests that the department only cited to case law that discussed FIFA along with the State public records statute; the department had neither indicated its reliance on FIFA itself nor based any legal argument on restrictions placed on the department by virtue of FIFA. The only basis on which the department ever resisted disclosure was G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth. This case, accordingly, arose under the State public records statute, unlike <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>391 Mass. 1 (1984), and <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 415 (1988), which, as well as Celia, Administrative Law &amp; Practice \u00a7 1187 (1986 &amp; Supp. 2006), provide useful discussions of the occasions where the disclosure requirements of the public records statute may appear to conflict with the nondisclosure requirements of FIFA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b462-6\">We see nothing in the submissions before the motion judge to support this.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b462-7\">In general, G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth, is patterned after the Federal Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b) (1976). <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>388 Mass. at 433, n.11. <em>Wakefield Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Wakefield, </em>431 Mass. 792, 796 (2000). Unlike G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (c), however, the Federal statute does not contain two distinct clauses. Under our statute, medical and personnel records are absolutely exempt under the first clause of exemption <em>(c), Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., supra </em>at 431-438, while the second clause requires balancing the invasion of privacy with the public interest. <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Collector of Lynn, </em>377 Mass. at 156 &amp; n.4. Under the Federal statute, medical and personnel records are not absolutely exempt but are subject to the balancing test. As to the second clause of exemption (c), then, we may look not only to our cases but to Federal case law for guidance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b464-6\">In a 1977 opinion, the Attorney General advised the department that \u201cdisclosure of personal information concerning an employee\u2019s name and home address ... is information in which the employee has a legitimate privacy interest.\u201d Rep.
