We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\"><em>Facts. </em>We summarize the facts found by the motion judge and supplemented by the undisputed testimony.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the evening of April 28, 2004, Officer Felipe Colon and Detective James Freeman of the Boston drug control unit were in plain clothes and driving in an unmarked passenger van in the Dorchester section of Boston gathering intelligence in response to numerous complaints of drug activity in the area. As they drove down Bird Street, they observed a group of about five males, who appeared to be of high school age, gathered around an illegally parked car. Some of the youths were at the vehicle\u2019s window talking with those inside. Upon making eye contact with the officers, the group of males began to walk away from the direction of the van.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These activities aroused the officers\u2019 suspicions \u2014 Officer Colon testified that he believed that a drug transac-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>tian was about to take place \u2014 and they wanted to get a better view. Officer Colon and Detective Freemen circled the block so as to encounter the group face-to-face.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">As the group got closer to the officers, Officer Colon noticed that the defendant was walking with his right hand clenching something on his right hip and his right elbow close to his waist, and that he was \u201cwalking funny\u201d \u2014 limping and favoring his right leg.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At this point, Officer Colon exited the van, acting as if he were saying goodbye to Detective Freeman so as to avoid scaring the youths away before he had a chance to approach and speak to them. On reaching the group, Officer Colon displayed his badge and said, \u201c[H]ang on a second; Boston Police, can I talk to you?\u201d We quote directly from the judge\u2019s ruling for the following facts: \u201c[The defendant] stopped, looked at [Ojfficer Colon, then took his right hand from his hip and took a step backwards. Subsequently [the defendant] placed his right hand into the right side of the waistband of his pants.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At this time, [Ojfficer Colon attempted to control [the defendant\u2019s] movement of his right hand. A search of [the defendant] by [0]fficer Colon revealed a .22 caliber rifle.\u201d The defendant was then placed under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>The motion judge identified as the primary issue whether \u201cthe officers had an objectively reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, based on specific and articulable facts [,] to justify pursuit.\u201d He concluded that Officer Colon conducted an unconstitutional stop of the defendant when he left the van and approached the defendant and the group in order to question them, and that \u201cthe only facts that the police had to support reasonable suspicion were: (1) a high crime area; (2) the defendant[] making eye contact and walking away; (3) and [the defendant] limping.\u201d On this basis, the judge further concluded that the defendant \u201cplacing] his right hand into the right side of the waistband of his pants cannot be used in the reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>suspicion analysis because reasonable suspicion must exist <em>before </em>the stop is made\u201d (emphasis original).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">When reviewing a judge\u2019s determination on a motion to suppress, \u201cwe accept the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error \u2018but conduct an independent review of his ultimate findings and conclusions of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>440 Mass. 642, 646 (2004), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jimenez, </em>438 Mass. 213, 218 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">A person is \u201cseized\u201d or \u201cstopped\u201d in the constitutional sense only if, in view of all the attending circumstances, \u201ca reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rock, </em>429 Mass. 609, 611 (1999), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borges, </em>395 Mass. 788, 791 (1985). Not every field encounter between a police officer and a member of the public constitutes \u201can intrusion of constitutional dimensions requiring justification.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rock, supra, </em>quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stoute, </em>422 Mass. 782, 789 (1996). \u201c[O]fficers may make inquiry of anyone they wish . . . , so long as they do not implicitly or explicitly assert that the person inquired of is not free to ignore their inquiries.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DePeiza, </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 401, further appellate review granted, 447 Mass. 1105 (2006), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murdough, </em>428 Mass. 760, 763 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">Officer Colon\u2019s initial actions \u2014 driving the van around the block so as to encounter the youths face-to-face after they had walked away from the van, exiting the van, approaching the group, identifying himself as a police officer, and saying \u201chang on a second . . . can I talk to you?\u201d \u2014 did not constitute a stop under either the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution or art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. At no point, as they circled the block and approached the group, did the police \u201cemploy the talismans of blue lights, flashers, or sirens,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DePeiza, supra </em>at 402, nor did their initial actions \u201cblock or control [the defendant\u2019s] path, direction, or speed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grandison, </em>433 Mass. 135, 138 (2001), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>430 Mass. 725, 731 (2000). Because Officer Colon\u2019s statement was not a command to stop but a request to speak with the defendant and ask questions, it lacked the compulsory dimen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>sion that would thereby transform the encounter into a seizure. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barros, </em>435 Mass. 171, 174-175 (2001). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fraser, </em>410 Mass. 541, 543 (1991) (police officer did not seize defendant \u201cby approaching him, identifying himself as a police officer, and asking him to take his hands out of his pockets\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rock, supra </em>at 612 (\u201cApproaching in an unmarked cruiser, leaving the cruiser, and requesting to speak with a citizen, without more, does not constitute a seizure\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mulero, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 963, 964 (1995) (no seizure during initial inquiry of defendant by police officer regarding gun charges in absence of display of authority); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 930, 931 (1998) (fact that unmarked police vehicle backed up in direction of defendant did not amount to stop, nor did officer\u2019s subsequent self-identification). In the absence of seizure, there is no need for the police to justify their conduct by showing a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harkess, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 626, 629 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">This does not end our inquiry, however, because we conclude that a stop of the defendant did occur under art. 14 when Officer Colon grabbed the defendant\u2019s hands as the defendant reached toward, and perhaps into, his waistband.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> By this restraint of the defendant\u2019s hand movements the officer displayed a show of authority that would have communicated to a reasonable person that he or she was not free to leave. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pimentel, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 557, 560 (1989) (physical touching of citizen by police officer may be indicative of seizure). Having concluded that the defendant was seized when the officer grabbed his hands, we must determine whether the officer\u2019s stop and contemporaneous patfnsk were justified by reasonable suspicion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">A police officer may stop and frisk an individual for the of-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>fleer\u2019s own safety and the safety of others if the circumstances reasonably suggest that the person is armed and potentially dangerous. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pagan, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 780, 782-783 (2005). In our review of the propriety of such a search, we apply an objective standard of reasonableness and look to the totality of the circumstances, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Patti, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 440, 443 (1991); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 311, 314 (1992), keeping in mind that \u201c[wjhile one factor by itself may appear innocent. . . and, therefore, insufficient to support a frisk, taken in combination with other factors, there may be the requisite reasonable apprehension about safety or a crime having been committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 314-315.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The facts of this case are, in some respects, similar to those in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DePeiza, </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. at 398-401, where we concluded that the stop and search of the defendant, who was walking rigidly, favoring one side, was not justified. We stated in <em>DePeiza </em>that \u201can individual\u2019s manner of walking,\u201d even late at night in a high crime area, was too idiosyncratic to serve as a reasonable basis for a stop and frisk. <em>Id. </em>at 404. We concluded, however, that the presence of some other factor, such as an officer\u2019s knowledge of the defendant\u2019s criminal past, a report of shots fired, or a furtive movement made by the defendant prior to the stop and search, might have provided justification for the stop and search of the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 402-405. In <em>DePeiza, </em>unlike in this case, the defendant \u201cnever made a movement to his jacket pocket or his waistband, factors that in other contexts have given rise to a reasonable apprehension of danger.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 405. \u201cStrange, furtive, or suspicious behavior or movements can infuse otherwise innocent activity with an incriminating aspect.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pagan, supra. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Patti, supra </em>at 443-444 (uniformed officer, who was conducting threshold inquiry of defendant alone at night in high crime area, was justified in frisking defendant after he reached into his pockets); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 41, 44-45 (2002) (uniformed officer patrolling high crime area late at night was justified in pat frisk<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>ing defendant for his safety and safety of others given defendant\u2019s evasiveness and quick motion to his waist).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The defendant\u2019s limping gait in this case, with his right hand clenching something on his right hip and holding his right elbow close to his waist, while not alone sufficient to create a reasonable basis for the officer\u2019s concern, was followed by the defendant\u2019s stepping back and reaching towards his waist, a gesture that in the circumstances would have justified a reasonable officer\u2019s belief that the defendant was about to pull out a weapon. That the officer was outnumbered and the encounter occurred in a high crime area, late at night, added to the totality of the circumstances to provide a reasonable basis for Officer Colon to conclude that the defendant was potentially armed and dangerous, justifying the stop and search.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">\n<em>Order allowing motion to suppress reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b254-8\">Only the two arresting officers testified at the hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b254-9\">The motion judge\u2019s written ruling includes these statements: \u201cOfficer Colon acknowledged that even though he and [OJfficer Freemen were in plain clothes and in an unmarked van, the van was known to be a police vehicle in the area. ... He reported that, upon making eye contact with the group of males \u2014 and the group realizing that the people in the van were police \u2014 the group began to walk away from the vehicle and towards Columbia Road.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">Even assuming that this recitation of the evidence constitutes findings of fact, compare <em>Care &amp; Protection of Lillith, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 132, 141 (2004) (judge recited testimony but did not make findings indicating he had assessed credibility of witness), with <em>Koch </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>416 Mass. 540, 545 (1993) (clear from context and heading that recitation of testimony constituted findings), and the evidence was otherwise admissible (and we do not so decide), the assumed findings \u2014 that the van was known to be a police van and that the group had identified its occupants to be police \u2014 are not supported by the evidence. Officer Colon\u2019s affirmative answer to the question, \u201cSo your presumption is that they knew you were a police officer,\u201d is not evidence of what the members of the group knew. Nor does his testimony \u2014 that the group dispersed \u201cas soon as we came in the area, and our vehicle is known in that area\u201d \u2014 support a finding that any member of this group knew the van was a police vehicle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b255-7\">Officer Colon testified that he believed the defendant was carrying a weapon and that he had seen other individuals employ this manner of walking in order to conceal shotguns, baseball bats, axes, and BB guns. The judge made no findings to this effect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b255-8\">The officer testified that the defendant \u201ctook his hand off his right side, took a step back, then went back towards his waist, at that time I went and grabbed his hands [sic] in his waist.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b257-7\">See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stoute, supra </em>at 785-789, for the proposition that art. 14 provides individuals with greater substantive protections than the Fourth Amendment in terms of deciding when a \u201cseizure\u201d has occurred, and thereby reaffirming adherence to the more protective standard expressed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thibeau, </em>384 Mass. 762 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b257-8\">The analysis applicable to a protective stop and firisk is the same under the Fourth Amendment and art. 14. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 311, 314 n.2 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b259-8\">In addition, Officer Colon was outnumbered by the defendant and his group.

Again, we see a situation that comes dangerously close to impermissible conduct on the part of the police. See and compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DePeiza, </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 398, further appellate review granted, 447 Mass. 1105 (2006). However, I am constrained to concur based on the reasoning of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pagan, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 780, 781-783 (2005). Of course, an officer can respond to a hand movement toward a waistband, but I am still amazed how a peculiar gait automatically triggers a stop and an inquiry. <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b259-9\">It is equally curious and worthy of particular note that here the defendant had a rifle (apparently tucked in his waistband) and in <em>DePeiza, supra, </em>the so-called straight leg gait (allegedly well known by police officers) revealed a handgun. Thus, I am ineluctably led to this conclusion \u2014 any walk fits all. In other words, it is the walk, not the type of weapon, that jump starts the stop.
