The act provides that \u201c[pjersonal injuries shall include mental or emotional disabilities only where the predominant contributing cause of such disability is an event or series of events occurring within any employment.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(7A), as amended through St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 14. In describing the employee\u2019s disabilities, the impartial medical examiner, Dr. Zamir Nestelbaum, stated in his report and on deposition that the work events at issue were \u201cthe major\u201d or \u201cthe primary\u201d cause of the employee\u2019s major depression and that it is \u201cmore probable than not that it was the work incidents that, essentially, caused this woman to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>become disabled.\u201d The reviewing board of the Department of Industrial Accidents (board) ruled that the employee did not meet the statutory standard of \u00a7 1(7A) for emotional work injuries because \u201c \u2018the predominant contributing cause\u2019 means the work cause(s) <em>must be greater than the sum of all non-work-related </em>causes\u201d (emphasis original). The board affirmed the decision of the administrative judge denying benefits to the employee. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The employee had worked as a correction officer at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution, Framingham, for fifteen years. She claimed that after two separate incidents, one in 1999 and one in 2000, when officers were disciplined as a result of her reports of rule violations to superiors, she was harassed, called a \u201crat\u201d by her coworkers, and told to rely on the convicts, not staff, for her personal safety. By 2002, she no longer was able to withstand the verbal abuse and harassment. She stopped working on June 21, 2002. These facts, as told by the employee, were recounted by Dr. Nestelbaum in his report, and he accepted them. He also wrote in his report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">\u201cRegarding causality, although there were other factors that seemed to affect Ms. May during 1999 and 2000 such as her mother\u2019s diagnosis with Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, her being put into a nursing home and then her death as well as Ms. May\u2019s building a house, it seems the major factor for causing her major depressive episode was her hostile work environment .... Another factor which should be considered is Ms. May\u2019s apparent reliving of her father\u2019s experience at being hounded out of jobs for no fault of his own, just for being black despite his doing a good job like Ms. May. She feels that like her father she\u2019s been out of a job for doing her job well and like her father suspects that it\u2019s not her job performance but her race, gender, and sexual orientation may be factors. She believes that she was treated unfairly like her father.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">In his deposition, on cross-examination, Dr. Nestelbaum, was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-8\">\u201c[I]s it more probable than not that it was the work incidents that, essentially, caused this woman to become disabled?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-9\">He answered: \u201cYes, I think it \u2014 After I thought about these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>different factors, I felt like the primary cause was the work incident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-5\">In denying the employee benefits, the administrative judge ruled:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-6\">\u201cEven if the employee\u2019s testimony is accepted in full, as it was by the impartial physician, this would be a case where the employee would fall just short of the standard. While Dr. Nestelbaum suggests that hostile work environment is a major cause of the emotional disability, he also identifies at least three other factors adding to the level of stress.. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-7\">\u201cAs outlined by the reviewing board in <em>Siano </em>v. <em>Specialty Bolt and Screw Co., </em>16 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 237 (2002), while it is possible that there can be multiple \u2018major\u2019 causes of medical disability, there can be by definition but one \u2018predominant\u2019 cause. In this case, the hostile work environment, while identified as a major cause, seems to be one of several causes that also play a role in the emotional disability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">Although the board acknowledged that the administrative judge erroneously referred to the doctor\u2019s opinion as stating that the employee\u2019s work environment was \u201ca major\u201d rather than \u201cthe major\u201d cause of her disability, it quoted the foregoing reasoning of the judge, stating that \u201c \u2018[mjajor\u2019 does not necessarily mean \u2018predominant.\u2019 \u201d It noted that \u201cthe doctor never characterized the work events as \u2018the predominant contributing cause\u2019 of the disability\u201d and the \u201cemployee\u2019s counsel did not ask [him] whether the employment events were the predominant contributing cause of her Ghent\u2019s emotional disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">As indicated earlier, the board concluded that \u201c \u2018the predominant contributing cause\u2019 means the work cause(s) <em>must be greater than the sum of all non-work-related </em>causes\u201d (emphasis original). The board went on to say, citing <em>Siano\u2019s Case, </em>16 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 237, 240 (2002):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-10\">\u201cWe therefore reject the employee\u2019s argument that medical testimony establishing the work incidents as \u2018the major\u2019 or \u2018the primary\u2019 satisfied, as a matter of law, the \u2018predominant contributing cause\u2019 standard for emotional injuries, where, as here, the employment was only one of several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>acknowledged contributing causes. . . . \u2018By definition there can be but one \u201cpredominant\u201d cause .... There may, however, be multiple \u201cmajor\u201d causes.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">We consider the board\u2019s interpretation of the statutory standard incorrect. It does not accord with precedent or with ordinary lexical definitions. The board\u2019s reliance on <em>Siam\u2019s Case, </em>16 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 237 (2002), is misplaced. In construing a different sentence of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(7a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the board in that case noted the contrast in the statute between the words \u201cmajor\u201d and \u201cpredominant\u201d and specifically found \u201cinstructive\u201d that the statute used the word \u201ca\u201d before the word \u201cmajor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 240. Cf. <em>Castillo </em>v. <em>Cavicchio Greenhouses, Inc., </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 218, 221 n.8 (2006). We take this to imply that had the word \u201cmajor\u201d been preceded by the word \u201cthe,\u201d the board would not have held that there could be several major, but only one predominant cause. Indeed, in <em>Myers\u2019s Case, </em>19 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 22, 24 (2005), the board stated, \u201cOnly one cause can be \u2018the major\u2019 cause, because use of the definite article \u2018the\u2019 means that the cause is greater in importance than all others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The board\u2019s present definition is also not in accord with the ordinary lexical meanings of the words \u201cpredominant\u201d and \u201cprimary.\u201d In Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged 1786 (1993), \u201cpredominant\u201d is defined as \u201chaving superior strength, influence, authority, or position,\u201d while \u201cprimary\u201d is defined as \u201cfirst in rank or importance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1800. Similarly, in the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 1427 (3d ed. 1996), \u201cpredominant\u201d is defined as \u201c[hjaving greatest ascendancy, importance, influence, authority, or force,\u201d and \u201cprimary\u201d is defined as \u201c[fjirst or highest in rank, quality, or importance, principal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1438. Other similar definitions are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>We consider the distinctions in definition between \u201cpredominant\u201d and \u201cprimary\u201d of no significance in determining the requisite causal relationship for purposes of receiving benefits for mental or emotional injuries. In sum, we think Dr. Nestelbaum\u2019s use of the terms \u201cthe major cause\u201d and \u201cthe primary cause\u201d were substantially equivalent to the statutory term and provided the proper standard. See <em>Robinson\u2019s Case, </em>416 Mass. 454, 460 (1993) (exact wording not necessary for proper application of standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The employee also raises a second issue, raised below but not explicitly treated by the board. She argues that the administrative judge improperly applied an objective standard in determining whether the events were stressful. After stating the statutory standard, \u201cthe predominant contributing cause of such disability,\u201d the judge opined that he did \u201cnot find the events at work to be at such a level as to meet that standard.\u201d He also stated, \u201cWhile I do not doubt the sincere belief of the employee today that her problems stem from work rather than from the other stressors in her life, I do not find the work events she describes to be as egregious as she now believes them to be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The administrative judge\u2019s view of the severity of the stressful incidents at work is an impermissible consideration. \u201c[Tjhere is nothing in the statute to suggest that emotional disability is compensable only if it resulted from \u2018an unusual and objectively stressful or traumatic event.\u2019 . . . The finding that the employee\u2019s disability was causally related to a series of events at work is sufficient as long as those events [meet the required causal standard] bringing about the employee\u2019s disability.\u201d <em>Robinson\u2019s Case, </em>416 Mass. at 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">We reject the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that the employee should not, in any event, prevail, on the ground that the administrative judge discredited her testimony. The record does not support this claim. The judge did not find that the events <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>recounted by the employee did not occur (indeed, he credited the evidence that the employee caused two supervisors to be disciplined), nor did he state that he disbelieved Dr. Nestelbaum. Under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11 A, in the absence of contradictory medical evidence, the impartial physician\u2019s determination whether an employee\u2019s disability has as its predominant contributing cause an injury arising out of the course of the employee\u2019s employment must be accepted as true. See <em>Young\u2019s Case, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 903, 904 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The decision of the board is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b240-7\">That sentence reads: \u201cIf a compensable injury or disease combines with a pre-existing condition, which resulted from an injury or disease not compensable under this chapter, to cause or prolong disability or a need for treatment, the resultant condition shall be compensable only to the extent such compensable injury or disease remains a major but not necessarily predominant cause of disability or need for treatment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b240-8\">In the Oxford Pocket American Dictionary of Current English 620 (2002), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>\u201cpredominant\u201d is defined as \u201cbeing the strongest or main element\u201d while \u201cprimary\u201d is defined as \u201cof the first importance, chief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 626-627. See also Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1177 (6th ed. 1990), where \u201cpredominant\u201d is defined as \u201c[s]omething greater or superior in power and influence to others with which it is connected or compared\u201d and \u201cprimary\u201d is defined as \u201c[fjirst, principal; chief; leading.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1190.
