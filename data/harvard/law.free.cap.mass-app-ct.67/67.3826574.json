App. Ct. 605, 611 (2002) <em>(Cumberland I), </em>we held that certiorari was not appropriate in that civil action purporting to challenge the Bourne planning board\u2019s (planning board) denial of site plan approval in connection with Cumberland Farms, Inc.\u2019s (Cumberland), application for a building permit, and remanded the matter \u201cfor further consideration or proceedings.\u201d Cumberland sought to amend its complaint, essentially seeking to resurrect its claim as initially commenced, i.e., as an appeal of the decision of the Bourne board of appeals (zoning board) pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A Superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>Court judge denied that motion upon finding that the amended complaint \u201ccould be futile\u201d because of Cumberland\u2019s need for a special permit to proceed with its project. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Judgment affirming the decision of the planning board subsequently entered. We vacate the judgment and order the entry of judgment dismissing the complaint.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">It is both unnecessary and, on this record, inappropriate for us to decide whether Cumberland\u2019s proposed work requires a special permit under the Bourne zoning bylaw (local bylaw).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Cumberland opted to proceed with its building permit application pursuant to \u00a7 1230 of the local bylaw that renders site plan approval a condition precedent to the issuance of a building permit, rather than proceeding by way of application for a special permit, accompanied by a petition for site plan approval. At no point did Cumberland, subsequent to the planning board action, request or receive directly from the building inspector a necessary formal action, e.g., official decision, or grant or denial of the building permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>After the planning board voted to disapprove the site plan, Cumberland purported to appeal that decision directly to the zoning board pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 8.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The zoning board held a public hearing on the matter and voted to uphold the decision of the planning board. However, an appeal to the zoning board pursuant to \u00a7 8 has, as a jurisdictional prerequisite, action by an administrative officer, \u201cthe inspector of buildings, or other administrative official,\u201d which in this case means that the building inspector was required to have formally denied Cumberland\u2019s building permit application.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 8, inserted by St. 1975, c. 808, \u00a7 3. See <em>Dufault </em>v. <em>Millennium Power Partners, L.P., </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 137, 138-143 (2000); <em>Elio </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Barnstable, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 424, 426-432 (2002).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, further proceedings on Cum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>berland\u2019s complaint, if the amendment were allowed, would be futile because the zoning board had no jurisdiction to render the decision which is the subject of Cumberland\u2019s zoning appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The judgment is vacated, and a new judgment is to enter dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b95-15\">Cumberland\u2019s initial complaint was filed on December 6, 1996, appealing the decision of the zoning board affirming the planning board\u2019s denial. After a series of interim matters, on August 11, 1998, Cumberland\u2019s motion to amend the complaint was allowed only insofar as to state a claim under the certiorari <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>statute, and after additional interim matters, judgment on the amended complaint was entered for the planning board on August 22, 2000. Judgment after our rescript entered on February 21, 2003, and Cumberland\u2019s motion to amend its complaint was filed on May 5, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">The question whether the local zoning bylaw (and the statute) requires a special permit for Cumberland\u2019s proposed project should have been apparent from the outset. Cumberland chose its procedural route and bypassed several opportunities for earlier resolution of the question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b96-8\">For background detail, including a description of Cumberland\u2019s proposed project, see <em>Cumberland </em>/, <em>supra </em>at 605-607.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b96-9\">We will make reference to <em>Cumberland I </em>to put this appeal in perspective and to supplement the background in our discussion. See note 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b96-10\">The planning board argued to the judge, in support of its futility argument, that a special permit was required. Cumberland argued that the planning board and zoning board processed the matters pending before them on the assumption that no special permit was necessary, and that the case on appeal should be considered on that hypothesis. The motion judge based her ruling, at least in part, upon her determination that a special permit was required. Although the substantive determination as to need for a special permit cannot be made on the record before the Superior Court as developed on Cumberland\u2019s procedural choices, the record, however, does not support Cumberland\u2019s position that the modification of its existing facility is a matter of right under the local bylaw, not requiring a special permit. The question, quite simply, is one that must be addressed in the first instance by the building inspector, who was essentially bypassed by Cumberland. See G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 7; <em>McDonald\u2019s Corp. </em>v. <em>Seekonk, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 351, 353 (1981); Local bylaw \u00a7 1210.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b97-5\">General Laws c. 40A, \u00a7 8, inserted by St. 1975, c. 808, \u00a7 3, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-6\">\u201cAn appeal to the permit granting authority as the zoning ordinance or by-law may provide, may be taken by any person aggrieved by reason of his inability to obtain a permit or enforcement action from any administrative officer under the provisions of this chapter, ... or by any person . . . aggrieved by an order or decision of the inspector of buildings, or other administrative official, in violation of any provision of this chapter or any ordinance or by-law adopted thereunder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">For purposes of this analysis, the powers of the zoning board under \u00a7 1320 of the local bylaw mirrors the authority in G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b97-8\">Of course, if the building permit had been granted, another aggrieved person may have sought enforcement and thereafter pursued a \u00a7 8 appeal to the zoning board. Suffice it to say that Cumberland\u2019s appeal to the zoning board bypassed building inspector action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b97-9\">There is some authority that in some cases the question of a zoning board\u2019s jurisdiction to hear an appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 8, may be waived. See <em>Elio </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Barnstable, supra </em>at 431. In the circumstances of this case, however, \u201cwe could not hold that the [zoning] board had power to entertain [Cumberland\u2019s] appeal without ignoring the plain requirements of \u00a7 [8].\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cWhere, as here, the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, it is conclusive as to the intent of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Ciardi </em>v. <em>F. Hoffmann-LaRoche, Ltd., </em>436 Mass. 53, 60-61 (2002). Moreover, the planning board is the party defendant in this action, and \u201c[t]he governmental zoning power may not be forfeited by the action of local officers in disregard of the statute and the ordinance.\u201d <em>Ferrante </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of </em>Northampton, 345 Mass. 158, 163 (1962). See <em>Cape Resort Hotels, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Lic. Bd. of Falmouth, </em>385 Mass. 205, 224-225 (1982); <em>Balcam </em>v. <em>Hingham, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 260, 264 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Aside from the technical requirements of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 14, the practical aspects of the requirement of building inspector action is apparent when we note, as we did in <em>Cumberland </em>I, 56 Mass. App. Ct. at 609, the multiple components for the building inspector\u2019s review of a building permit application under both State and local law, including, but not solely, compliance with local zoning (under both authorities). A central issue in this case, whether Cumberland\u2019s proposal requires a special permit, is, as Cumberland argues, initially a matter within the jurisdiction of the building inspector pursuant to \u00a7 1210 of the local bylaws. However, if Cumberland had not opted to bypass the building inspector in its process, prior to appeal to the zoning board, this central issue would have been determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">Finally, in the context of this appeal, we repair dicta in <em>Cumberland I </em>which was misleading in its suggestion, at least implicitly, that Cumberland\u2019s appeal to the zoning board was compliant with G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 15, notwithstanding the lack of final action by the building inspector. See <em>Cumberland I, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. at 609 n.10. Any such suggestion was error and resulted from our attempt to resolve a case that was pressed by the plaintiff in a piecemeal fashion. See <em>Long </em>v. <em>Wickett, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 380, 395 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
