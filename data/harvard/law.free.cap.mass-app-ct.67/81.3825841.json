L. c. 152, \u00a7 37, for pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>ments it made to an injured employee.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the present case, the underlying injury triggering \u00a7 37 relief occurred in September of 1989, and Travelers made its final payment to the employee in June of 1995. Travelers did not file its petition for reimbursement until December of 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">On appeal, the trust fund contends that the current version of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 37, which includes a two-year statute of limitations added by the Legislature in a 1991 amendment,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> should be applied to bar Travelers\u2019s claim for reimbursement. We conclude that the statute of limitations was intended to apply prospectively; accordingly, we affirm the decision of the single justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\"><em>Background. </em>Kim Oakes began working as a salesperson for Dettinger Lumber Company (Dettinger) in 1984. Oakes had sustained a significant back injury in 1980, prior to working for Dettinger. He suffered a subsequent work-related injury to his hand on September 2, 1989. This injury qualified as a subsequent injury pursuant to \u00a7 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Travelers, which provided workers\u2019 compensation insurance for Dettinger at the time of the injury, paid temporary total disability benefits, and then partial incapacity benefits, to Oakes from December 2, 1989, until June 22, 1995. At that point, a lump sum settlement was made in the amount of $100,000, which redeemed Travelers\u2019s liability for Oakes\u2019s injuries. In December of 1998, three and one-half years after making its final payment to Oakes, Travelers sought reimbursement from the trust fund, pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 37 and 65(2)(c), in the amount of $113,042.23. The trust fund refused to make the requested payment for a number of reasons, including its assertion that the petition was time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">Section 37 of the workers\u2019 compensation statute provides reimbursement to workers\u2019 compensation insurers for a portion of payments made to certain employees whose disabilities were caused in part by previous injuries. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 37. The purpose of the fund, formerly known as the \u201cSecond Injury Fund,\u201d is to encourage employers to hire previously disabled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>employees by reimbursing a portion of the increased compensation burden incurred when such an employee suffers further work-related injury. See <em>Daly </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 100, 101-102 (1990). Section 37 provides that an insurer may obtain partial compensation from the trust fund for payments made to qualifying employees: reimbursements are not to exceed seventy-five percent of the total payments made to the employee, and no reimbursement is made for payments in the first two years (104 weeks) of disability. To qualify for reimbursement under \u00a7 37, payments must be made to an employee with a known physical impairment who suffers a subsequent injury that results in a disability that is \u201csubstantially greater by reason of the combined effects of such impairment and subsequent personal injury than that disability which would have resulted from the subsequent personal injury alone.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 37, as appearing in St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Travelers\u2019s claim for reimbursement initially was denied by a DIA administrative judge after a conference. After a hearing, a second administrative judge granted Travelers\u2019s petition, and the trust fund appealed. Citing its decision in <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Bertolino Beef Co., </em>16 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 151, 153-155 (2002), the board summarily affirmed that portion of the administrative judge\u2019s decision that held that Travelers\u2019s claim was not time barred, and rejected, with a statement of reasons, the trust fund\u2019s remaining assertions of error. In February of 2005, a single justice of this court affirmed the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">On appeal, the trust fund does not dispute the underlying facts of the case. Rather, it contends that the board erred in determining that no statute of limitations applied to Travelers\u2019s reimbursement claim. The trust fund\u2019s argument rests on its interpretation of the 1991 amendment to the workers\u2019 compensation statute, which added the two-year statute of limitations to \u00a7 37, and which the trust fund argues should be applied retroactively.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\"><em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Standard of review. </em>\u201cWe review the single <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>justice\u2019s order \u2018in the same manner as if the single justice were a lower court.\u2019 Appeals Court Rule 2:04 (1990). Because this court is conducting \u2018an analysis of the same agency record . . . there is no reason why the view of the [single justice] should be given any special weight,\u2019 \u201d <em>Coggin </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Parole Bd., </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 584, 587 (1997), quoting from <em>Southern Worcester County Regional Vocational Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>377 Mass. 897, 903 (1979). Our review of the board\u2019s decision is, therefore, de nova. See <em>Coggin </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Parole Bd., supra </em>at 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">We begin our analysis by noting that \u201c[t]he interpretation of a statute by the agency charged with primary responsibility for administering it is entitled to substantial deference.\u201d <em>Gateley\u2019s Case, </em>415 Mass. 397, 399 (1993). See <em>Bertocchi\u2019s Case, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 561, 565 (2003). While the duty of statutory interpretation remains with the courts, we will not substitute our judgment for that of an administrative agency if its interpretation of a statute is reasonable and its findings are supported by substantial evidence. See <em>School Comm. of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>376 Mass. 112, 116 (1978); <em>United States Jaycees </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>391 Mass. 594, 600 (1984); <em>Massachusetts Med. Soc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>402 Mass. 44, 62 (1988), citing <em>Insurance Rating Bd. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>359 Mass. 111, 117 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">b. <em>Interpretation of \u00a7 37. </em>The trust fund acknowledges that \u00a7 37, as it appeared on the date of the employee\u2019s injury (September 2, 1989), contained no explicit limitations period within which insurers needed to file for reimbursements under the second injury scheme. However, on December 23, 1991, a two-year statute of limitations was established for \u00a7 37 with the enactment of St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 71; chapter 398 was entitled \u201cAn Act Relative to Fair and Effective Compensation of Injured Workers\u201d (Reform Act). <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trust fund argues that a proper reading of \u00a7 106 of the Reform Act dictates that we apply the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>two-year statute of limitations retroactively to bar Travelers\u2019s reimbursement claim. <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">In the absence of statutory guidance, procedural amendments are to be applied retroactively, and substantive amendments are to be applied prospectively. See <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Boston Univ. Hosp., </em>372 Mass. 654, 658 (1977); <em>Shelby Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>420 Mass. 251, 257 (1995), and cases cited. However, the workers\u2019 compensation statute provides its own statutory scheme for differentiating between procedural and substantive changes. Accordingly, \u00a7 2A of the statute provided that the only changes to be considered substantive are those that increase<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the amount of compensation \u201cpayable to an injured employee or his dependents . . . unless otherwise expressly provided.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 2A, inserted by St. 1946, c. 386, \u00a7 3.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Rather than relying on the standard set forth in \u00a7 2A of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>statute, however, the Legislature expressly designated each section of the Reform Act as either substantive or procedural. No section in the Reform Act was without such express designation, as provided in \u00a7\u00a7 103-107 of the Reform Act. See Nason, Koziol, &amp; Wall, Workers\u2019 Compensation \u00a7 2.15 (3d ed. 2003). Section 106 of the Reform Act, the section relevant to the present case, provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-5\">\u201cFor purposes of section two A of chapter one hundred and fifty-two of the General Laws, and <em>[sic] </em>section[]. . . seventy one ... of this act . . . shall be deemed to be substantive in character.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">The trust fund argues that this language is ambiguous and cryptic, and does not indicate a clear intent by the Legislature to apply the statute of limitations prospectively. The trust fund therefore argues that \u00a7 106 should be read as requiring the standard in \u00a7 2A to apply to each change set forth in \u00a7 71 of the Reform Act; accordingly, the addition of the statute of limitations would be considered procedural and would apply retroactively. The trust fund\u2019s argument is without merit, as there is no ambiguity in the language of \u00a7 106.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We also note that, even if an alternate reading of \u00a7 106 were possible, the analysis of this language by the board is certainly reasonable and warrants deference. See <em>Massachusetts Med. Soc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>402 Mass. at 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">The intended meaning of \u00a7 106 is clear: the changes set forth in \u00a7 71 of the Reform Act are to be considered substantive for purposes of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 2A, and therefore should be applied prospectively.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It is clear from the language of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 2A, that the Legislature contemplated the type of express designation set forth in \u00a7 106. See note 8, <em>supra. </em>We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>also find nothing in the language of \u00a7 106 to indicate that the addition of a statute of limitations should be treated any differently from the rest of the changes set forth in \u00a7 71 of the Reform Act. See <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy., </em>405 Mass. 439, 443-444 (1989), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Vickey, 381 Mass. 762, 767 (1980) (stating that words should be given \u201ctheir plain meaning in light of the aim of the Legislature,\u201d and judicial legislation should be avoided).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">We recognize that, absent specific designation by the Legislature, the addition of a statute of limitations would be regarded as procedural for purposes of assessing its effect on claims that already have arisen. See <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Boston Univ. Hosp., </em>372 Mass. at 658-659; <em>Ditomasso </em>v. <em>Laliberte, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 890, 890 (1980). It is, however, the legislative intent that controls. Where, as here, \u201ca contrary legislative design is plainly expressed,\u201d a conflicting general principle cannot supersede that statement of intention. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Freedman, </em>268 Mass. 38, 41 (1929). Considering the Legislature\u2019s clear expression of intent in the present case, the trust fund\u2019s reliance on <em>American Mut. Liab. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>379 Mass. 398, 404-406 (1979); <em>Pospisil\u2019s Case, </em>402 Mass. 820, 822 (1988); and <em>Shelby Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>420 Mass. at 256-257, is misplaced: none of these cases addresses a situation, like the present one, where the Legislature expressly has designated the disputed amendment as substantive.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Moreover, we agree with the board\u2019s assessment of the reasoning in <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Bertolino Beef Co. </em>that to apply the trust fund\u2019s reading of the Reform Act \u201cwould render the Legislature\u2019s prospective characterization of [the amendments designated in \u00a7 106] as utterly meaningless.\u201d 16 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. at 154. Furthermore, \u201cif the Legislature had intended the new statute of limitations to have retroactive application, \u2018it would have been natural for the Legislature to express such an intention,\u2019 as it did for the vast majority of the amendments enacted in 1991.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Nantucket </em>v. <em>Beinecke, </em>379 Mass. 345, 348 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b109-17\">As of July 1, 2005, appeals taken from decisions of the reviewing board go to a panel of this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b110-9\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 37, provides reimbursement to workers\u2019 compensation insurers for payments made to certain employees whose disabilities were caused in part by previous injuries.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b110-10\">Statute 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 71, was effective on December 23, 1991.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b111-8\">The trust fund alternatively argues that the time limit set forth in a 1989 regulation, which was in force at the time of Oakes\u2019s second injury but was repealed in 1997, should apply to bar Travelers\u2019s reimbursement claim. We do not address this argument, as it was not raised below. See <em>Gaw </em>v. <em>Sappett, </em>62 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>Mass. App. Ct. 405, 410 (2004) (\u201cA party is not entitled to appellate review of a nonjurisdictional issue or theory never presented to the trial court\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b112-9\">The last paragraph of St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 71, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>\u201cAny petition for reimbursement under this section shall be filed no later than two years from the date on which the benefit payment for which the reimbursement request is being filed was made.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b113-8\">We note that the date of injury is the proper date to consider, as this is the date on which an insurer\u2019s payment obligation first attaches. This date is also in line with other provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, which generally focus on the date of injury as the event from which time measurements are made. See, e.g., G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 15, 34B, 36, &amp; 36A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b113-13\">The Reform Act expanded the definition of substantive changes in \u00a7 2A to include changes that <em>decreased </em>compensation to employees in addition to those that <em>increased </em>such compensation. This change, however, has no implications for the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b113-14\">Section 2A, which was in effect in 1985 and continues to be in effect with only minor amendments (see St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 16), provided, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-15\">\u201cEvery act, in amendment of this chapter, in effect on the effective date of this section or thereafter becoming effective which increases the amount or amounts of compensation payable to an injured employee or his dependents shall, for the purposes of this chapter, be deemed to be substantive in character and shall apply only to personal injuries occurring on and after the effective date of such act, unless otherwise expressly provided. Every act, in amendment of this chapter, in effect on the effective date of this section or thereafter becoming effective which is not deemed to be substantive in character within the meaning of this section shall be deemed to be procedural or remedial only, in character, and shall have application to personal injuries irrespective of the date of their occurrence, unless otherwise expressly provided.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b114-8\">The trust fund also puts forth a policy argument in favor of imposing a statute of limitations on \u00a7 37 petitions. This argument, however, relies on information outside of the record and is unavailing in the face of the Legislature\u2019s clear expression of intent in \u00a7 106 of the Reform Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b114-9\">It is true that \u00a7 106 contains an extra word \u2014 the word \u201cand\u201d \u2014 which creates some confusion in the proper interpretation of the statute. While this error may evidence sloppy draftsmanship, it does not create an ambiguity as to the ultimate meaning intended by the Legislature.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
