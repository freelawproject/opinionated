Seeing no error in the judge\u2019s rulings, we affirm the judgments and the orders denying the defendant\u2019s motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">1. <em>Background, </em>(a) <em>The Commonwealth\u2019s case. </em>It was the Commonwealth\u2019s theory of guilt that on October 25, 1999, the defendant shot and murdered Eddy Javier Reynoso because of a dispute between them concerning Grisela Gonzalez. In support of this theory, the Commonwealth offered the testimony of Gonzalez and that of various law enforcement personnel, who produced physical evidence and related the details of their investigation that led to the defendant\u2019s arrest and confession.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Commonwealth also had the defendant\u2019s written confession read to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">In his confession, the defendant described how Reynoso repeatedly embarrassed and humiliated him about a poem he had written to Gonzalez, and he detailed Reynoso\u2019s attempts to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>make him jealous with claims that he, Reynoso, had a relationship with Gonzalez. The defendant stated that on the night of Reynoso\u2019s murder he met his friend, Carlos Rodriguez; that they walked to Reynoso\u2019s apartment; that as he, the defendant, knocked on the door to Reynoso\u2019s apartment, Rodriguez stood off to the side; that when Reynoso opened his door and saw the defendant, Reynoso began to swear and close his door; and that he, the defendant, fired his gun three times and fled from the building with Rodriguez. The defendant further stated that after separating from Rodriguez, he hailed a taxicab, and when he saw some trees a short time later, he had the driver drop him off and he threw the gun into the woods. <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">In addition to the above evidence, one of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses, State Trooper John S. Schrijn, testified that the day after Reynoso\u2019s murder, a man named Alex Rosa was shot and killed, and that the bullets recovered from both homicide investigations were shot from the same gun and were the same type.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">(b) <em>The defendant\u2019s case. </em>The defendant claimed that one of the men convicted of the Rosa homicide, Kelvin Gutierrez, shot Reynoso with the same gun that he used to kill Rosa. In support of that claim, the defendant called three witnesses and entered into evidence a stipulation that Gutierrez and Jean Carlos Almo-dovar were convicted of the shooting death of Rosa. The first witness called by the defendant was John G. Murphy, the State trooper who served as the case officer for the Rosa homicide. Trooper Murphy testified that a .38 caliber bullet was recovered during Rosa\u2019s autopsy and that he later learned ballistic tests established that the same gun was used in both the Reynoso and Rosa homicides. He also told the jury that a search of Gutierrez\u2019s apartment produced a \u201cspeed loader with two .38 caliber class rounds.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Trooper Murphy further testified that he searched for a taxicab driver who picked up a fare matching the details as to time and place provided by the defendant in his confession; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>he located a driver; and that when he showed the driver a photographic array, which included the defendant, Gutierrez, and Almodovar, the driver, expressing some uncertainty, selected Gutierrez\u2019s photograph.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">On cross-examination, Trooper Murphy testified that in the course of his investigation, he found \u201cno relationship or ties\u201d between Gutierrez and Reynoso, or between Almodovar and Reynoso. Nor did he find any connection between the defendant and Rosa.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">To rebut the notion that the defendant was unacquainted with Gutierrez, the Commonwealth presented the testimony of a correction officer assigned to the Ludlow house of correction. The correction officer testified that on October 29, 1999, he spoke with the newly arrested defendant who, speaking in English, requested that he be placed in a cell with his friend, Gutierrez. On cross-examination, the correction officer acknowledged that during the transport and intake process, new inmates are free to speak among themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">The defendant\u2019s second witness was Luis A. Garcia, a man who lived in an apartment across the hall from Reynoso. Garcia testified that when he heard loud knocking on Reynoso\u2019s door, he looked out the peep hole in his door, saw the back of a tall male with short \u201ckinky\u201d hair, who was wearing a black jacket, and, after hearing a man ask, \u201cAre you Eddy?\u201d and \u201cDo you know Lisa or Lucy?\u201d he returned to watching television. Garcia told the jury that he looked out the peep hole a second time, saw Reynoso in his doorway, then returned to watching television, and that less than three minutes later, he heard three gunshots. On cross-examination, Garcia again stated that he saw only one person standing in the hallway and added that if another person remained standing in the staircase or to the right of his peep hole, he would not have seen him.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">The third witness called by the defendant was Thomas Nev-ille, the taxicab driver located by Trooper Murphy. Neville testified that he was dispatched to pick up a fare that was a \u201cno show\u201d and, as he was leaving the area, he was flagged down by a man who said he was the person who had called earlier for a taxicab. Neville described his fare as an English-speaking Hispanic man in his twenties, dark in complexion, about five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>feet, six inches, to five feet, eight inches, tall, and weighing 160 to 170 pounds. Neville indicated that the fare was small, about four dollars. He also identified the photograph of Gutierrez as the one he selected from the array presented by Trooper Murphy.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">2. <em>Motion for funds for an investigator. </em>The day after Reynoso\u2019s murder, Wilbert Diaz gave a signed statement to the police. According to Diaz\u2019s statement, he lived in the apartment next to Reynoso and was friends with the defendant. Diaz\u2019s statement substantially tracked the trial testimony of Garcia, the neighbor who lived across the hall from Reynoso. See part 1(b), <em>supra. </em>That is, on the night of the murder, Diaz heard loud knocking on Reynoso\u2019s door and a voice coming from the hallway ask, \u201cAre you Eddy?\u201d and request that Reynoso step outside his apartment. Diaz related that after Reynoso refused to step into the hallway, he heard three rapid gunshots, which he believed to be louder than shots fired from a \u201c.357 revolver.\u201d He next heard \u201cpeople running down the stairs very fast and the door slam down stairs [sic].\u201d Diaz then ran into his bathroom and called the police on his cellular telephone. He remained in the bathroom until he heard the police in the hallway.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Appellate counsel filed a motion for funds to hire an investigator to locate Diaz. See Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(c)(5), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1502 (2001). In his affidavit in support of that motion, appellate counsel stated that during his investigation of the case, he learned that Diaz saw a man confront Rey-noso moments before he was shot, and that Diaz could have testified that the defendant was not the man who confronted Reynoso. Appellate counsel also explained that although he was aware of Diaz\u2019s last known address, date of birth, and Social Security number, he needed funds to hire an investigator to locate Diaz\u2019s present whereabouts.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">\u201cIn making the decision to allow costs associated with a new trial motion, the judge should take into account the likelihood that the expenditure will result in the defendant\u2019s being able to present a meritorious ground for a new trial.\u201d Reporters\u2019 Notes to Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(c)(5), Mass. Ann. Laws, Rules of Criminal Procedure, at 1589 (LexisNexis 2005). Such a decision is a matter of judicial discretion. See Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(c)(5) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>(\u201ccourt. . . may . . . exercise discretion to allow the defendant costs\u201d). In the instant case, the judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion for funds to locate Diaz based con her conclusion that Diaz\u2019s testimony would not create a substantial issue warranting a new trial. The judge found that the defendant failed to make a prima facie showing that Diaz would provide exculpatory evidence and that there was no reason to believe that Diaz\u2019s testimony would likely have influenced the jury\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">On appeal, the defendant argues that because Diaz told the police that he knew the defendant, it can be inferred that Diaz would have testified that the voice of the intruder who banged on Reynoso\u2019s door was not that of the defendant. It is, however, equally inferable that Diaz, based upon his friendship with the defendant, chose not to tell the police that he recognized the voice as being that of the defendant. Moreover, it has not escaped our notice that while the defendant\u2019s trial counsel signed an affidavit in support of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, in which the defendant claims, in part, that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to call Diaz as a witness, counsel\u2019s affidavit is silent as to the reasons for not presenting Diaz as a trial witness. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goodreau, </em>442 Mass. 341, 354 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">For the above discussed reasons and based upon the record before us, which indicates that the judge considered the expected testimony of the alleged exculpatory witness and applied the correct standard, we conclude that the judge did not abuse her discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for funds to hire an investigator to locate Diaz.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">3. <em>Motion for new trial. </em>A judge may grant a motion for a new trial \u201cif it appears that justice may not have been done.\u201d Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(b), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001). As stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>408 Mass. 117, 125 (1990) (citations omitted): \u201cA motion for new trial is addressed to the sound discretion of the judge, and the judge\u2019s disposition of the motion will not be reversed unless it is manifestly unjust, or unless the trial was infected with prejudicial constitutional error. Reversal for abuse of discretion is particularly rare where the judge acting on the motion was also the trial judge.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fanelli, </em>412 Mass. 497, 504 (1992) (rule 30[b] standard to be applied \u201crigorously\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>In applying this standard of review to the defendant\u2019s arguments, we are mindful of the fact that the judge who denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial was also the trial judge who, as set out in her detailed and comprehensive decision accompanying her ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion, was well aware of the discretion she had in ruling upon the defendant\u2019s request for a new trial, as well as her right to draw upon her familiarity with and memory of the witnesses and the evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">(a) <em>Missing witness instruction. </em>The defendant claims that immediately prior to trial the prosecutor misrepresented that Rodriguez (who had provided the police with a statement that he was with the defendant when the defendant shot Reynoso) was unavailable and his whereabouts unknown. He argues that but for the prosecutor\u2019s misrepresentation, he would have been entitled to a missing witness instruction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>413 Mass. 193, 199 (1992), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schatvet, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 130, 134 (1986) (\u201cWhere a party has knowledge of a person who can be located and brought forward, who is friendly to, or at least not hostilely disposed toward, the party, and who can be expected to give testimony of distinct importance to the case, the party would naturally offer that person as a witness. If, then, without explanation, he does not do so, the jury may, if they think reasonable in the circumstances, infer that person, had he been called, would have given testimony unfavorable to the party\u201d). See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 827, 829-830 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">In support of his claim that the prosecutor misrepresented that Rodriguez was unavailable, the defendant points first to the prosecutor\u2019s statement to the judge immediately prior to trial that Rodriguez was \u201cunavailable,\u201d his \u201cwhereabouts unknown.\u201d To show the prosecutor\u2019s statement to be untruthful, the defendant presented two affidavits, one from his trial attorney and the other from a disinterested attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">According to his trial attorney\u2019s affidavit, the prosecutor advised him on more than one occasion that Rodriguez was being detained in a juvenile detention facility in Puerto Rico, and about two weeks before one of the several scheduled trial dates, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>the prosecutor advised him that she intended to send officers to Puerto Rico to take custody of Rodriguez to bring him to Massachusetts to testify against the defendant. The disinterested attorney represented in his affidavit that while engaged in \u201csmall talk\u201d in the court house hallway before the defendant\u2019s trial was to start, a Springfield police detective told him that there was a dispute between the office of the district attorney and the Springfield police department about \u201cwhich office was going to pay to send officers to Puerto Rico to secure the attendance of a witness at the [defendant\u2019s] trial\u201d and that \u201ceach office was refusing to spend the money to send the officers to get the witness.\u201d This attorney also stated in his affidavit that he \u201chad the impression, from what the detective said and how he said it, that the witness was an important one for the Commonwealth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">There was a competing affidavit from the prosecutor in which she described her efforts to secure Rodriguez\u2019s attendance at trial. She related that \u201c[sjometime prior to trial\u201d she learned that Rodriguez\u2019s family sent him to Massachusetts so he would \u201cnot fall in with troubled youths in Puerto Rico,\u201d and that when he became an eyewitness to Reynoso\u2019s murder, his family brought him back to Puerto Rico where he got into \u201csome kind of trouble\u201d and was in the custody of juvenile authorities. The prosecutor enlisted the aid of a Spanish-speaking member of her office to contact law enforcement officials in Puerto Rico for assistance in locating Rodriguez and arranging for his presence at the defendant\u2019s trial. She also sent a letter to the authorities in Puerto Rico, a copy of which was attached to her affidavit, in which she explained the reasons for requesting their assistance. The prosecutor stated in her affidavit that law enforcement officials in Puerto Rico refused to assist her or to disclose any information about Rodriguez because he was a juvenile.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">As also related by the prosecutor, she had no specific recall of advising trial counsel of the obstacles she had encountered in attempting to secure Rodriguez\u2019s presence at trial, but she believed she would have done so, and she noted that when she told the judge that Rodriguez was unavailable, defense counsel voiced \u201cno comment, objection, or request for a continuance.\u201d The prosecutor represented in her affidavit that she had provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>the defendant\u2019s trial attorney with a copy of Rodriguez\u2019s statement. In addition, she outlined in her affidavit how Rodriguez\u2019s testimony would have helped the Commonwealth\u2019s case. She also expressed her opinion, as well as the reasons for it, that Rodriguez would have been a valuable prosecution witness and that his absence worked to the Commonwealth\u2019s detriment rather than benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">In rejecting the defendant\u2019s claim of prosecutorial misconduct, the judge disregarded the affidavit of the disinterested attorney in which he set out his hallway conversation with the police detective. As the judge succinctly stated, \u201cthe circumstances of a casual conversation while waiting in the courthouse hallway suggest that [the dispute over expenses for Rodriguez\u2019s return to Massachusetts] could be a mere rumor, without any adequate support.\u201d The judge found that \u201cthe record is simply devoid of evidence demonstrating that the Commonwealth[] intentionally misled the Court and the defense counsel,\u201d and she concluded that even had the defendant requested a missing witness instruction, \u201che could not have satisfied the foundational requirements for comment and instruction on a missing witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">On appeal, the defendant asserts that the affidavits show that he satisfied all four considerations that are significant in determining whether a missing witness instruction should be given against a party, specifically: (1) whether the case against the party is so strong that the party would naturally be expected to call a favorable witness; (2) whether the purported evidence of the missing witness is important or collateral and cumulative; (3) whether the party has superior knowledge of the identity and whereabouts of the missing witness; and (4) whether the party has given a plausible reason for the nonproduction of the witness. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Graves, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 76, 82-84 (1993) <em>(Graves). </em>See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. at 830 (indicating that when defendant requests missing witness instruction, first consideration may be formulated as whether Commonwealth\u2019s case is not so strong as to render unimportant or insignificant potential witness testimony). We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">As to the first two considerations, the defendant argues that the Commonwealth\u2019s case was entirely dependent upon his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>confession, which he claims is unreliable.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In support of this claim, the defendant points to the fact that he was interrogated at the police station for over seven hours; that his confession was not corroborated by an audiotape<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>; that he signed papers written in English, a language that he claimed he could neither read nor speak<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>; and that his confession made no sense in that it would mean he gave up the opportunity to act alone, instead choosing to shoot Reynoso in front of a witness. For these same reasons, the defendant argues that the Commonwealth would be expected to call Rodriguez as a witness, and Rodriguez\u2019s testimony would be important rather than collateral and cumulative.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Based on the prosecutor\u2019s affidavit in which she explained the importance of Rodriguez to the Commonwealth\u2019s case \u2014 that he would have corroborated the defendant\u2019s confession and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>helped to establish that the defendant planned Reynoso\u2019s murder \u2014 we assume for purposes of decision that the defendant has satisfied the first two of the four considerations set out in <em>Graves, supra </em>at 82-83, that is, the Commonwealth would be expected to call Rodriguez to testify to important matters. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Phinney, </em>446 Mass. 155, 167 (2006) (\u201cThe existence of a confession does not automatically mean that the evidence against the defendant was overwhelming\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">We next address the third consideration set out in <em>Graves, supra </em>at 83, that is, whether the prosecutor had superior knowledge of Rodriguez\u2019s whereabouts. According to trial counsel\u2019s affidavit, the prosecutor advised him on more than one occasion before trial that she learned that Rodriguez had returned to Puerto Rico, where he was being held in a juvenile detention center. As further related by trial counsel, about two weeks before one of the \u201cseveral\u201d scheduled trial dates, the prosecutor informed him that she intended to send officers to Puerto Rico to take custody of Rodriguez and return him to Massachusetts. Trial counsel\u2019s affidavit shows that he, as well as the prosecutor, knew prior to trial that Rodriguez was somewhere in Puerto Rico in the custody of juvenile authorities. In addition, as noted by the prosecutor in her affidavit and verified by the transcript, defense counsel remained silent when the prosecutor represented to the judge that Rodriguez\u2019s whereabouts were unknown. Thus, the defendant failed to show that the prosecutor had superior knowledge of Rodriguez\u2019s whereabouts.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">To support his argument to the contrary, the defendant points to the prosecutor\u2019s affidavit as an indication that she was in contact with Rodriguez\u2019s family in Puerto Rico and, therefore, had the means to ascertain his whereabouts. The only statements in the prosecutor\u2019s affidavit concerning Rodriguez\u2019s presence in Puerto Rico are that \u201c[sjometime prior to trial\u201d she learned that Rodriguez had returned to Puerto Rico to live with his family and then got into trouble and was placed in the custody of the juvenile authorities. Not even the most generous reading of the prosecutor\u2019s affidavit supports the defendant\u2019s assertion that the prosecutor \u201cwas in contact with [Rodriguez\u2019s] family in Puerto Rico, who in turn must have known where [he] was being held.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Lastly, we address the fourth consideration set out in <em>Graves, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. at 83-84, that is, whether the prosecutor gave a plausible reason for not producing Rodriguez. As to this consideration, the defendant argues that the reason given by the prosecutor was untrue, and in support of this assertion, he refers to the disinterested attorney\u2019s affidavit narrating his hallway conversation with a Springfield police detective. In denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, the judge declined to give any persuasive force to this affidavit because it failed to contain information as to how the detective, identified by name, obtained the information related in the affidavit, that is, whether it came from a reliable source or rumor. We concur with the judge\u2019s assessment. Moreover, we cannot help but notice that, although the detective was named in the affidavit of the disinterested attorney, the record before us does not include an affidavit from the identified detective verifying this conversation, or an affidavit from appellate counsel that details his fruitless attempts to secure such an affidavit. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goodreau, </em>442 Mass. at 353-354.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Based upon the above discussed considerations, we conclude that the judge did not err in determining that the defendant would not have been entitled to a missing witness instruction, even had he so requested, because of his inability to satisfy the requisite foundational requirements set out in <em>Graves, supra </em>at 82-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">(b) <em>Ineffective assistance of trial counsel. </em>In accusing his trial counsel of ineffective assistance, the defendant points to counsel\u2019s failure to call Diaz (the neighbor who provided a signed statement to the police) as a witness. We think it unnecessary to set out the long-established standard of review applicable to this claim. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>409 Mass. 266, 272-273 (1991) (tactics and strategy should be reviewed in deferential manner \u201cto avoid characterizing as unreasonable a defense that was merely unsuccessful\u201d and challenged tactical judgments must be shown as manifestly unreasonable).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">In concluding that trial counsel was not ineffective by reason of his failure to call Diaz, the judge rejected the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>contention that Diaz would testify, in effect, that the defendant did not shoot Reynoso. The judge found that any testimony from Diaz would merely corroborate Garcia\u2019s testimony and that the absence of Diaz\u2019s testimony did no \u201creal harm to the overall defense\u201d and \u201cno real potential tactical disadvantage . . . could have arisen from the failure\u201d to call Diaz. For the reasons set out in part 2, <em>supra, </em>we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">(c) <em>Request for an evidentiary hearing. </em>It is beyond dispute that in acting on a motion for a new trial the judge has the discretion to do so on the basis of the supporting affidavits and without an evidentiary hearing. In exercising that discretion, the judge is to look not only to the seriousness of the issues raised but also to the adequacy of the defendant\u2019s showing on those issues. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>383 Mass. 253, 257-258 (1981). As stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goodreau, supra </em>at 348-349: \u201cIf the theory of the motion, as presented by the papers, is not credible or not persuasive, holding an evidentiary hearing to have the witnesses repeat the same evidence . . . will accomplish nothing.\u201d In addition, the judge is free to ignore hearsay in an affidavit and to \u201ctake into account the suspicious failure to provide pertinent information from an expected and available source.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 353-354. For the reasons set out in the judge\u2019s memorandum of decision and discussed in parts 3(a) and 3(b), <em>supra, </em>we conclude that the judge did not commit any error of law or otherwise abuse her discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing on his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>It follows from what we have said throughout this opinion that we conclude that the judge did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, request for an evi-dentiary hearing on that motion, or motion for funds for an investigator.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">\n<em>Order denying motion for funds affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">\n<em>Order denying motion for new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b378-7\">The defendant was also found guilty of unlawful possession of a firearm, G.

In the defendant\u2019s affidavit in support of that motion, he stated that he did not understand English, that the police never advised him of his rights, and that he signed some papers he did not understand because the police told him he had no choice. The defendant does not challenge the denial of his suppression motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b379-8\">Other trial evidence indicated that the gun had never been found.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b379-9\">As explained by Trooper Murphy, a \u201cspeed loader\u201d is a cylindrical device \u201cthat holds usually six bullets, perhaps more,\u201d and allows them to be loaded into a revolver all at once.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b386-6\">In making this argument, the defendant does not claim error in any of the findings of fact made by the judge who denied his motion to suppress.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Although the defendant does not argue on appeal, as he did in his motion for a new trial, that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request a cautionary instruction regarding the defendant\u2019s unrecorded statement, we nonetheless note that there was no error in the judge\u2019s ruling on this issue. The hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress was held and that motion denied on May 18, 2001, the trial began on September 25, 2002, and the jury returned their verdicts on October 2, 2002. As correctly noted by the judge in her memorandum of decision on the defendant\u2019s motion, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiGiambattista, </em>442 Mass. 423, 447-449 (2004) (establishing prospective requirement that, on request, jury instruction be given concerning lack of recorded confession where defendant\u2019s confession, or statement that is product of \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d or \u201cinterrogation conducted in a place of detention,\u201d is admitted in evidence), was decided about three years after the defendant\u2019s trial and was, therefore, inapplicable. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dagley, </em>442 Mass. 713, 721-722 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">As to the defendant\u2019s suggestion that the failure to audiotape the defendant\u2019s confession undermines its reliability, we note that the judge acting on defendant\u2019s motion to suppress expressly found that \u201cthe defendant was not mistreated . . . , no promises were made to him, ... he was not threatened or beaten or [in] any way pressured or coerced into making the statement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b386-9\">While the judge made no finding whether the defendant could speak or read English, the judge found that the defendant gave his statement in Spanish; that a detective translated it into English; that the entire statement was read in Spanish to the defendant; that, when asked if he wanted to make any changes to the statement, the defendant responded that it was correct and that he did not wish to make any changes; and that the defendant signed the statement voluntarily.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
