His changed behavior was precipitated by her decision to reduce the asking price for the marital home (which either the divorce decree or the parties\u2019 separation agreement, neither of which is in the record, apparently required to be sold, with the proceeds divided between the parties). Blacker persisted in blaming Ginsberg for reducing the sale price, telling her that she had \u201cruined his life,\u201d that the sale of the house would be \u201cthe end of [their] family,\u201d and that \u201cthe Ginsberg family [which included his ex-wife] should be shot.\u201d He would continually call at \u201call hours of the day,\u201d repeatedly come into the house without notice or invitation,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> personally deliver her support checks despite her request that he send them to her, and often drive by the house. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>During this time, according to the son\u2019s health aide, there was frequent yelling between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">This period of rising tensions between the parties<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> culminated on February 3, 2005, when Blacker again entered the house unannounced and proceeded into the kitchen where Ginsberg was preparing dinner with her son and the son\u2019s aide. Blacker suddenly became enraged when be observed what he believed to be an unflattering haircut he mistakenly assumed Ginsberg had given their son. He began yelling at her about the supposed haircut and was \u201ctotally out of control, pulling his hair, pacing back and forth, [and] very physically aggressive with [Ginsberg].\u201d When she asked him to leave the house, \u201che went berserk.\u201d He \u201ccame right up into [Ginsberg\u2019s] face,\u201d screaming and waving his hands about very close to her face, his face so close to her that she \u201ccould feel his spit on [her] face.\u201d When she attempted to leave the kitchen and ran upstairs, Blacker followed her, shouting obscenities and \u201ccalling] [her] terrible names in front of\u201d their son and the aide. She came back downstairs and told Blacker she would call \u201c911\u201d if he did not \u201cget away from [her].\u201d Blacker then left, saying that Ginsberg was a \u201cstupid f n crazy fn bitch.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Ginsberg felt that Blacker had \u201creally lost it [and was] going to snap.\u201d Although she conceded that he had never struck her before, his \u201cviolent streak\u201d had reached the point, given his frightening and \u201cunexplainable\u201d outburst, that she feared \u201cthat he will strike [her] or do something much worse\u201d and that \u201cthe violence is imminent.\u201d She applied for the c. 209A order one and one-half weeks later.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Blacker\u2019s response to Ginsberg\u2019s evidence consisted of vehemently controverting every one of her allegations, denying in particular that he had ever entered the house unannounced, yelled at her, sworn at her, made any threats to her or her family, or raised his hand to her \u201ceven half an inch\u201d (indeed, he protested that he had \u201cnever raised [his] hand to a single human being in [his] Ufe\u201d). He described his conduct during the February 3 incident (about which he admitted he could not recall details) as \u201cjust sort of expressing] . . . frustration\u201d over the supposed haircut, in a normal and \u201cfriendly,\u201d though \u201cstem,\u201d tone of voice. The judge expressly noted that, as Blacker testified about his \u201cfrustration,\u201d \u201che was doing [in court] exactly what [Ginsberg] said he did with his hands,\u201d as to which conduct the judge observed, \u201c[tjhat\u2019s an assault.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>The issue presented is whether the judge could properly conclude that a preponderance of the evidence demonstrated that Blacker had, on February 3, 2005, placed Ginsberg \u201cin fear of imminent serious physical harm,\u201d which constitutes \u201cabuse\u201d justifying the issuance of a protective order under G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3. See <em>Iamele </em>v. <em>Asselin, </em>444 Mass. 734, 735, 739-740 (2005); <em>Uttaro </em>v. <em>Uttaro, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 871, 873-874 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">We note that, for c. 209A purposes, the conduct proscribed as abuse \u201cclosely approximates the common-law description of assault, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>407 Mass. 340, 349 (1990).\u201d <em>Uttaro </em>v. <em>Uttaro, supra </em>at 873. Under the common law, \u201cit is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>well established in this State that an act placing another in reasonable apprehension that force <em>may </em>be used is sufficient for the offense of criminal assault\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>367 Mass. 432, 437 (1975).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cIn determining whether an apprehension of anticipated physical force is reasonable, a court will look to the actions and words of the defendant in light of the attendant circumstances.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, supra </em>at 349. A central feature of c. 209A \u201cabuse\u201d is that the victim\u2019s fear or apprehension caused by the defendant\u2019s words or conduct \u201cmust be more than \u2018subjective and unspecified\u2019; viewed objectively . . . \u2018the plaintiffs apprehension that force may be used [must] be reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Vittone </em>v. <em>Clairmont, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 479, 486 (2005), quoting from <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Kartell, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 83, 86-87 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">We have no difficulty in upholding the judge\u2019s implicit findings that Blacker\u2019s conduct, by word and act, on February 3, 2005, was not only \u201cmenacing by objective standards,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Slaney, </em>345 Mass. 135, 140 (1962), but created an apprehension of imminent serious physical harm on the part of Ginsberg that was objectively reasonable. Blacker\u2019s intimidating behavior toward his ex-wife, as testified to by Ginsberg and credited by the judge, rationally could be interpreted by the judge as \u201ccreating] a picture of a volatile situation in which the possibility of physical abuse was present.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>407 Mass, at 350. Moreover, it readily could be inferred from Blacker\u2019s conduct on February 3, 2005, that Ginsberg, even if she had not expressly so testified, reasonably apprehended that force <em>\u201cmight </em>be used against her\u201d (emphasis added), <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robicheau, </em>421 Mass. 176, 181 (1995), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>at any moment,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> given his increasingly \u201cerratic and unstable behavior\u201d over the recent past that had \u201cescalated\u201d to the point that she felt \u201c[h]e\u2019s going to snap.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The requisite element, that the plaintiff must reasonably apprehend \u201cimminent serious physical harm,\u201d is satisfied by the threat Blacker communicated through his hands flailing in Ginsberg\u2019s face, so close to her that his angry shouting caused his spittle to spray upon her face. While naked hands (and other body parts) are not, as matter of Massachusetts law, dangerous weapons, it has been acknowledged that they may be used to inflict \u201cdisabling or disfiguring injuries,\u201d serious enough to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>warrant a conviction for mayhem (under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 14). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 190, 196 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Blacker contends that Ginsberg could not have reasonably had an imminent fear of serious physical harm at the February 3, 2005, confrontation because he had never physically struck or harmed her during the course of their relationship (a fact Ginsberg conceded). The absence of physical harm prior to the abusive incident may be a factor to be considered in the totality of the circumstances but does not remove Blacker\u2019s conduct on February 3 from the category of abuse. The facts in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>407 Mass. at 341-343, are instructive on this issue. There, the court held that \u201cabuse\u201d as defined in G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 1 (in the context of a prosecution for the defendant\u2019s violation of a c. 209A order to refrain from \u201cabusing\u201d his wife), could be found on the following facts that did not involve any past or contemporaneous physical abuse or violence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">\u201cIn the present case, there was evidence of a verbal outburst between the defendant and [his wife] five days before the incident in question, during which the defendant called his wife a \u2018bitch\u2019 and a \u2018whore.\u2019 [The wife] testified that, at this time, she was \u2018upset,\u2019 and that she \u2018didn\u2019t know what [the defendant] was going to do next.\u2019 At the next meeting between [the wife] and the defendant, on November 15, 1988, the defendant arrived at the house unannounced, and when [his wife] refused to respond to the defendant\u2019s requests that she open the door, the defendant said that [she] was being \u2018immature and ridiculous.\u2019 Despite [his wife\u2019s] obvious unwillingness to speak with him, the defendant left his automobile when she appeared and prevented [her] from closing the front door by propping his back against it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-7\">\u201cIn these circumstances, we cannot say that a jury could not conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that [the wife] entertained a reasonable apprehension that her husband might physically abuse her. The fact that the defendant had violated an order to remain away from the house, the evidence of the tension between the parties, the previous verbal abuse by the defendant, and the defendant\u2019s physi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>cal actions in holding open the door when [his wife] clearly desired to avoid contact could reasonably be combined by the jury to create a picture of a volatile situation in which the possibility of physical abuse was present.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 349-350.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The facts in the instant case \u2014 Blacker\u2019s flying into a rage at an objectively trivial incident (his mistaken perception about his son\u2019s haircut), his pulling at his hair while pacing back and forth, his thrusting of his waving hands into Ginsberg\u2019s face while screaming at her so uncontrollably as to project his saliva into her face, his pursuing her upstairs and downstairs as she tried to avoid his presence, as well as his obscene verbal abuse, all done in the presence of his young son and against the background of his wishing that Ginsberg and her family \u201cshould be shot\u201d for having \u201cruined his Ufe\u201d \u2014 are far more egregiously threatening and violent than those found sufficient to constitute abuse in <em>Gordon.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>The reasonableness of Ginsberg\u2019s apprehension here also contrasts sharply with those cases where the plaintiff\u2019s evidence has failed to establish abuse as defined in G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 1. See, e.g., <em>Larkin </em>v. <em>Ayer Div. of the Dist. Ct. Dept., </em>425 Mass. 1020, 1020-1021 (1997) (sending notices of a future lawsuit and court proceedings insufficient); <em>Wooldridge </em>v. <em>Hickey, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 637, 639-641 (1998) (conclusory assertions of ex-husband\u2019s having been \u201cabusive\u201d and \u201cverbally abusive\u201d without factual details, and with no explanation of why ex-wife felt apprehension of imminent physical harm, except unelabo-rated \u201c[b]ecause,\u201d insufficient); <em>Uttaro </em>v. <em>Uttaro, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. at 874-875 (complainant\u2019s fear of being arrested for violating an outstanding c. 209A order insufficient); <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Kartell, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. at 85-87 (receiving frequent undesired telephone calls and mail from defendant desiring to \u201ccultivate a friendship,\u201d without any menacing language or any menacing gestures by him on the few occasions they were together, insufficient); <em>Szymkowski </em>v. <em>Szymkowski, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 284, 287-288 (2003) (a divorced father\u2019s telling his seven year old daughter about peculiar and frightening dreams, tossing a milk container at her, cuffing her under the chin in irritation, kicking the back of her legs in irritation while both were in bed, and pinching her on the arm and leaving a mark, at various times, might be unacceptable parental behavior meriting modification of his custody and visitation rights under the divorce judgment, but were insufficient to establish c. 209A abuse); <em>Keene </em>v. <em>Gangi, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 667, 669-670 (2004) (placing of hidden video camera in girlfriend\u2019s bedroom by boyfriend who had a temper and occasionally said he could have someone \u201ctaken care of,\u201d insufficient).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The Probate and Family Court judge \u2014 undoubtedly experienced with and sensitive to the unfortunate fact that most litigants involved in family disputes and dissolutions are in turmoil, often angry, in their most unreasonable frames of mind, and at their emotional breaking points \u2014 had the unrivaled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>benefit of observing the parties at close hand, with the commensurate ability to evaluate their credibility, in light not only of their testimony but also of their demeanor in court. See <em>Iamele </em>v. <em>Asselin, </em>444 Mass. at 740; <em>Vittone </em>v. <em>Clairmont, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. at 487. She \u201cwas entitled to credit the testimony of the plaintiff\u201d regarding her fear in the attendant circumstances and \u201cto accept the reasonableness of her perception of that fear as a potential prelude to physical harm, particularly in tight of ... the defendant\u2019s agitated conduct in court.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Pike </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>47 Mass.

They had two children, a daughter who was a college freshman at the time of the hearing, and a thirteen year old son who was disabled and lived with his mother in the marital home, although the parties shared legal custody. The March 4, 2005, order would have expired, without further judicial action, on March 3, 2006, and the record is silent as to its present status. Blacker\u2019s appeal is not moot even if the order did expire. See <em>Frizado </em>v. <em>Frizado, </em>420 Mass. 592, 593-594 (1995); <em>Szymkowski </em>v. <em>Szymkowski, </em>57 Mass.

See <em>Keene </em>v. <em>Gangi, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 667, 667 n.1 (2004). The judge\u2019s questions during the hearing and her ultimate decision make it clear that she credited Ginsberg\u2019s version of the evidence and rejected Blacker\u2019s conflicting testimony, which essentially consisted of denying all of Ginsberg\u2019s charges and describing her affidavit in support of the ex parte order as entirely false (a position which the judge questioned at the hearing). We accord the credibility determinations of the judge who \u201cheard the testimony of the parties . . . [and] observed their demeanor,\u201d <em>Pike </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>47 Mass.

After the February 3, 2005, incident, she changed the locks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b169-6\">On cross-examination, Ginsberg admitted that during the month prior to the February 3 incident there had been a few instances of nonhostile interactions between the parties. Those occasions, however, involved either their joint efforts to assist their children (Blocker\u2019s driving their daughter and Ginsberg to and from the airport, assisting with their daughter\u2019s college application process, staying at the house with the son when Ginsberg was away) or to maintain the marital home (Blocker\u2019s being requested to come to fix a malfunctioning alarm system). Those instances appeared to represent, at best, a truce in their ongoing conflict for their limited mutual self-interest, rather than any warming of relations. Blacker complains in his brief that the judge refused to allow his counsel to cross-examine Ginsberg regarding her allowing him to drive her and the children to visit her relatives on Christmas Eve but does not present a coherent argument that the judge\u2019s action was an abuse of discretion or otherwise erroneous. He also asserts that the trial judge \u201cshowed animus\u201d toward his counsel and \u201cmay have been biased,\u201d but also makes no acceptable appellate argument on the point. Blacker\u2019s brief further mentions the fact that Ginsberg conceded that she was aware that Blacker had recently filed a complaint for modification of his alimony and support obligations, apparently to suggest that Ginsberg was using the protective order process to gain leverage in the modification proceeding, but no evidence supporting that proposition (which would go only to the issue of credibility at the hearing) appears in the record, and no reasoned argument directed to the matter appears in Blacker\u2019s brief. All of these abortive \u201carguments\u201d fail to comply with Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b170-8\">The son\u2019s aide testified to witnessing both the February 3 incident over the haircut and prior yelling between the parties.

[that] put the other in reasonable apprehension of an imminent harmful or offensive contact with his person.\u201d The distinction between civil and criminal assault is that in the latter case the Commonwealth need not prove that the victim was actually in fear or apprehension of harm.

It is quite evident that the defendant unjustifiably intruded himself upon plaintiff by entering the kitchen in which she was at work, and, according to her testimony, became violent in language and threatening in manner. . . . [T]he jury was justified in finding that defendant\u2019s behavior was . . . reasonably calculated to create apprehension of present violence, and a fear that he might go further, and commit a battery upon plaintiff\u2019s person . . .\u201d); <em>Howell </em>v. <em>Winters, </em>58 Wash. 436, 437 (1910) (court approved instruction that \u201cif you believe her testimony that he shook his fist in front of her face angrily and unlawfully, when he was in such proximity to her, as that he could, or might have struck her, also near enough to produce a feeling on her part that she might be struck \u2014 that would be an assault\u201d).

L. c. 209A, \u00a7 1, which would constitute the common-law crime of assault. The facts there were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-8\">\u201cThere were no allegations that the defendant physically harmed the victim, caused her to engage involuntarily in sexual relations, or attempted to do either. Therefore, any violation of the order to refrain from abuse must have been based on an allegation that the defendant placed the victim in fear of imminent serious physical harm. . . . [T]he jury could have found that the defendant had parked his automobile in front of the victim\u2019s home, from which he had been enjoined by court order to remain away. Further, the jury could have found that, when he had previously come to the victim\u2019s residence, she had requested that he leave and informed him that his presence was in violation of the [c.] 209A order. The credible evidence was that on this occasion, when the victim made the same request, the defendant got out of his automobile, stood in the middle of the street in front of her residence, yelled obscene language, and made an obscene gesture. He also made an ambiguous statement that he would do exactly as he pleased. He then drove away with a loud, aggressive display. Soon thereafter, the defendant stated over the telephone that he would kill her. ... In addition, the victim specifically testified that the defendant\u2019s conduct scared and upset her. She also testified that she feared he would carry through his stated intention to kill her. ... In these circumstances, a jury were more than justified in finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim\u2019s fear was reasonable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 181-182.
