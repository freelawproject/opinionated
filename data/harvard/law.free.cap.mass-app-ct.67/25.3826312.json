L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D. Nor is there any dispute that the defendant, who is actually facing deportation as a result of the firearm convictions, is entitled to withdraw his pleas from those two particular indictments. Rather, the chief issue on appeal is whether the judge, who was also the plea judge, erred when she denied the defendant\u2019s mo-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>tian to withdraw his guilty pleas<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to the extent that it also sought to withdraw his plea on the related indictment charging him with receiving stolen property.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>Proof that the court gave an inadequate immigration warning at the time of a defendant\u2019s plea and conviction is not enough to warrant relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D. \u201cThe remedy clause of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D, is triggered only when a defendant can . . . demonstrate that he \u2018may\u2019 become subject to one of the immigration consequences enumerated in the statute. We construe this requirement to mean that a defendant must demonstrate more than a hypothetical risk of such a consequence, but that he actually faces the prospect of its occurring.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Berthold, 441 Mass. 183, 185 (2004). Moreover, the defendant must show a nexus, a \u201cplausible showing of materiality,\u201d between the judge\u2019s defective \u00a7 29D warning and an immigration consequence set out in the statute that materializes as a result of the conviction for which he lacked proper warning. <em>Id. </em>at 186, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Katsirubis, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 132, 138 (1998). Put another way, the inadequacy complained of must be material to the harm for which the extraordinary remedy under the statute is sought. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berthold, supra. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Agbogun, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 206, 207-208 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">In these circumstances, that burden was not met because the defendant failed to establish that he actually faces deportation as a result of his conviction for receiving stolen property. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pryce, </em>429 Mass. 556, 559 (1999) (defendant failed to establish that \u201cthis conviction caused him to be deported\u201d and that the action taken against him was not the result of other offenses considered at the time of his deportation).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On February 12, 1993, the United States Department of Justice is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>sued an \u201cOrder to Show Cause and Notice of Hearing\u201d (order to show cause) to the defendant, alleging that he was subject to deportation based on his March 19, 1992, conviction \u201cfor the offense of unlawful possession of a firearm, in violation of Chapter 269, Section 10 of the Massachusetts General Laws.\u201d No mention is made of the defendant\u2019s related conviction of receiving stolen property. Subsequently, at the deportation hearing held on September 16, 1994, the defendant admitted to the factual allegations of the order to show cause and was found \u201cdeportable as charged\u201d on December 13, 1994. Thus, the record is very clear that the defendant faces deportation as a result of his conviction under G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10, for \u201cunlawful possession of a firearm,\u201d and no other conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Consequently, any prejudice the defendant claims as a result of the inadequate warnings given prior to his separate, although related, conviction for receiving stolen property is merely speculative and insufficient to trigger the remedy under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D. Had the conviction for receiving stolen property been included as the basis for deportation, the defendant\u2019s argument would have been taken out of the realm of the hypothetical. That, however, is not the case before us. <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Nor does it matter that the stolen property consisted of the weapons referenced in the two firearms indictments. Although the charges relate to the same objects, the gravamen of each offense is different. The fact remains that the Federal authorities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>chose to pursue the defendant\u2019s deportation specifically based on \u201cthe offense of unlawful possession of a firearm, in violation of Chapter 269, Section 10 of the Massachusetts General Laws.\u201d That they also could have done so based on the defendant\u2019s conviction of receiving stolen property consisting of firearms is not relevant in the circumstances. It is sufficient that the defendant suffered no adverse immigration consequences as a result of his conviction of that offense.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The order dated June 3, 2004, allowing in part and denying in part the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty pleas is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b54-7\"> Although the defendant styled his motion as one to withdraw his admission to sufficient facts, he in fact pleaded guilty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b54-8\">The \u201cremedy clause\u201d of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D, as amended by St. 1996, c. 450, \u00a7 254, provided that should the court not provide the defendant with the statutory immigration warnings \u201cand he later at any time shows that his plea and conviction may have one of the enumerated consequences, the court, on the defendant\u2019s motion, shall vacate the judgment, and permit the defendant to withdraw the plea of guilty . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b54-9\">At the time of the decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pryce, supra, </em>the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>did not permit an already-deported defendant to challenge the adequacy of the immigration warnings that he had received. General Laws c. 278, \u00a7 29D, has since been amended by St. 2004, c. 225, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, to afford those who plead guilty after its effective date and are subsequently deported the opportunity to seek relief under the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b55-10\">We note that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (2000) states, in relevant part, that \u201c[a]ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.\u201d \u201cAggravated felony\u201d is defined to include \u201ca theft offense (including receipt of stolen property) or burglary offense for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G) (2000). Consequently, there appears to be a statutory basis for Federal authorities to commence deportation proceedings against the defendant due to his related conviction for receiving stolen property. Were such action to be taken, the defendant would face possible deportation as a result of his conviction for that offense. He would then be in a position to argue that he may become subject to one of the immigration consequences enumerated in the statute, a claim that he cannot successfully make at this juncture.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b56-7\">The defendant\u2019s claim that the \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d standard applies to review of the judge\u2019s denial of a motion brought under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D, is without merit. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahadeo, </em>397 Mass. 314, 318 n.5 (1986). Nor did the judge abuse her discretion in denying a hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial where the defendant failed to raise a substantial issue. Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(c)(3), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001). To the extent the defendant raises additional arguments in this appeal challenging the judge\u2019s colloquy and related claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, those claims are unsupported by the record and do not require further discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
