Willis. Although an active participant in the proceedings in the trial court, the trustee took no part in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b474-13\">Perretta, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ah8\">By this action, originally brought in the Superior Court but then transferred to the Probate and Family Court, Anthony Weller (Anthony) sought a declaration as to \u201cwhether he is an eligible distributee under a trust known as the Trust under the Will of Helena C.M. Willis,\u201d established for the benefit of, among others, certain grandnephews and grandnieces of Helena C.M. Willis (Helena), and providing for the eventual distribution of the assets of that trust to their \u201cissue.\u201d Anthony is a nonmarital child of one such grandnephew, and Ann Tagge (Ann) is the marital child of the same grandnephew. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Anthony\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the judge ruled that the term \u201cissue\u201d used by Helena in her will includes children bom out of wedlock. A judgment entered declaring that Anthony was to be treated as an \u201celigible distributee under said tmst, whose rights thereunder shall be identical to those of Ann Tagge.\u201d Ann appeals and argues that the term \u201cissue\u201d used by Helena in her 1955 will must be construed to exclude nonmarital children absent a \u201cclear expression\u201d of a contrary intention, which does not appear in Helena\u2019s will. We reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">1. <em>The relevant undisputed facts. </em>Helena, then eighty-six years of age, executed her will on March 1, 1955.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The tmst was established under Article VTII(2) of the will. As set out in that provision, $10,000 from the income of the tmst was to be paid annually to each of her niece, Matilda B. Weller, and nephew, Donald E. Wilbur, during their lives. The balance of the income was to be divided into five equal parts: one part to be paid to Helena\u2019s niece, Teresa McAleer Finn, during her life if she was living at the time of Helena\u2019s death,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and four parts to be paid to the \u201clegal children\u201d of four other named nieces and nephews living at the time of her death: Matilda B. Weller, Leo F. McAleer, Charles L. McAleer, and John A. McAleer. Upon the death of any of Helena\u2019s grandnephews and grandnieces, \u201ctwo-thirds of the tmst principal of which he or she received the income [was to] be paid in equal shares to his or her issue, per stirpes and not per capita.\u201d The will contains no definition of the word \u201cissue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Helena died in 1960. She was survived by her niece Matilda Weller and Matilda\u2019s two \u201clegal children,\u201d Paul Weller and George A. Weller (George), both of whom were income beneficiaries under Helena\u2019s will. George was a foreign correspondent who spent significant periods of time living and working outside the United States. He married Katherine Deu-pree Weller in Naples, Italy, on July 29, 1932. Two children were bom during their marriage: Ann, who was bom in Naples <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>on July 30, 1932, and Susan, who was born in the United States in October, 1943.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Based on the materials put before him on Anthony\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the judge ruled that Susan was not George\u2019s biological child, a fact that neither party appears to dispute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> George and Katherine were divorced in Nevada in 1944. Four years later, George married his second wife, Charlotte Ebener Weller. No children were bom of that marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">On September 18, 1957, Gladys Lasky Weller gave birth to Anthony Weller in Macon, Georgia. It is undisputed that George and Gladys were never married. Gladys, a British citizen, apparently adopted the name of Weller pursuant to a Deed Poll from the British government.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> George Weller died in Rome, Italy, in 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">In deciding Anthony\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the judge mled that the language of Helena\u2019s will was unambiguous and that the term \u201cissue\u201d as used in Article VIII(2)(c) of the will included children bom out of wedlock. The judge\u2019s determination was based on his reasoning that the language of the will explicitly restricted Helena\u2019s gift to her grandnephews and grandnieces to marital children by her modification of \u201cchildren\u201d with the word \u201clegal.\u201d The judge also reasoned that it could be inferred from the absence of the term \u201clegal\u201d in the provision immediately following that restriction that the term \u201cissue\u201d was intended to include all children, even those bom out of wedlock.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">On appeal, Ann argues that the term \u201cissue\u201d used in a 1955 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>will must be construed to exclude nonmarital children absent a \u201cclear expression\u201d of a contrary intent. She argues that because no such clear expression appears in Helena\u2019s will, Anthony is not entitled to share in any distribution of the assets of the trust created by her will.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>At common law followed in Massachusetts until 1987, the word \u201cissue\u201d used in a will was presumed to <em>exclude </em>nonmarital children. See <em>Hayden </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>172 Mass. 472, 474 (1899); <em>Old Colony Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen. of the U.S., </em>326 Mass. 532, 533 (1950); <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>399 Mass. 650, 661-662 (1987) (overruling <em>Fiduciary Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Mishou, </em>321 Mass. 615, 634-636 [1947]); <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>444 Mass. 487, 494 (2005). The traditional rule of construction was overruled in <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>399 Mass, at 662, where the Supreme Judicial Court held that \u201cthe word \u2018issue,\u2019 absent clear expressions of a contrary intent, must be construed to <em>include </em>all biological descendants\u201d (emphasis added). The court stated that the new rule of construction would apply only prospectively to instruments executed after the date of its opinion, that is, April 16, 1987. <em>Id. </em>at 662-663.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Although the parties do not dispute that when Helena executed her will in 1955, the word \u201cissue\u201d presumptively meant only those \u201cissue\u201d bom into wedlock, they do dispute what must be shown to overcome the legal presumption of exclusion and whether Anthony satisfied that requirement. Those are the issues before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Anthony relies on the phraseology used by the court in 1947 in <em>Fiduciary Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Mishou, </em>321 Mass. at 634. There the court, in its discussion of the traditional mie of construction that children bom out of wedlock were presumptively excluded from taking under a will as \u201cissue,\u201d stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-8\">\u201cIt cannot be doubted that by the common law of a few generations ago such words as issue, children, descendants, and so forth as descriptive of a class in a grant, devise, or legacy, <em>in the absence of anything indicating a contrary intent, </em>meant only persons of the class who were bom in lawful wedlock\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">He reads that statement as an adoption by the court of a less <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>stringent standard for the showing of the intent required to overcome the meaning presumptively ascribed to the term \u201cissue.\u201d Based upon that reading, he argues that the term \u201cissue\u201d is to be construed to exclude nonmarital children only \u201cin the absence of anything indicating a contrary intent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">We do not read <em>Fiduciary Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Mishou, supra, </em>as Anthony does. First, the court in <em>Mishou </em>did not announce that it was adopting a new rule of construction. Second, the shift in the law that is posited by Anthony as implicit in <em>Mishou </em>does not take into account the fact that evidence of a testator\u2019s contrary intent was not there at issue. <em>Fiduciary Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Mishou, </em>321 Mass. at 636 (\u201cNothing appears in [the] . . . will or in the circumstances of the case to indicate that [the testatrix] did not use the word \u2018issue\u2019 in the sense attributed to it by established legal usage\u201d). To the contrary, the principal thrust of <em>Mishou </em>was to reaffirm adherence to the traditional rule of construction. See <em>ibid:, Powers </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>399 Mass. at 655.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Although appellate decisions have quoted the <em>Mishou </em>formulation of the traditional rule of construction, see <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>399 Mass. at 654; <em>C.C. </em>v. <em>A.B., </em>406 Mass. 679, 683-684 (1990); <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>444 Mass. at 494, none has decided the precise question of the showing required to overcome the traditional presumptive construction of the word \u201cissue\u201d or determined the sufficiency of evidence probative of a testator\u2019s contrary intent on facts similar to those before us or are otherwise inconsistent with our conclusion. See generally <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>399 Mass. at 654 (construing the word \u201cissue\u201d used in a trust to exclude nonmarital children where \u201cnothing indicate[d] an intent by the donor to include nonmarital issue\u201d); <em>C.C. </em>v. <em>A.B., </em>406 Mass at 683-684 (refering to traditional rule of construction in context of general discussion of historic legal status of nonmarital children); <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>444 Mass, at 493-494 (considering whether evidence of testatrix\u2019s intent to include adopted issue was sufficiently plain to overcome statutory presumption under former version of G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 8, against inclusion of a person not adopted by the testator).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">In interpreting the language used by Helena, we are guided by the well-established principle that \u201ca trust instrument must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>be construed to give effect to the intention of the donor as ascertained from the language of the whole instrument considered in the light of circumstances known to the donor at the time of its execution.\u201d <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>399 Mass. at 653, quoting from <em>Groden </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>382 Mass. 333, 335 (1981). Application of that tenet leads us to conclude that Helena did not express a clear intention to include nonmarital children within the term \u201cissue\u201d under Article VIII(2) of her will.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The record establishes that Anthony was bom two years after the date of Helena\u2019s will and codicil. Anthony points to nothing, nor could we find anything, in the record to show that Helena was aware of his birth prior to her death and specifically intended to include him in her will. Cf. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Hannam, </em>369 Mass. 26, 32 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Anthony first contends that even if Helena was unaware of his existence, she was surely aware of Susan\u2019s birth and the fact that she was not George Weller\u2019s biological child. Based upon that allegation, which is unsupported by any evidence, Anthony argues that by using the word \u201cissue,\u201d Helena intended to exclude those not of her bloodline, i.e., Susan, and to include persons related by blood, including nonmarital children such as himself. This argument fails for the reason that it is based upon conjecture and not evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Next, Anthony argues that the language of Helena\u2019s will manifests her intent to recognize nonmarital children as issue. As earlier recited, Helena used the words \u201clegal children\u201d in her will in describing the class of income beneficiaries, i.e., her grandnephews and grandnieces, under the trust but then provided that upon their deaths, \u201ctwo-thirds of the trust principal of which he or she received the income [was to] be paid in equal shares to his or her issue, per stirpes and not per capita.\u201d Relying on Helena\u2019s use of the words \u201clegal children\u201d in one instance and her use of the word \u201cissue\u201d in a subsequent provision, Anthony argues that Helena specifically excluded non-marital children from the class of income beneficiaries while including nonmarital children, that is, \u201cissue,\u201d in the eventual distribution of the assets of the bust. This argument has been rejected in cases involving the interpretation of wills governed by a mie of statutory construction, similar to the rule applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>to Helena\u2019s will of 1955, that is, that the word \u201cissue\u201d as used in a will was presumed to exclude nonmarital children.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Under a former version of G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 8, the word \u201cchild\u201d or its equivalent used in a will or trust excluded adopted children where the settlor or testator was not the adopting parent unless it \u201cplainly appear[ed]\u201d to have been his intent to include an adopted child.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Hannam, </em>369 Mass. at 31-32, a granddaughter adopted almost seventeen years after the testator\u2019s death argued that the testator\u2019s specific exclusion of his own adopted daughter and her issue in his 1926 will was indication of an intent to include other adopted issue wherever they were not expressly excluded. The court rejected that argument as insufficient to show the sort of clear manifestation necessary to warrant a conclusion that the testator had used the word \u201cissue\u201d in a manner inconsistent with its commonly accepted legal definition. <em>Ibid. </em>See <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 509, 514 (1991) (ability to raise rational inference on the basis of textual interpretation insufficient to meet \u201cplainly appears\u201d standard of the pre-1958 version of G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 8).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">In short, when Helena executed her will in 1955, the word \u201cissue\u201d did not include nonmarital children. It is more than reasonable to infer from her testamentary documents that they were drafted with the assistance of counsel, rendering it equally if not more likely that the term was used in accordance with its usual meaning, see <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Wilbur, </em>431 Mass. 429, 436 (2000), and that had she wanted to include nonmarital children in the distribution of trust assets, she would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>have done so in a more clear manner consistent with the then controlling law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Hannam, </em>369 Mass. at 31-32; <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>444 Mass. at 495-496.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the above-discussed reasons, the judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the Probate and Family Court for entry of a judgment declaring that Anthony Weller is not an eligible distributee under the trust under the will of Helena C.M. Willis.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Helena executed a codicil on March 30, 1955, which did not affect the provisions of the will at issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b475-8\">Teresa McAleer Finn predeceased Helena in 1959.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b476-9\">Susan predeceased George in 1996. Her estate is not a party to this action. In support of his motion for summary judgment, Anthony submitted what he purports to be the affidavit of George in which he, George, states that Susan was not his biological child and acknowledges Anthony as his son. While disputing the authenticity of the affidavit, Ann does not appear to question that Susan was not George\u2019s biological child. She did, however, dispute Anthony\u2019s contention that Susan was not George\u2019s \u201cissue\u201d under Helena\u2019s will.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b476-10\">We could find nothing in the record to support the judge\u2019s statement in his memorandum of decision that the parties agreed that George had a son, Anthony, \u201cbom out of wedlock.\u201d Ann disputes that Anthony is George Weller\u2019s child, and argues that she \u201cdeferred\u201d that dispute in order to obtain a ruling on whether an illegitimate child can take under Helena\u2019s will and trust as matter of law. The record supports her position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b480-7\">As inserted by St. 1876, c. 213, \u00a7 9, G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 8, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">\u201cThe word \u2018child,\u2019 or its equivalent, in a grant, trust settlement, entail, devise or bequest shall include a child adopted by the settlor, grantor or testator, unless the contrary plainly appears by the terms of the instrument; but if the settlor, grantor or testator is not himself the adopting parent, the child by adoption shall not have, under such instrument, the rights of a child bom in lawful wedlock to the adopting parent, unless it plainly appears to have been the intention of the settlor, grantor or testator to include an adopted child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">This statutory rule of construction was reversed by St. 1958, c. 121, \u00a7 1. See <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>444 Mass. at 492, where the court held that \u201c[e]ver since\u201d the 1958 amendment, \u201cthe term \u2018child\u2019 or its equivalent in a testator\u2019s will has included an adopted child, absent a clearly stated contrary intent, regardless of who adopted the child.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Our conclusion makes it unnecessary to consider Ann\u2019s additional arguments, as we understand them, all to the effect that the judge\u2019s rulings and decision were motivated by a personal bias in favor of nonmarital children.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
