We affirm the judgment denying Croak\u2019s complaint for modification and directing him to pay to his former wife, Lorraine Bergeron, accrued child support in the amount of $118,640.76.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>1. <em>Background. </em>The parties were married on December 13, 1991, and were divorced on April 2, 1998. Two children were bom of the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Prior to the present controversy, Croak\u2019s support obligations had been the subject of various orders. A separation agreement incorporated into the final divorce judgment required Croak to pay weekly child support of $240. In April, 1999, while a complaint for modification filed by Bergeron was pending, the parties agreed that Croak would pay an additional $270 per week as alimony, thus increasing Croak\u2019s total support obligation to $510 per week. After a trial on Bergeron\u2019s complaint, a judge of the Probate and Family Court, applying the Child Support Guidelines (guidelines), entered a judgment of modification on October 6, 1999, increasing child support to $969.54 per week.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">On March 14, 2000, Croak filed the present complaint for modification seeking to reduce his child support obligation due to his alleged involuntary unemployment. On September 13, 2000, a temporary order was issued by a second probate judge, reducing the child support payment to $156.92 per week, but directing that the balance of the $969.54 was to continue to accrue until a hearing on the merits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">After a trial on Croak\u2019s complaint for modification,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>second judge found that Croak has a consistent history of working in the nuclear power industry although he, at times, has experienced periods of unemployment. The judge noted, however, that Croak had \u201ccarefully orchestrated his periods of unemployment to coincide with court appearances so that he [could] report that he [was] unemployed at that point in time and thereby evade the payment of guidelines support.\u201d Continuing, the judge found that in the year 2000 Croak\u2019s \u201caggregate gross income from all sources includable under the . . . Guidelines [including wages, business income, premature Individual Retirement Account (IRA) distributions in the amount of $64,159, and proceeds received by Croak in the amount of $60,000 in settlement of a claim against his father\u2019s estate <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> ]was $187,365.00 or $76,756.00 more than he made in 1999, the year in which the [earlier] modification judgment was entered.\u201d For the year 2001, Croak reported on his Federal tax return a reduced gross income of $56,206 (including a premature IRA distribution of $12,193), but, the judge stated, he \u201ccould also live on the substantial assets accumulated at the end of 2000.\u201d The judge found that Croak\u2019s aggregate gross income for 2002 was $120,703, which sum included a trust distribution of $50,000 that Croak received as an inheritance from a relative.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In 2003, Croak\u2019s total earnings, considered to July 8, 2003, amounted to $4,272. In summary, the judge stated that since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>September 13, 2000, when his support order was temporarily reduced, Croak had received $447,700 in \u201cincome and assets\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> while Bergeron and the children had struggled to meet their living expenses on a tiny fraction of that amount. On these facts, and others (which we shall discuss, <em>infra), </em>the judge concluded that Croak had failed to demonstrate a material change in circumstances and, in fact, had \u201cwrongfully and considerably benefitted from the reduction in his child support during the pendency of this action.\u201d By a judgment dated November 19, 2003, the probate judge denied Croak\u2019s complaint for modification and ordered him to pay $118,640.76 to Bergeron, said sum representing the child support accrued ($964 per week minus $156.92 per week) during the 147-week period from September 13, 2000, to July 8, 2003 (the date of the Rhode Island support order, which was issued shortly before the hearing on the merits of Croak\u2019s complaint).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Croak has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>Croak argues that the judgment must be reversed as the judge grossly overstated for guidelines purposes his (Crook\u2019s) income during the three-year period under review. More specifically, he asserts that (1) it was error for the judge to count as <em>income </em>the one-time payments received by him from the settlement and the trust distribution or inheritance, and (2) it was improper \u201cdouble counting\u201d to treat funds prematurely withdrawn from his IRAs as income for child support purposes as those funds had already been divided as part of the marital estate upon divorce. He requests that the matter be remanded to the Probate and Family Court for a recalculation of child support based on \u201cthe correct income figures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>\u201c[Cjhild support is controlled by G.

Although a purpose of the guidelines is to \u201cencourage joint parental responsibility for child support in proportion to, or as a percentage of, <em>income </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>. . .\u201d (emphasis supplied),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Child Support Guidelines, preamble; see <em>Crowe </em>v. <em>Fong, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 673, 677 (1998); <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 568, 575 (2002), we have stated that the \u201cguidelines indicate that a judge is to consider the totality of the parties\u2019 circumstances in determining their support obligations.\u201d <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 716, 723 (1997). See <em>Schuler </em>v. <em>Schuler, </em>382 Mass. 366, 373-376 (1981) (a pre-guidelines case); <em>Bassette </em>v. <em>Bartolucci, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 732, 736-737 (1995); <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Piela, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 731, 734-735 (2004). See also Kindregan &amp; Inker, Family Law and Practice \u00a7 39.7 (3d ed. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">In the instant matter, it is apparent that the judge considered the \u201ctotality of the parties\u2019 circumstances\u201d in dismissing Croak\u2019s complaint for modification. At the outset, it is to be emphasized that notwithstanding the judge\u2019s findings concerning Croak\u2019s earned income during the three years in question, the judge found that Croak had a pattern of nondisclosure and evasion with respect to his finances and, as we have indicated, that he carefully orchestrated his periods of unemployment to coincide with court appearances so that he could evade the payment of guidelines support. See <em>Crowe </em>v. <em>Fong, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. at 678-679 (judge entitled to draw inferences adverse to an evasive party from uncertainties attending that party\u2019s financial affairs); <em>Salten </em>v. <em>Ackerman, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 868, 872-873 (2005) (in determining the amount of child support, the judge could take into account the husband\u2019s evasiveness as to finances). Although the judge did not attribute to Croak a specific amount of additional income, as a judge may when she determines that a party is earning substantially less than he or she could through reasonable effort, see Child Support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>Guidelines II-H; <em>Flaherty </em>v. <em>Flaherty, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 289, 291 (1996); <em>Crowe </em>v. <em>Fong, supra </em>at 679-680, the judge\u2019s findings, taken together, suggest strongly the view that Croak may have forgone (or manipulated) employment opportunities and that the income reported by him may not reflect the income he was capable of earning.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">The judge also considered the settlement and the inheritance received by Croak as well as the straitened financial circumstances of Bergeron and the children. While acknowledging that the judge was \u201ccertainly entitled\u201d to consider the inheritance and settlement proceeds received by him subsequent to the divorce in determining his ability to pay child support, Croak asserts that \u201cthese distributions should have been treated not as income, but as assets, with [only] the income attributable to such assets considered in determining the appropriate level of child support.\u201d See <em>Crowe </em>v. <em>Fong, supra </em>at 679 (judge would have been justified in treating at least $75,000 of $115,000 that the father received when he liquidated his business interests as available to him to produce interest income of approximately $115 per week for purposes of calculating his support obligation). See also Child Support Guidelines I-A(22) (including as a source of \u201cincome,\u201d <em>\u201cincome </em>from interest in an estate [direct or through a trust]\u201d [emphasis supplied]). Implicit in Croak\u2019s argument is the proposition that the judge could not consider as income for guidelines purposes the inheritance or settlement itself.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">Notwithstanding the judge\u2019s findings that the settlement and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>inheritance proceeds were includable in their entirety as income under the guidelines (a proposition we find troubling in view of the nonperiodic nature of the distributions), we think it is apparent that the judge had in mind that Croak had substantial <em>resources </em>upon which he could draw to pay child support during the three years under review. Indeed, the judge referred specifically in her findings and rationale to Croak\u2019s ability to \u201clive on\u201d his <em>assets </em>and to the substantial \u201cincome and assets\u201d (emphasis supplied) he had received during the years in question. Even were we to assume that the one-time inheritance and settlement distributions should not have been included as \u201cincome\u201d for purposes of the guidelines, the judge was not precluded from considering, as she did, the entire amount of those \u201cassets\u201d (not merely the income the assets could generate) in determining whether to modify Croak\u2019s child support obligation. Cf. <em>Crowe </em>v. <em>Fong, supra </em>(judge not limited to considering the income that the father could earn on $75,000 that he received upon liquidation of his business interests; \u201c[i]t would have been permissible to treat the $75,000 as a fund out of which weekly support payments were to be made\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Such an approach is consistent not only with the pre-guidelines principle that a party\u2019s \u201cownership of a valuable asset demonstrates ability to pay,\u201d <em>Schuler </em>v. <em>Schuler, </em>382 Mass. at 375 (modification action), quoting from <em>Krokyn </em>v. <em>Krokyn, </em>378 Mass. 206, 213-214 (1979), but with the express policies of the guidelines \u201c[t]o provide the standard of living the child would have enjoyed had the family been intact\u201d and \u201c[t]o meet the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>child\u2019s survival needs in the first instance, but to the extent either parent enjoys a higher standard of living to entitle the child to enjoy that higher standard.\u201d Child Support Guidelines, preamble. A consideration of resources would seem particularly appropriate in the instant matter in view of Croak\u2019s use of his assets to support himself (and for other purposes beneficial to him) during, as found by the judge, his orchestrated periods of unemployment, while Bergeron and the children struggled to defray their living expenses.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It is for the judge, in the exercise of her discretion upon consideration of all the circumstances, to determine how substantial the assets possessed by a support provider must be (in circumstances where the support provider has otherwise experienced a decrease in income) to justify the dismissal of a modification complaint. <em>Schuler </em>v. <em>Schuler, </em>382 Mass, at 375.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Finally, we perceive nothing in Croak\u2019s argument that the judge engaged in improper \u201cdouble counting\u201d (or \u201cdouble dipping\u201d) by treating his IRA funds \u201cas both assets in the property division[<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>] and later, as income when Croak liquidated them,\u201d that would cause us to disturb the judgment.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \u201cCommentators use the phrase \u2018double dipping\u2019 to describe the seeming injustice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>that occurs when property is awarded to one spouse in an equitable distribution of marital assets and is then also considered as a source of income for purposes of imposing support obligations.\u201d <em>Champion </em>v. <em>Champion, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 215, 219 (2002). <em>Sampson </em>v. <em>Sampson, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 366, 373-374 (2004). <em>Adlakha </em>v. <em>Adlakha, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 860, 865 (2006). See <em>Dalessio </em>v. <em>Dalessio, </em>409 Mass. 821, 828 (1991), <em>S.C., </em>413 Mass. 1007 (1992). Although \u201c[cjourts and commentators have often disagreed ... as to what constitutes double-dipping,\u201d <em>Sampson </em>v. <em>Sampson, supra </em>at 374, we have stated that there is nothing in the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s <em>Da-lessio </em>decision, <em>supra, </em>or in G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> that prohibits double dipping as matter of law. See <em>Champion </em>v. <em>Champion, supra </em>at 222. Rather, as Croak acknowledges in his brief, the judge must look to the equities of the situation to make her determination. See <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Even were we to assume that the concept of double counting has application in the present case, and were to assume further that the judge engaged in some double counting, we would conclude that, in the circumstances presented here (including, as we have discussed, Croak\u2019s use of his IRA funds as a replacement for earnings and for his own support and benefit during his periods of unemployment, and the parties\u2019 disparate economic positions), a failure to consider the IRAs would have resulted in an inequity. See <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">Upon review of the totality of the circumstances, and giving due deference to the discretion accorded the judge, we conclude that the judge did not err in dismissing Croak\u2019s complaint for modification.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">\n<em>Order denying postjudgment motions affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b779-8\">The child support modification in 1999 was based upon the judge\u2019s calculation of Croak\u2019s income for the period from September 28, 1998, when he resumed work in the nuclear power industry after a period of unemployment, to July 9, 1999, in the amount of $2,609.49 per week. The amount of support was allocated as $918.54 per week for child support and $51 per week for health insurance costs. The judge found that Croak had been paying substantially less in child support than the amount called for by the guidelines.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b779-9\">The second judge mistakenly stated in her temporary order, and later in her findings and judgment, that the earlier modification judgment called for a combined payment of $964 per week. Neither party makes an issue of the point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b779-10\">Jurisdictional issues arose in the matter as Bergeron and the children had moved to Rhode Island, but the modification action was ultimately heard in Massachusetts, where Croak resided at the time he filed his complaint. Cf. <em>Klingel </em>v. <em>Reill, </em>446 Mass. 80, 86-87 (2006). After resolving the present action, the judge determined that \u201cRhode Island is the appropriate [jurisdiction] to resolve all future child support and custody matters between the parties.\u201d Bergeron has been receiving child support pursuant to a Rhode Island court order dated July 8, 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b779-11\">At trial, Croak, through counsel, requested that the judge take an average of the income he had earned during the three years between the issuance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>the temporary order and the hearing on the merits and, applying that average amount, as well as the average income received by Bergeron, to the guidelines, conclude that the amount of child support which should have been paid to Bergeron during the period under review was $133 per week.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b780-9\">Croak testified that his mother and father had owned as joint tenants a home in Massachusetts. After his parents\u2019 deaths (his mother predeceased his father), Croak learned that he had been \u201cdisinherited from the property.\u201d Croak brought a claim against the estate and eventually received a settlement from the estate which he characterized at trial as one \u201cfor previous improvements to a property where I was situated.\u201d Although Croak testified that he actually received about $40,000 from the settlement proceeds, after the payment of attorney\u2019s fees, he provided no supporting documentation concerning the amount of attorney\u2019s fees he paid and he makes no reference in his brief to the payment of attorney\u2019s fees. In all events, the judge\u2019s findings reflect that the judge was cognizant of Croak\u2019s claim that he had paid $20,000 to his attorneys.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b780-10\">Earlier in her findings the judge stated that Croak\u2019s aggregate gross income for 2002 from all sources includable under the guidelines was $103,042. This figure was based, in part, on Croak\u2019s 1099 and W-2 forms which showed earned income of $53,042. (Croak failed to produce his prepared, but not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>filed, 2002 Federal tax return in response to a subpoena served in hand.) The judge later found, however, that Croak represented on his most recent financial statement, dated October 17, 2003, which is not included in the record appendix, that his income in 2002 (apart from his inheritance) was $70,703.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b781-9\">Although Croak does not challenge in his brief the amount found by the judge, it is difficult to discern on the record before us how the judge arrived at the figure. In all events, even if the income and assets amount was somewhat lower, it would not change the result that we reach in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b781-13\">Croak filed a motion for new trial that was denied. He also filed a motion for relief from judgment. Although no action appears formally to have been taken on the motion for relief from judgment, as that motion is identical to the motion for new trial, Croak assumes, as do we, that the judge treated the two motions as a single motion and denied them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b782-5\">We have noted that there is a slight difference in certain of the standards set forth in \u00a7 28 and the guidelines. See <em>Crowe </em>v. <em>Fong, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 673, 677 &amp; n.3 (1998). Croak does not address those differences on the appeal and does not challenge the judge\u2019s citation to \u00a7 28 for the proposition that an order for child support may be modified where the judge finds that a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties has occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b782-6\">The guidelines provide, in the preamble: \u201cThere shall be a presumption that these guidelines apply, absent agreement of the parties, in all cases seeking the establishment or modification of a child support order. A specific, written finding that the guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate and that the best interests of the child have been considered in a particular case shall be sufficient to rebut the presumption in that case.\u201d The guidelines further provide that \u201c[a] modification may be allowed upon showing a discrepancy of 20% or more between an established order and a proposed new order calculated under these guidelines. The presumption establishing a proposed new order may be rebutted in cases where the amount of support required under the guidelines is due to the fact that the amount of the current support order resulted from a rebuttal of the guideline amount or by an allowance of an agreement of the parties and there has not been a change in the circumstances which resulted in a rebuttal of the guideline amount.\u201d Child Support Guidelines, preamble. The guidelines (effective February 15, 2002) also recite that they are not meant to apply where the combined gross income of the parties exceeds $135,000 or where the gross income of the noncustodial parent exceeds $100,000. Child Support Guidelines II-C. (The guidelines previously set the income limits at the $75,000/$100,000 level.) In cases where the parties\u2019 income exceeds these limits, the judge is to consider the award of support at the $100,000/$135,000 level as a minimum presumptive level of support to be awarded. <em>Ibid. </em>Additional amounts of child support may be awarded at the judge\u2019s discretion. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b783-6\">The guidelines define income as \u201cgross income from whatever source,\u201d including, but not limited to, twenty-six named sources of income (e.g., salaries and wages, bonuses, insurance benefits [including those received for disability and personal injury], income from trusts, contractual agreements, capital gains in real and personal property transactions to the extent that they represent a regular source of income, perquisites or in kind compensation to the extent that they represent a regular source of income, income from interest in an estate [direct or through a trust], lottery or gambling winnings received either in a lump sum or in the form of an annuity, and prizes or awards). Child Support Guidelines I-A. See <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Merida, </em>428 Mass. 182, 187 (1998) (describing the definition of income contained in the guidelines as \u201cbroad[]\u201d)_</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b784-7\">There is a split among the jurisdictions as to the treatment of inheritances for purposes of the guidelines (which guidelines vary, to some extent, from State to State). \u201cIn some jurisdictions, the entire amount of the inheritance is included as gross income for purposes of determining child support. Other states, however, have held that only the interest generated by the inheritance constitutes gross income. A third approach, adopted in New York, is to treat inheritances as a factor in deviating from the basic child support obligation and awarding additional child support [citations omitted].\u201d <em>Cody </em>v. <em>Evans-Cody, </em>291 A.D.2d 27, 30-31 (N.Y. 2001) (there is statutory authority in New York authorizing a court to allocate a portion of a parent\u2019s inheritance to child support). At least one jurisdiction has adopted a hybrid approach, treating only that portion of an inheritance that a parent withdrew and spent as gross income, and the remainder of the inheritance as an interest-generating asset. See <em>In re A.M.D., </em>78 P.3d 741, 743, 746 (Colo. 2003). See also Morgan, Child Support Guidelines: Interpretation and Application \u00a7 2.03 [e] [4] (2006), and cases cited. Similarly, the courts of other jurisdictions have not always been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>uniform in their treatment of certain settlement proceeds. See, e.g., <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 2.03[e][7], and cases cited. In the instant matter, the judge simply cited to the guidelines for the proposition that \u201cincome is defined as gross income from whatever source.\u201d See note 11, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b785-6\">To the extent a consideration of available resources may involve some deviation from the guidelines, see <em>Cody </em>v. <em>Evans-Cody, </em>291 A.D.2d at 30-31; <em>Humphreys </em>v. <em>DeRoss, </em>567 Pa. 614, 624-625 (2002) (although under Pennsylvania\u2019s guidelines the corpus of an inheritance is not included in income, the guidelines provide that an asset, such as an inheritance, may be considered in deciding whether to deviate from the presumptive amount of support determined by the guidelines), we think it is implicit in the judge\u2019s findings and rationale that she was of the opinion that a substantial reduction in child support (as requested by Croak) based solely on Croak\u2019s alleged income would be unjust or inappropriate in the circumstances and not in the best interests of the child. See <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. at 723.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b786-6\">The judge found that Bergeron\u2019s total combined earned income, alimony, and unemployment income reported by her on her 2000, 2001, and 2002 tax returns was $64,339. Bergeron testified that since September 13, 2000, she has had difficulty making ends meet and has, on occasion, resorted to going to a \u201cfood pantry\u201d to obtain free food. She also testified that she could not pay her health insurance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b786-7\">The court did not hold in <em>Schuler </em>v. <em>Schuler, supra, </em>that a support provider would have to deplete his total liquid or other assets in an effort to meet his support obligations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b786-8\">Although the parties\u2019 separation agreement and the divorce judgment are not included in the record appendix, neither party appears to dispute that Croak was assigned certain IRAs at the time of the divorce. (Croak testified that while he had $360,000 in \u201cretirement funds\u201d at the time of the divorce, he had spent those funds by the time of the modification trial in October, 2003). It is not clear whether Croak made additional contributions to his IRAs in 1998 or 1999, subsequent to the divorce (contributions which, if made, could not form the basis of a claim of double counting). As we have stated, Croak has not included in the record appendix the financial statement dated October 17, 2003, that he submitted to the court and which was referred to by the judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b786-9\">Croak does not argue in any meaningful way that an IRA distribution per se cannot be included as income for purposes of the guidelines.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b787-9\">The present case is an action to modify child support under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b787-10\">Croak raises no argument in his brief that he does not have the ability to comply with the judge\u2019s order for the payment of the accrued child support.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
