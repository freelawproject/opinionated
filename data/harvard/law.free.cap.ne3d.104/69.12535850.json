For the reasons set forth below, this court finds appellant was denied a fair trial because of the admission of prejudicial other acts evidence pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B). This court further finds the evidence presented is not sufficient to support appellant's convictions as a matter of law. Therefore, we reverse the trial court's judgments and vacate appellant's convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On September 25, 2014, appellant was indicted by the Ashtabula County Grand Jury on ten counts involving a home invasion with three separate victims, Heather Marx, Matthew Carnes, and Abigail Grubbs: three counts of aggravated robbery (counts one through three), felonies of the first degree, in violation of R.C. 2911.01(A)(1) ; one count of aggravated burglary (count four), a felony of the first degree, in violation of R.C. 2911.11(A)(2) ; three counts of felonious assault (counts\n   five through seven), felonies of the second degree, in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2) ; and three counts of kidnapping (counts eight through ten), felonies of the first degree, in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(2). Each count carried a firearm specification. Appellant was represented by counsel, pleaded not guilty to all charges, and waived her right to a speedy trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On November 2, 2015, appellee, the state of Ohio, filed a notice of intention to use other acts evidence pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B) and R.C. 2945.59 to show appellant's identity, knowledge, absence of mistake, common scheme or plan, and modus operandi. Specifically, the state sought to present evidence of other home invasions in which appellant was the getaway driver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In response, appellant filed a motion to exclude any evidence related to other crimes, wrongs, or acts. Appellant asserted that the other acts evidence contains many significant factual differences from the instant case, is very highly prejudicial to her, and undermines her rights to due process and a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The trial court subsequently found the evidence to be admissible and permitted the state to use other acts evidence during the jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On January 19, 2016, the state filed a motion for joinder, Case Nos. 2014 CR 00564 (involving appellant) and 2014 CR 00571 (involving appellant's co-defendant Marcus Lashley). Appellant and co-defendant Lashley filed separate responses. In appellant's response, she indicated that undue prejudice would result from joinder because she and her co-defendant would be asserting antagonistic defenses which are mutually exclusive to each other, and that the defenses would likely differ to an extent that would confuse the jury at appellant's expense. Nevertheless, following a hearing, the trial court ordered the matters be joined into a single action for purposes of trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 7} A jury trial commenced on September 27, 2016. The state submitted 74 exhibits and the following ten witnesses testified on its behalf: Officers Thomas Simcich, Chris Mackensen, and Denny Moore with the Conneaut Police Department (\"CPD\"); Detective Michael Sullivan with the CPD; Detective William Felt, Jr. with the Ashtabula City Police Department (\"ACPD\"); Lieutenant Dennis Dibble with the ACPD; Special Agent Edward Lulla with the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation (\"BCI\"); forensic scientist Emily Feldenkris with BCI; Heather Marx, a victim; and Alyssa Hill, Highland Place Apartments property manager.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Heather Marx and her young son lived at Highland Place Apartments, 446 West Main Road, Apartment 101, Conneaut, Ohio. Matthew Carnes is Marx's boyfriend. Abigail Grubbs is Marx's friend and babysitter to her son. On January 26, 2014, Marx was in her apartment with her son, her son's friend, and Grubbs. Marx later left to pick up Carnes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 9} When they returned, the apartment was dark. Marx walked to the bedroom and was hit on the head several times by one of two assailants, who were wearing masks. She passed out. When Marx awoke, she had been tied up with belts and the men were gone. Her phone and car keys were missing. Carnes and Grubbs were also injured.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Officer Simcich was dispatched to Marx's apartment regarding a report of a home invasion by two masked African American men with handguns. Upon his arrival, Officer Simcich observed Marx\n   with a laceration on her forehead and blood on her hair and clothing. Marx was crying and extremely distraught. Marx indicated she was assaulted by one of the two masked men. The apartment was in disarray.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On cross-examination, Officer Simcich testified that he had to be \"buzzed into\" Marx's apartment building. He also stated there were no signs of forced entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Officer Mackensen provided back-up assistance. He confirmed the condition of the apartment occupants. While outside, Officer Mackensen noticed footprints in the snow which he followed across Route 20 to 445 West Main. The trail led to a parking lot with some tire tracks and what appeared to be the contents of an ashtray emptied on the ground. Officer Mackensen secured the scene and pointed out the potential evidence to Detective Sullivan, who arrived about 30 minutes later. A cigarette butt and a napkin cutting were sent for testing. Appellant was later contacted and gave a DNA sample. Forensic scientist Feldenkris with BCI confirmed the DNA profile from the cigarette butt and napkin cutting was consistent with appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 13} On cross-examination, Officer Mackensen indicated the footprints in the snow were not tied to any person or pair of shoes. He also said no one saw who made the footprints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Alyssa Hill, the apartment property manager, authenticated a video of the outside area of the apartment building which was played in open court. Detective Sullivan pointed out that the video showed two individuals entering the apartment, a vehicle pulling into the parking lot, and two individuals leaving the apartment and running away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 15} On cross-examination, Detective Sullivan testified it appeared the two individuals entered the apartment building by merely opening the door, which meant that someone in one of the twelve units had \"buzzed\" them in. No indication of the identity of the two individuals, including gender and race, was able to be made from the video.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 16} The next day, January 27, 2014, Detective Felt was dispatched to the scene of a double murder on Norman Avenue, Ashtabula, Ohio. Footprints in the snow at this crime scene were followed. Some torn clothing and blood from the top of a fence were found. Special Agent Lulla with BCI was dispatched. BCI confirmed the DNA profile of the blood belonged to co-defendant Lashley. Also found and recovered was a knit hat. BCI confirmed the DNA profile of the hat belonged to Taquan Mathers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 17} During the investigation of the Norman Avenue murders, appellant was implicated as a suspect in that case as well as in another incident on Hiawatha Avenue, Ashtabula, Ohio. Authorities were looking for a silver four-door SUV thought to be involved in the Norman Avenue murders. A vehicle of a similar make, model, and color registered to appellant's mother, Michelle Bernard, was located but never searched.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 18} At the close of the state's case, appellant's counsel moved for an acquittal pursuant to Crim.R. 29. The trial court dismissed counts one and three (aggravated robbery), five and seven (felonious assault), and eight and ten (kidnapping) relating to the alleged victims, Matthew Carnes and Abigail Grubbs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Appellant did not testify and presented no witnesses. Appellant's counsel renewed its Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal regarding the remaining counts, which was overruled by the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Following trial, the jury found appellant guilty on count two (aggravated robbery), count four (aggravated burglary), count six (felonious assault), and count nine (kidnapping) relating to the victim, Heather Marx. The jury found appellant not guilty of any of the firearm specifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Co-defendant Lashley was acquitted of all charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 22} The trial court merged appellant's counts two and four for purposes of final conviction and sentencing. Appellant was sentenced to five years in prison on count four, three years on count six, and five years on count nine. Counts four and nine were ordered to run concurrently with one another and consecutively with count six for a total prison sentence of eight years, with 211 days of credit for time served. The court advised appellant that upon her release from prison, she will have a period of post-release control for five years. Appellant filed a timely appeal and asserts the following three assignments of error:\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 23} \"[1.] The trial court erred to the prejudice of Appellant when it allowed Appellee to submit other bad acts evidence pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 24} \"[2.] The verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence and the sufficiency of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 25} \"[3.] The trial court erred when entering inconsistent verdicts against Appellant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 26} In her first assignment of error, appellant argues the trial court erred in allowing the state to submit other bad acts evidence pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 27} \"[A]ppellate review of a trial court's decision regarding the admissibility of other crimes, wrongs, or acts under Evid.R. 404(B) is conducted under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Specifically, the state sought to present evidence of other home invasions in which appellant was the getaway driver.

The state presented no other evidence to the jury about any other involvement with respect to appellant in\n   this case. Again, the trail in the snow led to a parking lot with some tire tracks and what appeared to be the contents of an ashtray emptied on the ground.

There was no testimony, however, that appellant was seen driving that vehicle near the scene of the Norman Avenue homicides or that she\n   <em>\n    ever\n   </em>\n   drove that vehicle, let alone as a getaway driver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 70} The State then attempted to elicit testimony about another murder, closely related in time, on Hiawatha Avenue. When the detective was asked how appellant was involved in that case, he began to respond, stating she was \"identified as the driver of the-\"; whereupon defense counsel objected. The objection was sustained, and no further testimony was elicited about this incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 71} The State contends in its brief that appellant was \"implicated\" as the getaway driver in these homicides. That is a complete misrepresentation of the testimony at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 72} At the close of the State's case, appellant's Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal should have been granted. Even considering the inadmissible \"other acts\" evidence, there was insufficient evidence to support appellant's convictions.
