We vacate both modification judgments and remand for further proceedings consistent with this memorandum and order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties divorced after nearly forty-two years of marriage in 2004, when the husband was sixty-five and the wife was sixty-one years old. During the marriage, the wife was a homemaker and the husband worked as a self-employed psychiatrist, operating his business within the marital home. The husband's significant income allowed the parties to enjoy an upper middle-class lifestyle during the marriage. However, by the time the parties divorced, they were left with only modest assets and significant debts. Pursuant to the parties' separation agreement, which was incorporated and merged with the judgment of divorce nisi (divorce judgment), the marital estate was divided relatively equally, and the husband was required to pay alimony of approximately $3,192 per week until either party's death or the wife's remarriage. The husband's alimony obligation amounted to approximately forty-eight percent of his gross income at the time of the divorce.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   In February of 2014, the husband filed a complaint for modification (first modification complaint), seeking to reduce or terminate his alimony obligation. A trial was held in November of 2014. On April 20, 2015, a modification judgment (first modification judgment) entered reducing the husband's weekly alimony obligation from $3,192 to $1,548, based on the judge's finding that the husband's weekly income had decreased by $930 (from $6,599 to $5,669) since the time of the divorce. In other words, the judge reduced the wife's alimony by almost twice the amount that the husband's income had decreased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In May of 2015, less than one month after the first modification judgement entered, the husband filed a second complaint for modification (second modification complaint), once again seeking to terminate or reduce his alimony obligation. A trial on this second modification complaint was held before the same judge in February of 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 3, 2016, a modification judgment (second modification judgment) entered reducing the husband's weekly alimony obligation to $634, based on the judge's finding that the husband's weekly income had decreased by $2,576 (from $5,669 to $3,093) since the first modification trial. The present appeal by the wife followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . \"In reviewing a modification judgment, we examine whether the factual and legal bases for the decision are in error, or whether the judge otherwise abused his discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Flor\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Flor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=92%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%20360\">\n    92 Mass.

Here, the judge's findings do not reflect such a determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   With respect to the first modification judgment, the judge acknowledged the $51,977 home office deduction claimed by the husband in the prior year, but did not indicate whether that deduction, or any of the other deductions, claimed by the husband, were \"reasonable and necessary.\" In connection with the second modification judgment, the judge simply found the husband's business expenses to be \"credible,\" with no \"commingl[ing] [of] his personal and business expenses.\" The judge should have considered whether the expansion of the husband's home office after the divorce increased his business expenses, and if so, whether that expansion was \"reasonable and necessary.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Whelan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .

The wife contends the judge failed to adequately consider her needs when reducing alimony by eighty percent between the time of the divorce and the second modification judgment.

Here, the judge found the wife had \"a continued need for alimony ... to maintain the standard of living she enjoyed during the marriage.\" However, neither modification judgment permitted the wife to maintain the former marital lifestyle. Following the divorce, the wife made considerable efforts to downsize her lifestyle, reducing her weekly expenses by forty-eight percent by the time of the second modification trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Despite these efforts, the wife was left with a shortfall of $354 per week as a result of the first modification judgment, and an even greater shortfall of $744 per week as a result of the second modification judgment. The wife's inability to meet even her reduced expenses is reflected in the sharp decline in her assets following the first reduction in alimony. Between the time of the first and second modification trials, the wife's assets decreased by forty-three percent, leaving her with sixteen percent less in assets than she had at the time of the divorce. In contrast, the judge's findings and the record demonstrate that, since the divorce, the husband has been able to increase his assets by forty-six percent and maintain the marital lifestyle,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   even with his reduced 2016 income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"Absent good reason, in a long term marriage, there is no justification for the life-style of one spouse to go down while the other remains high.\"\n   <em>\n    Goldman\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Goldman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4001007\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/28/603/#p611\">\n    28 Mass.
