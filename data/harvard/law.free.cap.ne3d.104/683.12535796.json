The new trial motion was denied, and the defendant appealed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm, relying in substantial part on the motion judge's careful and thorough findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . The underlying facts are fairly straightforward. The victim testified that, on June 19, 2010, she and her fifteen year old daughter were returning to her New Bedford apartment from shopping; the victim was driving. When she could not find a parking space at her apartment, she parked in a nearby lot where, she said, the landlord had given her permission to park. As she did so, the defendant, who was in the parking lot, confronted her and told her that she could not park there.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   When she refused to move, he grabbed her, dragging her out of the car and calling her names; he pulled out a knife and, holding onto her blouse around the neck area, he put the knife to her throat and told her he would kill her if she yelled. In the meantime, the victim's fifteen year old daughter started screaming and telephoned the police; at trial she largely corroborated her mother's testimony. One of the daughter's three brothers arrived at the scene soon afterwards, just as the police were arriving.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   A State police officer also testified that he received a call when he was a short distance away from the scene. When he arrived, he saw the defendant yelling at a woman who was \"frozen\" and \"crying.\" \"The young girl was screaming and crying on-appeared to be a cell phone.\" The defendant said to the trooper, \"[T]hat fuckin' bitch doesn't live here, she can't park here, this is my parking space, this is America.\" The trooper saw red marks on the victim's upper chest, along with a straight-line cut. Photographs of the injuries were admitted in evidence. The trooper arrested the defendant and, in so doing, retrieved \"a folded knife in a sheath on his belt of his pants.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Second motion for new trial\n   </em>\n   . a.\n   <em>\n    Trial counsel\n   </em>\n   . The defendant first contends that trial counsel was ineffective because she did not investigate the defendant's allegation that he had earlier been involved in an altercation with one of the victim's three sons; the defendant argues that case provided a motive for the victim to lie about him. The earlier incident was first reported on June 6, 2010, by the defendant and his girl friend, Sara Fowle, allegedly a witness to that attack; at that time, the two said that they did not know the identity of the alleged attacker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On July 14, 2010, the New Bedford police prepared a modified report reciting that William Gomez-Perez had committed an assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon against the defendant on June 6, 2010. It appears from the modified report that, on July 14, 2010, the defendant and his girl friend returned to the police and identified William Gomez-Perez, who lived next door to the defendant-and who was the son of the victim in the case at issue-as the attacker. A criminal complaint issued against Gomez-Perez on the same day. On January 5, 2012, the charges against Gomez-Perez were dismissed without prejudice with a docket entry that said \"wrong person charged.\" The case at issue here was tried on December 13, 2012, more than eleven months later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The defendant agrees that Gomez-Perez was the wrong person, but argued to the motion judge that he was actually attacked by another of the victim's sons, Alvaro Gomez-Perez. Nothing in this record, apart from the defendant's affidavit, filed in support of that second motion for a new trial, corroborates his allegation that Alvaro Gomez-Perez was involved in, or ever charged with, the June 6, 2010, incident described by the defendant and his girl friend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In reviewing the denial of a motion for a new trial, we apply the familiar test of\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Saferian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"314554\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/366/89/#p96\">\n    366 Mass. 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 96 (1974) (whether counsel's performance falls below that of \"an ordinary fallible lawyer\" and, if so, has it \"deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence\"). \"We also consider whether there is 'some showing that better work might have accomplished something material for the defense.' \"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Baran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3832215\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/74/256/#p272\">\n    74 Mass.

The evidence against him at trial was overwhelming and the defense that he did offer-and that the jury rejected-was arguably more plausible than the one he now advances. In addition, as the motion judge observed, \"trial counsel could reasonably have concluded that evidence about Mendoza's having been beaten in a fight with one of Perez's sons before the incident between Mendoza and Perez would be more harmful than helpful at trial,\" providing, as it did, a motive for the defendant to attack Perez. Finally, the judge was not required to take as true the statements contained in the defendant's self-serving affidavit filed in support of his motion. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Denis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1183072\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/442/617/#p633\">\n    442 Mass. 617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 633 (2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Former appellate counsel\n   </em>\n   . The defendant also alleges that former appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance in failing to raise on appeal the fact that trial counsel had failed to investigate the defendant's allegations about an altercation on June 6, 2010. This argument also fails. \"The standard for determining ineffective assistance of appellate counsel is the same standard set forth in\n   <em>\n    Saferian\n   </em>\n   , [\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"314554\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/366/89/#p96\">\n    366 Mass. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   96 ].\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Aspen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4229551\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/85/278/#p281\">\n    85 Mass.

When she arrived, \"she rushes to the second floor and sees another person on top of Mr. Mendoza with a knife.\" Incredibly there are two other male friends of the defendant witnessing the fight, but Ms. Fowle \"comes in, saves the day, kicks the knife out of [the attacker's] hand, gets a good look at that knife, knows exactly which knife that was. It just so happens to be the same knife that was found on Mr. Mendoza [the day he was arrested for this crime], and then they left the scene.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In making his closing argument, the prosecutor is entitled to \"marshal the evidence\" and to argue that the jury should disbelieve the testimony of a witness testifying on behalf of the defendant.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Beaudry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2824428\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/445/577/#p587\">\n    445 Mass. 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 587 (2005).
