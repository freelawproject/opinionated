The father's expert testified that the father and the child had a \"secure attachment, which is so crucial for [the child's] current and future development,\" and that a curtailment of their bond could put the child at risk for depression, anxiety, and confusion. In addition, the father's expert testified that the use of \"Skype\" or \"Facetime\" would not suffice as a substitute for physical contact.

Legal proceedings are a blunt instrument with which to calibrate the intricacies of human relationships. Nothing in this memorandum and order should be considered a criticism of the parents or their families or a referendum on the parenting skills of one or the other parent. The record reflects that the child has two loving parents and a welcoming extended family. The trial judge decided that a move to Minnesota would not provide enough of a benefit to the mother to improve the child's welfare, and that the child's best interests were best served by remaining in close proximity to both parents in Massachusetts. While one parent in any removal proceeding will always be disappointed in the decision of the court, both parents here have demonstrated a deep love of, and commitment to, this child.
