He argues that there was no need for the first complaint testimony because the victim immediately reported the sexual assault. This argument fails for two reasons. First, it misunderstands the doctrine of first complaint testimony. As noted above, the issue of timing is merely one factor which the jury may consider in weighing the credibility of a complainant's testimony, and does not speak to the initial admissibility of first complaint evidence. The Supreme Judicial Court recently reaffirmed the principle that questions of credibility \"may be at issue even absent any delay in disclosure\" and concluded that there was no abuse of discretion where a first complaint witness \"provided the jury with a contemporaneous description of the victim's reaction to the defendant's actions.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kennedy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12548629\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/90/722/#p814\">\n    478 Mass. 804\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 814 (2018). The defendant's attempt to distinguish this recent case on factual grounds is unavailing. Second, the case here did involve a question of whether the victim immediately reported the sexual assault. The jury could have found that the victim did not immediately tell her mother or her sister, who were present in the apartment. Instead, she waited for a telephone to charge and then called her cousin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The judge permissibly allowed the cousin's testimony and instructed the jury on the limited purpose of that testimony. Her cousin testified that she was contacted by the victim through a text message asking for help, that she then received a telephone call from the victim and that the victim described the assault, and that she picked up the victim and drove her to a hospital. The defense challenged the victim's veracity and credibility, drew attention through cross-examination to discrepancies between the victim's testimony and her cousin's testimony, and, in both the opening statement and closing argument, described the case as one \"about a troubled\" teenager and her \"false accusation.\" Therefore, the judge did not abuse his discretion in allowing the first complaint testimony and permitting the jury to consider it when determining the victim's credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Judgments affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    The trial judge entered a required finding of not guilty as to an additional count of statutory rape of a child.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    The named party in this citation is not the defendant.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    At the time of the assault, the victim was thirteen years old and lived with her mother, a younger sister, and the defendant. The defendant was engaged to the victim's mother. The victim testified that she wanted to live with her biological father, and defense counsel argued to the jury that the defendant did not assault the victim but that the victim reported the assault because the defendant was not her biological father.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
