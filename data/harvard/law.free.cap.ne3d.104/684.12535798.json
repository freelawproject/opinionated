Because the waiver of rights inherent in the tender of a guilty plea must be knowing and voluntary, \"a defendant must possess a certain degree of competence to plead guilty. 'The test of competence to plead is similar to that for standing trial.' \"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Robbins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"286798\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/431/442/#p445\">\n    431 Mass. 442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 445 (2000), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Russin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"826218\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/420/309/#p316\">\n    420 Mass. 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 316 (1995). That test \"requires that the defendant have '[1] sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding, and ... [2] a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.' \"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lyons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"369491\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/426/466/#p468\">\n    426 Mass. 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 468-469 (1998), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Vailes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"317438\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/360/522/#p524\">\n    360 Mass. 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 524 (1971). See\n   <em>\n    Dusky\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6164747\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/362/402/#p403\">\n    362 U.S. 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 403 (1960).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The defendant claims that his guilty pleas were not intelligent and voluntary because he was not competent at the time. We disagree. He claims that the finding of competence during the plea colloquy was faulty because it was based on nothing more than the plea judge \"eyeballing\" him during the colloquy. However, the plea judge was aware of the finding of incompetence seven months prior. The plea judge observed and interacted with the defendant during the forty-five-minute colloquy, tailored the colloquy to account for the defendant's limitations, consulted with plea counsel, and asked if counsel was aware of any reason that the plea should not be accepted. Plea counsel told the plea judge that he believed that the defendant's competency issues were properly addressed during the colloquy and the plea judge determined that there was no basis for questioning the defendant's competence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The defendant failed to raise a \"substantial question of possible doubt\" so as to require a further competency hearing.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Field\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451926\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/477/553/#p561\">\n    477 Mass. 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 561 (2017). See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wentworth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1168090\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/53/82/#p89\">\n    53 Mass. App. Ct. 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 89 (2001). Moreover, the defendant has identified no case in which such a hearing has been required in these circumstances, in order for a guilty plea to be accepted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Contrary to the defendant's claim, his statements during the plea colloquy did not establish his incompetence, let alone did they require the plea judge to so find. In fact, the defendant maintained that \"the victim lied about her age,\" but he did not challenge that she was a minor or that he touched her in an indecent manner. In that posture, the defendant demonstrated his understanding of the offenses to which he was pleading guilty. To the extent the defendant claimed that the touching was consensual, the assertion is not relevant. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Suero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275952\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/465/215/\">\n    465 Mass. 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 220 n.5 (2013). The motion judge did not abuse his discretion by denying the motion without a hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Order denying motion for new trial affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-14\">\n    The defendant was indicted for rape of a child, but the Commonwealth reduced the charge.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    The defendant's motion for new trial was not supported by an affidavit from plea counsel. Such an omission is significant. See\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Lynch\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"47307\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/439/532/\">\n     439 Mass. 532\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 539 n.2 (2003). Indeed, at the plea hearing, counsel stated that he was aware of the competency issue and, at the conclusion of the hearing, he said that the colloquy was \"very appropriately done\" and that he had no \"problem\" with the manner in which it was conducted.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    We note that most of the concerns raised by the judge (not the plea judge) during the defendant's competency hearing related to trial-based concerns, and not those that arise during a guilty plea. For example, the judge was concerned about the defendant's ability to withstand cross-examination.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    To the extent we do not address other issues raised by the defendant, \"they 'have not been overlooked. We find nothing in them that requires discussion.' \"\n    <em>\n     Department of Rev.\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Ryan R.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1221134\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/62/380/#p389\">\n     62 Mass.
