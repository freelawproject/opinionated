First, Appellant argues he was denied effective assistance of counsel when the trial court denied his request for appointment of new counsel. He argues appointment of new counsel was required because there was a complete breakdown in communication with his appointed counsel. Alternatively, he requested a continuance to prepare for trial. The trial court denied this request also. Appellant contends the trial court's denial of the motion was an abuse of discretion. Second, Appellant asserts the conviction for menacing by stalking is not supported by sufficient evidence. Lastly, he argues the imposition of a consecutive sentence is contrary to law because the record does not support the trial court's findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} For the reasons expressed below, all arguments lack merit. Appellant's conviction is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Statement of the Facts and Case\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} At approximately 12:30 a.m. on July 31, 2016 an argument occurred between Jeronica Wolfe and Appellant at Jeronica's house located 3948 Sunset Boulevard in Boardman Township, Ohio. Trial Tr. 180-181. The argument was about the use of a car. Trial Tr. 181-184. Jeronica and Appellant had known each other for ten years and at some point were in a relationship. Trial Tr. 179-180. Celeste Wolfe, Jericona's adult daughter who resided with her, was upstairs getting ready to go out while the argument was occurring. Trial Tr. 208. Celeste came downstairs to tell Appellant to leave the residence. Trial Tr. 208. He allegedly attacked her while she was coming down the stairs and punched her multiple times and then ran out of the house with the keys to Celeste's car. Trial Tr. 181-182, 208. Appellant admitted to hitting Celeste four to eight times, but claims Celeste swung at him first and initiated the fight. Trial Tr.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   273. The altercation resulted in Celeste sustaining injuries; she lost consciousness, her nose was broken, and she had a facial laceration. Trial Tr. 213, 221-222.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} After regaining consciousness, Celeste, Jeronica, and a few other people went in two separate cars to look for Appellant to get Celeste's keys. Trial Tr. 185, 209. They drove to Judson Avenue and found Appellant. Trial Tr. 185, 209. Appellant had a gun on his person, ran in the middle of the street, and yelled he would kill them. Trial Tr. 186, 209. Appellant admitted he had a gun in the middle of the street and used it to get them to leave. Trial Tr. 276. Celeste and Jeronica immediately left and returned to the residence on Sunset Boulevard. Trial Tr. 186, 209.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} While Jeronica and Celeste were looking for Appellant, Boardman police officers arrived at the residence on Sunset Boulevard. Trial Tr. 244-245. The officers had been dispatched to the house after receiving an \"open ended\" 911 call with screaming and fighting heard in the background. Trial Tr. 244. When the officers arrived at the residence the front door was ajar and no one was home. Trial Tr. 244. Jeronica and Celeste arrived at the house after the officers determined the house was clear. Trial Tr. 245.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Photographs were taken of Celeste and the stairs, and statements were taken. Celeste was then taken to the hospital in an ambulance. Trial Tr. 187. The emergency room doctor treated her for a closed head injury, nasal bone fracture, and facial laceration. Trial Tr. 236.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} At around 8:30 a.m. on July 31, Appellant returned to the Sunset Boulevard residence. Trial Tr. 188, 226-227. Jeronica's other adult daughter, Krystal, was sleeping on the living room floor and was awakened to the sound of Appellant saying \"yo-yo-yo\" at the window. Trial Tr. 226. Jeronica and Krystal testified they called the police. Trial Tr. 189, 227. Appellant used a key and tried to push his way into the house, but Krystal pushed back and tried to keep him out of the house. Trial Tr. 189-190, 227. An altercation ensued between Appellant and Krystal in the driveway and backyard. Trial Tr. 190, 227. Appellant admitted to hitting and kicking Krystal in the face during this altercation. Trial Tr. 279.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 9} When the police arrived, Appellant fled on foot. Trial Tr. 252. He was apprehended in Youngstown by a Youngstown police officer. Trial Tr. 254.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Complaints were filed against Appellant in Mahoning County Court Number 2, Boardman, for resisting arrest, burglary, assault, and obstructing official business. 8/2/16 Complaint. At the initial appearance, Appellant was held in direct contempt for statements he made to the court while walking away from the bench. 8/2/16 J.E. A preliminary hearing was held on August 9, 2016 and Appellant was bound over to the Mahoning County Common Pleas Court. 8/9/16 J.E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Thereafter, Appellant was indicted for felonious assault in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(1)(D), a second-degree felony; menacing by stalking in violation of R.C. 2903.211(A)(1), a fourth-degree felony; burglary in violation of R.C. 2911.12(A)(2)(D), a second-degree felony; and assault in violation of R.C. 2903.13(A), a first-degree misdemeanor. 9/1/16 Indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Defense counsel made requests for discovery, moved for Appellant to wear civilian clothes at trial, and filed a motion in limine. 9/14/16 and 9/23/16 Motions. A pretrial was held on September 21, 2016, the Wednesday before trial. At that pretrial, Appellant asked for new counsel. 9/27/16 J.E. The trial court denied the motion. 9/27/16 J.E. On the day of trial, Appellant through counsel renewed the\n   motion for new counsel or, in the alternative, moved for a continuance. 10/5/16 J.E.; Trial Tr. 7-20. The trial court denied the requests. 10/5/16 J.E; Trial Tr. 7-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The case proceeded to trial. The state's case consisted of testimony from the victims Jeronica, Celeste, and Krystal; two officers from the Boardman Police Department; and the Emergency Room Doctor. Appellant testified on his own behalf. The jury found Appellant guilty of felonious assault, menacing by stalking, and assault. The jury found him not guilty of burglary. 10/5/16 J.E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Appellant was sentenced to an aggregate term of nine and a half years. 10/7/16 J.E.; Sentencing Tr. 15. He received eight years for felonious assault, eighteen months for menacing by stalking, and six months for assault. 10/7/16 J.E.; Sentencing Tr. 15-16. The six month assault sentence was ordered to be served concurrently with the other sentences. 10/7/16 J.E.; Sentencing Tr. 16. The felonious assault and menacing by stalking sentences were ordered to be served consecutively. 10/7/16 J.E.; Sentencing Tr.16. The trial court made consecutive sentence findings at the sentencing hearing and in the judgment entry. 10/7/16 J.E.; Sentencing Tr. 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Appellant timely appealed his conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    First Assignment of Error\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"Darrell Brown was denied his right to the effective assistance of counsel as guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Section 10, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Appellant asserts he was denied his right to effective assistance of counsel because the trial court did not grant his request for substitute counsel. He contends there was a complete breakdown in communication between himself and his counsel and thus, substitute counsel was warranted. Alternatively, he argues the trial court abused its discretion when it denied his motion for a continuance. Appellant argues since the trial court denied his request for alternative counsel, it should have granted his request for a continuance so that he and his attorney could prepare for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The decision whether to remove court-appointed counsel and allow substitution of new counsel is within to the sound discretion of the trial court; its decision will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The original motion had been made one week prior to trial at the September 21, 2016 pretrial hearing. The pretrial hearing was not transcribed for our review. However, on the day of trial the events that transpired at the September 21, 2016 pretrial were discussed in conjunction with the renewed request to appoint new counsel. Trial Tr. 8-18. The basis for the original motion and the renewed motion was a complete breakdown of communication between trial counsel and Appellant. Trial Tr. 8-9. Trial counsel indicated that since the indictment Appellant had refused to communicate with counsel. Trial Tr. 9. The trial court overruled the motion because Appellant was causing counsel to be ineffective:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   He's entitled to the effective assistance of counsel but he cannot cause the ineffectiveness by his refusal to cooperate. He can't make you ineffective and then argue that counsel is ineffective. So his refusal to converse with you is not a grounds for removing you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Trial Tr. 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Appellant argues the above demonstrates there was a complete breakdown of communication that warranted the appointment of new counsel. Furthermore, he contends the trial court abused its discretion when it did not permit him to address the court about his complaint with his attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 22} The Tenth Appellate District has stated, \"when a defendant expresses concerns or complaints regarding appointed counsel, the trial court has a duty to inquire into the nature of the complaint, make such inquiry a part of the record, and make a decision on the record.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Bowman\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist. No. 06AP-149,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006-Ohio-6146\">\n    2006-Ohio-6146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%203365506\">\n    2006 WL 3365506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 35. When the motion was renewed on the day of trial, the trial court did instruct Appellant not to answer or say anything unless he was called upon. Trial Tr. 8. A reading of the trial transcript reveals this instruction was given because at the September 21, 2016 pretrial, when the motion for new counsel was made Appellant did not act appropriately:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   THE COURT: The pretrial was last Thursday?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   MR. MASZCZAK [the prosecutor]: Wednesday.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   THE COURT: Wednesday. Mr. Brown, you are not to answer or to say anything unless you're called upon. I'm talking to your lawyer. So I don't want you answering anything.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   If you do, if you act inappropriately at trial-the only reason that I'm mentioning this to you, normally I don't have to do this, is because of your conduct the other day at the pretrial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   When we're in trial and I have a jury sitting here, any type of misconduct by you at any time, you blurting something out, you laughing, you shaking your head, you disagreeing, you showing anything but sitting there like a perfect gentleman is going to result in a contempt of court charge. So I want you to be aware of that. I'm not somebody to mess around with.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   The rules by this court are going to be followed by everybody. So you are not permitted to respond, react, show disappointment or approval or disapproval, or whatever. You just-your place is to watch this; let this thing go on. If you choose to participate, that would be by testifying. It's not by anything else. So I don't want to hear your voice again while I'm talking to these lawyers. Okay. Go ahead.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Trial Tr. 8-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 23} The trial court also noted at the sentencing hearing the inappropriate behavior at the pretrial:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   During the course of the trial the court-let me say this first: To listen to you today and to listen to you at your pretrial last week is like you're two different people. You're a whole lot different today than you were last week. It kind of fascinates me. I don't really understand why. I don't really care to know why. But two completely different people.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Sentencing Tr. 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Furthermore, the statement given before the start of trial was not the only time in this case a court had to admonish Appellant. At the initial appearance, Judge Houser found Appellant in direct contempt of court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Defendant found in direct contempt of court for statements made to the court while walking away from the bench. The court had him returned to the bench and gave the defendant the opportunity to clarify his comments or recant them. The defendant did neither.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   The defendant was found in direct contempt and sentenced to 5 days in jail to commence immediately.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   8/2/16 J.E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Thus, the record in this case indicates the trial court was warranted in directing Appellant to remain quiet when the motion to appoint new counsel was renewed by counsel; Appellant's past behavior warranted such instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 26} That said, the trial court did permit to Appellant to express his concerns about counsel on the record and the court inquired about those concerns on the record. This occurred at the September 21, 2016 pretrial. Although the transcript of the pretrial was not made a part of the record, the trial transcript and the judgment entry following the September 21, 2016 pretrial indicate at the pretrial the trial court heard from Appellant, inquired about his concerns, and ruled on the motion to appoint new counsel. When the motion was renewed, the trial court indicated the same argument was made at the pretrial and overruled. Trial Tr. 12. Counsel indicated Appellant wanted him to reraise the issue because Appellant did not believe he was allowed to make motions. Trial Tr. 12-13. In response the court stated, \"Well, he's wrong about that. Because the record will bear out that I did go through all of the so-called motions that he wanted to present to the court, one of which was dismissing you.\" Trial Tr. 12-13. The judgment entry following the September 21, 2016 pretrial also indicates all of Appellant's motions, including the one requesting new counsel, were addressed by the court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   The Court is in receipt of a letter sent from Defendant, an inmate at the Mahoning County Justice Center. Said letter was opened by the Court this date and reviewed by the Court in open Court during this proceeding. This letter requested that counsel for Defendant, Attorney Edward Hartwig, be removed as counsel of record for Defendant and requested that a bond be set in this matter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   The State of Ohio addressed the Court regarding the letter, as did Defendant and his counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   9/27/16 J.E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 27} The judgment entry further stated Appellant addressed the court regarding issues related to the case without consulting defense counsel. The court considered those arguments and gave Appellant the choice to proceed pro se or with counsel. Appellant did not want to speak to his attorney, but did not want to proceed pro se. The court then addressed and overruled three pro se requests made by Appellant. The judgment entry indicated the case would proceed to trial on September 26, 2016. 9/27/16 J.E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Consequently, the record does indicate the trial court heard from Appellant, inquired into his concerns about counsel, and ruled on the request. Therefore, Appellant's argument that the trial court did not let him air his concerns about trial counsel fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Defense counsel does state on the record that since Appellant was indicted he refused to communicate with him to assist in the defense. Trial Tr. 9-10. This statement does show there was a lack of communication between Appellant and defense counsel. However, as the trial court noted, this lack of communication was caused by Appellant. In some instances, the failure to cooperate and communicate with counsel is nothing more than \"stalling\" and \"playing games with the court.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Hollingsworth\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist.

The trial court noted this is a simple case; it's a he said/she said type of case, there is no issue of identity, and there is no scientific evidence, such as fingerprinting, forensics, or DNA.

Although this was the first continuance requested and there would not be too much inconvenience to the witnesses and state, the request was made moments before the trial was scheduled to start. Appellant's failure to communicate was the reason for the request; the reason for the request was dilatory and contrived. Although the trial court did indicate continuances are granted at pretrial and insinuated it was the policy of the court to not grant one after the final pretrial, the trial court's primary reason for denying this continuance motion was because it believed Appellant was \"manipulating the process\" of the court. Trial Tr. 14. The motion for new counsel was made at the pretrial and was denied. Appellant did not ask for a continuance at the pretrial, but instead waited until moments before trial to move for a continuance to allow him and his counsel to prepare a defense. Appellant had refused to communicate with his counsel following his indictment up until the renewed motion for new counsel. He refused to communicate with his counsel even after he was told at the pretrial hearing that new counsel would not be appointed and trial was scheduled for the following week:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   THE COURT: But see, he's manipulating the process of this court. * * * He is one of defiance and rejection of anything and everything rather than to listening.

Menacing by stalking requires a \"pattern of conduct.\" Appellant states there was no evidence of a \"pattern of conduct\" regarding Celeste. He argues the only event was the waving of the gun in the street. The state contends the \"pattern of conduct\" included the punching of Celeste in the face, which resulted in the felonious assault conviction, and the waving of the gun in the street incident that happened shortly after the felonious assault. Appellant does not explain why the assault is not considered part of menacing by stalking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 42} \"Pattern of conduct\" is defined by statute as, \"two or more actions or incidents closely related in time, whether or not there has been a prior conviction based on any of those actions or incidents.\" R.C. 2903.211(D)(1). Given this definition the felonious assault of Celeste can be considered part of the \"pattern of conduct.\" Therefore, if the felonious assault meets the other requirements in the statute, such as being close in time and Celeste believing Appellant would harm her, then the state provided sufficient evidence of a \"pattern of conduct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 43} We conclude the state provided sufficient evidence the felonious assault was close in time to the gun waving incident.

In comparing the assaults on Celeste and Krystal, Jeronica testified because of the size differences Appellant injured Celeste, but \"he couldn't do nothing to Krystal.\" Trial Tr. 195. Since Celeste testified at trial, the jury was able to see Celeste's size compared to Appellant's size. Both Jeronica and Celeste also testified Appellant kept hitting Celeste and then immediately left. Trial Tr. 182, 208.

The court further noted Appellant has previously served time in the penitentiary but continues to commit crimes. Sentencing Tr. 15. Thus, the division (c) finding is supported by the record and was not contrary to law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   {\u00b6 55} The division (b) finding is also supported by the record. The undisputed facts of this case are Appellant punched Celeste multiple times breaking her nose, lacerating her face, and causing her to lose consciousness. Appellant left the house and when Celeste and Jeronica found him a little while later, Appellant waved a gun at them in the middle of Judson Avenue and told them he would kill them. These facts support a division (b) finding; the finding was not contrary to law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   {\u00b6 56} For those reasons, this assignment of error is meritless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   {\u00b6 57} All three assignments of error lack merit. The conviction is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Waite, J., concurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   DeGenaro, J., concurs.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
