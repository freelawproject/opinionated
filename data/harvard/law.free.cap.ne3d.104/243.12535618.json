The indictment charged Appellant with two counts of Murder; Count One in violation of R.C. \u00a7 2903.02(A) and Count Two in violation of R.C. \u00a7 2903.02(B), both unclassified felonies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Appellant was further charged with Intimidation of a Witness in violation of R.C. \u00a7 2921.04(B)(2) and with Having a Weapon Under Disability in violation of R.C. \u00a7 2923.13(A)(4). Counts One, Two, and Three also carried a Gang Affiliation Specification in violation of R.C. \u00a7 2941.142 and a Firearm Specification in violation of R.C. \u00a7 2941.145.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Prior to trial, the defendants moved to sever their trials. Following an evidentiary hearing, the motions were denied. The trial court also held an evidentiary hearing on the defendants' motions\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   to exclude evidence of Conley's involvement in a double homicide with Gervins. Again, the trial court denied the motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Both Defendants waived their right to a jury trial as to the gang specifications related to Counts One, Two, and Three, and their right to a jury trial as to their respective having weapons under disability charges. Those charges were tried to the court. The murder and intimidation\n   charges along with the firearm specifications were all tried to a jury, with the trial commencing on March 6, 2017, and continuing through March 7, 8, 9 and 10, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} At trial, the jury heard the following account of the events that took place on November 9, 2012, which led to the above charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Victoria Hilbrands testified that on November 9, 2012, she lived at 6901 Redbank Rd. in Galena, Ohio. Around 5:30 P.M. she heard a loud banging on the door. T. at 254-255. She could not initially see anyone outside the door. However, she heard a man, later identified as Dontee Gervins, yelling that he had been shot and asking to be let in. T. at 256. Mrs. Hilbrands immediately called 911. T. at 257. That call was placed at 5:43 P.M. T. at 284. While on the phone with 911, Mrs. Hilbrands could hear Gervins on his cell phone. Gervins repeatedly said \"I won't tell anybody\" to the person with whom he was speaking. T. at 260.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Gale Dunlap testified that she lived on Gorsuch Rd. This is a short distance from the Hilbrands' residence on Redbank Rd. T. at 346-347. On November 9, 2012, Dunlap was returning home from work sometime after 5:00 P.M. when a vehicle pull out of the Hilbrands driveway. The vehicle exited the driveway in a manner that forced her to brake her vehicle. T. at 350. She described the vehicle as a light blue or gray sedan but could not identify who was driving or how many occupants were in the vehicle. T. at 351. Mrs. Dunlap was behind the vehicle for a short period of time. During this time, the vehicle failed to stop at two stop signs. T. at 353. Around this same time, Mrs. Dunlap saw a squad traveling toward the location where the shooting had occurred. Mrs. Dunlap was unable to positively identify the vehicle, but testified it was consistent with that later found to be used by Reginald Conley. T. at 356.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Deputy Charm Johnson (also referred to in the record by her maiden name as \"Charm Miller\") testified that she was the first person to arrive at the Hilbrands' residence after the shooting. T. at 284-286. She arrived at approximately 5:50 P.M. T. at 299. Dep. Johnson found Gervins laying on the front porch of the Hilbrands' residence. T. at 286. Gervins appeared very weak, indicated he had been shot, but was unable to verbalize his name or other information at that time. T. at 286. Gervins' cellphone was lying next to him on the porch, and Dep. Johnson could hear a female voice on the line. T. at 287. Shortly thereafter Dep. Johnson notified medics that the scene was safe and they could approach to aide Gervins. T. at 288.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Brooks Church testified that he was one of the first medics who arrived on the residence. T. at 326. Church described Gervins as scared, very alert, barely able to speak, but could speak a little in between breaths. T. at 328. Church asked Gervins where the shooting occurred. Gervins responded \"here\" and gestured as if to indicate near the residence. T. at 330. When asked, Gervins indicated that he knew who shot him. T. at 330.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Detective Charles Gannon was the first officer to arrive on scene after Deputy Johnson. He testified he became involved in the investigation at 5:42 P.M. on November 9, 2012. T. at 1190. He was on his way home when the 911 call was placed, but he was the closest detective to 6901 Red Bank Rd. T. at 1190. When Det. Gannon arrived at the scene, medics were working on Mr. Gervins and he was still alive. T. at 1194. Shortly after Det. Gannon arrived, Gervins' cellphone began ringing and \"Wifey\" was displayed as the caller on the screen of the cell phone. T. at 1200. Det. Gannon had a brief conversation with\n   Amber Bland and ended the call to continue his work on the scene. T. at 202-1203. Det. Gannon finished processing the scene and documented what occurred. T. at 1203-1212. After his work at the scene was completed, he drove to Riverside hospital. T. at 1217.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} At the hospital, Det. Gannon learned that Dontee Gervins had been living with his fianc\u00e9, Amber Bland, on the near-east side of Columbus, Ohio. T. at 376. Gervins was selling marijuana to pay the bills and was associated with a gang called the Bloods. T. at 377. During this same time frame, Ms. Bland informed him that Gervins and her brother (Richard Bland) were closely associated with a man named Reginald Conley. T. at 378. He learned Conley went by the street name \"Twice.\" T. at 378.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Ms. Bland explained that late in the morning on November 9, 2012, Gervins and Ms. Bland ordered pizza and \"chilled\" at their residence with his friend \"Blaze\" (later identified as Domino Mack) and Blaze's girlfriend. T. at 379. After they finished eating pizza, Gervins received a phone call and stated that he had to leave but would be back. T. at 380. Before Gervins left, Ms. Bland heard him go into the laundry room and retrieve an unknown quantity of money from a safe in the ceiling. T. at 381-382. Shortly thereafter, Gervins left with Blaze and Blaze's girlfriend. Ms. Bland then fell asleep with her children. T. at 383.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Several hours later, Ms. Bland was awoken by a phone call from Gervins. T. at 383. When she answered the phone, he immediately stated \"Babe, I've been shot\" and hung up the phone. T. at 383. This call was placed at 5:44 P.M. Ms. Bland immediately called him back and had a short conversation with him. Gervins sounded scared and out of breath. T. at 384.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 15} When Ms. Bland called him back, Gervins stated that he had been shot and that he was in New Albany. When Ms. Bland asked if he knew who shot him, Gervins stated that it was \"Ice\" who shot him and that she was not to tell anyone. She stayed on the phone with him until the paramedics arrived a few minutes later and the phone was hung up. T. at 385.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Ms. Bland went to the hospital to be with Gervins and was accompanied by a number of his friends and family. One individual she spoke with at the hospital was \"Blaze.\" T. at 387. Because \"Blaze\" was the last person she had seen Mr. Gervins with that day, she spoke with him about what had transpired. She then provided that information to Gervins' sister (Dena Bronaugh) and to detectives from the Delaware County Sheriff's Office. T. at 387-388.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Ms. Bland stayed with Mr. Gervins at the hospital most of the week that followed the shooting. During that time he was intubated and unable to breath without the assistance of a tube down his throat. Ultimately, Mr. Gervins succumbed to his injuries on November 18, 2012. T. at 389.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Dr. Gerston testified that Gervins was shot in the lower-mid back. The bullet travelled at an upward trajectory perforating the liver and the right lung of Gervins. T. at 472-474. This would have caused continuous internal bleeding, difficulty breathing, and immobility in a matter often to fifteen minutes. T. at 475. Despite efforts to save Gervins' life, he ultimately died as a result of the gunshot wound to the back. T. at 477.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 19} In the days immediately after the shooting, Detectives from the Delaware County Sheriff's Office began to make use of the leads provided by Gervins' family at the hospital. Det. Gannon used the contact\n   information provided by Gervins' family and subpoenaed Conley's call detail records for the relevant timeframe. T. at 1219-1220. When he received information that Jermaine Kelly may have been involved in the shooting, he obtained historical cell phone records for Kelly as well. T. at 1221. Det. Gannon also subpoenaed Gervins' cellphone records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The records identified numerous calls between Conley and Gervins and between Conley and Kelly on the date of the shooting. These records were ultimately given to Det. Moledor for cell phone mapping. T. at 1223. Det. Moledor was able to map the locations of cell phones belonging to Dontee Gervins, Jermaine Kelly, and Reginald Conley around the time Gervins was shot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Generally speaking, all three phones were in the area of the Wilson Market on the near east side of Columbus approximately one hour before the shooting. Between 5:00 P.M. and 5:45 P.M. all three phones can be seen traveling northbound out of Columbus. At 5:33 P.M. Kelly's phone connected to a cell phone tower approximately 2.7 km. from the location of the shooting. That tower would have been the closest to Kelly when the call was made. T. at 981. By approximately 6:00 P.M., Kelly and Conley's phones can both be seen traveling southbound back into the Columbus area. No data from the cell phone mapping was inconsistent with Conley and Kelly being present at the shooting on Redbank Rd. T. at 985.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Around the time of Gervins' death, investigators were attempting to identify possible suspects and motive for the shooting. Det. Gannon learned that approximately ten days prior to the shooting, Gervins had been involved in a shooting on Gault St. in Columbus. Det. Gannon obtained records from Columbus Police regarding the Gault Street shooting and learned that Gervins was suspected as being the driver in a robbery that ultimately resulted in the death of two individuals. T. at 1238. The information indicated a man named \"Twice\" was also involved in the Gault St. shooting. The fact that both shootings involved someone with the street name \"Twice\" and Gervins led him to interview Mary Page and Jonathan Dantzler. T. at 1239-1240.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Mary Page testified that in 2012 she allowed Gervins to sell drugs out of her residence. T. at 732. This residence was across the street from an apartment complex on Gault St. in Columbus, Ohio. T. at 734. Page testified that in the days leading up to the death of Gervins, men identified as \"Twice\" and \"Jesus\" (whom she later identified as Jonathan Dantzler) came to her residence with Gervins. T. at 734-736. \"Twice\" and Dantzler asked Page to knock on the door of a crack dealer she knew in the Gault St. Apartments. The plan was that Conley and Dantzler would then rob the dealer at gunpoint, while Gervins would remain in the car to facilitate their escape. T. at 735; 739-740.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Page explained that when she, Dantzler, and \"Twice\" approached the door to the residence, she knocked on the door and inquired of an occupant if she could buy drugs. When she was told no by the occupant, she asked to use the bathroom. T. at 739. When she was told she could not use the bathroom, \"Twice\" and Dantzler began shooting into the apartment and went inside. Page did not enter the residence and instead fled the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 25} When Page arrived home, she saw \"Twice\" and Dantzler get into the car with Gervins and drive off. T. at 740. Page explained that when she saw \"Twice\" and Gervins later in the day, \"Twice\" told her not to say anything and told her to implicate two dark skinned guys if questioned about the robbery. T. at 743. At this time,\n   Gervins gave her some drugs. Neither Gervins, Dantzler, nor \"Twice\" were dark skinned. T. at 744.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Later that day, Page learned that someone had been killed in the shooting and one person was critically injured. T. at 743. Shortly thereafter, Columbus Police arrived at her home and arrested her for her involvement in the robbery. She initially told investigators it was two dark-skinned guys who put her up to it, but decided to tell the truth a few moments into her six minute interview. T. at 745. She later identified Gervins as the driver, Dantzler as \"Jesus\", but did not know who \"Twice\" was. T. at 756. Page ultimately pled guilty to manslaughter with a firearm specification and testified against Dantzler at his trial. T. at 728-729.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Dantzler testified that he was convicted for two counts of homicide arising out of the Gault St. shooting described by Mary Page. T. at 1072. He stated that on the day of the Gault St. shooting, he went to the Gault St. residence in question with Reginald Conley (\"Twice\"), Gervins, and Page. T. at 1075. Dantzler explained that Gervins drove him, Conley, and Page to the Gault St. residence and that Gervins remained in the car while Page, Conley and he went up to get drugs from the apartment. T. at 1076. Dantzler was arrested a few days after the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 28} On the day Gervins was shot, Dantzler was incarcerated awaiting trial for the Gault St. shootings. T. at 1072. While incarcerated, Dantzler placed a phone call to his brother Jermaine Kelly (who goes by \"Mac Maine\" and \"Maine\"). T. at 1069; 1073. On that call, Kelly informed Dantzler that he was 'just with Twice.\" Kelly then stated \"I hope we shoot good.\" Kelly then informed Dantzler that they \"shot a little deer.\" T. at 1168-1169. This call was placed on November 9, 2012 at 6:34 P.M. and occurred less than an hour after Gervins' shooting. In a call to his mother Kelly acknowledged his participation in this call. T. at 1160.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 29} As part of the investigation, investigators attempted to locate the vehicle described by Gale Dunlap. Det. Gannon testified he located a traffic citation issued to Reginald Conley in August of 2012. The ticket indicated Conley was driving a 2006 Ford Fusion, green in color, with a plate matching the one he borrowed from Christopher Hall. T. at 1232-1233. This prompted detectives to interview Christopher Hall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Christopher Hall testified that he knew Reginald Conley as \"Reggie Two Times\" and \"Twice\" in mid to late 2012. T. at 531. Hall explained that in 2012, he owned a green Ford Fusion that he had lent to Conley. T. at 532, 536. Conley had possession of the vehicle for at least several weeks. In late 2012, Hall received a phone call that he could retrieve the vehicle. T. at 537. However, Hall was unable to retrieve the vehicle because the Columbus Police impounded it prior to his arrival. T. at 538. This vehicle was later turned over to the Delaware County Sheriff's Office for processing. T. at 566.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 31} BCI Supervising Agent Gary Wilgus testified he processed the vehicle Hall provided Conley during the timeframe in question. T. at 566. As part of the processing of that vehicle, Agent Wilgus photographed the interior and exterior of the vehicle. T. at 568-585. Additionally, he attempted to locate the presence of gunshot residue, blood, and latent fingerprints. T. at 571-594. He explained that had a firearm been discharged inside the motor vehicle, there would have been gunshot residue present. T. at 581. Ultimately, no evidence of gunshot residue or blood was located on the vehicle itself. T. at 590-591, 620.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 32} While no gunshot residue was identified on the vehicle itself, Agent Wilgus documented a blue Champion sweatshirt in the backseat of the vehicle he processed. T. at 571. When the sweatshirt was forensically processed, gunshot residue and the DNA of Reginald Conley were found on it. T. at 637-644, 687-689. Daniel Steiner also testified that fingerprints lifted by Agent Wilgus from inside the vehicle were left by Conley. T. at 718.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 33} During the course of the investigation, Reginald Conley made some statements about what occurred in this case. When interviewed by Det. Gannon, he identified himself as \"Twice.\" T. at 1241. He stated that on the date of the shooting, he received a call from Gervins. In response to that call, Conley met up with Gervins at the Wilson Market. He stated Gervins was brought to the market by \"Blaze\" (Domino Mack); the three waited there for the arrival of Conley's cousin. T. at 1243. After waiting with them for a short time, Conley claimed he walked to his grandma's house a couple blocks away. T. at 1244. Conley stated he had his phone with him all day and that if law enforcement checked the records it would show him at his grandma's house near Wilson Market. T. at 1248.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 34} In addition to speaking with law enforcement, Conley made statements to Ms. Bland about Gervins' shooting. Ms. Bland testified she saw Conley, whom she also knew as \"Twice\", on Near Year's Eve of 2012 at an establishment called 'The Moonlight.\" T. at 392. When she saw him, he approached her and they discussed the shooting of Gervins. T. at 395. He stated he was with Mr. Gervins when he went up to Delaware on the day Gervins was shot. He further stated he had a gun on his person at the time Gervins was shot. T. at 395. Ms. Bland identified Mr. Conley in the courtroom as the person she knew as both Reginald Conley and \"Twice.\" T. at 391.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Conley made additional statements regarding the incident to his cousin Lamonte Rayford. Rayford is also the brother of Amber Bland. Rayford testified he learned that Gervins, his sister's paramour, was shot while Rayford was incarcerated in Franklin County. T. at 784. He explained his sister, Amber Bland, told him what she knew while he was at the Workhouse in Franklin County. This prompted Rayford to call \"Twice\" (Reginald Conley) from jail. T. at 787.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 36} During this call, Rayford discussed with Conley what had transpired with Gervins and the Gault St. shooting for which Dantzler had been arrested. T. at 795. Rayford commented to Conley that he heard Conley was out doing his \"thug\" too (meaning committing the same offenses as Dantzler). After laughing, Conley stated \"they got my name in their mouth\" (meaning individuals are accusing him of something). T. at 796-797. When the topic turned to the shooting of Gervins, Conley made some self-aggrandizing comments and then laughed when Rayford suggested Conley had left Gervins for dead. T. at 799.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Finally, Appellant presented statements Conley made to fellow inmate Christopher Brookman. Christopher Brookman testified he was incarcerated at the Delaware County Jail with Reginald Conley while both were awaiting disposition of their criminal cases. T. at 921. Brookman explained that on one occasion an inmate \"trustee\" at the jail had a brief conversation with Conley which caused Conley to become upset. T. at 923-24. When Brookman questioned Conley about why he was upset, Conley stated he learned someone he knew on the street was going to testify that Conley had admitted to the crime for which he was awaiting trial. T. at 926. Conley then indicated\n   that \"he never should have trusted that weak-ass nigger. I shouldn't have never said nothing to him.\" T. at 927.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Appellant also presented a number of Kelly's statements at trial. Detective Arthur Kester, III, testified he interviewed Jermaine Kelly on two separate occasions. He was first interviewed on December 14, 2012. T. at 1153. During the interview Kelly denied knowing anyone by the name of Reginald Conley, \"Twice\", or \"Baby Twice.\" He further denied knowing an individual by the name of Jonathan Dantzler, \"Jesus\" or \"Baby Jesus.\" T. at 1155. During the second interview with Kelly, Kelly requested to see the evidence against him. When the Detectives produced a binder and started to go through the evidence Kelly told them to shut the book and left the interview. T. at 1157.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Months after Gervins' shooting, Kelly also made statements to Lamonte Rayford regarding Gervins' shooting. Rayford explained he met Kelly after his release from prison and knew him as \"Mac Maine.\" T. at 803. Rayford testified he began to see Kelly daily at the \"Taste of Chicago\" pizza shop near where they lived. While Rayford described himself as merely an acquaintance of Kelly, he explained his cousin \"Meme\" (Demetrius Edwards) was very close to Kelly. T. at 806.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Rayford explained that on one occasion, Rayford and \"Meme\" began discussing the Gervins shooting in the presence of Kelly. At that time, Kelly explained that Gervins had to be killed because Gervins was going \"to tell on some shit that went down.\" Kelly explained that he had been the one who shot Gervins. He explained that Gervins was taken to Delaware to go get money and told he had to switch seats in the car. When Gervins exited the car, Kelly shot him. T. at 807-809.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 41} As part of the investigation, law enforcement forensically processed the phones of Conley and Kelly. T. at 1113. The iPhone that was examined was associated with the phone number (614) 316-1329. It contained numerous messages suggesting Jermaine Kelly (Mac Maine) was using the phone in November and December of 2012. This phone was taken from Kelly's person upon his arrest. T. at 1125-1129. The phone was linked to a \"Mac Maine\" Facebook page with associated email addressed JermaineKelly82@yahoo.com and MacMaine.3@yahoo.com. Kelly's phone also included contact information for \"Baby Twice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Detective Ullom also examined the Blackberry Curve associated with phone number (614) 701-0403 and taken from the person of Reginald Conley. T. at 1134. This phone and corresponding number were provided to law enforcement by Conley during his initial interview. T. at 1246. The data recoverable from the phone was quite limited as it appears that the phone was newly activated on November I8, 2012 at approximately 6:48P.M. T. at 1136-1137. Det. Gannon testified that Conley activated the cell phone the same day Gervins died. T. at 1247.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 43} At trial, Appellee also presented the testimony of Richard Bland. Mr. Bland testified that he was the brother of Lamonte Rayford and Amber Bland. T. at 882. He testified the street name of Reginald Conley was \"Twice\" and was familiar with Jermaine Kelly being \"Mac Maine.\" T. at 883. He explained that he didn't know Kelly very well, but that Conley was his cousin. T. at 885. He testified that around the time Gervins was shot, Conley was driving a greenish Ford Fusion that had a mirror missing on the passenger side. T. at 888.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Appellee presented additional testimony relevant to the gang specification at trial. Lamonte Rayford, a cousin to\n   Reginald Conley, testified he has been a gang member for most of his life in the Columbus area. He explained how individuals typically join a gang. He explained that one can commit a variety of offenses (i.e. sell drugs, rob people, or kill people) or they can be \"blessed\" into a gang if they have someone in their family with sufficient tenure and rank in the gang.

Such section states: (A) No person shall purposely cause the death of another or the unlawful termination of another's pregnancy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 57} Appellant initially argues that his conviction is against the manifest weight and sufficiency of the evidence because Appellee did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) he was identified as the shooter, or (2) that the shooting took place in Delaware County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 58} Upon review, this Court finds based on the testimony presented at trial as set forth above, that the State presented proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant was guilty of the murder of Dontee Gervins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 59} The jury heard testimony from both Amber Bland and Lamonte Rayford that Appellant admitted to them that he was involved on Gervins' murder. Further, evidence was presented as to cell phone tower data which placed Appellant, his co-defendant Kelly and Gervins together in Delaware County. Also, the telephone call Gervins made to Ms. Bland after he was shot placed him in Delaware County. Further, Gervins told the medic who was treating him that he was shot \"here\" and indicated in front of Ms. Hilbrands' residence. Additionally, Dr. Gerston testified that based upon Gervins' injuries and the fact that the bullet perforated Gervins' liver and lung, he would only have been able to move for 10 to 15 minutes after\n   being shot, as his blood pressure would drop and his lungs would fill with blood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 60} There was also ample evidence presented that Gervins was the only witness to the Gault Street shootings who could have testified against his cousin Jonathan Dantzler, who was in jail awaiting trial, and who could identify and inform the police that Appellant was also involved those shootings. Co-defendant Jermaine Kelly received a call from Dantzler, who is Kelly's brother, from the jail less than an hour after Gervins was shot. During this call Kelly informed his brother that he was \"just with Twice\" and that they \"shot a little deer\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 61} Based on the foregoing, together with all of the evidence presented, we find that Appellant's murder conviction was supported by sufficient evidence and that the jury did not lose its way in finding Appellant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 62} Appellant's First and Second Assignments of Error are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 63} In his Third Assignment of Error, Appellant argues he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation when Lamonte Rayford was permitted to testify as to certain statements made to him by co-defendant Jermaine Kelly, when Kelly himself did not testify. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 64} Appellant claims Lamonte Rayford's testimony that Kelly told him \"they took him to Delaware and had him switch seats\" and \"[t]hey were basically telling him ...\" violated his right to confrontation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 65} Initially, we note Appellant did not object to the first statement and the trial court sustained his objection to the second statement. We therefore review the admission of the statements for plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 66} Crim.R. 52(B) affords appellate courts discretion to correct \"[p]lain errors or defects affecting substantial rights\" notwithstanding an accused's failure to meet his obligation to bring those errors to the attention of the trial court.
