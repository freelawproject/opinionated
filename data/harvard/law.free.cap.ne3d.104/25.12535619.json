Hudson, appeals the trial court's September 23, 2014 judgment entry sentencing him following a jury trial and conviction for possession of cocaine in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A) and (C)(4)(e). Anthony argues that his conviction is contrary to law since the state failed to establish the weight of the actual cocaine in the crack cocaine in his possession. He also asserts there was insufficient evidence establishing that he knowingly possessed cocaine and thus his conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} William Felt Jr. testified that he was a member of the TAG task force and is an Ashtabula City Police Officer. Felt explained that he initially drove a confidential source to a home in Warren Township to purchase drugs. Thereafter, a warrant was obtained,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and on November 13, 2006, the Trumbull, Ashtabula, and Geauga County \"TAG\" task force executed a search warrant at the home. The only person in the home at the time was Michael Hudson, who is appellant's brother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Felt was the photographer and the task force's scribe when the warrant was executed. He photographed and secured documents with the name Michael Hudson on them and other documents with Anthony Hudson's name on them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Felt photographed a receipt found in the kitchen with Michael's name on it with his address listed as the address of the home being searched. Felt also secured a CD case with white powder lines and residue on it. The officers also found a scale with a white residue on it, baking soda, a protein powder used for \"cutting\" cocaine, and a frying pan with white crusty residue, suspected to be cocaine, in the kitchen. Felt's photographs of these items were introduced at trial. They also found a baggie containing marijuana in the kitchen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Felt confirmed that the first floor bedroom was padlocked closed, and the officers had to use force to open it. TAG task force members located documents in the locked bedroom containing the name Michael Hudson as well as documents with Anthony's name on them. They found a pawn receipt with Michael's name on it in the padlocked bedroom along with a residential lease agreement listing Anthony Hudson as the lessee of this property. Felt\n   also photographed an Ohio identification card issued to Anthony and a Warren utility receipt with Anthony's name on it in this locked bedroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The task force also found a large quantity of crack cocaine on a television stand in the locked bedroom. This was the only bedroom in the home that had the door padlocked closed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Ten to fifteen minutes after the task force arrived at the home, Major Thomas Stewart Sr. saw Anthony drive past the home in a beige Cadillac. Stewart pulled Anthony over for driving with a suspended license. The car was registered in Michael's name. Stewart secured a small bag of marijuana from Anthony and a set of keys, which contained the key to the padlock for the locked bedroom. This was the only key the officers located to the padlocked bedroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Detective Tackett was the lead detective in this case and was also a TAG task force member. Tackett testified that it has been increasingly difficult to secure drug traffickers' homes and cars via forfeiture because there is a tendency for offenders to put valuables in another's name to avoid forfeiture. Tackett explained that Anthony was known to use his brother's name as an alias.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Appellant's brief asserts three assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 10} \"Anthony Hudson's first-degree felony conviction for possession of 27 grams or more but less than 100 grams of cocaine was not supported by sufficient evidence.

(T.p. 92-94, 186.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 11} \"The trial court erred when it denied Mr. Hudson's Crim.R. 29(A) motion for acquittal because the conviction for possession of cocaine therefore violates his rights to due process.

(T.p. 186.)\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 13} First, Anthony alleges that his first-degree felony conviction was based on insufficient evidence. He argues that the state must prove the quantity of the pure cocaine in the crack cocaine in his possession in order to secure an enhanced conviction. He alleges that the evidence at trial only supports a conviction for a fifth-degree felony possession in light of the state's failure to prove the actual quantity of pure cocaine in his possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The state correctly points out that Anthony did not raise this issue at trial either by way of objection or in his motion for acquittal. Thus, we review this issue for plain error.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The penalty for the offense shall be determined as follows: * * * (e) If\n   <em>\n    the amount of the drug\n   </em>\n   involved equals or exceeds twenty-seven grams but is less than one hundred grams\n   <em>\n    of cocaine\n   </em>\n   , possession of cocaine is a felony of the first degree, and the court shall impose as a mandatory prison term one of the prison terms prescribed for a felony of the first degree.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 17} In Anthony's case, the state established via the testimony of a forensic chemist, Jennifer Acurio, that crack cocaine is a compound. She confirmed that the amount of the drug in Anthony's possession, i.e., crack cocaine, weighed more than 27 grams. Acurio confirmed that the crack cocaine weighed 28.97 grams when she first weighed it in June 2014. Acurio's predecessor weighed and tested the same substance, and it weighed a few grams more in December of 2006. She explained that crack cocaine is a moisture compound and that it lost moisture weight during the eight years that it was in storage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Acurio stated the following on cross-examination:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 19} \"Q.

That's correct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Felt's testimony confirmed that he found baking soda at the home that day and explained that it is used \"as a chemical additive to powder cocaine. And that is how crack is made.\" Felt also explained the significance of the protein additive used by weightlifters found in the home, stating \"[i]t's added to raw cocaine before it's cooked into crack. And what it does is increases the volume of the original product. It's a cutting agent. You essentially turn a specific quantity of powder cocaine, add a corresponding amount of a cutting agent, now you've doubled the amount of cocaine which you then can turn more profit * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Anthony asserts that a plain reading of R.C. 2925.11(C)(4)(e) requires the state to establish the weight of the pure cocaine in the crack cocaine in his possession via a scientific analysis of the entire substance. He directs our attention to\n   <em>\n    State v. Gonzales\n   </em>\n   , 6th Dist.

Anthony rented the Warren Township residence, and as a result of his possession of the key to the room, he had access and control over the locked bedroom that contained the drugs. Further, the crack cocaine was sitting in plain view on a television stand in the bedroom, and the police found personal items belonging to Anthony and documents bearing his name in this bedroom.

While this appears to express doubt about the propriety of such decision, there is no question that the Supreme Court's reading and application of the unambiguous statutory language was correct. Further, to fairly address the issue raised on appeal, it is necessary to include more than just a cursory reference to the analysis contained within\n   <em>\n    Gonzales II.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 64} The pertinent statute, R.C. 2925.11(C)(4), states: \"If the drug involved in the violation is cocaine\n   <em>\n    or a compound, mixture, preparation, or substance containing cocaine\n   </em>\n   , whoever violates division (A) of this section is guilty of possession of\n   cocaine.\" (Emphasis added.) Under this language, a mixture or compound is also \"cocaine\" and must be weighed as such. The statutory language was properly held to be unambiguous and to \"clearly encompass\" the whole compound or preparation of cocaine.\n   <em>\n    Gonzales II\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 65} As the Court held: \"Giving effect to the statute as a whole and to the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of the statute, we conclude that the applicable offense level for cocaine possession under R.C. 2925.11(C)(4) is determined by the total weight of the drug involved, including any fillers that are part of the usable drug.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 66} Any holding to the contrary would be impractical and inconsistent with legislative intent. \"Concluding otherwise would require us to insert the words 'actual' or 'pure' to describe the cocaine that is intended to be penalized by the statute. If the General Assembly had been concerned about purity, rather than total weight, it would have said so.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13. There is no basis, under the current statutory language, for a conclusion that a small difference in purity should result in a disparate punishment. Drugs of any quality, with greater filler, available to a larger number of users present a serious threat to society as a whole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 67} In addition, the opposing interpretation would make it difficult to sentence many defendants guilty of possession of cocaine with anything greater than a fifth-degree felony, which is contrary to the statutory scheme laid out by the General Assembly and detrimental to society as a whole. It would further be cumbersome for criminal laboratories to change their current procedures for testing cocaine, as was established in the Ohio Attorney General's amicus brief in\n   <em>\n    Gonzales,\n   </em>\n   causing an additional burden to the community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 68} For the foregoing reasons, the\n   <em>\n    Gonzales II\n   </em>\n   decision must be applied not only because we are bound by the Supreme Court's precedent but also due to its consistency with the clear statutory language of R.C. 2925.11(C)(4).
