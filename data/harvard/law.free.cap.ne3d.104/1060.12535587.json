Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Appellants challenge the constitutionality of legislation introduced as H.B. No. 70 and ultimately adopted as Am.Sub.H.B. No. 70 by the Ohio General Assembly in 2015. H.B. No. 70 was introduced in the Ohio House of Representatives on February 18, 2015, and read for the first time. As introduced, H.B. No. 70 proposed to enact new sections within R.C. Chapter 3302 authorizing school districts and community\n   schools to create community learning centers. On February 25, 2015, H.B. No. 70 was read a second time in the House and referred to the House Education Committee. On May 6, 2015, H.B. No. 70 was reported out of committee with a recommendation that it be passed. On May 19, 2015, H.B. No. 70 was read a third time in the House and passed by a vote of 92 to 6. On May 20, 2015, H.B. No. 70 was introduced in the Ohio Senate and read for the first time. The bill was read a second time in the Senate on May 27, 2015, and referred to the Senate Education Committee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In the Senate Education Committee, H.B. No. 70 was amended twice on the morning of June 24, 2015. One amendment expanded the definition of facilities that were eligible to become community learning centers. The second amendment modified the structure of academic distress commissions under existing law by repealing and replacing existing R.C. 3302.10, enacting a new R.C. 3302.11, and by making changes to other sections in R.C. Chapters 3302 and 3310. The committee adopted the second amendment by a vote of 7 to 5. The committee then voted 8 to 4 to pass the legislation, referred to as Sub.H.B. No. 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On the afternoon of June 24, 2015, the Senate took up Sub.H.B. No. 70 as reported by the Senate Education Committee. Amendments were adopted on the Senate floor modifying the residency requirement for members of an academic distress commission appointed by the state superintendent of education and indicating that a chief executive officer for a school district appointed by an academic distress commission would serve at the pleasure of the commission; thereafter, the bill was referred to as Am.Sub.H.B. No. 70. Following those amendments, the Senate passed Am.Sub.H.B. No. 70 by a vote of 18 to 14. The same day, Am.Sub.H.B. No. 70 was taken up for consideration in the House. The House voted to concur in the Senate amendments to the bill by a vote of 55 to 40. The governor signed Am.Sub.H.B. No. 70 on July 16, 2015, and the legislation became effective October 15, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On August 21, 2015, appellants filed a complaint for declaratory judgment and permanent injunction in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, alleging the Youngstown City School District was subject to the academic distress commission provisions contained in Am.Sub.H.B. No. 70 and challenging the constitutionality of the law. Appellants also filed a motion for preliminary injunction and requested an evidentiary hearing. After conducting an evidentiary hearing on September 29 and 30, 2015, the trial court issued an order denying appellants' motion for preliminary injunction on October 13, 2015. Appellants appealed the denial of the preliminary injunction to this court. In a decision rendered February 16, 2017, this court dismissed the appeal sua sponte for lack of a final appealable order and remanded the case to the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Youngstown City School Dist.

No. 70. Appellants claim the amendments relating to academic distress commissions vitally altered the substance of the legislation and the General Assembly violated the Three Reading Rule because Am.Sub.H.B. No. 70 was not considered three times in each chamber and there was no vote to suspend the Three Reading Rule. Appellants argue that in addition to considering the text of the legislation and its amendments, the court must consider the underlying purposes of the Three Reading Rule and assert that the process by which Am.Sub.H.B. No. 70 was amended and adopted did not satisfy those purposes. Appellees claim the Three Reading Rule was not violated, arguing the amendments did not vitally alter the legislation because both the introduced and final versions of the legislation shared the common purpose of restructuring and improving underperforming school districts. Appellees further claim that adopting appellants' position would result in excessive judicial encroachment on the legislative process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Article II, Section 15(C) of the Ohio Constitution governs passage of legislation by the General Assembly and provides \"[e]very bill shall be considered by each house on three different days, unless two-thirds of the members elected to the house in which it is pending suspend this requirement, and every individual consideration of a bill or action suspending the requirement shall be recorded in the journal of the respective house.\" The Supreme Court of Ohio has held that if it can be proven that a bill was not considered three times in each legislative chamber, the bill is void and without legal effect pursuant to Article II, Section 15(C).\n   <em>\n    Hoover v.

The final version of the legislation abolished the existing Industrial Commission of Ohio, created a new version of the Industrial Commission, substantially amended workers' compensation law, and made appropriations for the Bureau of Workers' Compensation and the Industrial Commission.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=631%20N.E.2d%20582\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court determined that despite the extensive amendments, the final version of the bill \"retain[ed] its common purpose to modify the workers' compensation laws.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   at 234,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=631%20N.E.2d%20582\">\n    631 N.E.2d 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The\n   <em>\n    Voinovich\n   </em>\n   court further stated that the difference between a heavily amended bill and a vitally altered bill is one of degree.

That version of the bill was read three times and adopted by the House and read twice in the Senate before being referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee on December 11, 2012. In committee, the legislation was amended to eliminate certain mayor's courts and clarify the effect of state and municipal prohibitions on texting while driving. On December 13, 2012, the Senate passed the amended version of the legislation and the following day the House concurred in the Senate amendments to the bill.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On appeal from a judgment granting a motion to dismiss, this court held that the amendment to the legislation eliminating certain mayor's courts did not vitally alter the original bill. We concluded that the amended version of the legislation retained a common purpose with the original version, holding that \"while the amended bill contained two topics, they shared a common relationship of regulating the organization and structure of Ohio's statutory courts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22. Further, the court noted that when the full Senate considered the amended version of the legislation, no member sought to strip the amendment or otherwise alter or further amend the legislation. Likewise, when the full House considered and voted to concur in the Senate amendments, no member sought to remove those amendments or otherwise amend the legislation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 17} In the present case, each chamber of the General Assembly considered the legislation on three different occasions, but considered the final, amended version of the legislation only once. The question before us, therefore, is whether the subject matter of the legislation was vitally altered by the amendments, departing entirely from a consistent theme, such that there was no longer a common purpose or relationship between the original legislation and the amended legislation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Voinovich\n   </em>\n   at 233,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=631%20N.E.2d%20582\">\n    631 N.E.2d 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 18} As introduced, H.B. No. 70 was a relatively brief bill comprising of 10 pages that proposed to enact three new sections under R.C. Chapter 3302 authorizing school districts and community schools to create community learning centers. As finally adopted by both chambers of the General Assembly, Am.Sub.H.B. No. 70 was comprised of 77 pages and amended or enacted new sections of law in R.C. Chapters 133, 3302, 3310, 3311, and 3314. The amendments to the legislation primarily involved revising the law related to academic distress commissions. Appellants cite to the increased length and complexity of Am.Sub.H.B. No. 70 in arguing that the amendments vitally altered the original legislation. However, in determining whether legislation was vitally altered by amendments, we must focus on the content of the amendments and ascertain whether there remained \"a common purpose or relationship between the original bill and the bill as amended.\"\n   <em>\n    Voinovich\n   </em>\n   at 233,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=631%20N.E.2d%20582\">\n    631 N.E.2d 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 19} H.B. No. 70, as introduced, authorized the creation of community learning centers in underperforming school buildings. If the community learning center process was initiated, the board of education was required to create a school action team composed of 12 members, including 7 parents or guardians of students enrolled in the school and members of the community, and 5 teaching or non-teaching employees assigned to the school. R.C. 3302.18(A). The school action team would conduct a performance audit of the school and propose an improvement plan. R.C. 3302.17(E) and (F).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 20} As amended, Am.Sub.H.B. No. 70 retained the community learning center provisions, and added provisions revising the law related to academic distress commissions. It provided that an academic distress commission was to be established for any school district that received an overall failing grade for three consecutive years or had been subject to an academic distress commission under prior law for at least four years. R.C. 3302.10(A). The academic distress commission would be comprised of three members appointed by the state superintendent of education, one teacher employed by the district to be appointed by the president of the board of education, and one member appointed by the mayor of the appropriate municipality. R.C. 3302.10(B)(1). The academic distress commission would then appoint a chief executive officer, whose duties would include creating a plan to improve the district's academic performance, subject to the review and approval of the commission. R.C. 3302.10(E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 21} In this case, the original legislation and the amended final version not only involved the same general subject area of education, but the specific subject of improving underperforming schools. Notably, the community learning center provisions contained in the original legislation were retained in the final version, with some changes through the amendment process. Unlike the scenario in\n   <em>\n    Hoover\n   </em>\n   , Am.Sub.H.B. No. 70 was not completely different in content from H.B. No. 70 as introduced. Rather, the original version, which provided one method of improving underperforming schools, was amended to include another method of improving underperforming schools. Thus, the legislation at issue in this case is more analogous to the heavily amended bill in\n   <em>\n    Voinovich\n   </em>\n   or to the legislation considered by this court in\n   <em>\n    Village of Linndale\n   </em>\n   , each of which did not violate the Three Reading Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Appellants also argue the process by which Am.Sub.H.B. No. 70 was amended and adopted violated the purposes of the Three Reading Rule, asserting the amendments were drafted in secret to\n   deny the opportunity for debate and pushed through both chambers of the General Assembly in a single day. Appellants claim this distinguishes the present case from\n   <em>\n    Voinovich\n   </em>\n   , where the court found the amendments had been debated for several months and were subject to multiple hearings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 23} In the present case, it is clear that amendment and adoption of Am.Sub.H.B. No. 70 occurred quickly. Amendments to the legislation were adopted in the Senate Education Committee on the morning of June 24, 2015, and the full Senate considered the amended bill later that afternoon. The House voted to concur in the Senate amendments later that same day. Thus, this case does not involve the same sort of lengthy, deliberative process described by the\n   <em>\n    Voinovich\n   </em>\n   court, and a more deliberative process may be preferred. However, we are mindful of the\n   <em>\n    Voinovich\n   </em>\n   court's warning that it would be inappropriate to \"polic[e] every detail of the legislative amendment process when bills are passed containing a consistent theme,\" its declining to extend the\n   <em>\n    Hoover\n   </em>\n   analysis, and examination as to whether the legislation departed\n   <em>\n    entirely\n   </em>\n   from a consistent theme.\n   <em>\n    Voinovich\n   </em>\n   at 234,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=631%20N.E.2d%20582\">\n    631 N.E.2d 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We conclude that H.B. No. 70 as introduced and Am.Sub.H.B. No. 70 as adopted shared a common purpose of providing measures to improve underperforming schools. Moreover, although the amendment and adoption process occurred quickly in this case, the record reflects that legislators who opposed the amendments were able to present their arguments to their colleagues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 24} As to the merits of this claim, based on the record before us, appellants have failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the General Assembly violated Article II, Section 15(C) of the Ohio Constitution in enacting Am.Sub.H.B. No. 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

No. 70 violates Article VI, Section 3 of the Ohio Constitution, which provides, in relevant part, that \"each school district embraced wholly or in part within any city shall have the power by referendum vote to determine for itself the number of members and the organization of the district board of education.\" Appellants assert Am.Sub.H.B.

Under the law, the commission had authority to reduce the number of teachers in a school district, even if an applicable collective bargaining agreement provided otherwise.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4. Finding that the commission was appointed only to assume the school board's fiscal responsibilities while the state of fiscal emergency existed, but that the elected school board retained all other rights and duties, the court concluded the law did not violate Article VI, Section 3 by usurping the authority of the elected school board.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Appellants argue Am.Sub.H.B. No. 70 is distinguishable from the laws challenged in\n   <em>\n    Congress of Parents &amp; Teachers\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    E. Liverpool\n   </em>\n   because it usurps all powers of the elected school board. Pursuant to R.C. 3302.10(C)(1), a chief executive officer appointed by an academic distress commission \"shall exercise complete operational, managerial, and instructional control of the district\" and provides a non-exclusive list of powers and duties the chief executive officer may exercise. Citing this provision, appellants argue that the chief executive officer assumes all powers of the school board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Although the language of R.C. 3302.10(C)(1) grants broad authority to a chief executive officer appointed by an academic distress commission, it does not appear to usurp\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   powers of the elected school board. For example, pursuant to R.C. 5705.21, a school board may, by a two-thirds vote of its members, adopt a resolution seeking to impose an additional tax levy, subject to approval by the electors of the district. Appellants argue that because there is no language in R.C. 3302.10(C)(1) limiting a chief executive officer's authority, it necessarily encompasses all of the school board's powers. However, the phrase \"operational, managerial, and instructional control\" in R.C. 3302.10(C)(1) constitutes an implicit limit on a chief executive officer's authority. Had the General Assembly intended to give the chief executive officer authority to perform all of the school board's duties, it could have written the statute to provide that the chief executive officer would exercise complete control of the district, without including the limiting phrase \"operational, managerial, and instructional control.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Thus, in this case, as in the\n   <em>\n    E.

Pursuant to R.C. 3302.10(A), as enacted through Am.Sub.H.B. No. 70, an academic distress commission may be established for any school district that has received an overall failing grade for three consecutive years or where an academic distress commission had been established under prior law and had been in existence for at least four years. Thus, the changes authorized under the law are limited to school districts that are consistently underperforming. Similar to the law permitting mayoral appointment of certain school boards that was upheld in\n   <em>\n    Mixon\n   </em>\n   , Am.Sub.H.B. No. 70 is rationally related to the state's legitimate interest in ensuring a quality education system and improving the quality of underperforming public schools.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Thus, based on the record in this case, appellants have failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Am.Sub.H.B. No. 70 violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Ohio Constitution or the United States Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Accordingly, we overrule appellants' first assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Having concluded that appellants' failed to demonstrate success on the merits of their claims, their remaining assignments of error are likely rendered moot. However, in the interest of justice, we will consider appellants' arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Appellants' Failure to Show Irreparable Injury\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Appellants argue in their second assignment of error the trial court erred by concluding they failed to show irreparable injury would occur if the injunction was not granted. In support of this assignment of error, appellants cite various provisions of R.C. 3302.10(G) and (H), authorizing a chief executive officer appointed by an academic distress commission to reconstitute or close schools, replace school administrators, teachers, and staff, reopen collective bargaining agreements, and contract with a non-profit or for-profit entity to manage operations of the school. However, as appellees note, Am.Sub.H.B. No. 70 went into effect on October 15, 2015, and appellants have not demonstrated any irreparable injury that has occurred during the intervening period. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude the trial court abused its discretion by concluding appellants failed to show that immediate and irreparable harm would result if a permanent injunction was not granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Accordingly, we overrule appellants' second assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Appellants' Failure to Show an Injunction Would Not Cause Harm to Third Parties and Would Serve the Public Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 41} Appellants claim in their third assignment of error the trial court\n   erred by concluding they failed to establish that third parties would not be harmed by granting a permanent injunction. In their fourth assignment of error, appellants assert the trial court erred by concluding they failed to establish that granting an injunction would serve the public interest. Because appellants raise similar arguments in support of their third and fourth assignments of error, we will consider them together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Appellants argue third parties and the public have an interest in ensuring that the protections of the Ohio Constitution are preserved and that laws are properly enacted, as well as ensuring the right to vote is protected. Appellants further assert that third parties would not be harmed by the grant of a permanent injunction because enjoining Am.Sub.H.B. No. 70 would retain the academic distress commission that existed in Youngstown under prior law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 43} The trial court concluded appellants failed to prove that third parties would not be harmed by granting an injunction, noting that if Am.Sub.H.B. 70 was enjoined, the chief executive officer to be appointed by a newly constituted academic distress commission would be prevented from creating an improvement plan for the school district. With respect to appellants' public interest arguments, the trial court concluded that while the public has interests in ensuring constitutional rights are preserved, the public also has an interest in having effective public schools, and that the latter interest was served by Am.Sub.H.B. No. 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Appellants' argument that third parties would not be harmed by granting a permanent injunction is implicitly based on a presumption that the Youngstown school district would improve if the existing academic distress commission structure was left in place. In support of their motion for preliminary injunction and in their brief on appeal, appellants cite only to testimony from the superintendent of the school district stating his belief that the school district was on its way to recovery when he was hired shortly before passage of Am.Sub.H.B. No. 70. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude the trial court abused its discretion by determining appellants failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that granting a permanent injunction would not harm third parties. Similarly, as explained above, we find that Am.Sub.H.B. No. 70 does not violate the protections provided under the Ohio Constitution or the United States Constitution. Therefore, we cannot conclude the trial court abused its discretion by rejecting appellants' assertion that the public interest would be served by granting a permanent injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Accordingly, we overrule appellants' third and fourth assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 46} For the foregoing reasons, we overrule appellants' four assignments of error and affirm the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   BROWN, P.J., concurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   TYACK, J., dissents.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    In relevant part, Article II, Section 15(A) of the Ohio Constitution provides that \"[b]ills may originate in either house, but may be altered, amended, or rejected in the other.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Appellants introduced transcripts of the Senate and House proceedings on Am.Sub.H.B. No. 70 demonstrating that opponents of the amendments spoke out against them and urged their colleagues to oppose them. On the floor of the Senate, Senator Lehner, the chair of the education committee, argued in favor of the legislation but acknowledged the amendments had been brought to her committee late and that some committee members were concerned the amendments had not been properly vetted. Senator Sawyer argued against the legislation, asserting that the amendments had not been adequately vetted and arguing that more time was needed to build consensus on the appropriate reforms. Similarly, Senators Schiavoni, Thomas, Tavares, Skindell, Yuko, and Brown argued extensively against the bill, asserting concerns that the amendments had been drafted by a small group of people and had been introduced too quickly without providing adequate time for review and consideration. Senator Brown moved to recommit the bill to the education committee and that motion was defeated. Senator Schiavoni also offered two amendments to the legislation on the floor of the Senate modifying the residency requirement for members of the academic distress commission appointed by the state superintendent of education and indicating that a chief executive officer for a school district appointed by an academic distress commission would serve at the pleasure of the commission; these amendments were adopted without objection. Following the floor discussion and amendment, the Senate passed Am.Sub.H.B. No. 70 by a vote of 18 to 14.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    In the House, similar objections were expressed. One of the original sponsors of the legislation, Representative Driehaus, argued against the amendments, citing, in part, the speed with which the legislation was amended and urging her colleagues not to concur in the Senate amendments. Representatives Lepore-Hagan, O'Brien, Gerberry, Ramos, Fedor, and Strahorn also expressed concerns about the content and complexity of the Senate amendments and the speed with which they were adopted. After the floor discussion, the House voted to concur in the Senate amendments to the bill by a vote of 55 to 40, whereas the House had passed the original version of H.B. No. 70 by a vote of 92 to 6. This extensive record establishes that members of the Senate and House were made aware of the speed with which the amendments had been adopted and the concerns arising from that process. Thus, although the amendments proceeded quickly there was significant debate and discussion before each chamber adopted the final version of Am.Sub.H.B. No. 70. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that the underlying purpose of the Three Reading Rule was violated.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"dissent\">\n  <author id=\"p-80\">\n   TYACK, J., dissenting.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 47} I do not agree with the majority of this panel on the issue of the Three Reading Rule because the various amendments did vitally alter the legislation. Since the Three Reading Rule is a very simple requirement to meet, I do not foresee judicial encroachment on the legislative process. All the Ohio legislature has to\n   do is comply with the simple rules applicable to passing laws. Here, it did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 48} A bill does not have to be wholly changed in order to be vitally altered. I note that Am.Sub.H.B. No. 70 went from being a 10 page bill to a 77 page bill in a period of less than 24 hours. It was then passed on a party-line vote. It went from allowing school districts to create community learning centers to a law which allowed the state of Ohio to take complete control of a school district, pitching the local school board and local superintendent out of the day-to-day running of the school district. I see this as vitally altering a bill with little or no opportunity for input from the full range of interested parties. Such input as occurred came from the political friends of the Governor of Ohio and from persons closely wired to the leadership of the Ohio General Assembly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 49} The persons who wrote the Ohio Constitution displayed impressive wisdom. They said bills should have three readings so the public can know what is being considered and possibly passed. They said bills should have one subject, not one part to create community learning centers and another part which allows government to divest control of the local school district from local elected leadership to persons chosen by state leadership. We ignore the wisdom of the persons who drafted our Ohio Constitution at great peril to good government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 50} I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
