We find no merit in his sole assignment of error, and we affirm his conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. Facts and Procedure\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On September 19, 2015, Gage was arrested and charged with obstructing official business under R.C. 2921.31, a second-degree misdemeanor, and walking in a roadway and impeding traffic, a minor misdemeanor. He first asserted his right to speedy trial on May 26, 2016. He was not tried until October 19, 2016, over a year after his arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Immediately before trial, the state dismissed the obstructing-official-business charge, and the case proceeded to a bench trial on the minor misdemeanor. Gage was found guilty, and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In his sole assignment of error, Gage contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss. He argues that the state's delay in bringing him to trial violated both his statutory and constitutional rights to a speedy trial. This assignment of error is not well taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II. Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Our review of the trial court's decision involves mixed questions of fact and law. We give due weight to the inferences drawn from the facts found by the trial court as long as they are supported by competent, credible evidence. We review the trial court's conclusions of law de novo to determine whether the facts satisfy\n   the applicable legal standard.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Statutory Right to a Speedy Trial\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Gage was charged with a minor misdemeanor and a second-degree misdemeanor, which was not dismissed until the day of trial. R.C. 2945.71(D) provides that \"[a] person against whom one or more charges of different degrees * * * all of which arose out of the same act or transaction, are pending shall be brought to trial on all of the charges within the time period required for the highest degree of the offense charged * * *.\" The state must bring a person charged with a second-degree misdemeanor to trial within 90 days of the person's arrest or the service of summons. R.C. 2945.71(B)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Because Gage showed that he was not tried within 90 days of his arrest, he established a prima facie violation of the speedy-trial statutes.\n   <em>\n    State v.

On September 21, 2015, he appeared in court and asked for a continuance to speak to an attorney. On September 28, although he appeared in court, he refused to acknowledge his own presence in the courtroom, and a capias was issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On October 8, 2015, the court journalized a motion and entry recalling the capias and reset the date for an arraignment. The entry specifically stated that Gage \"knowingly and voluntarily extends the time limitations to be brought to trial * * * from the date of the original arrest to the next scheduled date.\" It was signed by the defendant personally, not just his counsel. Thus, Gage knowingly waived his speedy-trial rights from the date of his arrest until October 16, the next scheduled date, and none of that time was chargeable to the state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thus, the speedy-trial time was tolled. At a\n   hearing on December 17, he failed to appear in court and another capias was issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On February 18, 2016, the court journalized an entry recalling the capias issued on December 17, 2015. Again, Gage himself signed the entry, which stated that he \"knowingly and voluntarily extended the time limitations to be brought to trial\" from date of his arrest until \"the next scheduled date.\" Gage again waived his speedy-trial rights from the date of his arrest until the next scheduled hearing date on March 3, 2016. Therefore, there was still no time chargeable to the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 13} At two subsequent hearings, on March 3 and March 17, Gage asked for continuances, so that time was also not chargeable to the state. On March 31, the case was referred to the assignment commissioner for a jury trial, which would have started the speedy-trial time running, except that Gage executed another speedy-trial waiver for the period from March 31 until May 4. So, due to either continuances requested by Gage or waivers, no time elapsed that was chargeable to the state from the date of arrest until May 4, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 14} On May 4, the case was continued on a \"defense request for pretrial\" because Gage was incarcerated on pending charges in the Greene County jail. Since the continuance was a result of his motion, the time was not chargeable to the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 15} On May 23, Gage's counsel indicated that he was incarcerated in the Greene County jail and that he wanted to be brought back to Hamilton County for trial. The matter was continued for a jury trial. Gage executed another waiver of the time from May 23, until June 28, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 16} The record shows that on May 31, 2016, he withdrew that waiver. The waiver was effective from the date it was executed until the date it was withdrawn.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Boles\n   </em>\n   , 2d Dist.

But even if we do not consider that waiver, Gage was still tried within the speedy-trial period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The time from May 4 to May 23 was not chargeable to the state because the continuance was granted at Gage's request. On May 23, when the matter was set for a jury trial, the time began to run.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The next hearing occurred on May 26, so three days elapsed that were chargeable to the state. At that hearing, Gage moved to dismiss the charges for lack of a speedy trial. The trial court overruled that motion on May 31. The time from May 26 to May 31 was not chargeable to the state because the delay was attributable to Gage's own motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 19} On May 31, the court also noted that Gage was still in the custody of the Greene County Sheriff. It issued a capias \"to ensure that the Defendant will be transported to Hamilton County once the more serious felony charges are adjudicated in Greene County, Ohio.\" It further stated, \"Additionally, the Court will send a letter to the Sheriff of Greene County and the Sheriff of Hamilton County with this entry to facilitate delivery of the defendant as soon as he becomes available.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Under R.C. 2945.72(A), the speedy-trial period is tolled by any time that the accused is unavailable for hearing or trial, by reason of other criminal proceedings against him \"provided that the prosecution exercises reasonable diligence to secure his availability.\" If the defendant is incarcerated in the county jail of another Ohio county, and the prosecution is aware of the defendant's whereabouts, the record must show that the prosecutor exercised reasonable diligence to have the defendant appear before the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

Second, issuance of a capias and execution within a reasonable time constitute reasonable diligence to secure the defendant.\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   at *2. Therefore, the speedy-trial period was extended by the time that Gage was in jail in Greene County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 22} On August 17, the trial court recalled the capias and requested that the matter be set for trial, which started the time running again. The next hearing occurred on September 13. The 27 days between August 17 and September 13 were chargeable to the state. Thus, a total of 30 days was chargeable to the state at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 23} At the September 13 hearing, defense counsel asked for a continuance because she was in progress on another trial. Because the case was continued at the defendant's request, the running of the speedy-trial period was tolled until the trial date of October 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Thus, from the date that Gage was arrested until the October 19, 2016 trial date, only 30 days chargeable to the state elapsed. Therefore, Gage was tried within the speedy-trial period. The trial court did not err in overruling Gage's motion to dismiss based on the alleged violation of his statutory right to a speedy trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     IV.
