Young, III appeals the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress a firearm and several baggies of marijuana and pills police discovered after placing him under arrest. Upon review, we overrule his sole assigned error and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The record developed at the suppression hearing reveals that one evening, a Parma Heights resident called 911 to report two males breaking glass in an intersection. The caller stated that the suspects were heading south on Edgehill Drive towards the intersection where Edgehill merges into Pearl Road, and that one of them was on a bicycle. Two police officers, in separate patrol cars, responded to the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The officers arrived to the vicinity within minutes of being dispatched. The first officer came upon Young, who was riding a bicycle on the sidewalk, heading south on Pearl Road near Edgehill Drive. He relayed this information to the second officer and continued to search for additional suspects. The second officer saw Young on his bicycle, immediately turned his cruiser around, and activated his lights. Young stopped. The other officer arrived shortly thereafter and they questioned Young about what he was doing and if he knew about the broken glass. They asked Young if they could see his identification and Young complied. The officers ran Young's information through dispatch and were alerted to the fact that Young had an active warrant. After arresting Young, police discovered the firearm and contraband. Young moved to suppress the items arguing that the police did not have a right to stop him. The trial court denied his motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} \"Appellate review of a motion to suppress presents a mixed question of law and fact.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

He argues that he could not, and did not, voluntarily provide his identification to the police because at the point the officers asked him for it, he was not free to leave and had no choice but to comply with their request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} When the police encountered Young, one immediately turned around, activated his lights, and approached him. That officer did not remember exactly what he said to engage Young, but testified that his tone was not angry or loud, that he did not yell at Young, nor did he order him to stop his bicycle. The officer testified to saying something to the effect of \"hey, can I talk to you?\" The other officer arrived within a short time, at which point the officers asked Young where he was coming from, where he was going, what he was doing, and why he was in the area. They asked him if he knew anything about the broken-glass incident. Neither officer drew a weapon or physically touched Young. One officer described the manner in which he addressed Young as being a \"normal conversational tone.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} With regard to whether a reasonable person would have felt free to leave at this point, both of the officers' testimony, as well as Young's were clear that Young was not free to leave.\n   <em>\n    But see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whren v.

Young argues, therefore, that the encounter was an investigatory stop and not a consensual encounter. Even assuming that to be true, the police had reasonable suspicion to believe that Young was involved in the glass-breaking incident. The 911 call indicated that one of the suspects was a male on a bicycle heading in the same direction as Young was heading. Admittedly this description is generic, but Young fit it. This, combined with testimony from one of the officers that there was nobody else outside at that time of night, compels us to find that the stop was lawful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} \" 'Ordinarily, an investigating officer is free to ask a person for identification without implicating the [Fourth] Amendment.' \"\n   <em>\n    Hiibel\n   </em>\n   , 542 U.S. at syllabus,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2528582\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/177/#p185\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2528582\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/177/#p185\">\n    159 L.Ed.2d 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting\n   <em>\n    INS v.
