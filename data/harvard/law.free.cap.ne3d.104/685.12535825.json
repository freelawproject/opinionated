After a trial, a jury returned a guilty verdict on all remaining charges and the judge sentenced the defendant. The Supreme Judicial Court upheld the defendant's convictions on all but two of the charges, setting aside the defendant's two convictions of armed assault with intent to murder and remanding the case to the Superior Court for a new trial on those indictments.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dung Van Tran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3685501\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/463/8/\">\n    463 Mass. 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). On July 17, 2013, the Commonwealth filed a nolle prosequi on the two remanded charges after conferring with the victims' families, who requested not to be forced to endure a second trial on the matter. The defendant then filed a motion for new trial on March 2, 2017, which the Commonwealth opposed and a judge denied. The defendant appeals, alleging that the judge erred in denying his motion for new trial because the defendant was not afforded trial counsel at the entry of nolle prosequi. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   The defendant alleges that the prosecution's filing of a nolle prosequi was a critical stage at which the protections of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution entitled him to counsel. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3844639\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/80/505/#p510\">\n    80 Mass. App. Ct. 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 510-511 (2011). He can point to no cases and we can find none that stands for this proposition. Critical stages occur when \"the accused finds himself 'confronted, just as at trial, by the procedural system, or by his expert adversary, or by both.' \"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sargent\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3816811\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/449/576/#p580\">\n    449 Mass. 576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 580 (2007), quoting from\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Byers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3802331,622972\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/740/1104/\">\n    740 F.2d 1104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1117-1118 (D.C. Cir. 1984). Alternatively, entering nolle prosequi for the defendant's charges, \"[i]n effect, ... wipes out the charges pending against the defendant and precludes the State from prosecuting the defendant under the charging document that was nolle prossed.\" 4 LaFave, Israel, King, &amp; Kerr, Criminal Procedure \u00a7 13.3(c), at 179 n.37 (4th ed. 2015). The defendant here was \"not confronted by the procedural system; he [had] no decisions in the nature of legal strategy or tactics to make.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sargent\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3816811\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/449/576/#p580\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3816811\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/449/576/#p580\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   quoting from\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Byers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3802331,622972\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/740/1104/\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3802331,622972\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/740/1104/\">\n    at 1118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
