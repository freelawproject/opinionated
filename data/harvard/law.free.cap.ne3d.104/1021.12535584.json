This Court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In August 2013, David Petroskey, as buyer, and Dee Martin, as seller, entered\n   into a purchase agreement for 5555 Laura Lane in Lorain (\"the Home\"). Jasmine Petroskey is David Petroskey's wife, and Dr. Thomas Martin is Dee Martin's husband. Prior to the sale, the Home had been titled solely in Dee Martin's name. The record does not reflect how the Petroskeys titled the Home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In April 2013, Mrs. Martin, with the assistance of Dr. Martin, had completed an Ohio Residential Property Disclosure Form (\"Disclosure Form\"). The Disclosure Form asked, \"Do you know of any previous or current water leakage, water accumulation, excess moisture or other defects to the property, including but not limited to any area below grade, basement or crawl space?\" Mrs. Martin checked the \"No\" box following this question. The Disclosure Form also asked, \"Do you know of any previous or current leaks or other material problems with the roof or rain gutters? * * * If 'Yes,' please describe and indicate any repairs completed (but no longer than the past 5 years).\" Mrs. Martin checked the \"No\" box on this question as well. In her deposition, Mrs. Martin testified that, at the time she completed the Disclosure Form, she \"thought it was about seven years\" since they had the roof replaced and that had been done for \"cosmetic reasons.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In September 2013, Mr. Petroskey had the home inspected. The inspection report noted various water issues and concerns about the roof. For instance, the crawl space had \"[e]vidence of past or present water leakage\" and \"[e]levated moisture\" at the time of the inspection. In addition, \"wet areas [were] noted at [the] time of the inspection on the south[, and] the buyer mentioned that[,] when he [ ] was walking through the home[,] he noted wet areas on the north side of the crawlspace.\" (Emphasis deleted.) The inspector also noted that the property's grading was a \"[f]lat [i]mproper soil slope towards [the] foundation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Further, the inspector found \"[e]vidence of past water leakage\" around the skylights and \"[e]vidence of past or present water staining\" on the ceilings in all bedrooms in the home, the family room, and the master bathroom. He found a \"mold like substance [ ] in the main attic specifically near the lower north soffits\" and that the \"[s]heathing show[ed] evidence of past or present water stains.\" (Emphasis deleted.) The inspector observed \"[e]vidence of repairs on the roof\" and opined that \"the roof may [ ] be less th[a]n 7 years old.\" He further observed that there was loose and damaged trim wood where it was in contact with the roof and damaged wood fascia \"from past or present leaks.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The inspector recommended that Mr. Petroskey \"[i]nquire with the seller regarding [the] history of [the roof] repairs and any potential warranties\" and \"inquire with the owner as to the scope of the repairs noted on the roof and flashing.\" He also \"recommend[ed] * * * increas[ed] ventilation of the roof.\" (Emphasis deleted.) Finally, the inspector stated multiple times in his report that \"[a] qualified roofing contractor is recommended to evaluate and estimate repairs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Following the inspection, Mr. Petroskey developed a list of items that concerned him. That list included some, but not all, of the items identified by the inspector. In October 2013, Mr. Petroskey and Mrs. Martin amended their purchase agreement. The amendment removed the general home inspection contingency and reduced the sale price. Mr. Petroskey testified that he went through the Home \"[m]aybe half a dozen\" times before finalizing the purchase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In November 2013, the Petroskeys moved in to the Home. At that time, they\n   were provided a folder containing documents related to various improvements that the Martins had done to the Home. Within that folder were invoices for roof work from June 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} According to the Petroskeys, they experienced \"ice damming\" on the roof, leaking skylights, and a leaking roof soon after moving in to the Home. In addition, \"the front yard did not drain properly and [ ] water entered the crawlspace and collected on the floor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The Petroskeys sued alleging that Dr. and Mrs. Martin (1) \"misrepresented that the roof did not have 'previous or current leaks or other material problems' \" and (2) \"misrepresented that there were no 'current or previous water leakage, water accumulation, excess moisture, or other defects in [ ] the property including but not limited to any area below grade, basement or crawl space.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The Martins moved for summary judgment. The Petroskeys opposed the motion. The trial court granted summary judgment to the Martins finding that (1) the evidence did not \"establish that the [Martins] incorrectly filled the form out knowing it was false or * * * 'with such utter disregard and recklessness as to whether it [was] true or false that knowledge may be inferred' \" and (2) there was \"no justifiable reliance by the [Petroskeys].\" (Emphasis deleted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The Petroskeys appeal, raising one assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT GRANTED SELLER's MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDG[ ]MENT BECAUSE IT FAILED TO VIEW THE EVIDENCE IN A LIGHT \"MOST STRONGLY\" FAVORABLE TO BUYER AND WEIGHED THE EVIDENCE.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In their sole assignment of error, the Petroskeys argue, \"The trial court weighed the evidence before it [to] conclude[ ] that 'the testimony before the court fails to establish that the [Martins] incorrectly filled the form out knowing it was false or * * * 'with such utter disregard and recklessness as to whether it [was] true or false that knowledge may be inferred.' ' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Initially, this Court notes that the Petroskeys concede that the inspection report \"may have placed\" them on notice regarding the crawl space. The Petroskeys then set forth their argument based on the roof. This Court will likewise limit its analysis to the roof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 15} This Court reviews an award of summary judgment de novo.\n   <em>\n    Grafton v.
