Rohrer Associates Inc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   STATEMENT OF THE FACTS AND CASE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In 1992, and 1993, Appellee submitted two proposals to provide engineering services for the construction of the Ohio Department of Transportation (hereinafter \"ODOT\") District 11 garage in New Philadelphia, Ohio. Appellee signed an agreement with the Ohio Department of Administrative Services (hereinafter \"ODAS\") to provide design services related\n   to structural engineering and related supervision for the construction of the garage. Structural designs for the project were provided by the State Architect's Office (hereinafter \"SAO\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In 1997, the SAO became aware of issues with the brick around five windows of the completed building. Appellee paid ODAS $68,000.00 to remediate the issue around the windows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Appellants later claimed all windows showed some degree of impermissible rotation of the steel supporting the brick, causing the brick around the windows to crumble and/or crack. Appellants further claimed the two-plus-story garage walls of the facility were not adequately supported. Appellants filed the instant action on March 3, 2015, for negligence, breach of contract, and declaratory judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On September 28, 2015, Appellee filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, arguing Appellants' complaint was barred by Ohio's statute of repose, R.C. 2305.131. The trial overruled the motion on December 31, 2015, finding R.C. 2305.131 is generally worded and does not say it applies to the State, and Appellants were exempt from operation of the statute by the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    nullum tempus.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The case proceeded to jury trial on February 22 and 23, 2017. Prior to trial, Appellants dismissed their claims for negligence and for declaratory judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} At the close of the presentation of Appellants' case at trial, Appellee moved for directed verdict on various grounds, again arguing the action was barred by R.C. 2305.131. Tr. 445. The trial court directed a verdict as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Based upon evidence illicited [sic] by the Plaintiffs from Defendant's principal, the Agreement was acknowledged, the Defendant stated that the work was performed, and the Defendant affirmed that it was paid upon completion of the work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Based upon the evidence presented by Plaintiffs' expert, the claims for damage were proximately caused by inadequate design, regarding the standard of care for engineering.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The Complaint, Pre-trial Statement, and finally, the evidence at trial, presented a claim in tort.

We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b611} Civ.

If the trial court finds on any determinative issue reasonable minds could come but to one conclusion on the evidence submitted, then the court shall sustain the motion and direct the verdict as to such issue.

Almost every state, including Ohio, enacted this type of statute, recognizing that architects and builders were exposed to liability for an indefinite time due to the longevity of buildings. Over such a long time, evidence becomes stale and intervening negligence could and does occur. I find unpersuasive the argument that the legislature would have passed such legislation intending it to apply only to tort claims but not to contract claims that allege the same type of injury.

In the instant case, the current statute is clearly not a statute of limitations as the\n   <em>\n    Kocisko\n   </em>\n   court characterized the prior version of R.C. 2305.131. Rather than limiting the time in which the action may be brought, the current statute prevents the cause of action from accruing after ten years has passed, stating \"no cause of action shall accrue\" later than ten years from the date the project was substantially completed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 24} In addition, R.C. 2305.131 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   (F)

Revised Code in this act, it is the intent of the General Assembly to do all of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   (1) To declare that the ten-year statute of repose prescribed by section 2305.131 of the Revised Code, as enacted by this act, is a specific provision intended to promote a greater interest than the interest underlying the general four-year statute of limitations prescribed by section 2305.09 of the Revised Code, the general two-year statute of limitations prescribed by section 2305.10 of the Revised Code, and other general statutes of limitation prescribed by the Revised Code;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   (2) To recognize that, subsequent to the completion of the construction of an improvement to real property, all of the

professionals, construction contractors, and construction subcontractors and to declare that the ten-year statute of repose prescribed in that section is a rational period of repose intended to preclude the pitfalls of stale litigation but not to affect civil actions against those in actual control and possession of an improvement to real property at the time that a defective and unsafe condition of that improvement causes an injury to real or personal property, bodily injury, or wrongful death. 2004 SB 80 \u00a7 3, eff. 4-7-05.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 28} We

Based on the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    nullum tempus\n   </em>\n   , the state of Ohio is not subject to general requirements of statutes of limitations unless the statute in question has specifically included the government.\n   <em>\n    State, Dept. of Transp. v.

We reiterate the present version is not a statute of limitations but rather a declaration of when a cause of action no longer exists.

In that case, the Illinois court first undertook an analysis of the application of\n   <em>\n    nullum tempus\n   </em>\n   to the statute of limitations, as in Illinois the test for its applicability is whether the right the State seeks to assert is a right belonging to the general public, or whether it belongs only to the government or a small subsection of the public at large.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 361,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=265%20Ill.%20Dec.%20535\">\n    265 Ill.Dec. 535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=772%20N.E.2d%20906\">\n    772 N.E.2d 906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After determining the right was one belonging to the general public and the statute of limitations did not apply based on the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    nullum tempus\n   </em>\n   , the court then found the statute of repose also did not bar the action, citing\n   <em>\n    People v.

However, the Illinois statute in question in\n   <em>\n    Asbestospray\n   </em>\n   differed from the Ohio statute. Unlike R.C. 2305.131 which prevents the cause of action from\n   accruing, the Illinois statute provides no product liability action based on strict liability \"shall be commenced except within the applicable limitations period and, in any event, within 12 years from the date of first sale....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 260,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=186%20Ill.%20Dec.%20462\">\n    186 Ill.Dec. 462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=616%20N.E.2d%20652\">\n    616 N.E.2d 652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 38} We find the\n   <em>\n    City of Chicago\n   </em>\n   case unpersuasive in the instant appeal. The Illinois statutory language is more similar to a statute of limitations than the language in the Ohio statute. Further, Illinois requires consideration of whether the government is engaged in a public function prior to applying the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    nullum tempus.\n   </em>\n   Ohio has no such requirement, and thus application of the doctrine to the statute of repose would provide a sweeping application to all actions brought by the State.
