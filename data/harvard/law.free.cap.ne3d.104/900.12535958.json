For the reasons that follow, we affirm in part; reverse in part; and remand for a hearing regarding the imposition of court costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Jeffries was charged in a four-count indictment as follows: Count 1, rape in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b) ; Count 2, kidnapping in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(4) with a sexual motivation specification; Count 3, rape in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(2) ; and Count 4, kidnapping in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(4) with a sexual motivation specification. Counts 1 and 2 related to an incident that occurred on December 23, 2011, the victim's twelfth birthday, and Counts 3 and 4 related to an incident that occurred in March 2016, when the victim was 16 years old.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Jeffries pleaded not guilty and the case proceeded to a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The evidence adduced at trial demonstrated that Jeffries and R.S., the victim's mother, had an on and off relationship for several years. During those years, R.S. had one child with Jeffries and two children with other men, including D.S., the victim in this case. R.S. eventually lost custody of the children, and they went to foster care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} D.S. testified that she lived in three different foster homes before she was six years old, when she went to live with H.G., Jeffries's mother, who had obtained custody of R.S.'s three children. Jeffries also lived in the home. D.S. was not Jeffries's biological child but she testified that she considered him to be her father and called him \"Dad.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} D.S. testified that about a year after she moved in, Jeffries began touching her inappropriately. She said the first incident she remembered was when Jeffries lay on his back on the couch, placed her on his stomach, placed his hand on her buttocks, and then moved his hand around. Both D.S. and Jeffries were clothed during this incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} D.S. testified that the inappropriate touching continued as she grew older. She recalled an incident when she was about nine years old when Jeffries came into the living room while she was watching television and forced her to take her clothes off and sit on his lap on the couch. She testified that there were other incidents\n   where Jeffries would force her to take her clothes off and sit on his lap; she said that sometimes he was dressed during these incidents but at other times he would have his pants down. She said that during these incidents, Jeffries would touch her buttocks, breasts, and vagina. D.S. testified that the incidents occurred when H.G. left the house on the weekends or after her brothers were in bed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} D.S. testified that on December 23, 2011, her twelfth birthday, Jeffries instructed her to take her clothes off and lay on the couch. She said that Jeffries, who was undressed, laid on top of her and after touching her vagina, inserted his fingers and then his penis into her vagina. D.S. testified that she did not feel like she could leave or get away from Jeffries during this incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} D.S. testified that this type of sexual activity continued for \"years.\" She said that she never told anyone about the abuse because she was afraid that no one would believe her, or she would be sent back to foster care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} In March 2016, when she was sixteen years old, D.S. finally told Jacqueline Bell, the principal at her high school, about the abuse because she \"was just tired of it.\" D.S. testified that one or two weeks before she told Ms. Bell, Jeffries came into her bedroom one night as she was sleeping. She said she was sleeping on her stomach, dressed in pajama pants, underwear, and a tee-shirt, when she awoke to Jeffries lying on top of her. D.S. testified that Jeffries pulled her pajama pants and underwear down, and then pulled his own pants off. She said that he then got back on top of her and put his penis in her vagina. She testified that during this incident, she did not feel like she could leave and had no choice but to stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} After Jeffries left her room, D.S. decided to run away. She packed two bags and left home at approximately 11 p.m. D.S. said she took Jeffries's cell phone with her because he had hidden her phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} During the hours after D.S. ran away, Jeffries called her over 30 times but D.S. did not answer. He also texted her at approximately 10:30 a.m. the following morning, telling her \"police on way\" and asking her to \"don't tell on me.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 12} After she ran away, D.S. walked to her high school and when it opened at 7 a.m., told Bell about the abuse. Bell called Cuyahoga County Department of Children and Family Services (\"CCDCFS\"), and CCDCFS social worker Shannon Sneed responded to the school and interviewed D.S. The police were called, and Jeffries was eventually arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} At trial, Jeffries denied that he ever sexually abused D.S. He admitted sending a text to her the morning after she ran away, but said that he texted \"police on way\" only because he did not want D.S. to be scared when the police arrived at her school. He also said he intended to text \"just talk to me\" but the old cell phone he was using somehow changed his text to \"don't tell on me.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The jury found Jeffries guilty of all counts. The prosecutor and defense counsel agreed that for purposes of sentencing, Counts 1 and 2 merged and Counts 3 and 4 merged. The state elected to proceed to sentencing on Counts 2 and 3. The trial court sentenced Jeffries to life in prison on Count 2, with parole eligibility after 15 years, to run concurrent to 10 years incarceration on Count 3. The court also imposed court costs. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Evidence of Victim's Prior Allegations of Nonconsensual Sexual Abuse Precluded From Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Prior to trial, the trial court held an in camera hearing pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State v. Boggs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1714495\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/63/418/\">\n    63 Ohio St.3d 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=588%20N.E.2d%20813\">\n    588 N.E.2d 813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992), to determine the admissibility at trial of evidence regarding D.S.'s prior allegations of sexual misconduct against a foster brother. At the hearing, D.S. testified that when she was in a foster home at age four or five, one of her foster brothers sexually abused her, including putting his penis in her vagina. She said that the activity was not consensual, and that she honestly disclosed the abuse to a CCDCFS social worker. The trial court then denied Jeffries's request to allow defense counsel to ask questions of D.S. regarding these prior allegations of sexual abuse by the foster brother, concluding that cross-examination on this issue was precluded by Ohio's rape shield statute. In his first assignment of error, Jeffries contends that the trial court erred in denying his request because it violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 16} R.C. 2907.02(D), Ohio's rape shield statute, states, in relevant part, that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Evidence of specific instances of the victim's sexual activity, opinion evidence of the victim's sexual activity, and reputation evidence of the victim's sexual activity shall not be admitted under this section unless it involves evidence of the origin of semen, pregnancy, or disease, or the victim's past sexual activity with the offender, and only to the extent that the court finds that the evidence is material to a fact at issue in the case and that its inflammatory or prejudicial nature does not outweigh its probative value.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Jeffries cites to\n   <em>\n    State v. Stoffer\n   </em>\n   , 7th Dist. Columbia No. 09-CO-1,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011-Ohio-5133\">\n    2011-Ohio-5133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%204579182\">\n    2011 WL 4579182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in which the Seventh District found that the rape shield statute address only prior\n   <em>\n    consensual\n   </em>\n   sexual activity of the victim and not prior sexual abuse suffered by the victim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 98. Thus, in\n   <em>\n    Stoffer\n   </em>\n   , although it ultimately found the error to be harmless, the Seventh District held that the trial court erred in applying the rape shield statute to preclude the defendant from introducing evidence that the victim had previously been sexually abused by someone other than the defendant. In\n   <em>\n    State v. Sledge\n   </em>\n   , 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-15-1109,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-4904\">\n    2016-Ohio-4904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203654677\">\n    2016 WL 3654677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Sixth District, citing\n   <em>\n    Stoffer\n   </em>\n   , found that where alleged prior sexual abuse of the victim does not result from \"volitional sexual acts * * * it may not fall within the general prohibition mandated by R.C. 2907.02(D).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19. In reliance on\n   <em>\n    Stoffer\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Sledge\n   </em>\n   , Jeffries asserts that the rape shield statute did not preclude his cross-examination of D.S. regarding her prior allegations of sexual abuse against a foster brother. We disagree because the Ohio Supreme Court has made it clear that both prior nonconsensual and consensual sexual activity of the victim are protected by the rape shield statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 18} In\n   <em>\n    Boggs\n   </em>\n   , supra, the Ohio Supreme Court considered whether the rape shield statute prohibits a defendant from cross-examining an alleged rape victim about prior false rape allegations. The court held that before cross-examination of a rape victim regarding prior false rape accusations may proceed, \"the trial judge shall hold an in camera hearing to ascertain whether such testimony involves sexual activity and thus is inadmissible under R.C. 2907.02(D), or is totally unfounded and admissible for impeachment of the victim.\"\n   <em>\n    Boggs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1714495\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/63/418/\">\n    63 Ohio St.3d at 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=588%20N.E.2d%20813\">\n    588 N.E.2d 813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The Supreme Court also held that the burden is on the defendant to demonstrate that the accusations were false. The court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   the initial inquiry must be whether the accusations were actually made by the prosecutrix. Moreover, the trial court must also be satisfied that the prior allegations of sexual misconduct were actually false or fabricated. That is, the trial court must ascertain whether\n   <em>\n    any sexual activity took place, i.e., an actual rape or consensual sex. If it is established that either type of activity took place, the rape shield statute prohibits any further inquiry into this area.\n   </em>\n   Only if it is determined that the prior accusations were false because no sexual activity took place would the rape shield law not bar further cross-examination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 423,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=588%20N.E.2d%20813\">\n    588 N.E.2d 813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In short, if any type of sexual activity occurred and the allegation was not false, the victim is protected by the rape shield statute, and the defendant may not question the victim about the prior sexual activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Here, the trial court conducted an in camera hearing at which it learned that the incident involving D.S.'s foster brother had occurred one or two years before she moved in with H.G. and Jeffries. D.S. never wavered from her claims that the incident occurred, and that she honestly reported it to CCDCFS. After hearing from D.C., the trial court decided that the incident was protected by the rape shield statute because it involved sexual activity, and there was no evidence whatsoever that the allegation was false. On this record and in light of\n   <em>\n    Boggs\n   </em>\n   , we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's ruling. The first assignment of error is therefore overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Other Acts Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 21} In his second assignment of error, Jeffries contends that the trial court erred by admitting evidence of his prior bad acts; specifically, in allowing D.S. to testify about prior instances of sexual abuse against her other than the two incidents for which he was indicted. Jeffries contends this evidence was \"classic bad-man evidence\" that was unrelated to the two incidents for which he was indicted and allowed the jury to convict him on the charged offenses merely because it assumed that he acted in conformity with his bad character.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Defense counsel did not object to the admission of this evidence at trial and therefore has waived all but plain error on appeal.\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, there are exceptions that allow other acts of wrongdoing to be admitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 24} First, R.C. 2945.59 provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   [i]n any criminal case in which the defendant's motive or intent, the absence of mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant's scheme, plan, or system in doing an act is material, any acts of the defendant which tend to show his motive or intent, the absence of mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant's scheme, plan, or system in doing the act in question may be proved, whether they are contemporaneous with or prior or\n   subsequent thereto, notwithstanding that such proof may show or tend to show the commission of another crime by the defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Also, Evid.R. 404(B) provides that evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is permitted to show proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or the absence of mistake or accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 26} In deciding whether to admit other acts evidence, trial courts should conduct a three-step analysis:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   The first step is to consider whether the other acts evidence is relevant to making any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more or less probable than it would be without the evidence. Evid.R. 401. The next step is to consider whether evidence of the other crimes, wrongs, or acts is presented to prove the character of the accused in order to show activity in conformity therewith or whether the other acts evidence is presented for a legitimate purpose, such as those stated in Evid.R. 404(B). The third step is to consider whether the probative value of the other acts evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Evid.R. 403.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4125145\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/134/521/\">\n    134 Ohio St.3d 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012-Ohio-5695\">\n    2012-Ohio-5695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=983%20N.E.2d%201278\">\n    983 N.E.2d 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Applying this test to the challenged testimony, we find no abuse of discretion by the trial court in admitting the evidence. First, the other acts evidence was relevant because it tended to show Jeffries's plan for grooming D.S. for sexual activity. \" 'Shaping and grooming describes the process of cultivating trust with a victim and gradually introducing sexual behaviors until reaching the point of intercourse.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21, quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11890437\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/132/1279/#p1280\">\n    132 F.3d 1279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1280, fn. 2 (9th Cir.1997). D.S.'s testimony established that the grooming started at six years of age when Jeffries held her and touched her buttocks; progressed through the years to Jeffries having her take her clothes off and sit naked on his lap; escalated to Jeffries touching her breasts and vagina; and finally, culminated in incidents when Jeffries would insert his penis in D.S.'s vagina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Next, the testimony was elicited for a legitimate purpose under Evid.R. 404(B), which provides that other acts evidence may be admitted to show motive, intent, plan, scheme and absence of mistake. D.S.'s testimony was relevant to Jeffries's plan and scheme to groom her over the years from touching to sexual intercourse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 29} And the probative value of the evidence was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Rather than inflaming the jury and appealing only to its emotions (the general test for unfairly prejudicial evidence), the evidence of Jeffries's grooming of D.S. provided a basis for the jury to recognize his ongoing scheme for sexual activity with D.S. And although the trial court did not give a limiting instruction regarding the other acts evidence, D.S. was subject to cross-examination, and defense counsel challenged her credibility and testimony regarding Jeffries's sexual motives and actions. Likewise, Jeffries testified in his own defense that D.S. was lying. The jury was free to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Finally, Jeffries did not request that the trial court give a limiting instruction regarding the other acts evidence. His failure to do so waives all but plain error.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Where the defense fails to request a limiting instruction on other acts evidence, the\n   trial court's failure to give such an instruction is not plain error where nothing suggests the jury used other acts evidence to convict the defendant because he was a bad person.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=920%20N.E.2d%20104\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Jeffries points to nothing that suggests the jury did so. Accordingly, we find no plain error in the trial court's failure to give a limiting instruction and in admitting the other acts evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 31} The second assignment of error is therefore overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

He argues that the \"released in a safe place unharmed\" provision of R.C. 2905.01(C)(3)(a) is a factual sentencing determination that the finder of fact is required to make because it controls which of the two sentencing terms the trial court is required to impose. He asserts that the trial court therefore erred in not instructing the jury to make this determination. Jeffries did not request such a jury instruction, however, and has waived all but plain error, which we do not find.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 34} This court considered and rejected a similar argument in\n   <em>\n    State v.

This testimony, coupled with D.S.'s age, her testimony that she considered Jeffries to be her father and called him \"Dad,\" and Jeffries's acknowledgment that he considered D.S. to be his child and that he helped care for and discipline her, proved that Jeffries restrained D.S.'s liberty by psychological pressure inherent in his position as D.S.'s \"father.\" Accordingly, his conviction for kidnapping is supported by sufficient evidence and not against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 55} Jeffries also contends that his conviction on Count 3, rape in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(2), was not supported by sufficient evidence and is against the manifest weight of the evidence. Under R.C. 2907.02(A)(2), \"[n]o person shall engage in sexual conduct with another when the offender purposely compels the other person to submit by force or threat of force.\" For the same reasons argued with respect to his kidnapping conviction, Jeffries contends that there was no evidence\n   that he compelled D.S. to submit by force or threat of force with respect to the rape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 56} We disagree. The evidence demonstrated that D.S. awoke to find Jeffries on top of her, and that he then pulled her pajama pants and underwear off and inserted his penis in her vagina. D.S. testified that during this incident, she did not feel like she could leave and had no choice but to stay. We find this evidence sufficient to establish that Jeffries used physical force to rape D.S. And as discussed above, Jeffries's position as a father-figure to D.S. restrained her liberty through the psychological pressure he exerted as her \"Dad.\" And despite Jeffries's argument otherwise, there is no requirement that to find the element of force, a rape victim must tell her rapist that she does not want the rape to happen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 57} The jury did not lose its way in convicting Jeffries of kidnapping and rape, nor is this the exceptional case where the evidence weighs heavily against the convictions. The fifth and sixth assignments of error are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Testimony of a Witness Stricken\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 58} During trial, D.S. testified that once when she was sitting on Jeffries's lap while naked, C.J., one of Jeffries's sons, walked into the living room and saw her and Jeffries. Before trial, C.J. told a social worker that he had seen Jeffries and D.S. in the living room engaged in sexual activity. However, when the state called C.J. to the stand, he gave nonresponsive testimony as to whether he had ever seen Jeffries and D.S. together. He also testified that he did not remember telling a social worker about an occasion when he came downstairs, even though Jeffries had told him not to, and saw Jeffries and D.S. engaged in sexual activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 59} The trial court struck C.J.'s testimony, finding that his testimony provided no relevant information. The trial court also found that although the state was surprised by C.J.'s testimony, it did not amount to affirmative damage to the state's case because the incident allegedly observed by C.J. did not occur on either December 23, 2011 or in March 2016, the dates charged in the indictment. Accordingly, the trial court held that under Evid.R. 607, the state was precluded from bringing out any prior inconsistent statements by C.J. Defense counsel did not object to the trial court's ruling, telling the court that she was not going to ask any questions of C.J. anyway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 60} Evid.R. 607(A) prevents a party from impeaching its own witness unless the party is surprised by the testimony and the testimony is damaging. Jeffries agrees with the trial court's analysis that C.J.'s testimony, although a surprise to the state, was not damaging to the state's case because it was not connected to the two incidents charged in the indictment. Thus, he asserts that the trial court properly ruled that the state could not question C.J. regarding his prior inconsistent statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {\u00b6 61} Nevertheless, in his seventh assignment of error, Jeffries argues that the trial court erred in striking C.J.'s testimony because it directly refuted D.S.'s testimony that C.J. had seen her and Jeffries together and, thus, was relevant to D.S.'s credibility. Because Jeffries did not object to the trial court's ruling striking C.J.'s testimony, he has waived all but plain error, which again we do not find.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {\u00b6 62} Our review of the record demonstrates that C.J.'s testimony did not refute D.S.'s testimony that C.J. had once seen her and Jeffries engaging in sexual activity. The record reflects that when he was asked if he remembered ever seeing his father and D.S. together, C.J. first replied,\n   \"no, not really,\" and then when asked what he meant by \"not really,\" said, \"no, I mean, I mean, all-used to, I mean-,\" and then \"I mean, all of us.\" When asked if he remembered a time when he wanted to go downstairs but Jeffries told him he could not, C.J. replied \"no.\" Finally, when he was asked if he remembered telling a social worker about that incident, C.J. said he could not remember.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 63} We find no plain error in the trial court's judgment to exclude this testimony. Because C.J.'s testimony was nonresponsive, it did not refute D.S.'s testimony that C.J. had once seen her and Jeffries together and thus was not relevant to her credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {\u00b6 64} Jeffries also contends that his counsel was ineffective for not objecting to the trial court's ruling excluding C.J.'s testimony. We disagree. In evaluating a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a court must give great deference to counsel's performance.\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. at 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Had the trial court allowed C.J.'s testimony, the state would have used his prior statements to the social worker to impeach him, testimony that clearly would have been detrimental to Jeffries's defense that he never sexually abused D.S. In fact, counsel told the court she had not planned to ask C.J. any questions, presumably to avoid opening the door to any damaging testimony. It is apparent that counsel's decision not to object to the court's ruling was a matter of trial strategy to which we must afford great deference. Accordingly, we find no ineffective assistance of counsel, and the seventh assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   {\u00b6 66} Judgment affirmed in part; reversed in part; and remanded for a hearing regarding the imposition of court costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   ANITA LASTER MAYS, J., and LARRY A.
