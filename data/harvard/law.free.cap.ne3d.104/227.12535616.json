Appellee is the State of Ohio. The relevant facts leading to this appeal are as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In the summer of 2015, appellant and her boyfriend, Walter Renz, were the next-door neighbors of Patsy Hudson, who lived alone at 284 Spring Street in Mansfield, Ohio. Hudson, then in her early sixties and on disability, was known to rescue and take care of a large number of cats in or around her house. Her adult son, Lonnie Clevenger, drove trucks for a living, but he periodically stopped at the house to visit. According to Lonnie, Hudson sometimes demonstrated reclusive behaviors, refusing to answer the door or the telephone if she was busy watching television or was simply having a bad day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Appellant and Renz became acquainted with Hudson, and occasionally drove her on local errands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On June 25, 2015, appellant, using the alias \"Cara Longtail,\" went to the\n   emergency room in Shelby, complaining of pain. Tr. at 400. She was prescribed Flexeril and Atenolol at that time by Dr. Charles Marti, who was on duty in the E.R. Tr. at 408. Dr. Marti later testified he wrote appellant the prescription for Atenolol because appellant told hospital personnel she been prescribed that medication, but she did not have any left. Tr. at 409. Both Dr. Marti and a second physician testifying for the State opined that a high enough dose of Atenolol could be fatal. Tr. at 416, 634-636.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} At about this time, appellant was speaking to neighbors about taking Hudson on a trip to Florida, although at one point she also stated that she was angry about Renz spending time at Hudson's house. One of the neighbors, Walter Liggett, specifically recalled that appellant and Renz, in late June 2015, \"[s]aid they was [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] going to head back down south and take Patsy [Hudson] with them to her sister in Florida.\" Tr. at 352.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Appellant and Renz also told this neighbor that they were helping Hudson get rid of her cats. Despite this claim, Hudson was worried someone was trying to poison her cats, and told her son, Lonnie Clevenger, about this concern when he visited her in early July 2015. At one point, Hudson also informed police of the situation. Also, she continued to take some of the cats in for veterinarian appointments in early July. One appointment was scheduled for July 22, 2015, but Hudson did not show up at the veterinarian clinic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Shortly before July 4, 2015, another neighbor, Mark Clever, overheard an outdoor \"yelling and screaming\" argument involving the appellant, Renz and Hudson. Within a couple of weeks, he began to notice Hudson's mail piling up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Nicholas Miller, owner of a local lawn service, was contacted by Hudson in early July 2015. Hudson told him that \"her neighbors\" had been helping her with yard work, but she was concerned that they had \"poisoned her cat or something,\" so she didn't want them taking further care of her lawn. Tr. at 398. On July 10, 2015, Miller mowed Hudson's grass and received payment for his work. This was the last day Hudson was seen alive in the neighborhood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On July 10, 2015, Karissa Gibson, a resident of Shelby, Ohio, was on her lunch break when she drove past an older-model blue van, similar to one owned by Renz, pulled over on the side of a country road. She noticed a \"creepy looking\" man in the process of dumping something. Tr. at 279, 292, 300. The next day, she went by again and found a number of cats in the area where the van had been sitting. Tr. at 287. Some of them had collars. Tr. at 289. She returned to that spot and eventually, with the help of a neighbor, took in over twenty cats found in the general location. Tr. at 290. Unfortunately, a couple of days later, a heavy rain flooded the spot, which is near a creek.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Sometime between late July and early August 2015, appellant and Renz vacated and abandoned the premises at 290 Spring Street, where they had been living. When the landlord, Dwight Wallen, went through the property, he found a ring washer in the basement that was not there when he first rented the house to them. A ring washer was later found to be missing from Hudson's house. Investigators also found a seven-day pill container, with six days' worth of various medications, in Hudson's house. Tr. at 487.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On August 3, 2015, another neighbor, Steve Au, called the police after noticing Hudson's mail accumulating, her grass being quite overgrown, and the cats having \"vanished.\" Tr. at 332. When Hudson's son, Lonnie, next went to see her in August 2015, there was no one home. Tr. at 178. However, both of Hudson's vehicles were still at the house. Tr. at 178. He attempted to call the number he had for his mother, but another female voice answered. Tr. at 182. Lonnie later observed that his mother's jewelry boxes and two guns were missing from her house. Tr. at 201.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Between July 2015 and January 2016, Hudson's debit card was used in various locations throughout the United States. Tr. at 453-459. It was used in Ohio, Indiana, Missouri, Nebraska, Montana, South Dakota, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Mississippi.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 13} On December 22, 2015, officers from the Mansfield Police Department commenced a missing person investigation. The officers learned, among other things, that appellant and Renz had been using appellant's debit and credit cards. Upon questioning by detectives, Renz finally led police to various locations where parts of Hudson's dismembered body had been hidden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Investigators also found a nightgown, with numerous bloodstains, in the Spring Street residence where appellant and Renz had been living at the time of Hudson's disappearance. Tr. at 506. Two of the stains were matched to appellant; a third stain also contained appellant's blood, along with an unknown human contributor, described as a \"minor DNA profile.\" Tr. at 833.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 15} In addition, as further discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , appellant later made admissions about her involvement in an Ohio killing to a woman she met in Mississippi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 16} On July 1, 2016, appellant was indicted by the Richland County Grand Jury as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Count I, aggravated murder ( R.C. 2903.01(A) ), an unclassified felony; Count II, murder ( R.C. 2903.02(A) ), an unclassified felony; Count III, abuse of a corpse ( R.C. 2927.01(B) ), a felony of the fifth degree; Count IV, tampering with evidence ( R.C. 2921.12(A)(1) ), a felony of the third degree; Count V, receiving stolen property ( R.C. 2913.51(A) ), a felony of the fifth degree; Count VI, misuse of credit card ( R.C. 2913.21(B)(2)(D)(4), a felony of the fifth degree; Count VII: identity fraud, R.C. 2913.49(B), a felony of the fourth degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The case proceeded to a jury trial commencing on November 17, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State's case centered on the theory that appellant, either on her own or along with Renz, had caused Hudson to overdose on Atenolol, after which the couple secreted Hudson's dismembered body and made use of her money and credit cards. Following the presentation of evidence, the jury was given,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   instructions on aiding and abetting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Appellant was ultimately found guilty by the jury on all counts. At sentencing, the trial court found Count I and Count II to be allied offenses, and likewise found Count V and Count VI to be allied offenses. On Count I, appellant was sentenced to life in prison, without parole. For Counts III and IV, appellant was sentenced to three years in prison on each\n   count. For Counts V and VII, appellant was sentenced to six months on each count. Furthermore, Counts III, IV, V and VII were ordered to run consecutively to each other, but concurrently to Count I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 20} On December 28, 2016, appellant filed a notice of appeal. She herein raises the following two Assignments of Error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 21} \"I.

It is well-established that the State bears the burden of establishing each and every element of a charged crime and must do so with proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re L.R.\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 25} R.C. 2903.01(A) provides as follows: \"No person shall purposely, and with prior calculation and design, cause the death of another or the unlawful termination of another's pregnancy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Cause of Death\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 26} The record in the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   reveals the coroner listed the \"immediate cause of death\" regarding Hudson as unknown, noting the state of Hudson's dismembered body parts. Tr. at 617, 619. The coroner nonetheless considered Hudson's manner of death a homicide because he could not rationalize any other manner of death. Tr. at 619. Appellant posits the State's theory of the case was that appellant, in July 2015, caused Hudson to take an overdose of Atenolol, resulting in her death, in order to steal her identity and use her debit and credit cards, and that after Hudson's death, appellant assisted Renz in dismembering and secreting Hudson's body. In response, the State concedes its theory \"revolved around\" poisoning by an Atenolol overdose, but it urges \"any number of possibilities exist\" for how Hudson died based upon the evidence at trial. Appellee's Brief at 13. For example, the State's forensic anthropologist testified there was evidence of possible stabbing with a sharp instrument in one of Hudson's recovered vertebrae. Tr. at 708.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 27} In a criminal prosecution, a plea of 'not guilty' requires the State to prove all material facts relating to the crime charged, including those facts relating to the\n   <em>\n    corpus delicti\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

The Ohio Revised Code states: \"The cause of death and the manner and mode in which the death occurred, as delivered by the coroner and incorporated in the coroner's verdict and in the death certificate filed with the division of vital statistics, shall be the legally accepted manner and mode in which such death occurred, and the legally accepted cause of death, unless the court of common pleas of the county in which the death occurred, after a hearing, directs the coroner to change his decision as to such cause and manner and mode of death.\" R.C. 313.19.

R.C. 2903.01(A) was amended in 1981, but it retained the term 'prior calculation and design' as a necessary element of aggravated murder.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The Ohio Supreme Court has also stated that \"it is not possible to formulate a bright-line test that emphatically distinguishes between the presence or absence of 'prior calculation and design' \" and that \"[i]nstead, each case turns on the particular facts and evidence presented at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 20,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=676%20N.E.2d%2082\">\n    676 N.E.2d 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 31} In the present case, we find evidence of prior calculation and design was first presented via testimony that appellant and Renz told neighbors that they were going to take Hudson on a purported trip to Florida.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 352. Based on this, the jury could have reasonably inferred that this was part of a plan to allay suspicion in the neighborhood when all three of them disappeared at about the same time. The jury could have also reasonably inferred that the assistance appellant and Renz provided in driving Hudson to the grocery store (Tr. at 352) was a means of becoming acquainted with Hudson's finances and obtaining the PIN for her debit card.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Also, appellant and Renz told neighbors that they were going to get rid of Hudson's cats for her. Tr. at 352, 357. This would have been out of character for the victim, as she was known to care greatly for her animals and had even made a formal police report on July 4, 2015 when\n   she became concerned that one of them had been killed and another one poisoned. Tr. at 266. The officer who responded to that call for assistance described Hudson as upset, as she often took in stray cats to protect them. Tr. at 272. Even until the time of her disappearance, Hudson would take her cats in for veterinary care. Tr. at 339-340. As noted in our recitation of facts, a witness testified that she saw Renz pulled over in a van, appearing to be dumping something, and the witness later found a number of cats stranded in that area. In sum, the record does not show Hudson would have had any intention of \"getting rid of\" her adopted cats, and the jury could have determined beyond a reasonable doubt that this was part of a scheme to murder Hudson and divert attention from Hudson's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Upon review, we are unpersuaded by appellant's claim that insufficient evidence was provided that she acted with prior calculation and design, either on her own or in complicity with Renz, in causing Hudson's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Element of Purpose\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Ohio law recognizes that circumstantial evidence is sufficient to prove the essential elements in a criminal case.\n   <em>\n    State v.
