The defendant conceded at oral argument, and we agree, that waiver or direct estoppel bars each of his claims. And to the extent any survive, we conclude that trial counsel was not ineffective for substantially the same reasons cited in the motion judge's thoughtful and comprehensive decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Order denying motion for new trial affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
