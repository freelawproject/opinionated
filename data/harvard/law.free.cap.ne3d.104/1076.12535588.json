Intervenor-appellant, Westfield Insurance Company (\"Westfield\"), also appeals. For the following reasons, we reverse the judgment and remand this case to the trial court to enter a directed verdict in HDS' favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On August 24, 2005, Claris and HDS executed a contract in which HDS agreed to build Claris a 4-floor, 122-room hotel in the Polaris area of Columbus, Ohio. Claris planned to operate the hotel as a Candlewood Suites, a brand owned by InterContinental Hotels Group. HDS began construction in September 2005, and it completed the hotel late in the summer of 2006. Claris opened the Polaris Candlewood Suites in September 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} This case concerns the construction of the hotel's exterior walls. For the most part, the exterior walls are covered with exterior insulation and finish system (\"EIFS\"), a building cladding system that resembles stucco. Stacked-stone veneer covers a relatively small portion of the hotel at the first-floor level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The hotel's exterior walls contain multiple layers. The innermost layer is drywall, which is attached to the inner side of the wooden framing. Oriented strand board (\"OSB\") sheaths the outer side of the framing. Batt insulation is wedged between the framing studs. Before the installation of the EIFS, the builder affixed to the OSB sheathing a water-resistive barrier, which is a pliable sheet material. The first step of installing the EIFS involved mechanically fastening expanded-polystyrene insulation boards to the water-resistive barrier. Over the insulation boards, the EIFS subcontractor applied a base coat into which the subcontractor embedded a fiberglass mesh. Finally, the subcontractor applied more base coat and a finish coat over the mesh.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The outermost EIFS coating is watertight; water cannot penetrate it unless the surface is broken. After installing the EIFS, the EIFS subcontractor applied sealant to bridge junctures between adjacent building components to prevent water\n   infiltration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sealant fills the expansion joints in the EIFS and the joints between the EIFS and the windows, as well as the EIFS and the sleeves holding the packaged-terminal-air-conditioner (\"PTAC\") units. The PTAC units are located directly beneath the windows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Behind the cladding and sealant, the openings for the windows and PTAC units are surrounded by tape-like, flexible flashing to prevent water intrusion. Incidental water that penetrates through the cladding or sealant is intended to slide over the flashing and onto the water-resistive barrier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The water-resistive barrier provides the last, innermost layer of protection against water infiltration. The water-resistive barrier used on the Polaris Candlewood Suites-Tyvek StuccoWrap-serves as a drainage plane. StuccoWrap is corrugated, so when installed, the StuccoWrap creates narrow, vertical spaces for water to collect and drain to the bottom of the wall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In July 2013, hotel guests began to complain of water intrusion in rooms 128, 228, 328, and 428, i.e., the \"28 bank\" of the hotel. When it rained, water penetrated the exterior wall around the windows and PTAC units. Claris hired Elford, Inc., a general contracting company, to investigate and fix the leaking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 9} To complete its repair work, Elford removed the EIFS and water-resistive barrier from the exterior wall outside of the 28 bank. The removal of the outermost wall layers revealed sizable patches of organic growth on the OSB sheathing. For the most part, the organic growth was concentrated below the PTAC units. Such organic growth is consistent with moisture exposure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Additionally, at the first-floor level, water saturated the OSB sheathing, framing, and batt insulation. At higher levels, a moisture meter showed high levels of water within the OSB sheathing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 11} After the repair and restoration of the exterior wall outside of the 28 bank, Claris hired Professional Service Industries, Inc. (\"PSI\") to assess the entire building envelope. Initially, PSI visually examined the condition of the hotel exterior and conducted water tests of certain windows. PSI then opened the exterior walls at 11 locations around the hotel to view the condition of the wall components and determine the extent of the water damage. As Konrad Surlej, the PSI project manager, later explained, PSI observed a number of deficiencies, which he defined as \"something not performing as intended or perhaps not installed per industry standard or what we would have expected to see, as well as perhaps some components missing.\" (Tr. at 696-97.) PSI also found evidence of water damage at 10 of the 11 openings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On April 25, 2014, Claris sued HDS for breach of the construction contract. HDS filed a third-party complaint seeking indemnification from its subcontractors, including Five Star Plastering; Inloes Mechanical, Inc.; JHP Construction, Inc.; and Michael J. Baumann and Co., Inc. (\"Baumann\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   After securing leave of court, Westfield intervened and sought a declaratory judgment stating that it was not obligated to provide coverage to HDS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   under its commercial general liability policy for any of Claris' damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Trial on Claris' claim for breach of contract occurred between August 16 and 26, 2016. For purposes of this appeal, we will recount the expert testimony introduced at trial regarding and relating to the cause of the water damage to the exterior walls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Surlej, Claris' expert witness, testified to the multiple deficiencies PSI identified in the wall assembly. First, Surlej stated that sheet-metal flashing \"would usually be called for and installed at any penetration through the wall,\" but the Polaris Candlewood Suites did not have any such flashing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Tr. at 702.) Surlej also indicated that he would expect to see sheet-metal flashing at the horizontal expansion joints in the EIFS and at the base of the exterior walls. However, there was no sheet-metal flashing in those areas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Sheet-metal flashing has an L-shape, with a lip protruding from the end of the horizontal leg of the L. When installed, the vertical leg of the L is covered by the water-resistive barrier, and the horizontal leg extends through the wall assembly to the outside. Water flowing down the water-resistive barrier strikes the horizontal leg of the L, which directs the water out of the wall assembly through a small gap above the horizontal leg. The water then drips off the protruding lip and falls away from the building. Surlej explained that sheet-metal flashing acts as a \"control mechanism\" that directs water away from a building, preventing that water from \"follow[ing] the path of least resistan[ce], which could be toward the interior.\" (Tr. at 719.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Second, Surlej categorized the sealants as in poor condition, meaning they had failed or could not be relied upon to perform their original function. In most locations, the sealant was pulling away from substrate it was intended to adhere to and/or was failing to hold together, causing tears within the sealant material. Additionally, no sealant was present around the windows and PTAC units surrounded by the stacked-stone veneer or the pipes and vents protruding from the exterior walls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Third, Surlej testified to countless cracks in the EIFS surface. There were also areas where the EIFS surface coat was missing, exposing the fiberglass mesh. Fourth, Surlej testified that the tape-like, flexible flashing was improperly lapped at the PTAC sleeves, either because the flashing did not achieve a shingling effect or not enough flashing extended over the edges of the PTAC sleeve. Fifth, Surlej stated that, in some cases, sheets of the water-resistive barrier did not lap or insufficiently lapped over sheets located below and to the sides.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Although Surlej testified to the above deficiencies, he was never asked if those deficiencies caused any of the water damage to the hotel. However, when asked to summarize PSI's results and findings, Surlej stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [S]tarting from the exterior, we commented on the deficiencies of the sealants we observed, some of the surface deficiencies in the actual EIFS because we did find some cracks, some penetration, some areas where there was just not enough material installed and you can see the exposed reinforcing mesh underneath.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Going beyond that, obviously we commented on the fact that we didn't see some [sheet-metal] flashings or some flashings that we were expecting to see at some of these locations. And then going further and detailing some of the issues with the flexible flashings that [were] installed, either lapped incorrectly or not carried properly with enough of an overlap onto the material.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Same went [with] the weather-resistive barrier. We had locations where [the sheets] simply did not touch or didn't overlap or if they overlapped, it was documented to be less than the [four] inches which would be anticipated or is an industry standard and seen in other projects.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Beyond that, we obviously saw a lot of evidence of OSB deterioration, corroded sections from section loss,\n   <em>\n    all leading us to the conclusion that there is, at least at the time of our visit, * * * water exposure resulting in the level of deterioration that we did see.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (Emphasis added.) (Tr. at 749-50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Claris' attorney subsequently inquired whether the replacement of the sealant could resolve the problems with the exterior walls. Surlej answered:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   No[.] * * * [I]f we felt that sealant was the primary cause or the only issue that * * * we observed, our report essentially would have stopped and stated that. Based on the evidence and the results we were finding, we felt that we needed to go further and we were able to discover other deficiencies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   So sealant has a component obviously in this by allowing some water behind, but what we were able to discover is that there [were] some deficiencies with the installation of the components concealed by the face of the EIFS and also discovered the lack of a mechanism to expel water or essentially a drainage system in [the] EIFS itself and the assembly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   (Tr. at 761-62.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 20} HDS called its own expert witness, Michael D. Lewis. Before offering any opinions, Lewis agreed to provide those opinions to a reasonable degree of architectural certainty. Lewis then declared that the damage to the Polaris Candlewood Suites occurred when the sealant around the windows and PTAC units failed, allowing water to leak through the joints. The water that entered the wall assembly through the joints accumulated between the expanded-polystyrene insulation boards and the water-resistive barrier. That water flowed down the water-resistive barrier and emptied through openings in the base of the walls. However, the excessive amount of water streaming through the open joints caused the humidity level between the insulation boards and the water-resistive barrier to rise to, and stay at, 100 percent. Water then diffused across the water-resistive barrier and into the less humid interior side of the wall, causing water damage to the OSB sheathing and the framing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 21} According to Lewis, the sealant failed due to normal weathering. Claris failed to maintain the sealant or replace it when it failed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 22} HDS moved for directed verdict twice: once at the conclusion of Claris' case in chief and, again, at the close of all evidence. HDS argued that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because Claris failed to prove that a breach of the construction contract caused Claris' damages. The trial court denied both of HDS' motions. At the conclusion of the proceedings, the jury rendered a verdict in Claris' favor and awarded $631,200 in damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 23} On September 29, 2016, the trial court issued a final judgment. In addition to entering the jury's verdict, the final\n   judgment declared that Westfield had to pay HDS 50 percent of the damage award, or $315,600, under the commercial general liability policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 24} HDS appeals the September 29, 2016 judgment and assigns the following errors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   [1.] THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT GRANTING HDS' MOTIONS FOR DIRECTED VERDICT BECAUSE THERE WAS LEGALLY INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO PROVE THAT ANY BREACH OF CONTRACT BY HDS CAUSED THE WATER DAMAGE TO THE HOTEL.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [2.] THE JURY'S VERDICT WAS AGAINST THE MANIFEST WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE BECAUSE CLARIS DID NOT PRESENT ANY EVIDENCE TO PROVE THAT A BREACH OF CONTRACT BY HDS, INCLUDING THOSE FOUND IN JURY INTERROGATORY NO. 2, CAUSED THE ALLEGED DAMAGE TO THE HOTEL.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   [3.] THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN ADMITTING CLARIS' EXPERT REPORT BECAUSE IT WAS INADMISSIBLE HEARSAY AND WAS PREJUDICIAL TO HDS.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Westfield also appeals the final judgment, and it assigns the following errors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [1.] The trial court erred in holding that the jury's allocations of 50% of the damages to EIFS, and 50% to professional services, applied concurrently rather than cumulatively.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   [2.] The trial court erred in failing to hold that the EIFS exclusion and the \"professional services\" exclusion each independently exclude coverage for all damages awarded to the plaintiff.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 26} By HDS' first assignment of error, it argues that the trial court erred in denying its motions for directed verdict. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 27} A court must grant a motion for directed verdict \"if, after construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion is directed, 'reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion upon the evidence submitted and that conclusion is adverse to such party.' \"\n   <em>\n    Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v.

Surlej, however, did not designate any of the five deficiencies, whether alone or in combination, as the probable cause of Claris' damages. The only testimony Surlej offered regarding the likelihood that a particular deficiency resulted in Claris' damages was his opinion that the failure of the sealant was not the \"primary cause\" of the water damage. (Tr. at 761.) At best, this testimony excluded the failed sealant as the probable cause of the water damage. However, it did nothing to pinpoint which of the other deficiencies was the probable cause. Surlej's testimony, therefore, is not competent evidence of the proximate cause of the water damage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Equally troubling, Claris presented evidence establishing only one of the deficiencies-the lack of sheet-metal flashing-as a breach of the construction contract. Under Section 3.7.2 of the general conditions incorporated into the construction contract, HDS had to \"comply with and give notices required by laws, ordinances, rules, regulations and lawful orders and all other requirements of public authorities applicable to performance of the Work.\" (Ex. 14.) According to Claris, Section 3.7.2 required HDS to satisfy all provisions of the Ohio Building Code in effect at the time it constructed the hotel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Pursuant Section 1403.2 of the 2005 Ohio Building Code:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Exterior walls shall provide the building with a weather-resistant exterior wall envelope. The exterior wall envelope shall include flashing, as described in Section 1405.3. The exterior wall envelope shall be designed and constructed in such a manner as to prevent the accumulation of water within the wall assembly\n   <em>\n    by providing a water-resistive barrier behind the exterior veneer * * * and a means for draining water that enters the assembly to the exterior of the veneer\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   (Emphasis added.) (Ex. 62.) Section 1405.3 stated that \"[f]lashing shall be installed in such a manner so as to prevent moisture from entering the wall or to redirect it to the exterior.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=504%20N.E.2d%2044\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Surlej opined that the hotel's exterior walls contained a water-resistive barrier, but lacked a means for draining water that entered the wall assembly. The colloquy between Claris' attorney and Surlej explicates that opinion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Q: * * * And can you explain based on the observations that you noted, you know, what is being required here in [Section 1403.2] and what was inconsistent in regards to this with what you saw?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   A: Well, what we looked at and what [Section 1403.2] references is that the exterior wall has to provide a weather-resistant exterior envelope, which we know is kind of the entire assembly, and it calls out flashings specifically and * * * specifies that the intent of those flashings is to prevent accumulation of water within the * * * wall assembly * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Q: And so you did not necessarily see this type of performance requirement in what you observed, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   A: * * * [C]orrect, this references some of those through-wall flashings and the drip edges and the mechanism to expel water from behind the EIFS system to the exterior [that were not incorporated into the Polaris Candlewood Suites].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   (Tr. at 755-56.) Thus, in Surlej's opinion, due to the lack of sheet-metal flashing, the exterior walls of the Polaris Candlewood Suites did not include a means for draining water that entered the wall assembly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 38} During cross-examination, Surlej acknowledged that the exterior walls included openings at the base so water draining down the water-resistive barrier could exit the wall assembly. However, Surlej opined that those openings did not constitute an adequate means for draining water because the exterior walls did not contain any sheet-metal flashing to control the water and direct it away from the walls. Moreover, Surlej interpreted Section 1405.3 to impliedly require sheet-metal flashing. HDS, therefore, violated Sections 1403.2 and 1405.3 of the 2005 Ohio Building Code when it failed to install sheet-metal flashing. Given Surlej's testimony, Claris presented sufficient evidence that the failure to use sheet-metal flashing breached the construction contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Beyond that breach, the record contains no evidence that any of the other deficiencies breached the construction contract. On appeal, Claris claims that the other deficiencies violated the project specifications. Part of the parties' contract, the project specifications set forth the technical requirements for all the materials and workmanship HDS had to provide when constructing the hotel. Claris points to no evidence that explains how the other deficiencies constituted a breach of any of the project specifications. Claris even fails to identify a particular provision of the project specifications that the other deficiencies allegedly violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Therefore, construing the evidence in a manner most favorable to Claris, the record demonstrates that only one of the multiple deficiencies that caused the water damage amounted to a breach of the construction contract. In such a situation, a plaintiff may still recover for a breach of contract. Generally, in a breach-of-contract action, a defendant must pay damages equivalent to the total harm suffered, even if factors other than the breach\n   contributed to causing that harm. 2 Perillo,\n   <em>\n    Corbin on Contracts\n   </em>\n   , Section 55.9, at 31 (Rev.Ed.2005).

Thus, other than Surlej's opinion that the failed sealant was not the primary cause of the water damage, the record lacks evidence regarding the extent to which each particular deficiency contributed to the water damage. Consequently, the evidence does not establish HDS' breach-the failure to install sheet-metal flashing-as a substantial factor in causing the water damage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 42} In sum, the expert testimony Claris adduced regarding causation is insufficient to prove that a breach of the construction contract resulted in the water damage to the hotel. Surlej failed to express his opinions in terms of probability, and he failed to identify the lack of sheet-metal flashing as a substantial factor in bringing about Claris' damages. Therefore, Surlej's testimony does not establish causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Our analysis, however, is not complete. Claris also relies on the testimony of HDS' expert, Lewis, to argue that it proved that a breach of the construction contract caused the water damage. Claris directs this court to the following colloquy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   Q: So we have at least three or four, maybe five different ways that water gets behind [the EIFS layers]. And if water gets behind there and there's no drainage to the outside system, what is going to happen to that water?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   A: It will be trapped.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   (Tr. at 1553.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 44} With this testimony, Lewis admitted that if water cannot drain out of exterior walls, it will remain trapped in the wall assembly. However, contrary to Claris' representations, Lewis refused to concede that water that penetrated the Polaris Candlewood Suites' EIFS layers could not drain to the outside. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. at 1488 (\"Q: * * * [D]oes that [water] have the ability to get out of this building to the\n   exterior? A: It does. It ends at the bottom of the wall and out[;] * * * where the stucco wrap ends at the grade, the water evacuates there.\"); 1539 (\"Q: And is [the water-resistive barrier] set up to drain to the outside? A: Yes.\"); 1540 (\"In this case, [water] does go to the outside.\").) Because Lewis maintained the exterior walls had openings at the base that allowed water to exit, his testimony cannot demonstrate that the absence of openings caused water damage to the hotel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Next, Claris argues that HDS breached the construction contract when it installed EIFS manufactured by Parex instead of EIFS manufactured by one of the three companies named in the project specifications. Claris maintains that Parex's exclusion from the list of approved manufacturers is sufficient evidence of causation. According to Claris, Parex was excluded for a reason, and although Claris cannot articulate that reason, Claris contends that it must have manifested itself and caused the water damage to the hotel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 46} HDS does not dispute that its use of Parex EIFS breached the construction contract. It, instead, argues that in order to show that that breach caused the water damage, Claris had to present evidence demonstrating that Parex EIFS possessed a feature, absent in the other brands, which resulted in the water damage. In response, Claris contends that it should not have to carry this burden. It argues that because HDS breached the construction contract, HDS had to prove that Parex EIFS did not contain a difference that caused the water damage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 47} As the party seeking to recover for a breach of contract, Claris bears the burden of proving each element of its claim.\n   <em>\n    Buckeye Telesystem, Inc. v.

Claris wants us to create a rebuttable presumption that once a plaintiff demonstrates a breach of a contract, it is entitled to recover damages unless the defendant shows the breach did not cause those damages. Such a presumption does not exist in contract law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moss v. Sibley\n   </em>\n   , 2d Dist.

Neither witness qualified as an expert.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    Claris also elicited testimony that HDS failed to install the sheet-metal flashing that the project drawings required within the sections of the exterior walls clad in stacked-stone veneer. As the construction contract incorporated the project drawings, HDS' failure to install that sheet-metal flashing constituted a breach of two sections of the contract: Section 3.7.2 of the general conditions and the project drawings.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
