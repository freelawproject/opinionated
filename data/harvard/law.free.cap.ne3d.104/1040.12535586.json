GALLAGHER, A.J.:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 1} This case involves the interpretation of various insurance policies. In this consolidated appeal, defendants-appellants Erie Insurance Co. (\"Erie\") and William Hobbs (\"Hobbs\") and third-party defendants-appellants Amica Mutual Insurance Co. (\"Amica\"), Recreation Insurance Specialists, L.L.C. (\"Recreation\") and RIS Risk Management Services, L.L.C. (\"Risk\") appeal from the trial court's order granting third-party defendant-appellee Westfield Insurance Co.'s (\"Westfield's\") motion for summary judgment and denying Erie's motion for summary judgment regarding insurance coverage for injuries sustained by Eric Raudins (\"Raudins\") arising out of a January 13, 2011 automobile accident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellants contend that the\n   trial court erred in concluding that Westfield was not obligated to provide liability insurance coverage to Hobbs, the driver of the accident vehicle, under a non-owned auto liability endorsement to a businessowners policy Westfield issued to Recreation and Risk. Erie, Recreation and Risk further contend that the trial court erred in concluding that the accident was covered under a personal auto liability insurance policy Erie issued to Hobbs. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the decision of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    The Accident and the Companies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On January 13, 2011, Hobbs and Raudins were traveling from Risk and Recreation's offices in Akron, Ohio to the Hilton Garden Inn in Mayfield Heights, Ohio where Hobbs was scheduled to make a presentation on trailer insurance to an insurance agency. Raudins accompanied Hobbs to the January 13, 2011 meeting out of \"curiosity\" and \"to get out of the office.\" Hobbs was driving his 2003 Toyota Tundra truck (the \"accident vehicle\" or the \"Toyota Tundra\") and Raudins was the front seat passenger. On their way to the meeting, Hobbs hit a patch of ice on I-271 North, lost control of the vehicle and the vehicle struck a concrete barrier. Raudins injured his neck in the accident, requiring surgery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 3} At the time of the accident, Hobbs and Raudins were involved in three related business entities - Recreation, Risk and RIS Holdings, L.L.C. (\"RIS Holdings\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Recreation was an insurance agency in the business of underwriting insurance policies for recreational vehicles. At the time of the accident, Hobbs was the president of Recreation, Raudins was the company's vice-president and chief operating officer and the two men comprised its board of directors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Risk was in the business of administering claims made under insurance policies for recreational vehicles. At the time of the accident, Hobbs was the president of Risk and Hobbs and Raudins comprised its board of directors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 6} RIS Holdings, a holding company, was the sole member of Recreation and Risk. At the time of the accident, Hobbs and Raudins were two of the members of RIS Holdings. Hobbs was the president of RIS Holdings and Raudins was its vice-president and chief operating officer. Raudins testified that he and Hobbs were responsible for \"overseeing [the] strategy and direction\" of the three entities and \"mak[ing] sure that those companies operated and functioned properly.\" Raudins testified that he did not have \"any defined duties\" for the companies and that what he did \"varied widely.\" Although Recreation and Risk each had employees who earned wages reported on W-2 forms, Hobbs and Raudins were not among them. Hobbs and Raudins were compensated for the services they provided through guaranteed payments from Recreation, which were reported on K-1 forms issued by RIS Holdings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Raudins filed workers' compensation claims for the injuries he sustained in the accident but his claims were denied on the ground that he was not an employee of any of the companies and did not otherwise have workers' compensation coverage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    The Insurance Policies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 8} At the time of the accident, Erie insured Hobbs under a \"family auto insurance policy\" (the \"Erie policy\"). The Toyota Tundra was specifically identified as a \"covered auto\" on the declarations page of the policy. The Erie policy included bodily injury auto liability coverage with limits of $250,000 per person and $500,000 per accident and uninsured/underinsured motorists (\"UM/UIM\") coverage with limits of $250,000 per person and $500,000 per accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Amica issued a personal automobile policy to the Raudinses (the \"Amica policy\"). As it relates to this case, the Amica policy provided UM/UIM coverage with limits of $1,000,000 per person and $1,000,000 per accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Westfield issued a \"businessowners package policy\" to Recreation and Risk (the \"Westfield policy\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The policy included an endorsement for \"hired auto and non-owned auto\" liability coverage with a $2,000,000 limit (the \"endorsement\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    The Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On August 20, 2012, the Raudinses filed a complaint in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Case No. CV-12-789591) against Hobbs, Erie and Amica to recover for injuries and damages sustained as a result of the accident (the \"first lawsuit\"). Raudins asserted a negligence claim against Hobbs and claims for breach of contract and declaratory judgment against Erie and Amica, seeking to establish his rights against the insurers under their respective insurance policies. Dee Raudins asserted a claim for loss of consortium against Hobbs, Erie and Amica. Erie filed an answer\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and counterclaim for declaratory judgment, seeking a declaration that the Erie policy afforded no liability or UM/UIM coverage for Raudins' injuries and damages. Amica filed an answer, a counterclaim for declaratory judgment and a cross-claim against Hobbs for contribution and/or indemnification. Amica sought a declaration that it owed no UM/UIM coverage to Raudins as a result of the\n   accident or, alternatively, that (1) it owed no UM/UIM coverage until all other liability coverage and primary UM/UIM coverage was exhausted or (2) any UM/UIM coverage under the Amica policy applied on a pro rata basis with other applicable UM/UIM coverage. Hobbs filed an answer and a cross-claim against Erie for declaratory judgment, seeking a declaration that he was entitled to liability coverage under the Erie policy. The Raudinses filed an answer to Erie's counterclaim. Hobbs and Erie filed answers to the cross-claims asserted against them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 12} In March 2013, Hobbs filed a third-party complaint against Recreation, Risk, Westfield and Community Insurance Company d.b.a. Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield (\"Anthem\"). Hobbs asserted a claim for contractual indemnity against Recreation and Risk, alleging that the companies had a duty to indemnify him for Raudins' alleged damages pursuant to indemnification provisions in their operating agreements. Hobbs asserted a claim for breach of contract against Westfield for its failure to defend and indemnify him under the Westfield policy and asserted a claim for declaratory judgment against Anthem, seeking a declaration that Anthem was not entitled to recover medical benefits it paid to Raudins from Hobbs. Westfield and Anthem filed answers to Hobbs' third-party complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 13} On January 10, 2014, the Raudinses filed a second lawsuit in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas against Westfield (the \"second lawsuit\"). Raudins asserted a claim for UM/UIM coverage under the Westfield policy, and Dee Raudins asserted a claim for loss of consortium. In February 2014, the trial court consolidated the two lawsuits. In March 2014, Hobbs voluntarily dismissed his cross-claim against Erie and his third-party complaint against Recreation and Risk in the first lawsuit without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    Motions for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 14} In August 2014, Westfield, Erie and Amica all filed motions for summary judgment on the issue of insurance coverage. Each insurer argued that there was no liability coverage and/or UM/UIM coverage for the accident under its insurance policy and that the other insurers were responsible for coverage for the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Westfield argued that it was entitled to summary judgment on Hobbs' third-party complaint in the first lawsuit because Hobbs did not meet the definition of an \"insured\" under the endorsement\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that it was entitled to summary judgment on the Raudinses' complaint in the second lawsuit because the Westfield policy did not include UM/UIM coverage. Erie argued that it owed no liability coverage or UM/UIM coverage for the accident under its policy because (1) the policy excluded coverage for injuries to an insured's employees occurring in the course of employment and (2) Hobbs was not \"legally\" required to \"pay\" for Raudins' injuries and Raudins was not \"legally entitled to recover\" for his injuries from Hobbs (as necessary to trigger liability coverage or UM/UIM coverage under the policy) based on \"fellow employee immunity\" under R.C. 4123.741. Erie further argued that the Westfield policy had primary coverage because it insured the accident vehicle as a \"non-owned auto.\" Amica argued that both the Erie policy and the Westfield policy provided liability coverage for the accident vehicle and that, given the amount of liability\n   coverage available under those policies, the accident vehicle was not uninsured or underinsured so as to trigger UM/UIM coverage under the Amica policy. In the alternative, Amica argued that any UM/UIM coverage under the Amica policy was secondary and excess to the UM/UIM coverage under the Erie policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 16} The Raudinses also filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of insurance coverage, requesting a finding that liability coverage existed under both the Erie and Westfield policies and that the Amica policy provided UM/UIM coverage to Raudins to the extent the liability limits under the Erie and Westfield policies were insufficient to cover his damages. The Raudinses argued that even if Hobbs was not an \"insured\" under the non-owned auto liability endorsement, liability coverage nevertheless existed under the Westfield policy because the named insureds, Recreation and RIS, were \"derivatively liable for the injuries [Hobbs] negligently caused in furthering their business\" under the doctrine of respondeat superior. Each party opposed the motions for summary judgment filed by the other parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 17} On January 29, 2016, the trial court ruled on the parties' summary judgment motions. Concluding that Hobbs was entitled to liability coverage under the Erie policy but was not an insured for purposes of the non-owned auto liability endorsement under the Westfield policy,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   the trial court: (1) granted the Raudinses' motion for summary judgment as to Amica and Erie and denied it as to Westfield; (2) granted Westfield's motion for summary judgment with respect to coverage under its businessowners policy; (3) denied Erie's motion for summary judgment and (4) granted Amica's motion for summary judgment to the extent it requested a declaration that Erie was obligated to provide liability coverage for Hobbs but otherwise denied the motion. The trial court specifically found as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   On the record evidence I find no genuine issue of material fact on the lawsuits' claims for declaration of the rights and obligations of the parties under the various insurance contracts. Accordingly, summary declaratory judgment is entered as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   1) Erie Insurance Company is required under the terms of insurance policy number Q05-7405925 to indemnify William Hobbs for compensatory damages proximately caused by Hobbs's negligence to Eric Raudins in the January 13, 2011, accident, up to the policy's $250,000 per person limit;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   2) Erie is obligated to defend Hobbs against the negligence claim asserted in case number 789591 by Raudins and his wife;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   3) Amica Mutual Insurance Company is obligated under the terms of insurance policy number 910834-1098\n   to provide underinsured motorists coverage to Raudins for his damages in excess of $250,000 incurred because of Hobbs's negligence, to limit of $750,000; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   4) Westfield Insurance Company is not obligated under the terms of insurance policy number BOP 3760387 to provide liability coverage to Hobbs or uninsured/underinsured motorists coverage to Raudins for any claims arising out of the January 13, 2011, accident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 18} On January 20, 2017, the Raudinses, Hobbs, Erie and Amica voluntarily dismissed all claims between and among them with prejudice, pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A). In the notice of partial dismissal, Erie and Amica reserved their right to appeal the trial court's decision on summary judgment as to Westfield. On August 10, 2017, Hobbs dismissed his third-party complaint against Anthem with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Appellants appealed. In Appeal Nos. 106232 and 106233, Amica and Hobbs raised the following assignment of error for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   The trial court erred in determining that Westfield's insurance policy issued to Recreation and Risk did not provide coverage for the William Hobbs automobile accident and Eric Raudins' subsequent injuries.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 20} In Appeal Nos. 106236 and 106238, Erie, Recreation and Risk raised the following three assignments of error for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Assignment of Error No. 1: The Trial Court erred when it failed to find that Appellee, Westfield Insurance Company, is primarily obligated under the terms of its Insurance Policy to provide primary coverage for the claims out of the January 13, 2011 Accident, because the policy provided primary coverage for \"insured contracts\" such as the Indemnity provisions found in the Company's Operating Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Assignment of Error No. 2: The Trial Court erred when it failed to find that the policy exclusion contained in Erie Insurance Company's Policy was applicable to the January 13, 2011 Accident, thereby eliminating coverage under the Erie Policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Assignment of Error No. 3: Alternatively, the Trial Court erred when it failed to hold that a finding of coverage under Erie Insurance Company's policy should have resulted in a Pro-Rata Apportionment of liability between Erie Insurance Company and Westfield Insurance Company.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Appellants' assignments of error overlap. Accordingly, we address them together where appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 22} We review summary judgment rulings de novo, applying the same standard as the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Grafton v.

(Westfield Policy, BOC Form, at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Focusing on section A.2. of the endorsement - \"[t]he insurance provided * * * applies to 'bodily injury' * * * arising out of the use of any 'non-owned auto' in your business by any person\" - appellants argue that because there is no dispute that: (1) the accident vehicle was owned by Hobbs (and not Recreation or Risk) and (2) Raudins' injuries occurred while Hobbs was using the vehicle in connection with the business of Recreation and Risk, the trial court erred in concluding that the Westfield policy did not cover Hobbs' liability for Raudins' injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 32} The trial court acknowledged that, based on the plain language of section A.2. and the undisputed facts, Raudins' injuries could potentially fall within the scope of the endorsement's liability coverage for \" 'bodily injury' * * * arising out of the use of any 'non-owned auto' in your business by any person.\" However, as the trial court indicated, this was just the first step in determining whether coverage existed under the endorsement. For liability coverage to exist, Hobbs had to also be an \"insured\" for purposes of the endorsement. Following a thorough analysis of the relevant policy language, the trial court concluded that Hobbs was not an insured under the endorsement and that, therefore, there was no coverage for the accident under the Westfield policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 33} In this appeal, all of the appellants challenge the trial court's finding that there was no coverage under the Westfield policy because Hobbs was not an insured for purposes of the endorsement - albeit for different reasons. We address each of appellants' arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 34} In their first assignment of error, Erie, Risk and Recreation argue that whether Hobbs was an insured under the endorsement is irrelevant because the endorsement \"specifically insured the accident vehicle,\" regardless of whether Hobbs was an insured. Citing the \"rule of thumb\" that \"insurance on the car is primary\" and that \"insurance follows the car,\" they contend that the Westfield policy provided primary coverage for Raudins' injuries because it insured the accident vehicle and that the trial court \"incorrectly held that both the accident vehicle and Hobbs must have coverage in order for the Westfield Policy to be applicable.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    Coverage for the Accident Vehicle under the Endorsement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Section II.A.1.a. of the BOC form identifies the business liability coverage provided under the Westfield policy. Westfield agrees to \"pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of 'bodily injury' * * * to which this insurance applies.\" (Westfield Policy, BOC Form, Section II.A.1.a.) Section A.2. of the endorsement specifies a set of circumstances giving rise to \"bodily injury\" \"to which this insurance applies\": \"\n   <em>\n    The Insurance provided under Paragraph A.1. Business Liability in Section II - Liability, applies to\n   </em>\n   'bodily injury' * * * arising out of the use of any 'non-owned auto' in your business by any person.\" (Emphasis added.) (Westfield Policy, Non-Owned Auto Liability Endorsement, Section A.2.) Reading these provisions in tandem, it is clear that coverage under the endorsement applies to \"sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages,\" (Westfield Policy, BOC form, Section II.A.1.a.), for \"bodily injury * * * arising out of the use of any 'non-owned auto' in your business by any person,\" (Westfield Policy, Non-Owned Auto Liability Endorsement, Section A.2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Thus, for there to be non-owned auto liability coverage under the endorsement, an \"insured\" must be legally obligated to pay damages because of \"bodily injury\" arising out of the use of any \"non-owned auto\" in Recreation's or Risk's business by any person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {\u00b6 36} At issue in this case is Hobbs' liability for Raudins' injuries. Accordingly, the trial court properly determined that, under the plain language of the policy, for Hobbs' liability for Raudins' injuries to be covered under the endorsement, Hobbs needed to be an \"insured\" for purposes of the endorsement; it was not enough that Raudins' injuries arose out of Hobbs' use of a \"non-owned auto\" while conducting business on behalf of Recreation and Risk. Where there is no \"insured\" legally obligated to pay damages, Westfield has no obligation to pay under the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 37}\n   <em>\n    Ohio Farmers Ins. Co. v.

Because Hobbs was an executive officer driving his own vehicle at the time of the accident, he was not an insured and there was no coverage for Raudins' damages under the endorsement. As the trial court explained, this result is not only clear from a plain reading of the policy language, it makes sense:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   The net effect of the non-owned auto endorsement is unambiguous: a corporate officer is not covered for the use of his own car on company business but is covered for the use of somebody else's car (except one owned by the company). At the same time, another company employee is covered while using the officer's car on company business.

Erie, Recreation and Risk assert that Hobbs, Recreation and Risk all \"fall into the Erie policy's 'anyone we protect' language\" to which Exclusion 7 applies. They contend that because Raudins was an employee of Hobbs, Recreation and Risk at the time of the accident and was injured in the course of this employment, Exclusion 7 eliminated coverage for Raudins under Erie's policy \"from all three insureds-Hobbs, Risk, and Recreation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   {\u00b6 66} \"Employee\" is not defined in the policy.\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   defines \"employee\" as \"[s]omeone who works in the service of another person (the employer) under an express or implied contract of hire, under which the employer has the right to control the details of work performance.\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   639 (10th Ed. 2014).\n   <em>\n    Webster's Third International Dictionary\n   </em>\n   defines \"employee\" as \"one employed by another [usually] in a position below the executive level and [usually] for wages\"; \"any worker who is under wages or salary to an employer and who is not excluded by agreement from consideration as such a worker.\"\n   <em>\n    Webster's Third International Dictionary\n   </em>\n   743 (1993).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   {\u00b6 67} The only evidence the parties presented regarding Raudins' \"employment\" was the testimony of Raudins and Hobbs, the operating agreements of Recreation, Risk and RIS Holdings and documents relating to Raudins' workers' compensation claim. This evidence established that, at the time of the accident, Raudins was a member of RIS Holdings, vice-president and chief operating officer of RIS Holdings, vice-president and chief operating officer of Recreation and a director of Recreation and Risk. The evidence further showed that Raudins was compensated for his services through guaranteed payments from Recreation reported on a K-1 form issued by RIS Holdings, not salary or wages reported on a W-2 form, and that Raudins filed a workers' compensation claim that was denied on the ground that he was not an employee of any of the companies and did not otherwise have workers' compensation coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   {\u00b6 68} Even assuming that (1) Raudins qualified as an \"employee\" of Recreation or Risk, (2) Recreation and/or Risk qualified as \"anyone we protect,\" i.e., that Recreation and Risk were \"legally responsible for the use of, an 'owned auto we insure' \" and (3) Raudins' injuries occurred during the course of his employment with Recreation and Risk - so as to take away any coverage Recreation and Risk otherwise may have had under the Erie policy - there would still be the issue of coverage for Hobbs. Although Exclusion 7 takes away coverage for an insured when one of its employees is injured during the course of employment, it would not be reasonable to read the language of the exclusion as taking away coverage for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   insureds when the employee of\n   <em>\n    one\n   </em>\n   insured is injured during the course of employment. Even if Erie had established that Raudins was an employee of Risk or Recreation (or presented sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding the issue), there is nothing in the record to suggest that Raudins was an employee of Hobbs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   {\u00b6 69} Erie, Recreation and Risk acknowledge that Hobbs was not a \"direct employer\" of Raudins; nevertheless, they contend that, due to Hobbs' position as an officer for Risk and Recreation and status as a member of RIS Holdings, the trial court should have found that Raudins \"was acting as Hobbs' employee\" and was, therefore, his \"de facto employer.\" They cite no authority to support their \"de facto employer\" argument and have no evidence to support their claim that Raudins was otherwise an employee of Hobbs at the time of the accident. As such, Erie has failed to show that the exclusion applied to take away liability coverage for Hobbs. The trial court properly determined that the Erie policy provided liability coverage for Hobbs' negligence in the accident. Erie, Recreation and Risk's second assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   <strong>\n    Pro Rata Apportionment of Liability Between Policies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   {\u00b6 70} In their third assignment of error, Erie, Recreation and Risk contend that the trial court erred because it failed to find a pro-rata apportionment of liability between Erie and Westfield based on an \"other insurance\" clause in the Erie policy. Because we have found no error by the trial court in concluding that there was no coverage under the Westfield policy for the injuries Raudins sustained in the accident, Erie, Recreation and Risk's third assignment of error is moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   {\u00b6 71} Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   PATRICIA ANN BLACKMON, J., and FRANK D.

The trial court did not consider the issue of whether coverage existed under the umbrella policy, concluding that \"any consideration of the umbrella policy is superfluous because there is no affirmative claim in any pleading in either case for a declaration of the rights and obligations of the parties under the umbrella policy.\" None of the parties has challenged the trial court's decision regarding that issue.
