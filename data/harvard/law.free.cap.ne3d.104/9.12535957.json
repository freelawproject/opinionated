The issue before this court is whether a trial court must comply with the mandate of an appellate court where the judgment is supported by a majority of judges hearing the cause. For the following reasons, the judgment of the lower court is modified and reversed, and this cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The underlying case, originally filed on January 24, 2008, involved claims against intervening defendant-appellee, Tammy Schmitt, for violation of R.C. 1701.37, interference with a business relationship, breach of a fiduciary duty, and punitive damages/attorney fees. The factual and procedural history of this case is set forth in\n   <em>\n    McConnell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-1206\">\n    2015-Ohio-1206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Following trial to the court, judgment was entered against Schmitt in the amount of $23,030 on April 9, 2013. McConnell appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} After the case had been pending for twenty-three months on appeal, on March 31, 2015, this court issued the following Judgment Entry, constituting the mandate of this court: \"The order of this court is that the judgment of the Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas is reversed and this cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the opinion.\" App.R. 27 (\"[a] court of appeals may remand its * * * judgments * * * to the court below for further proceedings therein\" and \"[a] certified copy of the judgment shall constitute the mandate\"). In accord with Section 3(B)(3), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution, this Judgment was rendered by two judges of this court-the second judge concurring in judgment only.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-1206\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"[a] majority of the judges hearing the cause shall be necessary to render a judgment\"). The third judge concurred in part and dissented in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Upon remand, the trial court determined that it was without \"clear directive\" as to how to proceed, as \"the authored opinion was not joined by enough jurists to create a majority as to the body of its work.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On April 28, 2015, the trial court entered judgment against Schmitt in the amount of $23,071 for lost profits of the business during the first six months of operation, $23,071 for lost profits during the remaining six months of McConnell's employment contract; and $1 for punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On May 26, 2015, McConnell filed a Notice of Appeal. On appeal, McConnell raises the following assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 8} \"[1.] The court erred to the prejudice of plaintiff in again finding that appellant was not entitled to an award of statutory forfeiture damages pursuant to R.C. 1701.94 contrary to the clear directives of the reviewing court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 9} \"[2.] The court erred to the prejudice of plaintiff in failing to include significant and primary revenue sources in its calculation of lost profits contrary to the clear directives of the reviewing court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 10} \"[3.] The court erred to the prejudice of plaintiff in failing to award lost profits beyond the term of the management agreement contrary to the clear directives of the reviewing court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 11} \"[4.] The trial court erred to the prejudice of appellant by failing to award as damages his percentage of ownership of Club Pink's property removed by the appellee just prior to sale and then returned immediately thereafter contrary to the clear directives of the reviewing court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 12} \"[5.] The trial court erred to the prejudice of appellant by failing to award attorneys fees to appellant and only awarding one dollar in punitive damages contrary to the clear directives of the reviewing court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In the first assignment of error, McConnell claims the trial court failed to comply with this court's mandate in the prior appeal to award statutory damages pursuant to R.C. 1701.94. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 14} On this issue in the prior appeal, the trial court had found in favor of Schmitt on McConnell's claim that she violated\n   R.C. 1701.37(C), by failing to produce corporate records upon request. This court reversed and remanded with instructions for \"the lower court * * * to either reinstate the December 26, 2012 Judgment [awarding McConnell statutory fines in the amount of $47,580 for violating 1701.37(C) ], or, if it finds this amount to be in error, to recalculate the amount of statutory damages to which McConnell is entitled.\"\n   <em>\n    McConnell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-1206\">\n    2015-Ohio-1206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Instead of complying with this court's mandate, the trial court concluded that the determination that Schmitt had violated R.C. 1701.37(C) was against \"the manifest weight of the direct evidence\" and so would \"not impose a statutory penalty.\" The court further stated that it could not \"in good conscience simply revert to [the December 26, 2012 Judgment] as suggested by the author of the appellate decision.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 16} It is well-established law that \"an inferior court has no discretion to disregard the mandate of a superior court in a prior appeal in the same case.\"\n   <em>\n    Nolan v.

The opinion is a \"written statement explaining [the court's] decision in a given case.\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   1125 (8th Ed. 2004). The court's opinion is distinct from its judgment which is \"[a] court's final determination of the rights and obligations of the parties in a case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 858. The opinion in the 2015\n   <em>\n    McConnell\n   </em>\n   appeal was unsupported by a majority of the judges, but the judgment did have the support of a majority of judges. The fact that the opinion lacked precedential value did not absolve the inferior court in the case from abiding by this court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The first assignment of error is with merit. The trial court's April 28, 2015 Judgment Entry is reversed with respect to the denial of statutory damages. Based on the record, judgment is entered in favor of McConnell in the amount of $47,580 on\n   Count I of the Amended Complaint (Violation of O.R.C. \u00a7 1701.37 by Defendant Schmitt).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 20} In the second and third assignments of error, McConnell challenges the trial court's award of lost profits on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 21} In the prior appeal, this court held as follows with respect to lost profits:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   McConnell presented sufficient evidence of Club Pink's profitability to merit an award of lost profits beyond his seven-month period of employment. * * * Given the totality of the evidence, the trial court should have fashioned an appropriate remedy to compensate McConnell, not only for lost shareholder profits during his period of employment, but also for the period after his employment, during which he remained a 49% shareholder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   McConnell's losses as a 49% owner of Masury Real Estate * * * were demonstrated with reasonable certainty. * * * McConnell is entitled to $35,770, representing his share of the rents * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    McConnell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-1206\">\n    2015-Ohio-1206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 45-46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 22} On remand, the trial court partially complied with this court's mandate. The court awarded McConnell $23,071 \"for lost profits during his operation of the club,\" and $23,071 \"for lost profits for the remaining six months under his employment contract.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 23} The trial court did not, however, award McConnell lost profits from Masury Real Estate. Rather, the court construed this court's judgment that \"McConnell is entitled to $35,770, representing his share of the rents\" as \"dicta\" which it \"decline[d] to follow.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 24} As noted above, this court's judgment was supported by a majority of the judges and the trial court is without discretion to disregard it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 25} The second and third assignments of error are with merit. The trial court's April 28, 2015 Judgment Entry is reversed with respect to future lost profits from Masury Real Estate. Based on the record, judgment is entered in favor of McConnell in the amount of $35,770 representing \"[o]ne-half (1/2) of the rental monies collected or entitled to be collected by Masury Real Estate, Inc.\" See page 9 of the Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 26} In the fourth and fifth assignments of error, McConnell contends the trial court did not enter a proper award of punitive damages in accordance with this court's previous decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 27} In the prior appeal, this court held as follows with respect to punitive damages:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   On remand, the trial court should fashion an award of punitive damages, taking into consideration McConnell's testimony regarding attorney fees and the removal of property and equipment from the club building.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    McConnell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-1206\">\n    2015-Ohio-1206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 51 ;\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 49 (\"[p]unitive damages may [be] awarded based on a claim of breach of fiduciary duty where there is a demonstration of 'actual malice' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 28} The trial court made a pretense of complying with this court's judgment, stating, \"in review of the evidence presented, * * * the Appellate Court is correct.\" Thereupon, the court \"award[ed] McConnell $1.00 (ONE DOLLAR) in punitive damages against Schmitt after taking into consideration the totality and credibility of the evidence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 29} The trial court's purported compliance with this court's judgment may best be described as facetious. Again, we note that a judge has the obligation to recuse himself when his impartiality might\n   reasonably be questioned.\n   <em>\n    State v. Watkins\n   </em>\n   , 2d Dist.

The trial court's April 28, 2015 Judgment Entry is reversed with respect to punitive damages and this cause is remanded with instructions for the lower court, upon reassignment, to comply with this court's prior decision, i.e., to \"fashion an award of punitive damages, taking into consideration McConnell's testimony regarding attorney fees and the removal of property and equipment from the club building.\" Furthermore, on remand and reassignment, a hearing is to be held to determine the amount of attorney fees and litigation expenses incurred by McConnell in the course of these proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 32} In cases such as this, where the lower court judge indicates that he \"in good conscience\" cannot follow the appellate court's judgment on remand, the Ohio Supreme Court and Ohio appellate courts have recognized the authority of the appellate court to order the assignment of another judge to hear the case on remand.\n   <em>\n    Columbus v.

Susak's testimony was likewise speculative. Furthermore, it was not clear that Susak's knowledge of the dance revenue was derived from first-hand knowledge as he was a self-described door and maintenance man. * * * In addition, the Court finds the general testimony regarding the door and dance numbers were not credible and were not based on any evidence whatsoever other than the self-serving testimony * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   {\u00b6 79} However, the trial court did find that the club's weekly gross income was $4,650, which \"equates to monthly gross revenue of $20,150. Less the monthly expenses of $5,500, the total monthly net was $14,650. * * * After expenses of $5,500 per month, the Court finds the monthly net profit was $14,650. McConnell ran the club for six months. Six months of a monthly net profit at $14,650 equals $87,900. McConnell is entitled to 49% of this profit; or $43,071.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   {\u00b6 80} After reducing this amount by the $20,000 for Schmitt's initial investment, the trial court awarded McConnell $23,071 for lost profits the first six months and another $23,071 for the remaining six months under his employment contract based in part on McConnell's statement that he personally expected to earn $50,000 in profits the first year of business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   {\u00b6 81} Thus, the trial court awarded McConnell an additional $23,071 for lost profits for the six months remaining under his contract for a total lost profit award of $46,142. Contrary to McConnell's claims, the trial court was not required to award lost profits for lap dances in light of the limited evidence before it, and as such, his second assignment lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   {\u00b6 82} McConnell's third assignment of error has two sub-arguments. First he claims the trial court erred in failing to award him lost profits for the period of time\n   <em>\n    beyond\n   </em>\n   the expiration of his management agreement. The lead opinion instructed the trial court to compensate McConnell \"not only for lost shareholder profits during his period of employment,\n   <em>\n    but also for the period after his employment, during which he remained a 49% shareholder\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45. McConnell claims he was not awarded any lost profits for the time period\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the expiration of his management agreement during which he remained a 49% shareholder and the club continued to exist, consistent with our prior opinion. Again, the trial court was not obligated to follow the directives of the lead opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   {\u00b6 83} Furthermore, the lead opinion arising from McConnell's prior appeal notes that Schmitt provided the pertinent evidence establishing these damages. She testified that Club Pink was open for a total of three years. Thus, it was open for two years beyond McConnell's one-year management agreement. Schmitt confirmed that the club was open seven nights in the beginning, but for the last year it was only open three nights per week. She confirmed that the club attempted to operate five nights per week after she terminated McConnell, but that it was not sustainable. However, and as found by the trial court on remand, there was no evidence reflecting the number of patrons admitted per night during this time period, and there was nothing introduced evidencing the amount of money earned by the club after the expiration of McConnell's management agreement. Schmitt never testified about the revenue generated. Accordingly, his first sub-argument lacks merit because McConnell did not establish lost profits beyond the expiration of his management agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   {\u00b6 84} McConnell's second sub-argument claims the trial court acted contrary to our prior lead opinion based on its failure to award him 49 percent of the real estate lease payments owed by Club Pink to Masury Real Estate. The prior lead opinion on this issue concludes that McConnell \"is entitled to $35,770, representing his share of the rents ( [$88,000 - $15,000] x 0.49).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46. My concurrence in part and dissent in part disagreed, and thus the trial court had free reign.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   {\u00b6 85} Upon reviewing the evidence, the trial court concluded:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   {\u00b6 86} \"Any damages for lost profits from Masury Real Estate were not sufficiently proven at the trial in this matter and are indeed too remote to speculate. Therefore, the Court finds McConnell did not meet his burden of proof as to any lost profits due to him for future lost profits from Masury Real Estate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   {\u00b6 87} Accordingly, the trial court did not err and was within its discretion in concluding that McConnell did not meet\n   his burden of proof. Thus, McConnell's second sub-argument under his third assignment of error lacks merit and his third assigned error lacks merit in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   {\u00b6 88} McConnell's fourth assignment of error claims the trial court erred by failing to award him 49 percent of the value of the personal property that Schmitt removed from the club prior to the sale of the building. Specifically, he alleges that Schmitt wrongfully removed bar furniture and kitchen appliances and equipment in advance of the auction thereby greatly reducing the price obtained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   {\u00b6 89} Schmitt initially purchased the property in 2004 for Bare Label, including all of its contents, for approximately $15,000. The building had been a VFW hall, and Schmitt's purchase included the existing kitchens and \"all the equipment.\" McConnell described her purchase as a \"turnkey business without a liquor license.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   {\u00b6 90} According to Bare Label's appointed receiver, this same real property, including the personal property contained therein, had a total estimated value of $36,600 in advance of the auction in 2009. Schmitt purchased the property at auction for $17,500 in 2009. McConnell filed an objection to the sale based on Schmitt's removal of the personal property from the building. The trial court nevertheless confirmed the sale.\n   <em>\n    McConnell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at \u00b6 9-11.

Second, McConnell failed to offer specific evidence identifying the personal property that Schmitt removed.

Instead, he claims a greater award was warranted in light of the overwhelming evidence of Schmitt's vindictiveness, spite, and malice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   {\u00b6 102} However, the trial court considered McConnell's testimony regarding attorney fees and Schmitt's removal of equipment from the building and took \"into consideration the totality and credibility of the evidence.\" Thereafter, it awarded McConnell one dollar in punitive damages. This minimal punitive damage award was apparently based on the trial court's concern as to the nominal amount of proof establishing McConnell's claims. The trial court noted concern throughout its decision that his testimony was self-serving and unsubstantiated. Consequently, the trial court did not abuse of discretion upon awarding only one dollar in punitive damages.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=671%20N.E.2d%201049\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   {\u00b6 103} Last, the directives by the lead opinion relative to damages following the first appeal were untenable in light of the overwhelming number of unresolved factual issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   {\u00b6 104} Contrary to the majority's conclusion, the trial court did not defy what it believed to be a binding appellate decision. Instead, it conscientiously considered the hand it was dealt, and concluded that the splintered opinion did not constitute a binding majority. The trial court spells out its conclusion to this effect in the first paragraph of its decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   {\u00b6 105} Based on its conclusion that there was no majority opinion, with which I agree, the trial court then proceeded to address the issues on remand consistent with the law, not the lead opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   {\u00b6 106} The majority finds that the trial court was defiant and disobedient. The trial court, however, provided a good faith basis for its actions. That the trial court highlighted fatal flaws in the lead opinion was unavoidable. While there is room for disagreement on this issue, the majority's conclusion that the trial court was derelict is unnecessary and unwarranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   {\u00b6 107} This court has now issued a majority opinion. And the trial court is now duty bound to follow the majority opinion, however flawed. There is no reason to believe the trial court will not do so. Accordingly, this case need not be reassigned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   {\u00b6 108} I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    The dissent states that there was \"no evidence that Schmitt, as a corporate officer, was 'charged with' the duty to maintain the company's financial and corporate records.\" The dissent overlooks the fact that Schmitt was treasurer for both Bare Label Productions and Masury Real Estate, i.e., the chief financial officer for both corporations with responsibility for monitoring corporate finances and reporting to the organizations' members. The dissent also overlooks the fact that, after Schmitt \"froze\" McConnell out of the corporations, she was the corporations' only effective corporate officer.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    This dissent is properly concerned with how time could be \"better served\" in the resolution of this appeal. One suggestion would be for the judges on the panel, particularly the dissenting judge, to act on the appeal so as to ensure its release within the 210-day period prescribed by the Rules of Superintendence. Sup.R. 40(A)(2) and (3).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    The lead opinion and my dissent did not, however, agree with the scope of the trial court's authority on remand in fashioning the award. The lead opinion provided specific directives to the trial court on remand whereas my concurring in part and dissenting in part opinion found that the recalculation of lost profits was within the trial court's discretion as the trier of fact. The third appellate judge did not indicate any reasoning or opinion. Thus, we failed to provide a majority opinion directing the trial court's actions on remand.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
