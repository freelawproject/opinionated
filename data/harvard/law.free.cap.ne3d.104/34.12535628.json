On appeal, Jones argues that (1) the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on aggravated assault and defense of another; and (2) trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request a jury instruction on defense of another. For the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In the early morning hours of July 19, 2015, James Vickery was stabbed outside an alleyway in Chillicothe, Ohio. Jones was identified as Vickery's assailant and charged with one count of felonious assault in violation of R.C. 2903.11, a felony of the second degree. The circumstances surrounding the stabbing were disputed at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Vickery testified that on the night in question he was walking to the store when he saw his friend, Rebecca Cade, and an unknown male, later identified as Jones, walking towards him. Vickery called out to Cade; but she ignored him and eventually turned down an adjacent alley. Jones followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} As Vickery approached the alley, Jones emerged and punched him in his face. A struggled ensued; and Vickery was hit several times in the neck, chest, and abdomen region. Although Vickery had a knife in his pocket, he never used it. When he was finally able to get free, he realized that he was bleeding and flagged down a motorist, who called 9-1-1. Vickery was airlifted to a Columbus hospital where he underwent surgery for multiple punctured organs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Jones recalled a different version of events. According to him, on the night in question, he and Cade were hanging out at a house near the alley. Sometime after midnight, Cade walked into the alley to make a call; and shortly thereafter, he heard an argument. Initially, he only heard loud voices but then he heard Cade yelling for help. When he arrived in the alley, he saw that Vickery had Cade by her arm. The two were standing still; but Cade was trying to pull away. She asked him for help.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} At that point, Jones told Vickery that \"she was with [him] and that [he] was going to take her and she was drunk. She was drunk and [he] was going to take her back over to the house where she belonged.\" Vickery responded by punching Jones in his left temple, knocking him down. Jones stood up and responded with a double-punch, knocking Vickery to the ground. When Vickery got back up, he pulled out a knife, telling Jones that he was going to \"get him.\" Jones backed away, and fearing for his life, he pulled a knife from his back pocket. He explained,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Vickery kept coming after me with the knife. I approached him, cut him across his left jaw he wiped the blood away and then he just went crazy. I don't recall hitting him in his gut. Last thing I remember I hit him underneath his left arm, he screamed and I think that's the only thing that woke him up and he proceeded to back away from me from that point on.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} At the conclusion of Jones's case, trial counsel moved for a jury instruction on aggravated assault:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court: I don't really recall any testimony at all that the defendant was under any influence of sudden passion or sudden fit of rage. If you could direct me to where that testimony is, perhaps that would assist me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [Defense Counsel]: I would submit, Your Honor, the natural reaction to having someone pulling a knife on you would be a sudden passion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The Court: That may be a natural reaction, but that doesn't mean the defendant had that reaction. Is there any testimony that would get me that in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [Defense Counsel]: I think circumstantially, yes. If you apply the circumstantial evidence instruction, is found generally in OJI that circumstantial evidence is the same as direct evidence and therefore we've met that burden.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court: I agree that that is the OJI on circumstantial evidence. Can you point me to the circumstantial evidence that shows that is what he had?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [Defense Counsel]: Again, the circumstance is that he pulls a knife on him, [defendant's] reaction is to pull a knife out of his pocket, open it behind his back and when the guy comes at him he stabs him in his face.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The Court: You do understand that people can do that in a calm, collective manner, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [Defense Counsel]: Properly trained, yes. There are people that have been properly trained that they would be doing it in a calm and collective manner. I think that given, if you watch his demeanor as he described what was happening, that would support it certainly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court: Based on his demeanor as he described it, I don't get that conclusion. I'm going to decline to give an instruction on aggravated assault.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Although the trial court declined to give an instruction on aggravated assault, it instructed the jury on the affirmative defense of self-defense. The jury rejected that defense, however, and found Jones guilty of the charge. He was sentenced to four years in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Assignments of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On appeal, Jones assigns the following errors for our review.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Assignment of Error I:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   The trial court violated Brian Jones's rights to due process and a fair trial when it failed to give the jury an instruction as to the inferior-degree offense of aggravated assault and also when it failed to instruct the jury on the \"defense of another.\" Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 16, of the Ohio Constitution ; Crim.R. 52(B).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Assignment of Error II:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel, in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 10, of the Ohio Constitution.\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.
