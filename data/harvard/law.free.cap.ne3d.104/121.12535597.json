This fact and the tendency of parents to have their children use euphemisms for intimate parts of the body make it difficult to know exactly what children mean when they give testimony about certain sexual conduct. The inherent imprecision of euphemisms for intimate body parts becomes an issue for purposes of anal rape. \"If the evidence shows that the defendant made contact only with the victim's buttocks, there is not sufficient evidence to prove the defendant guilty of the crime of anal rape.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

That kind of evidence is not present in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The victim's testimony did not establish what he meant by his \"bottom.\" Nor does the testimony indicate that penetration of the anal opening occurred. We acknowledge that the victim testified that D.C. drove his hand \"into\" his bottom, but without additional context, we cannot conclude that the word \"bottom\" meant anal opening as opposed to merely between the cheeks of the victim's buttocks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 9} We are aware that it can be difficult to elicit from a child victim the kind of specificity needed to prove the penetration required to establish an anal rape. But as this testimony stands, the essential element of anal penetration was not proven, despite the state's contention otherwise. We have no choice but to conclude that the state's evidence was insufficient to establish penetration of the anal opening. The court erred by adjudicating D.C. delinquent of rape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 10} We agree with D.C., however, that the evidence is sufficient to justify a finding on the lesser included offense of gross sexual imposition under R.C. 2907.05(A)(4). That section states that no person shall have sexual contact with another when the other person is less than thirteen years of age. \"Sexual contact\" is defined as \"any touching of an erogenous zone of another, including without limitation the * * * buttock * * * for the purpose of sexually arousing or gratifying either person.\" The evidence showed that D.C. forced the victim to touch his own buttock for the purpose of sexual arousal. We therefore sustain this assignment of error and find D.C. delinquent of gross sexual imposition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   II. Manifest Weight of the Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The second and fourth assignments of error complain that the delinquency adjudication is against the manifest weight of the evidence. Given our holding that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the rape adjudication, D.C.'s argument with respect to rape is moot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App.R. 12(A)(2)(c). The remainder of the manifest weight of the evidence assignment of error is that the victim was inherently unbelievable because he admitted to lying about various allegations regarding the charges in this case that he made to his parents and the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 12} We preface our discussion here by noting that D.C. is not challenging the weight of the evidence supporting any of the individual counts for which he was adjudicated delinquent. Instead, he offers a general argument that the victim was inherently unbelievable given that he freely admitted lying to the police and his father when divulging the abuse. For example, the victim told the police that D.C. made him put his penis in D.C.'s \"butt,\" but testified at trial \"[t]hat was a lie. I never did that.\" The victim also told the police that D.C.'s brother exposed his private parts to him, but at trial testified that \"[t]hat never happened\" and that \"it wasn't the truth.\" The victim told the police that he did not wish to press charges against D.C., but claimed at trial that he lied about that at his mother's urging. The victim also admitted that he lied about telling his father's girlfriend that his friend's father had shown him \"pornographic material involving young boys.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Undoubtedly, the victim's admissions undermined his credibility. And it is difficult to accept the state's argument that the victim somehow rehabilitated what he described as his \"lying habits\" with the assertion that \"every day I always try to tell the truth.\" Nevertheless, it fell to the trial judge to assess the victim's overall credibility.\n   <em>\n    State v. DeHass\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1788172\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-2d/10/230/\">\n    10 Ohio St.2d 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=227%20N.E.2d%20212\">\n    227 N.E.2d 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1967), paragraph one of the syllabus (the weight of the evidence and credibility of witnesses are matters primarily for the finder of fact).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The court plainly found aspects of the victim's testimony credible. There was a basis for this. The victim's father testified that the manner in which the victim broke down emotionally when divulging the nature of the acts perpetrated against him seemed to be cathartic. And there were points in the victim's testimony where he became emotional in a way that the court could have found belied any assertion that they were contrived. The trial judge was in the better position to assess the credibility of the witnesses, and for that reason we must defer to the trier of fact.\n   <em>\n    State v.

That reasonable people might have viewed the victim's lies more critically is not a basis for finding that the trial judge lost his way by finding the victim credible enough to prove the allegations made against D.C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   III. Equal Protection\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The state charged D.C. with four counts of gross sexual imposition under R.C. 2907.05(A)(4). He maintains that, because he was only 11 years old at the time he engaged in the acts with the victim and was himself a child, he was thus a victim of sexual molestation under authority of\n   <em>\n    In re D.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4114393\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/129/104/\">\n    129 Ohio St.3d 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011-Ohio-2671\">\n    2011-Ohio-2671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=950%20N.E.2d%20528\">\n    950 N.E.2d 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , where the syllabus states: \" R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b) is unconstitutional as applied to a child under the age of 13\n   who engages in sexual conduct with another child under 13.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 16} The problem with applying\n   <em>\n    D.B.\n   </em>\n   to this case is that\n   <em>\n    D.B.\n   </em>\n   dealt with statutory rape under R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b) and this assigned error deals with gross sexual imposition under R.C. 2907.05(A)(4). The court in\n   <em>\n    D.B.\n   </em>\n   found application of the statutory rape statute \"unconstitutionally vague\" when both the alleged rapist and the victim are under the age of 13 because the want of a culpable mental element for the offense meant that \"each child is both an offender and a victim[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24. In other words, because the statute required no showing of force or aggression in order to charge the offense, the distinction between an offender and victim \"breaks down\" when both are under the age of 13 and the decision to prosecute one child over the other results in discriminatory enforcement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 17} We have held that\n   <em>\n    D.B.\n   </em>\n   does not apply to the offense of gross sexual imposition under R.C. 2907.05(A)(4) because that statute defines the offense in terms of \"sexual contact,\" where the touching is for the purpose of sexually arousing or gratifying either person.\n   <em>\n    In re K.A.\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos. 98924 and 99144,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013-Ohio-2997\">\n    2013-Ohio-2997\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203582013\">\n    2013 WL 3582013\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10. We concluded that the offense of statutory rape, which contains no element of mental culpability, is different from the offense of gross sexual imposition, which does require a person to act with \"purpose\" to achieve sexual gratification.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11. We thus found no arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement involved when the state charged a child who was under the age of 13 with gross sexual imposition under R.C. 2907.05(A)(4).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 18} D.C. acknowledges our decision in\n   <em>\n    K.A.\n   </em>\n   , but argues that it was wrongly decided and that we should overrule it.

Irrelevant Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 19} During trial, the state asked both D.C. and his mother questions regarding D.C.'s brother's status as sexual offender registrant. D.C. argues that this evidence was irrelevant because there was no evidence that the brother was present when any of the offenses were committed. He maintains that the state used the evidence to improperly suggest that the brother's conduct adversely reflected D.C.'s character.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The state maintains that D.C. opened the door to testimony about the brother being a sexual offender registrant because his mother, who testified for his defense, was the first person to mention it. This is not true. During redirect-examination of D.C. by the state, the assistant prosecuting attorney asked the victim why he lied to the police when claiming that D.C.'s brother exposed himself.

Second, the testimony did not prejudice D.C. because nothing in the record indicates that the court viewed testimony about D.C.'s brother's status as a sexual offender registrant as somehow reflecting on D.C. We assume that in a bench trial a judge does not use evidence for any improper purpose.\n   <em>\n    State v. Murray\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 91268,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009-Ohio-2580\">\n    2009-Ohio-2580\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%201564818\">\n    2009 WL 1564818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 25. D.C.'s argument is in essence a claim that the trial judge imputed the brother's status as a sexual offender registrant to D.C. Even without the presumption that the court did not do so, we find it difficult to accept an argument that the court imputed acts committed by a registered sex offender to his 11-year-old brother. Without a record showing that the court did impute the brother's conduct to D.C., we have no basis for finding that any miscarriage of justice occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   V. Allied Offenses\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 23} The complaint alleged eight counts of gross sexual imposition: four counts were alleged violations of R.C. 2907.05(A)(4) ; four counts alleged violations of R.C. 2907.05(A)(1). D.C. argues that all the offenses involved sexual contact such that a single act of sexual contact satisfied the elements of both R.C. 2907.05(A)(1) and (A)(4). He thus maintains that the victim suffered the same injury and the counts should have merged for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Some of the gross sexual imposition counts alleged the same type of conduct in what the victim called the \"try not to laugh\" game. This \"game\" involved D.C. and the victim rubbing their clothed genitals against the other in various positions of simulated sexual intercourse. The victim testified that they played the game \"five or six times.\" In addition, the victim testified that on two occasions, D.C. made the victim touch his own penis. In total, these were as many as eight separate acts. The eight acts were committed separately, so they do not merge.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 25} D.C. raises two claims of ineffective assistance of counsel: that on cross-examination of the victim, trial counsel brought up evidence of rape that the state failed to offer and that trial counsel failed to object to hearsay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 26} In direct examination of the victim, the state elicited no testimony to prove the rape count. In cross-examination of the victim, defense counsel played a recording of the victim's statement to the police and asked the victim whether he told the police that D.C. \"made you stick your finger somewhere?\" The victim replied that he did tell the police that. Defense counsel then asked for specifics on what happened, causing the victim to testify that D.C. drove his hand into his own bottom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 27} The state maintains that this questioning was a matter of trial strategy by defense counsel. We can conceive of no trial strategy where defense counsel willingly elicits testimony tending to prove the state's case. But we need not address this argument further because we have vacated the adjudication for rape and modified it to an adjudication for gross sexual imposition. The claim, therefore, is moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 28} The remaining question is whether defense counsel was ineffective for failing to object to hearsay offered by the victim's father. This included statements that the victim had been more \"open\" about discussing with the father what happened to him, that the victim had \"always said the same thing to me\" about what happened, and that to the extent the victim was reticent about sharing what happened with this father, the victim opened up to his counselors and that his counselors told the father that what he said to them \"always coincided.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Even if we assume without deciding that defense counsel should have objected to the statements, we find no prejudice sufficient to warrant reversal. The court's adjudication found support in otherwise properly admitted evidence. There is no reasonable probability that, but for counsel's error, the result of the trial would have been different.\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.
