White, was charged in the Boston Municipal Court with violation of a restraining order. A judge dismissed the complaint finding that it was not supported by probable cause. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . On September 8, 2015, A.F. filed a complaint for protection from abuse pursuant to G. L. c. 209A. An ex parte order issued on September 9, 2015, with an expiration date of September 22, 2015. On September 11, 2015, A.F. received five telephone calls from the defendant between 7:15\n   <em>\n    P\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    M\n   </em>\n   . and 7:24\n   <em>\n    P\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    M\n   </em>\n   . A.F. answered the first call, as she did not recognize the incoming telephone number, and hung up when she heard the defendant's voice. Thereafter, the defendant called A.F. from a telephone number that she recognized; she did not answer the call and the defendant left a voicemail message. In the message, the defendant stated, \"[W]hat is this court shit?\" and \"[Y]ou['re] ruining my life more than you already have.\" The defendant was served in hand with the order on September 12, 2015, at 9:51\n   <em>\n    P\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    M\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Detective Carmen Rodriguez of the Boston police department domestic violence unit filed an application for a criminal complaint alleging one count of violation of a restraining order. A hearing was held before a clerk magistrate on October 29, 2015. The magistrate found probable cause to issue the complaint and made certain notations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of probable cause, which was allowed after a nonevidentiary hearing. In a margin endorsement, the judge found that it was more probable than not that the defendant knew of the order, but not its provisions, including that he was not to contact A.F.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . We review a motion judge's determination on the issue of probable cause de novo. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ilya I.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4145101\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/470/625/#p627\">\n    470 Mass. 625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 627 (2015). \"[A] motion to dismiss a complaint [for lack of probable cause] 'is decided from the four corners of the complaint application, without evidentiary hearing.' \"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Humberto H.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223855\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/466/562/#p565\">\n    466 Mass. 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 565 (2013), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Huggins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4163774\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/84/107/#p111\">\n    84 Mass.

Probable cause requires \"more than mere suspicion,\" but \"considerably less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt, so evidence that is insufficient to support a guilty verdict might be more than sufficient to establish probable cause.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 565 (quotation omitted). In this context, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3833889\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/75/235/#p238\">\n    75 Mass. App. Ct. 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 238 (2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Supreme Judicial Court has made it abundantly clear that where a prosecutor exercises his prosecutorial discretion, and in the absence of statutory authority, a judge is precluded from dismissing a valid complaint. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Newton N.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12547356\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/89/1159/#p755\">\n    478 Mass. 747\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 755-756 (2018) ;\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Orbin O\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12547355\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/89/1151/#p764\">\n    478 Mass. 759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 764-765 (2018). Here, the judge acted within his authority in dismissing the complaint, as probable cause on the third element\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the offense-the defendant's knowledge of the order-is lacking. While personal service of the order is not required, here, at best, the complaint application established that the defendant knew of the order, but not its terms. The Commonwealth's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Melton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3837671\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/77/552/\">\n    77 Mass. App. Ct. 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010), is misplaced. In\n   <em>\n    Melton\n   </em>\n   , the victim specifically asked the defendant why he was calling, as \"there's a restraining order.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3837671\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/77/552/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3837671\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/77/552/\">\n    . at 556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the only inference to be drawn from the defendant's voicemail message is that he knew of the order. It does not follow from his message, in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, that the defendant knew he was precluded from calling A.F.
