Hutchison appeals from the October 18, 2016 Judgment of Conviction of Sentence and May 29, 2016 Decision and Order Denying Defendant's Motion to Withdraw Guilty Pleas of the Licking County Court of Common Pleas. Appellee is the state of Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The following facts are adduced from appellee's statement at the change-of-plea and sentencing hearing on October 17, 2016. These facts are also contained in the \"Memorandum Documenting Nature of Plea Agreement\" signed by appellant, appellee,\n   and defense trial counsel on October 17, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} This case arose on November 5, 2014 in the city of Newark. Law enforcement prepared to execute a search warrant at 58 \u00bd Union Street during an investigation of appellant's involvement in counterfeiting. Appellant left the residence and engaged in a confrontation with police, during which he discharged a firearm at Ptl. Jarrod Conley of the Newark Police Department.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ptl. Conley was struck in the arm and vest, causing serious physical harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} At the time of the shooting, Ptl. Conley was in uniform and had just exited a marked police car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Prior to this confrontation, appellant had stated \"he would engage in a shootout with police if he ever faced being re-arrested.\" (Memorandum, 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} After shooting Ptl. Conley, appellant fled on foot, pursued by Det. Doug Bline, who was in plain clothes. Appellant became aware of Det. Bline's pursuit in the area of West Church Street; appellant \"raised his firearm directly at Det. Bline in such a fashion as to manifest a substantial step toward shooting at him * * *.\" (Memorandum, 4). Det. Bline struck appellant with the vehicle he (Bline) was driving. Appellant's firearm was found at the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Appellant was alleged to have recklessly violated the terms of a protection order issued or consent agreement approved pursuant to R.C. 2919.26 or 3113.31 of the Revised Code, and/or a protection order issued pursuant to Section 2151.34, 2903.213, or 2903.214 of the Revised Code. These protection orders were issued in Licking County Common Pleas Court, Domestic Relations Division, Case No. 14-DR-1161 and Licking County Common Pleas Court, General Division, Case No. 09-CV-2135; both protection orders were in effect on November 5, 2014; and both protection orders prohibited appellant from possessing, using, carrying, or obtaining any deadly weapons, including a firearm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Appellant was in actual or constructive possession of, as a principal offender or in complicity with one or more others, \"counterfeit\" U.S. currency in the Union Street residence, in the vehicle he was driving before the confrontation with law enforcement, and/or in the personal effects removed from his person at the hospital. Additionally, appellant did with purpose to defraud or knowing that he was facilitating a fraud, did utter, or possess with purpose to utter, any writing that he knew to be forged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Appellant was in actual and/or constructive possession of, as a principal offender or in complicity with one or more others, items used to facilitate the counterfeiting of U.S. currency including but not limited to a printer/copier and copying paper to manufacture counterfeit bills; chemicals to \"bleach\" real U.S. currency; one or more vehicles to transport counterfeit bills and/or to transport items/equipment to aid in the counterfeiting process itself; and real U.S. currency from which to make copies or that can be bleached.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Appellant acknowledged the facts presented, that those facts would have been presented to a jury, and that if presented to the jury would have been sufficient to sustain convictions as described infra. (T. 23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Appellant was charged by indictment as follows: Count I, felonious assault pursuant to R.C. 2903.11(A)(2), a felony of the first degree; Count II, felonious assault pursuant to R.C. 2903.11(A)(2), a felony of the first degree; Count III, improper handling of firearms in a motor vehicle pursuant to R.C. 2923.16(B), a felony of the fourth degree; Count IV, violation of a protection order pursuant to R.C. 2919.27(A)(1) and/or (2) and (B)(4), a felony of the third degree; County V, forgery pursuant to R.C. 2913.31(A)(3), a felony of the fifth degree; Count VI, possession of criminal tools pursuant to R.C. 2923.24(A), a felony of the fifth degree. Count I is accompanied by firearm specifications pursuant to R.C. 2941.1412 and R.C. 2941.145 ; Count II is accompanied by a firearm specification pursuant to R.C. 2941.145.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Appellant entered pleas of not guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} On July 10, 2015, appellant filed a motion for psychological evaluations, asserting he had \"severe mental illness\" and possible \"intellectual/adaptive functioning impairments\" affecting his ability to meaningfully assist in his defense. On July 14, 2015, the trial court ordered appellant to submit to a psychological examination pursuant to R.C. 2945.37(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 14} While the instant case was pending, in an unrelated matter, appellant's federal supervision was revoked and he was sentenced to a federal prison term of 24 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 15} On September 11, 2015, the trial court filed a Judgment Entry accepting a Netcare Report and adopting the finding that appellant was capable of understanding the nature and objective of the proceedings and assisting in his defense. Appellant was therefore competent to stand trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 16} On September 16, 2015, appellant filed a pro se memorandum requesting new trial counsel, which the trial court granted on September 18, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Appellant moved for, and was granted, the services of a private investigator at public expense. Appellant also moved for, and was granted, the services of an expert crash investigator/reconstructionist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 18} On May 16, 2016, the trial court filed a Judgment Entry indicating appellant requested a new trial at a status conference and the request was granted. The Office of the Ohio Public Defender was appointed to represent appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 19} On October 18, 2016, appellant entered negotiated pleas of guilty to Count I, felonious assault of a police officer and the second accompanying firearm specification;\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Count III, improper handling of a firearm in a motor vehicle; Count IV, violation of a protection order; Count V, forgery; and Count VI, possession of criminal tools. Appellant entered an Alford plea to Count II, which was amended to attempted felonious assault pursuant to R.C. 2903.11(A)(1) and 2923.02, a felony of the third degree, and the accompanying firearm specification. The Entry of Guilty Pleas filed October 18, 2016, states the parties' agreement \"[t]hat the parties will jointly recommend that on the charges in this case the Court impose a prison sentence not less than twelve (12) years, and no greater than twenty-four (24) years under the terms otherwise outlined in a simultaneously-presented 'Memorandum Documenting Nature of Plea Agreement.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Also on October 18, 2016, the trial court journalized its Judgment of Conviction and Sentence indicating, e.g., appellant was sentenced to an aggregate prison\n   term of 20 years. The term was ordered to be served consecutively to appellant's federal prison term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 21} On October 31, 2016, appellant filed a pro se motion to withdraw his guilty plea, arguing e.g. he blacked out and had no memory of telling defense trial counsel he acquiesced to the negotiated pleas of guilty. Appellee responded with a memorandum and affidavit in opposition on November 3, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Appellant filed second and third (separate) pro se motions to withdraw his guilty plea on November 10, 2016. Appellee responded with a supplemental memorandum in opposition on November 15, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 23} On November 17, 2016, appellee filed a \"State's Submission of Proposed Judgment Entry Denying Defendant's Motions to Withdraw Guilty Plea.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 24} On November 29, 2016, the trial court entered a \"Decision and Order Denying Defendant's Motions to Withdraw Guilty Pleas.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Appellant then filed pro se motions to hold an evidentiary hearing, for preparation of transcripts at state's expense, and for appointment of counsel, all of which were overruled by the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 26} On December 16, 2016, however, the trial court filed a judgment entry noting the motions described above, concluding appellant \"wish[ed] to pursue some sort of appeal in connection with either his conviction, or his Motion to Withdraw his Guilty Pleas.\" Therefore the trial court granted appellant's motion for appointment of counsel to represent appellant for purposes of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 27} On December 29, 2016, appellant filed notice of the instant appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Appellant now appeals from the October 18, 2016 Judgment of Conviction and Sentence and November 29, 2016 Decision and Order Denying Defendant's Motions to Withdraw Guilty Pleas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Appellant raises three assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 30} \"I. HE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION WHEN IT DENIED THE APPELLANT A HEARING ON HIS MOTION TO WITHDRAW HIS GUILTY PLEA.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 31} \"II. THE TRIAL COURT VIOLATED THE APPELLANT'S DUE PROCESS RIGHTS WHEN IT FAILED TO COMPLY WITH CRIMINAL RULE 11, SPECIFICALLY BY NOT EXPLAINING TO THE DEFENDANT THAT A DEFENDANT WHO MAKES A GUILTY PLEA IS MAKING A COMPLETE ADMISSION OF GUILT.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 32} \"III. THE APPELLANT DID NOT ENTER A KNOWING, INTELLIGENT, AND VOLUNTARY PLEA BECAUSE HIS COMMENTS ON THE RECORD CLEARLY DEMONSTRATE THAT HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE CHARGES.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   I., II., III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Appellant's three assignments of error are related and will be considered together. Appellant argues that the trial court should have afforded him a hearing on his motions to withdraw his guilty pleas; that he did not understand his guilty pleas were a complete admission of guilt; and he didn't fully comprehend the charges he was facing. For each of these reasons, appellant alleges, the trial court erred in refusing to allow him to withdraw his guilty pleas. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    Post-Sentence Motions to Withdraw Guilty Pleas\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Appellant's motions to withdraw his guilty plea were made pursuant to Criminal Rule 32.1, stating: \"A motion to withdraw a plea of guilty or no contest may be made only before sentence is imposed; but to correct manifest injustice the court after sentence may set aside the judgment of conviction and permit the defendant to withdraw his or her plea.\" The standard upon which the trial court is to review a request for a change of plea after sentence is whether there is a need to correct a manifest injustice.\n   <em>\n    State v.

A trial court is not automatically required to hold a hearing on a post sentence motion to withdraw a plea of guilty. A hearing must only be held if the facts alleged by the defendant, accepted as true, would require that the defendant be allowed to withdraw the plea.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The term \"abuse of discretion\" implies the court's attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\n   <em>\n    Blakemore v.

Specifically, he asserts that he instructed his attorney that he did not want to enter guilty pleas when he entered the courtroom, but then blacked out for the remainder of the hearing due to his traumatic brain injury. We reject appellant's premise that a trial court must accept his claims as true without any consideration of credibility. In deciding a motion to withdraw a guilty plea, the trial court has the discretion to determine the \"good faith, credibility and weight of the movant's assertions * * *.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In this case, the only corroboration of appellant's claims are his own statements in the motions to withdraw the guilty pleas. Generally, a self-serving affidavit or statement is insufficient to demonstrate manifest injustice.\n   <em>\n    State v. Patterson\n   </em>\n   , 5th Dist.

Appellant claims in his motions and on appeal that he was ill during the hearing, that he was medicated to the extent he didn't understand what was happening, and that the prosecutor and defense trial counsel threatened and coerced him into accepting the plea offer. During the hearing, appellant testified under oath that he understood what he was doing, he wasn't under the effects of any mind-altering substance, and no threats or promises had been made to induce him to plead guilty. (T. 7, 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 40} There was no evidence of appellant's alleged altered mental state at the hearing. In\n   <em>\n    Caraballo\n   </em>\n   , supra, the appellant argued that his state of mind was affected by emotional debilitation and drug abuse, therefore preventing his plea from being voluntary and knowledgeable; additionally, he was not capable of appreciating the consequences of his actions due to his habitual drug dependency and the trial court erred in disallowing him to withdraw the plea. In affirming the decision of the trial court, the Ohio Supreme Court noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   While we recognize that a guilty plea must be knowing, intelligent and voluntary, appellant's own testimony established that he was not under the influence of any drug and that he understood the nature of the proceedings on the day in question. Further, we fail to see how the trial judge could have more thoroughly examined appellant's mental state relative to his plea. After complying with Crim.R. 11, the court again reviewed his mental awareness surrounding the plea at the hearing on this matter. We can, therefore, find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's action as appellant has not sustained his burden of proof required by\n   <em>\n    Smith, supra.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

The trial court found the only evidence of appellant's traumatic brain injury was his own self-serving statement; nor does any evidence exist that any such injury impaired appellant's decision-making during the change-of-plea hearing. As appellee points out, appellant was in fact found to be competent to stand trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 42} If we were to accept appellant's argument, a hearing would be required upon every claim of manifest injustice and the trial court would have no discretion to weigh the credibility of the allegations.

However, defense trial counsel further acknowledged that he and his client discussed the fact that if the testimony at trial corroborated evidence contained in the discovery, a factfinder could find appellant guilty of attempted felonious assault (T. 37). Therefore, the risk of trial vs. a plea to a lesser charge was to appellant's benefit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 59} The record before us therefore demonstrates the trial court complied with the statutory prerequisites of Crim.R. 11(C)(2), and appellant entered his\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea to the amended Count II both voluntarily and knowingly. The record further confirms that appellant's counsel was present at the time of the plea and that his counsel's advice was competent. Further, the record establishes appellant entered an\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea to a lesser charge to avoid exposure to another first-degree felony. As discussed supra, the record fails to demonstrate that appellant was coerced into entering his\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea. The trial court explained to appellant the possible charges and penalties associated with each charge. Appellant told the trial court that he understood the charges and the penalties. Thus, appellant's\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea was made with an understanding of the nature of the charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 60} The record before us confirms that appellant's\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea was made voluntarily and knowingly, and the prosecution presented a sufficient factual basis for an attempted felonious assault charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 61} We find the record indicates appellant answered the trial court's questions at the plea hearing correctly and appropriately, and specifically affirmed that he understood\n   the nature of the charge against him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Appellant affirmed at the plea hearing that he had fully discussed the case with counsel, and indicated no confusion regarding the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 62} Accordingly, under the circumstances of the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice,\n   </em>\n   the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding no manifest injustice which would warrant the extraordinary step of withdrawing appellant's guilty pleas. We therefore affirm the trial court's decision overruling appellant's motions to withdraw his guilty pleas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 63} Appellant's three assignments of error are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 64} Appellant's three assignments of error are overruled and the judgment of the Licking County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Wise, John, J. and Baldwin, J., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Appellee's statement of facts indicates appellant originally left the residence in a vehicle but ended up on foot as described infra.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Appellee dismissed the first firearm specification in Count I.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
