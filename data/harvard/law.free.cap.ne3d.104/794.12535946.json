On appeal, Appellant contends that 1) his conviction is not supported by sufficient evidence; 2) the trial court abused its discretion when it permitted the State to introduce evidence of other bad acts; 3) he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to object to prosecutorial misconduct in closing argument; and 4) the trial court abused its discretion when it admitted labels affixed to prescription bottles, which were both hearsay and not authenticated. Because we fail to find merit in Appellant's second, third and fourth assignments of error, and because we have determined under Appellant's first assignment of error that his conviction was supported by sufficient evidence, we overrule all of the assignments of error raised by Appellant. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On November 6, 2013, the Athens County Grand Jury indicted Appellant on one count of aggravated trafficking in drugs (oxycodone) in violation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(1), a third-degree felony, and one count of aggravated trafficking in drugs (oxycodone) in violation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(2), a third-degree felony. Each count carried an attendant forfeiture specification. Appellant pleaded not guilty and the matter proceeded to trial on November 19, 2015. Just prior to trial, the State dismissed count one of the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The State presented several witnesses at trial, including Sergeant Coy Lehman of the Ohio State Highway Patrol. Sergeant Lehman testified that in the early morning hours of August 24, 2011, he received a call about a possible impaired driver traveling on Route 33 in Athens County. After locating the car and observing it swerve multiple times, Sergeant Lehman initiated a traffic stop. He testified that he asked Appellant, who was the driver, for his license and registration. Appellant admitted that he did not have a valid driver's license but provided Sergeant Lehman with a Florida identification card and a copy of the car's rental agreement. The agreement listed Tamara Cremeans, the mother of Appellant's child, as the authorized driver and showed an estimated return date of August 8, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Sergeant Lehman testified that Appellant stated he and his girlfriend were traveling from Florida to Columbus, and as Appellant was speaking, Sergeant Lehman noticed that his \"speech was very slurred, * * * his pupils were pinpoint, which [was] odd because it was dark and they should be dilated. His eyes were red. His actions were lethargic and slow. His facial features were droopy.\" Sergeant Lehman testified that because he did not smell alcohol on Appellant, he suspected Appellant was under the influence of drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Sergeant Lehman testified he noticed that Appellant's girlfriend also seemed impaired. While talking with her, Sergeant Lehman observed a prescription pill bottle lying near the gas pedal. The label on the bottle indicated that the pills were \"Oxycodone\" and that the prescription was filled for Appellant on August 22, 2011, just two days prior to the traffic stop. Sergeant Lehman testified that of the 180 pills that the prescription label indicated were originally in the bottle, \"significantly less than 180 pills\" remained. Sergeant Lehman testified that he then administered field sobriety tests to Appellant and that despite the fact the test results did not confirm his suspicions, he nevertheless placed Appellant under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Subsequent urine testing confirmed the presence of cocaine and marijuana metabolites in Appellant's system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} During the search of Appellant's person, Sergeant Lehman found a \"wad of cash\" totaling $1,935.00 dollars. Sergeant Lehman testified that based on the number of missing pills and the large amount of cash, he suspected Appellant was transporting drugs. He further testified that after additional officers arrived on the scene, a search of the car yielded two more prescription pill bottles in Appellant's name and two cell phones. The record reveals that Appellant stated, on a recording of the traffic stop admitted a trial, that both of the cell phones in the car were his.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The record reveals that of the 180 tablets that the label indicated were originally in the first bottle, which was found near the gas pedal in plain view, there were only 70 tablets remaining. The label on a second prescription pill bottle, which was found in the driver's door storage\n   compartment, indicated that the pills were \"Alprazolam\" and that the prescription was filled for Appellant on August 22, 2011, as well. The label on that bottle indicated there were 84 pills, but of the 84 pills that the label indicated were originally in the bottle, there were only 37 whole and 14 broken pieces remaining. A third bottle containing oxycodone was found in the center console of the vehicle. The label on that bottle, also dated August 22, 2011, indicated there were 140 pills, but there were only 11 pills remaining.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   It was later determined that the bottles did in fact contain oxycodone, a schedule II controlled substance, and alprazolam, a schedule IV controlled substance. Thus, out of 320 oxycodone pills prescribed to Appellant just two days prior, 239 pills were missing at the time Appellant was stopped.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The State also presented testimony from Detective Chuck Haegele, employed by the Athens City Police Department and assigned to the Athens Major Crimes Unit. Detective Haegele, though not involved with Appellant's stop or arrest, testified generally with respect to his specific training and experience in drug interdiction. The trial court allowed the detective's testimony, over the objection of Appellant, \"just for background[,]\" in response to the State's asserted purpose of educating the jury. Detective Haegele testified that he typically looks for certain drug interdiction factors or common indicators, including rental vehicles, not carrying identification, coming from other states, including Michigan, Florida and Washington, D.C., and carrying prescription pills, the most common being oxycontin or oxycodone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The jury ultimately found Appellant guilty of aggravated trafficking in drugs. However, it found that the State had not proved that the cash found on Appellant was derived through the commission of the offense. Appellant was subsequently sentenced to an eighteen-month prison term, an eighteen-month suspension of his operator's license, and fines totaling $6,935.00. Appellant now brings his timely appeal, assigning the following errors for our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"I. THE TRIAL COURT VIOLATED CITO HILL'S RIGHTS TO DUE PROCESS AND A FAIR TRIAL WHEN, IN THE ABSENCE OF SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE, IT ENTERED A JUDGMENT OF CONVICTION FOR AGGRAVATED TRAFFICKING OF DRUGS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II. THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION WHEN IT PERMITTED THE STATE TO INTRODUCE EVIDENCE OF OTHER BAD ACTS, AND THUS DENIED CITO HILL HIS RIGHTS TO DUE PROCESS AND A FAIR TRIAL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   III. CITO HILL RECEIVED INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL BECAUSE HIS ATTORNEY FAILED TO OBJECT TO PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT IN CLOSING ARGUMENT, IN VIOLATION OF MR. HILL'S RIGHTS UNDER THE FIFTH, SIXTH, AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   IV. THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION WHEN IT ADMITTED LABELS AFFIXED TO PRESCRIPTION BOTTLES, AND THE LABELS WERE BOTH HEARSAY AND NOT AUTHENTICATED.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 10} For ease of analysis, we address Appellant's assignments of error out of order. In his second assignment of error, Appellant contends that the trial court abused its discretion when it permitted the State to introduce evidence of other bad acts, thus denying him his right to due process and a fair trial. Appellant's argument under this assignment of error is twofold. First, Appellant argues the trial court erred by allowing the jury to consider urinalysis results showing that he had ingested illicit drugs. Second, Appellant argues the trial court erred in allowing evidence of \"drug interdiction\" factors. Appellant argues the admission of this evidence violated Evid.R. 404(B). The trial court denied Appellant's motion in limine requesting this evidence and testimony be excluded. The State argues, with respect to the admission of the urine test results, that because defense counsel failed to object to the admission of testimony by expert witness, Emily McAnulty, this issue was not properly preserved for purposes of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Generally, appellate courts do not directly review in limine rulings.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Appellant objected, arguing such testimony constituted impermissible other acts evidence. The trial court decided to adjourn the trial for the day so that further discussion could be had outside the presence of the jury, but agreed that the evidence might constitute inadmissible other acts evidence. The trial resumed the next day with the State having filed a formal motion requesting the trial court to reconsider its prior ruling on the OVI evidence. The reason advanced by the State regarding the need for the evidence related to defense counsel's claim during both voir dire and opening statements that Appellant was stopped for nothing other than \"driving while black.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Appellant objected to the motion to reconsider, arguing that because he was not formally charged with Operating a Vehicle While Intoxicated (OVI), such evidence was irrelevant and also consisted of other bad acts evidence. After an extended bench conference at the beginning of day two of the trial, the trial court agreed and ruled that evidence related to Appellant's impairment, beyond his driving and the video and of the initial stop, were not relevant, would not be admitted, and thus the court denied the motion to reconsider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 16} However, on day three of the trial, the State sought to introduce the urine test results from the urinalysis performed on Appellant the night of the stop, arguing that the results were admissible because Sergeant Lehman had stated one of the factors he considers in drug trafficking investigations is whether or not an individual is a drug user as well. The trial court held off ruling on the issue until later in the afternoon, and when it did it decided as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \"As a preliminary matter as to the issues raised by the State, by the State at the last break the Court will allow the testimony of the State's witness tomorrow morning. Defense counsel can lodge any objections to her testimony at the appropriate time. But the court will allow the testimony.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The next morning, on day four of the trial, Appellant filed a written motion in limine, arguing that the urine test results were inadmissible. Appellant further asked the trial court to exclude \"evidence related to drug trafficking indicators,\" including the urine test results. Appellant argued in his motion that the State's introduction of urine test results showing drug use, as well as testimony describing \"drug trafficking indicators\" such as \"travelling between certain State's [sic], using rental cars, [and] using drugs * * *\" is just another way of saying \"that drug traffickers have certain character traits[,]\" and that Evid.R. 404(B) specifically prohibits the use of other crimes, wrongs or acts to\n   establish character or action in conformity therewith. Appellant argued that all of the drug trafficking indicators constituted other acts, wrongs or potential crimes, which the State was using to attempt to establish that he was a drug trafficker. The trial court denied the motion in limine, stating as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \"As an initial matter counsel for the defense has submitted a written Motion in Limine excluding evidence related to the indicators as was testified to yesterday. And as the Court has already ruled on that, having denied that motion, I don't believe we need to re-address that. But it is good to have that down in written form for the Court of Appeals to review.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Thereafter, the State presented witness Emily McAnulty, who is employed by the Ohio State Highway Patrol, and who was stipulated to as an expert by defense counsel. Ms. McAnulty testified that testing of Appellant's urine revealed the presence of marijuana metabolites and cocaine metabolites. She confirmed on cross examination that Appellant's urine was not tested for the presence of opiates. Appellant did not object to McAnulty's testimony, but did object to the admission of the urinalysis report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 18} With respect to Appellant's argument that the trial court erred in allowing the jury to consider urinalysis results showing that he had ingested illicit drugs, we note that we do not actually review the trial court's ruling on the motion on the limine, but rather we review the trial court's ultimate ruling based upon a later objection to the admission of the evidence. Based upon the foregoing, it is clear that Appellant, despite filing a motion in limine seeking the exclusion of testimony by McAnulty and the urinalysis report itself, did not object to McAnulty's testimony. As such, we agree with the State's argument that this issue was not properly preserved for review. Despite the fact that Appellant did object to the later admission of the actual urinalysis report, McAnulty's testimony regarding the results of the urinalysis was already admitted into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Further, assuming arguendo the issue was preserved by the objection to the admission of the urine test results themselves, we reject Appellant's assertion that the urine tests results were not relevant or admissible in the context of a charge of drug trafficking. The record reveals that Sergeant Lehman testified that an accused's drug use is a factor considered when investigating drug trafficking. Additionally, in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Dixon argued that his statement should have been excluded under Evid.R. 404(B) as evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts, which are not admissible to prove the character of a person or to show action in conformity therewith.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=72%20N.E.3d%20661\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The State argued that the testimony was not improper character testimony, but instead was admissible as a statement against interest, and also was evidence of motive, which is admissible under other acts.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=72%20N.E.3d%20661\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This Court ultimately found that Dixon's statement regarding his personal drug use \"was admissible for purposes of showing knowledge of the existence of the drugs at issue, as well as motive for his involvement in the transportation of drugs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41. Thus, we found Dixon's personal drug use to be both relevant and admissible as an exception to Evid.R. 404(B), as it demonstrated Dixon's motive and knowledge in the context\n   of drug trafficking. The same reasoning applies to the facts presently before us and leads us to conclude that the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion in admitting the testimony of Emily McAnulty as well as the urinalysis report. As such, we reject this portion of Appellant's second assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Next, with respect to Appellant's argument that the trial court erred in allowing evidence of \"drug interdiction\" factors, we note that Appellant cites no authority whatsoever in support of his argument. Further, this Court has been unable to locate any authority which indicates that testimony regarding \"drug interdiction\" factors or common indicators of drug trafficking, constitute impermissible other acts evidence. In fact, courts in Ohio, including this Court, routinely review and consider testimony regarding such factors given by law enforcement officers, based upon their training and experience in drug interdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

He was permitted to testify regarding common indicators of drug trafficking based upon his training and experience in drug interdiction. Likewise, Detective Chuck Haegele with the Athens City Police Department was permitted to testify regarding his training in drug interdiction and common indicators seen in drug trafficking cases. Appellant acknowledged in his motion in limine that drug interdiction factors are admissible to establish the basis for stops and seizures when evaluating Fourth Amendment issues, noting that the rules of evidence do not apply at suppression hearings. Thus, Appellant seems to argue that although such factors are relevant and admissible to justify an initial stop or search, they are not relevant or admissible in determining guilt at trial. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Again, Appellant cites no authority which suggests that these factors, in a totality of the circumstances analysis, cannot constitute circumstantial evidence to be considered by a jury in determining guilt. As such, we find no error or abuse of discretion in the trial court's allowance of this testimony herein. Accordingly, having found no merit in either of the arguments raised under this assignment of error, Appellant's second assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 23} In his fourth assignment of error, Appellant contends that the trial court abused its discretion when it admitted labels affixed to prescription bottles, arguing the labels were both hearsay and not authenticated. Appellant contends, with respect to his authenticity argument, that the authentication requirement demands that there be \"evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question\n   is what its proponent claims[,]\" citing Evid.R. 901(A) in support. Appellant argues this requirement could not be satisfied because the State could not decide throughout trial whether the prescription labels were authentic or not, offering some witnesses who opined the prescriptions were filled at a pharmacy, but then arguing during closing arguments that the labels may have been printed by Appellant himself. Appellant further argues that the labels constituted hearsay, were offered for the truth of the matter asserted (the number of pills in each bottle), and not subject to a hearsay exception. Based upon the following, we reject Appellant's arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 24} \" 'The admission or exclusion of relevant evidence rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In analyzing the question before it, the\n   <em>\n    Agosta\n   </em>\n   court looked to its previous decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Taylor\n   </em>\n   , 5th Dist.

The\n   <em>\n    Agosta\n   </em>\n   court noted that in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   , it had previously stated as follows in holding that the references to the warning label did not constitute hearsay:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \" 'The prescription bottle was marked as evidence and received as Exhibit 8. T. at 191. During oral argument, appellant's counsel attempted to move for an App.R. 9(E) correction of the record. Counsel argued an objection was made to the prescription bottle's admission, but it was omitted from the record. Although defense counsel objected at each mention of the warning label, there is no specific assignment of error on the prescription bottle's admission into evidence; therefore, we find the App.R. 9(E) request to be irrelevant.' \"\n   <em>\n    Agosta\n   </em>\n   at \u00b636 ; quoting\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    Agosta\n   </em>\n   further noted the following reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \" 'The prescription bottle was seized during appellant's arrest and qualified as relevant and admissible evidence under Evid.R. 401.

As such, and based upon the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   , the court held the canisters that were seized during the arrest were admissible evidence under Evid.R. 401 and that testimony referencing the warning label on the canister did not constitute hearsay. The same reasoning applies here as Appellant has only assigned error related to the labels, and not admission of the prescription bottles themselves, which were found in the vehicle being driven by Appellant on the night of his arrest. Thus, we conclude that the prescription bottles and affixed labels are relevant, admissible and, we believe, also authenticated, by the fact they were found in Appellant's possession when he was arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 26} We further conclude that assuming arguendo the labels constitute hearsay, they are admissible under the business records exception to the hearsay rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

We further note that much like\n   <em>\n    Agosta\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   , Appellant's arguments involve the admission of the labels, not the bottles themselves, which were properly admitted as exhibits.

Specifically, based upon the record before us, we believe it was reasonable for the jury to conclude, based upon the reasonable inferences it was permitted to make, that Appellant was trafficking in oxycodone. For instance, the jury was presented with evidence that Appellant was driving a rented car that was not rented in his name, and which had an estimated return date of more than two weeks prior. The jury was also presented with evidence that in the thirty days the car had been rented, it had been driven nearly 10,000 miles. The jury was informed that Appellant did not have a valid driver's license,\n   but that he produced an identification card from the State of Florida.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Further, evidence was also presented to the jury indicating three prescription pill bottles were found in the vehicle Appellant was driving, all in Appellant's name and filled just two days prior from a pharmacy in Florida. The jury heard testimony from Sergeant Lehman that of 320 oxycodone pills collectively prescribed to Appellant according to the prescription labels, only 81 pills remained after just being filled just two days prior. Thus, 239 oxycodone pills were missing. Additionally, with regard to the third prescription, which was for Alprazolam, the jury heard testimony that of the 84 pills prescribed just two days prior, only 37 whole pills and 14 broken pills remained. The jury was presented with evidence that in addition to the number of pills missing from the prescription bottles found, law enforcement also found two cells phones in the vehicle and a large sum of cash on Appellant's person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Moreover, the jury listened to testimony by Sergeant Lehman that in his experience as a law enforcement officer and his work involving drug interdiction, it is common to see drugs coming into the State of Ohio from Florida, especially in vehicles rented in another person's name. Sergeant Lehman also testified regarding certain other drug interdiction factors that indicate drug trafficking, including having multiple cell phones and carrying large quantities of cash. He also testified that having broken pills is a drug interdiction factor indicative of drug trafficking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 36} We find, based on the evidence it had before it, that the jury could have reasonably inferred that Appellant was engaging in drug trafficking. Based upon the above evidence, the jury could reasonably infer that the reason Appellant only had 81 oxycodone pills remaining from a total of 320 prescribed just two days prior, was because he was trafficking in drugs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Westlake v.

Although the amount of drugs recovered are not necessarily indicative of drug trafficking, it is the amount of drugs missing from the prescription bottles which gives rise to a reasonable inference that the drugs were being trafficked, especially in light of the fact that the labels indicate the prescriptions were filled just two days prior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Common sense dictates that even if Appellant was using the drugs, he could not have possibly used the number of pills that were unaccounted for in a two day time span and still be living. Further, even though no charges were made with respect to the prescription for Alprazolam, the fact that several of those pills were also missing, along with the presence of several broken pills, is pertinent to a totality of the circumstances analysis. We conclude, based upon the evidence before it and the totality of the circumstances, the inferences made and conclusions reached by the jury are supported by the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Consequently, we find that the State presented sufficient evidence that, if believed, established that Appellant trafficked in oxycodone by transporting a controlled substance when he knew or had reasonable cause to believe that the controlled substance was intended for sale or resale by the offender or another person. Accordingly, Appellant's first assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 39} In his third assignment of error, Appellant contends that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to object to prosecutorial misconduct in closing argument, thus denying him his constitutional rights under the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.

Further, we have already noted that Appellant's conviction was based upon sufficient evidence. Based on the trial court's instructions, as well as the other evidence in the record which sufficiently supports Appellant's conviction, we cannot say that the prosecutors' statements made during closing argument, which were not objected to by defense counsel, changed the outcome of the trial. Nor can we conclude that but for counsel's errors, the result of the trial would have been different. Accordingly, we cannot conclude Appellant's trial counsel was ineffective.

All three labels stated that the prescriptions had been filled for Appellant at pharmacies in Florida roughly 48 hours before the traffic stop. The first bottle contained only 70 of 180 oxycodone pills; the second bottle contained only about 37 of 84 alprazolam pills; and the third bottle contained only 11 of 140 oxycodone pills. Appellant also had more than one cell phone and nearly two thousand dollars in cash in his pocket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 55} There were also several things about Appellant's situation that were consistent with someone trafficking in drugs. For example, Florida is a known source of oxycodone; and traffickers often transport drugs in rental cars. Records also confirmed that the car Appellant was driving had been driven nearly ten thousand miles since being rented on August 1, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {\u00b6 56} However, the State presented no evidence at trial from which a jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant transported his remaining oxycodone pills\n   <em>\n    when he knew or had reasonable cause to believe that the drug was intended for sale or resale.\n   </em>\n   For example, the State presented no evidence that the remaining pills were cut for sale, that Appellant possessed items to package the pills for sale (e.g., plastic baggies) or that Appellant's phones contained text messages about future sales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b6 57} Furthermore, the State did not present any evidence at trial that Appellant sold his missing oxycodone pills.

Specifically, the jury had to have inferred that Hill had been selling oxycodone based on the number of missing pills in the bottles and then inferred that he intended to sell his remaining oxycodone pills. Because no evidence exists in the record from which a\n   jury could infer that Appellant sold his missing pills, this inference \"was dependent\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   upon an established fact, but upon another inferential assumption\" and is therefore improper.
