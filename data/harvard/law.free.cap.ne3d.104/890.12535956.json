For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Local 1099 is an organization whose workers maintain public parks and malls and other public areas. In 2006, Local 1099 filed a grievance against the city, alleging that the city had violated the parties' collective bargaining agreement and prior settlement agreements by having a private contractor-Downtown Cleveland Alliance (\"DCA\") and/or Block by Block-perform work traditionally performed by the union. In 2008, the arbitrator determined that the city did, in fact, violate its collective bargaining agreement and letter of understanding with Local 1099, and the arbitrator ordered the city to pay \"reasonable and demonstrable lost back pay\" to bargaining unit members. The arbitrator retained jurisdiction for 60 days to resolve any issues arising from implementation of the award.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Thereafter, the city appealed the arbitrator's decision by filing with the trial court a motion to vacate the arbitrator's award. In its motion, the city argued that the arbitrator relied on external law, in violation of the collective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\"), the arbitrator improperly modified the grievance, and the arbitrator incorrectly found the creation of the \"Special Improvement District\" created a subcontract between the city and DCA and/ or Block by Block. The city argued in the alternative that the trial court should hold its proceedings in abeyance in order for the city to address the purported back pay and overtime damages during the period of time in which the arbitrator retained jurisdiction over this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The union then filed an application to confirm the arbitrator's award. The union also filed a motion to strike the city's motion to vacate, stating that the city failed to serve upon the union a copy of the city's motion pursuant to R.C. 2711.13. In February 2009, the trial court denied the city's motion to vacate the arbitration award and it granted the union's motion to confirm the award. The city appealed. In December 2009, this court affirmed the decision of the trial court, finding that the city failed to comply with the procedural requirements of R.C. 2711.13 and, therefore, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the city's motion to vacate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cleveland v. Laborers Internatl. Union Local 1099\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 92983,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009-Ohio-6313\">\n    2009-Ohio-6313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%204406081\">\n    2009 WL 4406081\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Following this court's 2009 decision, the union returned to the arbitrator with a request for a hearing on the back pay award. The parties agreed to submit briefs in lieu of an evidentiary hearing on back pay amounts, and the arbitrator agreed to accept the briefs for consideration. In May 2010, the union filed its brief on damages to the arbitrator, and the city filed a brief in opposition. In its opposition, the city challenged the arbitrator's jurisdiction to issue a supplemental award on damages in light of the trial court's order of February 2009 confirming the arbitrator's initial award of \"reasonable and demonstrable lost back pay.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On March 27, 2013, approximately three years after Local 1099 filed its brief on damages, the arbitrator issued his decision, finding he lacked jurisdiction to issue an additional award. In doing so, the arbitrator determined he was rendered \"functus officio\" following issuance and confirmation of the initial award and stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   As the confirmed award is final and thus unalterable, and the arbitrator functus officio, disputes as to whether remedies required under the award have been met are necessarily submitted to litigation if they cannot be grieved under the agreement. In any case, litigation of the present matter seems likely, irrespective of any additional remedy award issued by this arbitrator.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On June 28, 2013, the union filed with the trial court a motion to show cause or alternative post-judgment motion to determine reasonable and demonstrable lost back pay. In its motion, Local 1099 requested the trial court issue an order requiring the city to show cause why it should not be found in contempt for refusing to pay \"reasonable and demonstrable\" back pay. Alternatively, the union requested the trial court, pursuant to Civ.R. 69, issue a post-judgment order setting the amount of \"reasonable and demonstrable\" back pay in the amount of $309,797.86.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The city responded, denying it was violating the arbitrator's decision, and it moved to dismiss the union's complaint for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Three additional years later, on December 16, 2016, the trial court issued an order stating that it \"reviewed the Laborer's Local 1099's motion to show cause or alternative post-judgment motion to determine reasonable and demonstrable lost back pay, briefs in opposition, various motions filed by both parties in furtherance of their arguments, exhibits, affidavits, and all pleadings,\" and it awarded the union $309,797.86 in \"reasonable and demonstrable lost back pay\" as well as prejudgment interest from May 23, 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Assignments of Error\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The city now appeals the trial court's 2016 decision, assigning two errors for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   I. The trial court erred in awarding damages as it lacked jurisdiction to modify the underlying arbitration award.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   II. The trial court abused its discretion in awarding $309,797.86 in \"reasonable and demonstrable lost back pay\" as damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Law and Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 10} In its first assignment of error, the city contends that the trial court\n   lacked jurisdiction to modify the arbitrator's award of \"reasonable and demonstrable lost back pay\" and therefore the court erred in awarding damages not stated in the arbitrator's initial award. In support, the city cites to R.C. Chapter 2711 and argues that the trial court's awarded sum of $309,797.86 was an improper modification of the arbitrator's award. The city further argues that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding the back pay because (1) the union cannot show that the DCA performed services that have been \"traditionally and exclusively\" performed by members of Local 1099, and (2) the union cannot establish that its members lost wages and overtime opportunities because of the work performed by DCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 11} In response, the union contends that the trial court had jurisdiction to monetize the arbitrator's award of \"reasonable and demonstrable\" back pay as part of its February 2009 order confirming the arbitrator's award. The union provides that the trial court's general jurisdiction under Civ.R. 69 to entertain execution proceedings supports its position. The union further provides that the trial court's December 2016 award is supported by the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Arbitration procedures are governed by R.C. Chapter 2711. And R.C. 2711.09 through 2711.14 provide the only procedures for challenges to, or arguments in support of, an arbitrator's decision.\n   <em>\n    Strnad v.

In considering Local 1099's motion to show cause or alternative post-judgment motion to determine \"reasonable and demonstrable lost back pay,\" reviewing the parties' briefs and responses, examining the evidence, and awarding the union $309,797.86, the trial court did not improperly modify the arbitrator's award of \"reasonable and demonstrable lost back pay.\" Rather, the court exercised its authority to issue orders pursuant to the rules of civil procedure and its inherent power to interpret and enforce a judgment of the court. Such action was necessary to provide meaning and effect to the judgment and ensure that litigation progresses toward final resolution.

We therefore review the record for \"some evidence\" supporting the trial court's award of $309,797.86 in \"reasonable and demonstrable lost back pay.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Before entering judgment, the trial court considered the union's motion to show cause or alternative post-judgment motion to determine reasonable and demonstrable lost back pay, briefs in opposition, various motions filed by both parties, exhibits, affidavits, and \"all pleadings.\" Considering this matter has been in litigation in some form or another since the union filed its initial grievance in 2006, the record is considerable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Specifically, the trial court considered the union's \"damages brief\" attached to the union's motion to show cause/post-judgment motion, which was initially prepared for the arbitrator's consideration and in lieu of an evidentiary hearing on \"reasonable and demonstrable lost back pay.\" This brief identified documentation received in response to a subpoena served upon Block by Block, which included time cards of employees and/or volunteers who worked on public areas maintained by the city \"from May 23, 2006 to present,\" payroll records of these workers, a list of all employees who worked on the public areas, and \"any documents describing where and what type of work the employees and/or volunteers performed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Additionally, on November 23, 2015, the union filed a notice of supplemental filings to its motion to show cause/post-judgment motion, which included Excel spreadsheets summarizing the payroll data produced by Block by Block, along with a CD containing all documents produced by Block by Block; arbitration transcripts\n   from 2007 and 2008 concerning the initial grievance that contained evidence of the duties performed by Block by Block that was purportedly historically performed by Local 1099; and information from the Ohio Department of Taxation concerning how to calculate interest from 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 38} These documents produced by Block by Block included the total number of hours the members of the Block by Block's \"Clean Team\" worked on public property owned or maintained by the city as 11,763.25 hours. They also included the hours the relevant members of the Clean Team worked during each applicable period: 3,818.75 hours in 2006; 5,544.50 hours in 2007; and 2,400 hours in 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Local 1099's damages brief also included the union's wage sheets, which contained the wages for bargaining unit classifications for 2006 through 2008.

For the ground maintenance worker, straight time is listed as $16.41 (2006), $16.75 (2007), and $17.09 (2008); and overtime pay is $24.61 (2006), $25.12 (2007), and $25.64 (2008). For the real estate maintenance worker, straight time is listed as $17.25 (2006), $17.60 (2007), and $17.95 (2008); and overtime pay is $25.87 (2006), $26.40 (2007), and $26.93 (2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Based upon our review of the record, including the documentation discussed above, we find there is \"some evidence\" in the record that demonstrates the work performed by Block by Block, the total number of hours that members of Block by Block worked, and the wages attributed to the relevant members of the union during the applicable time period. We therefore conclude that the trial court did not error in awarding Local 1099 \"reasonable and demonstrable lost back pay\" in the amount of $309,797.86, because there is \"some evidence\" supporting the trial court's determination.
