In 2014, a judge of the Superior Court (first judge) allowed the university's Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=365%20Mass.%20754\">\n    365 Mass. 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1974), motion to dismiss CPA's claims alleging breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and a claim to enforce the contract in equity. In 2015, a different Superior Court judge (summary judgment judge) ordered the entry of summary judgment pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(d),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=365%20Mass.%20824\">\n    365 Mass. 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1974), on three more of CPA's claims, but allowed CPA's claim for a violation of G. L. c. 93A to go to trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2016, the university again moved for summary judgment on the remaining claim for a violation of c. 93A, and CPA filed a cross motion for leave to amend its complaint to conform to the evidence adduced during discovery. A third Superior Court judge (third judge) denied both motions. In October of 2016, a bench trial commenced on CPA's claim for a violation of c. 93A. On the fourth day of trial, CPA moved to amend its complaint pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 15(b),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=365%20Mass.%20761\">\n    365 Mass. 761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1974), which was summarily denied. Following the conclusion of trial, judgment entered in favor of the university.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   CPA now appeals, arguing that (1) the first judge erred by allowing in part the university's motion to dismiss, (2) the third judge and the trial judge abused their discretion by denying CPA's motions for leave to amend its complaint, and (3) the judgment on CPA's claim for a violation of c. 93A claim was clearly erroneous.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Motion to dismiss\n   </em>\n   .

CPA's dismissed claims relate to a joint venture agreement between CPA and the university for land adjacent to the university's campus. In 1998, the university approached CPA with a proposal to create a joint venture to purchase development rights from CPA. The university requested that CPA obtain title to a parcel from the Boston Redevelopment Authority\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (BRA) and then sell all interest in that parcel to the university so that the university could build a parking garage. In 1999, the parties reduced this agreement to writing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Included within the agreement is a provision detailing a separate future joint venture for another parcel of land titled parcel 18-3A.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaint alleges, and we accept as true, that the parcel 18-3A provision was an integral part of the over-all agreement for the garage parcel. Following closing, the university paid CPA a price below fair market value for the garage parcel, but never entered into the contemplated second joint venture agreement for parcel 18-3A. In 2007, the university independently submitted an amended development plan to the BRA in which it represented the existence of a partnership with CPA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Within these plans, the university included a proposal to build a dormitory on parcel 18-3A. Following BRA approval, the university built the proposed dormitory on parcel 18-3A, which was ultimately completed in 2009. The university never paid CPA rent, a capital contribution, or a purchase price for parcel 18-3A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   To survive a motion to dismiss on a breach of contract claim, the plaintiff must establish (1) an oral or written agreement, express or implied, (2) supported by valid consideration; (3) the plaintiff was ready, willing, and able to perform; (4) breach by the defendant; and (5) damage to the plaintiff. See\n   <em>\n    Singarella\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Boston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3856815\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/342/385/#p387\">\n    342 Mass. 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 387 (1961). CPA argues that the unambiguous language contained in the agreement created a contract that the university breached when it failed to compensate CPA for developing parcel 18-3A. See\n   <em>\n    Targus Group Intl., Inc\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Sherman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836388\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/76/421/#p428\">\n    76 Mass.

App. Ct. 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 116 (1989). Rather, we interpret the agreement de novo to determine if CPA's complaint alleged claims upon which relief could be granted. See\n   <em>\n    Blank\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Chelmsford Ob/Gyn, P.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"826224\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/420/404/#p408\">\n    420 Mass. 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 408 (1995) (contract claim properly dismissed pursuant to rule 12 [b][6] where, accepting plaintiff's allegations as true, defendant acted within contractual rights in terminating her).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Generally, \"[a]n agreement to reach an agreement is a contradiction in terms and imposes no obligation on the parties thereto.\"\n   <em>\n    Rosenfield\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States Trust Co\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"493995\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/290/210/#p217\">\n    290 Mass. 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 217 (1935). However, \"[i]t is not required that all terms of the agreement be precisely specified, and the presence of undefined or unspecified terms will not necessarily preclude the formation of a binding contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Situation Mgmt.

In such a case, if the parties \"specify formulae and procedures that, although contingent on future events, provide mechanisms to narrow present uncertainties to rights and obligations, their agreement is binding.\"\n   <em>\n    Lafayette Place Assocs\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Boston Redev.

App. Ct. 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 169-170 (1997).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When conducting a de novo review of the unambiguous language in the parcel 18-3A provision, we fail to find the necessary formulae and procedures to fill the omitted material terms that CPA argues bind the university to an enforceable contract. Here, the express language of the provision only obligates the parties to \"commence negotiations\" toward reaching an agreement for parcel 18-3A upon closing of the garage parcel. The provision, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Lafayette Place Assocs\n   </em>\n   . or\n   <em>\n    Hastings Assocs\n   </em>\n   ., does not give a party an automatic right to enter into a joint venture agreement, provide a mechanism for resolving omitted terms, or even state what basic form the considered joint venture will take. In fact, the provision itself contemplates that agreement on material terms may never be reached by limiting negotiations to a six-month window unless mutually extended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   CPA argues that despite its plain language, affirmative obligations must be read into the parcel 18-3A provision because of the importance the parties placed on it during negotiations for the entire agreement. We agree that \"[t]he judicial bias is toward interpreting a contract 'so as to make it a valid and enforceable undertaking rather than one of no force and effect.' \"\n   <em>\n    Finn\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McNeil\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3993392\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/23/367/#p372\">\n    23 Mass. App. Ct. 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 372 (1987), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Shayeb\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Holland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"499975\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/321/429/#p432\">\n    321 Mass. 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 432 (1947). However, \"[t]he court cannot make for the parties a contract which they did not make for themselves.\"\n   <em>\n    Read\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McKeague\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"746261\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/252/162/#p164\">\n    252 Mass. 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 164 (1925). Accordingly, given the plain language, the parcel 18-3A provision is merely an unenforceable agreement to reach an agreement and the judge properly dismissed the breach of contract claim on the ground that it failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Schaer\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Brandeis Univ\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"285288\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/432/474/#p477\">\n    432 Mass. 474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 477-478 (2000). Because there must first be a binding contract to bring a claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, it also was proper to dismiss that claim. See\n   <em>\n    Eigerman\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Putnam Invs., Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3777474\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/450/281/#p288\">\n    450 Mass. 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 288 (2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   CPA also argues that even if its contractual claims fail, it should be able to enforce in equity the agreement to reach an agreement. Whether CPA's equity claim sounds in quasi-contract or estoppel, the judge properly dismissed it for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Here, there is an actual written instrument stating the obligations, or lack thereof, of the parties. See\n   <em>\n    Popponesset Beach Assn\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Marchillo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1040804\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/39/586/#p592\">\n    39 Mass. App. Ct. 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 592 (1996) (\"[I]mplied-in-fact contract comes into being when, notwithstanding the absence of a written agreement ... expressing mutual obligations, the conduct or relations of the parties imply the existence of a contract\"). Alternatively, CPA sought to estop the university from asserting that it did not enter into an enforceable joint venture agreement for parcel 18-3A. However, promissory estoppel requires that the party invoking it must have reasonably relied on the alleged promise to the party's detriment.\n   <em>\n    Rhode Island Hosp. Trust Natl. Bank\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Varadian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"823663\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/419/841/#p849\">\n    419 Mass. 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 849-850 (1995). Here, where the terms of the alleged promise are unambiguously indefinite, CPA had nothing more than a well-founded hope that a future joint venture agreement would come to fruition. Thus, where the university did not make a sufficiently definite promise, any reliance on the part of CPA was too unreasonable to give rise to a valid estoppel claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"823663\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/419/841/#p849\">\n     Ibid\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"823663\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/419/841/#p849\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Motions for leave to amend the complaint\n   </em>\n   .

App. Ct. 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 390 (2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   First, CPA contends that the third judge impermissibly deferred to the partial judgment entered on CPA's three dismissed claims. See\n   <em>\n    Goulet\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Whitin Mach.

While we agree that a judge is not permitted to merely defer to a prior judgment dismissing a complaint when ruling on a motion to amend, we find no abuse of discretion when a plaintiff's amendment would be futile. See\n   <em>\n    Doherty\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3845368\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/80/104/#p112\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3845368\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/80/104/#p112\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Here, CPA argues that the survival clause in the agreement was ignored by both the first and third judges and its consideration would have allowed CPA to state a valid claim for breach of contract. As observed in note 5\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , such a survival clause, though inconsistent with the six-month expiration clause, does not create an enforceable contract. Accordingly, any motion to amend the complaint to highlight such a clause would be futile. See\n   <em>\n    ibid\n   </em>\n   . We find no abuse of discretion in the third judge's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   CPA also argues that the trial judge abused her discretion when she denied CPA's motion for leave to amend its complaint to conform to the evidence during trial pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 15(b). \"[I]t is well-settled that prejudice to the non-moving party is the touchstone for the denial of an amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    Hamed\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Fadili\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3889915\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/408/100/#p105\">\n    408 Mass. 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 105 (1990), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Goulet\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3795024\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/399/547/#p552\">\n    399 Mass. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   550 n.3. \"[T]he timing of such a motion is a factor that may be considered by the judge in ruling on the motion.\"\n   <em>\n    Herbert A.

Here, we find no abuse of discretion when CPA moved to amend two years after the breach of contract claim was dismissed, nine months after summary judgment narrowed the issue solely to the claim for a violation of c. 93A, and four days into trial. From filing its complaint in 2013 until the start of trial, CPA had nearly four years to amend its complaint, which included the summary judgment judge's clear invitation to do so in his memorandum of decision and order. Finally, nothing at trial suggests that the university expressly or implicitly consented to trial of a breach of contract claim and adding such a claim would have severely prejudiced the university.

Aside from its claim under c. 93A, CPA did not bring a claim sounding in fraud or tortious interference, and the BRA was not a party below. For the reasons stated in note 2 of the memorandum of decision on the university's motion to dismiss, we agree that this alleged fact does not allow CPA's claims to survive dismissal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    CPA argues that the survival clause of the provision requires a reading that the mutual obligation between CPA and the university to \"commence negotiations\" must apply indefinitely. Such a reading ignores the two clauses that come immediately before and after the survival language which expressly contemplate never reaching an agreement.
