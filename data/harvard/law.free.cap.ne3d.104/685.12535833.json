Northrup,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and his wife and children, then brought this negligence action against the theater and its parent companies, alleging that their failure to provide police details on the theater premises proximately caused Northrup's injuries. A Superior Court judge allowed the defendants' motion for summary judgment, concluding that the stabbing was not reasonably foreseeable, and the plaintiffs appeal. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . We summarize the undisputed facts, reserving certain details for later discussion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The stabbing\n   </em>\n   . Shortly before 10:00 P.M. on Tuesday, September 6, 2011, Northrup pulled into the theater parking lot with plans to meet a friend for a movie. After parking along the east side of the theater, Northrup sat in his vehicle with the engine running and smoked a cigarette. There was no security presence in the parking lot.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Chantha Chau, who had parked his own vehicle in the adjacent hotel parking lot, approached Northrup and motioned through the window, indicating that he wanted a cigarette. As Northrup leaned to retrieve one, Chau suddenly stabbed him in the neck through the partially opened window. Northrup managed to escape out the front passenger door, but Chau pursued him and stabbed him again, this time in the stomach. Northrup sought refuge inside the theater, as Chau drove away in Northrup's vehicle. Surveillance video showed that the encounters inside and outside the vehicle lasted four and six seconds, respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Several months later Chau was indicted on multiple charges relating to the stabbing and the theft of Northrup's vehicle. After a jury-waived trial, a Superior Court judge found Chau guilty of the charges. The judge found that, although the evidence was \"overwhelming\" that \"Chau suffers from a mental disease or defect, either schizophrenia or a psychosis not otherwise specified,\" the Commonwealth had still met its burden of proving that he was criminally responsible for his actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Prior incidents at the theater\n   </em>\n   . In the three years preceding the stabbing, there were thirty police reports arising from incidents at the theater, three of which resulted in arrests. Only one referred to violence against a person: a woman reported (in 2010) that she had been sexually assaulted inside the theater sometime in the 1970s. Otherwise, the majority of the reports involved property crimes -- primarily vehicle break-ins and thefts of personal items -- while the remainder involved public intoxication, domestic incidents (verbal disputes and incidental violation of a restraining order), discovery of a missing person, harassing telephone calls, a disturbance (youths breaking bottles), and indecent exposure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The theater also generated seventy-one internal incident reports during the three-year look-back period. Many of those incidents concerned noncriminal activity, such as accidental injuries to patrons. Four reports referred to violence against a person; most pertinent is a report of an altercation that occurred in February of 2011 between two groups of juveniles.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   As reflected in that report, a woman called the theater claiming that her sons attended a movie the previous night and had rocks thrown at them as they were leaving. She further claimed that a fight \"ensued when kids surrounded [her sons'] car,\" punches were thrown, and \"[o]ne of the kids ... pulled out [a] knife.\" The woman said her sons \"were fine\" and, when offered free movie passes, \"seemed more excited about getting those than talking about her sons anymore.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . We review the allowance of a motion for summary judgment de novo, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.

To prevail on a negligence claim, the plaintiffs must prove the existence of a legal duty owed to them by the defendants, a breach of that duty, and injury proximately caused by the breach.

Specifically, where, as here, the crime involves violence against a person, liability may attach \"in the rare cases 'in which a person legally on the premises is attacked, and the owner or landlord knew of or should have known of both ... previous attacks ... and the potential for a recurrence based on a failure to take measures to make the premises safer.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   ., quoting from\n   <em>\n    Griffiths\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"274595\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/425/31/#p34\">\n    425 Mass. at 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The \"outer limits\" of reasonable foreseeability are therefore appropriate to resolve on summary judgment and, indeed, \"have been long defined by judges.\"\n   <em>\n    McLaughlin\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Vinios\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1040802\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/39/5/#p9\">\n    39 Mass. App. Ct. 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 9 (1995).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Applying these principles here, we conclude that summary judgment was properly granted for the defendants. Though there is evidence in the record of nonviolent crimes, mainly property crimes, occurring on the theater premises, there is no evidence of prior stabbings or similar violent incidents. The only incident involving a deadly weapon -- the fight between the two groups of juveniles -- was never reported to the police, nor even was it reported to the theater on the night it occurred. In any event, we do not think that one alleged incident of a fight between youths supports a finding that the defendants should have reasonably foreseen the sudden and unprovoked act of violence committed by Chau.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Our conclusion comports with a settled line of case law. Particularly instructive is\n   <em>\n    Luisi\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Foodmaster Supermkts., Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"235570\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/50/575/#p576\">\n    50 Mass.

In support of her claim, the plaintiff proffered evidence of previous violent incidents inside the store -- fistfights between customers, a beating of the store manager by a mentally ill person, and a threat made to one of the cashiers -- as well as evidence that a number of armed robberies, property crimes, and assaults had occurred in the parking lot and vicinity of the mall in which the store was located.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"235570\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/50/575/#p576\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"235570\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/50/575/#p576\">\n    . at 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It is undisputed, however, that the majority of the incidents occurred inside the hotel and bar, and, according to the Woburn police chief, the activity never \"leaked\" to the theater, which has a separate parking lot. Rather, he explained, \"[t]he only place anything leaked ... [was] to the back of the parking lot of the hotel that was pretty self-contained.\" Given his testimony, and the absence of any other evidence showing that these incidents had any spillover effect, we have no basis to conclude that the defendants \"should have known of\" them.\n   <em>\n    Griffiths\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"274595\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/425/31/#p34\">\n    425 Mass. at 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

During the three-year look-back period, there were seventy-five reported incidents at the hotel and bar, sixteen resulting in arrests. The majority involved nonviolent offenses, primarily property crimes. There were about a dozen incidents that might be considered crimes against a person, most of which involved simple assault between parties known to each other or between bar patrons. Only two reports referred to the possible use of a dangerous weapon, and both were unsubstantiated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Like the incidents at the theater, these incidents were too dissimilar in kind, or the reports too inconclusive, to support a finding that the defendants should have foreseen Chau's random act of violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The plaintiffs also claim that an affidavit they submitted from a security expert was enough to send the case to the jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree. The expert opines, in conclusory terms, that the prior incidents at and around the theater -- most significantly, the fight between the two groups of juveniles -- made it \"reasonable to have anticipated a violent event occurring on the property.\" This opinion runs counter to the cases discussed above, which again resolve foreseeability as a question of law. As the Supreme Judicial Court stated in\n   <em>\n    Griffiths\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"274595\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/425/31/#p34\">\n    425 Mass. at 35-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \"[t]here must be limits to the scope or definition of reasonable foreseeability based on considerations of policy and pragmatic judgment\" (quotation omitted). The court therefore held that the defendants were entitled to judgment notwithstanding the verdict despite testimony from the plaintiff's expert that the defendants violated their duty of care by not taking reasonable steps to prevent illegal activity on the premises. See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"274595\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/425/31/#p34\">\n     id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"274595\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/425/31/#p34\">\n    . at 32-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We likewise conclude that the expert affidavit in this case did not preclude the entry of summary judgment for the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Finally, the plaintiffs argue that the existence or absence of prior crimes is not conclusive of the question of foreseeability. But while that is true as a general proposition, see\n   <em>\n    Whittaker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"480512\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/418/196/#p197\">\n    418 Mass. at 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the plaintiffs have pointed to no other evidence -- such as an admission, see\n   <em>\n    Mullins\n   </em>\n   , 389 Mass. at 55, or actual knowledge that the assailant was armed, see\n   <em>\n    Flood\n   </em>\n   , 416 Mass. at 73 -- suggesting that Chau's crime was reasonably foreseeable. Instead, the plaintiffs claim that, irrespective of any prior crimes, the defendants should be held liable if they could have reasonably foreseen that eliminating police details would place theater patrons \"at a greater risk of being victimized.\" This exceedingly broad formulation, which comes close to strict liability, finds no support in the case law. \"The possibility of criminal conduct occurring is present in almost every aspect of daily life.

For this reason we should \"not place the burden of all harm caused by random violent criminal conduct on the owner of the property where the harmful act occurred, without proof that the landowner knew or had reason to know of a threat to the safety of persons lawfully on the premises against which the landowner could have taken reasonable preventive steps.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"480512\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/418/196/#p197\">\n     Ibid\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"480512\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/418/196/#p197\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Here, Chau's sudden and unprovoked attack on Northrup was not within the scope of foreseeable risk as a matter of law.
