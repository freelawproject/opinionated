Taylor and Brian M. Hurley, as trustees of Taylor Realty Trust.\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-6\">\n   The defendant trust claims a prescriptive easement across the plaintiff's property. After a bench trial in this declaratory judgment action brought by the plaintiff, a judge of the Land Court found the trust had failed to show that its use of the land was notorious, as is required for establishment of such an easement. We affirm the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . Steamboat Landing\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (the property) is a remote, undeveloped, cliffside parcel in Aquinnah, on Martha's Vineyard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is owned by the plaintiff, Martha's Vineyard Land Bank Commission (Land Bank), which acquired it in 2011. The property overlooks the ocean to the north. It is most directly accessible only by a path that connects to various paths and driveways traversing other lots. The property is entirely covered in thick vegetation, except for the single, narrow path that cuts through the property from its southwest corner to the cliff's edge. From the property, a secluded portion of a town-owned beach is accessible by clambering down the rocky cliff-approximately a thirty-foot descent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Taylor Realty Trust (the trust) owns a parcel of land on Lighthouse Road\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   in Aquinnah. Situated on the trust's land is the Outermost Inn, an inn and restaurant owned and operated by defendant trustees Hugh and Jeanne Taylor (Taylors).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Steamboat Landing is less than a ten-minute walk through the woods from the inn. From the time the inn opened for business in 1990 until the date of trial,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   its paying guests\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   traversed a wooded path from the inn to Steamboat Landing, and then used the path over Steamboat Landing to access the cliff and the beach below it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   This use was regular, but minimal and brief-typically consisting of each guest walking across the path to get to the beach in the morning, and returning later in the day.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   It only takes a minute or two to cross the entire length of Steamboat Landing and reach the top of the cliff. Persons using the path are not visible from the nearest public and private ways, or from any nearby residence or the inn. Both entrances to the Steamboat Landing path-at the southwest corner of the property and at the top of the cliff-are inconspicuous.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The judge found that although the Taylors occasionally trim the edge of the Steamboat Landing path, the trimming is not obvious and does not noticeably change its appearance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   At the crux of this appeal is the trial judge's finding that \"a reasonably diligent owner of Steamboat Landing would not have discovered that the Taylors and their guests used the Steamboat Landing path for access to the beach because the character of the land obscured their use.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   .

Moreover, there was testimony that the Taylors did nothing to hide their guests' use of the Steamboat Landing path, and actively encouraged it. Despite the frequency and openness of the that use, however, the trial judge found it was undetectable to the Land Bank for a number of reasons, including the remoteness of the property, the obscurity of the path itself, the very short length of time it takes to traverse the path across the property, and the fact that use of the path did not appear to alter its appearance in any readily observable way. The judge also found that the beach can be reached by other means and, thus, there is no way to tell whether those using it at any given time arrived via the path across Steamboat Landing. Moreover, he found that although the Taylors have not attempted to conceal the inn's (and their own) use of the path, \"they have not made it obvious either.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"The extent of openness and notoriety necessary for the acquirement of title by adverse use varies with the character of the land.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Tinker\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bessel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"839814\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/213/74/#p76\">\n    213 Mass. 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 76 (1912).
