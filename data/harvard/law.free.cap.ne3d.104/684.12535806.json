McGrath, was tragically shot and killed after the defendants, police officers in the town of Plymouth, attempted to stop the vehicle he was driving on the streets of Plymouth in the early morning hours of January 10, 2006. The plaintiff filed suit in Federal court, asserting, insofar as relevant here, that the defendants had used excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The defendants obtained summary judgment, and on appeal that judgment was affirmed, on the ground that the conduct of the officer who fired the fatal shot was objectively reasonable and thus did not violate the Fourth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    McGrath\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Tavares\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4125617\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/757/20/#p25\">\n    757 F.3d 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 25-29 (1st Cir. 2014), cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12587236,12587237,12587238,12587239,12587240,12587241\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1183/\">\n    135 S. Ct. 1183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). The plaintiff then filed this wrongful death action in Superior Court. On the defendants' motion, a judge dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted, ruling that issue preclusion barred the plaintiff from proving her claims. The plaintiff appeals. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   .

For present purposes it suffices to reiterate the court's conclusion that in firing four shots, \"Officer Tavares's use of deadly force was objectively reasonable because a reasonable officer in the same circumstances could have believed Anthony posed a threat of (at the very least) serious physical harm to his person when [Tavares] fired shots one and two, and an identical threat to Officer Almeida when [Tavares] fired shots three and four.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4125617\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/757/20/#p25\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4125617\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/757/20/#p25\">\n    . at 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"As in other Fourth Amendment contexts ... the 'reasonableness' inquiry in an excessive force case is an objective one: the question is whether the officers' actions are 'objectively reasonable' in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them, without regard to their underlying intent or motivation.\"\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   v.

L. c. 229, \u00a7 2(2). One count asserted that the defendants had engaged in \"wanton or reckless\" conduct, in \"intentional disregard of the ... high degree of probability that substantial harm, or even death, would result.\" The other count asserted that the defendants had engaged in \"intentional and wrongful misconduct\" that was \"intended to injure, harm and kill\" Anthony. The defendants moved to dismiss on issue preclusion grounds, arguing that the Federal court determination of the objective reasonableness of their conduct meant that the plaintiff could not prevail on her wrongful death claims. The motion judge agreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Issue preclusion\n   </em>\n   . \"Whether a Federal court judgment precludes a State-[law]-based action in the Commonwealth is a question governed by Federal common law.\"\n   <em>\n    Alves\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Massachusetts State Police\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461267\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/90/822/#p824\">\n    90 Mass.

Instead, she argues that that issue is irrelevant to her State wrongful death claims, which, she contends, turn on the defendants' subjective intent and motivation-issues that were not determined in the Federal litigation. We examine each of her wrongful death claims in light of this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As to the claim asserting that the defendants engaged in wanton or reckless conduct, the judge observed that although recklessness may be proved on either subjective or objective theories, both theories require proof that a defendant acted or failed to act in circumstances creating a risk that was \"an unreasonable one under the circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    National R.R. Passenger Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3783834\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/446/540/#p546\">\n    446 Mass. 540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 546-547 (2006), quoting from Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 500 comment a (1965). The judge concluded that the reasonableness of the risk of death posed by Tavares's conduct was previously determined in the Federal action and could not be relitigated here. Accordingly, the plaintiff could not succeed on her claim that the defendants had acted recklessly or wantonly.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiff insists that her claim requires proof of the defendants' subjective motives and state of mind. But she fails to address the additional requirement stated in\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   and relied upon by the judge: that, to prove reckless conduct, she must show that the defendants' conduct was unreasonable under the circumstances. She has not identified any error in the judge's reasoning, and we see none.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As to the claim asserting that the defendants engaged in intentional misconduct\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   that was \"intended to injure, harm and kill\" Anthony, the judge concluded that the defendants had a valid claim of self-defense. The judge relied on the statement in\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4272505\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/460/80/\">\n    460 Mass. 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011), that a claim of self-defense depends, in part, on whether \"the degree of force used was reasonable in the circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4272505\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/460/80/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4272505\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/460/80/\">\n    . at 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Franchino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"511557\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/61/367/#p368\">\n    61 Mass. App. Ct. 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 368-369 (2004). Reasoning that self-defense \"is assessed by the objective standard utilized by the [Federal court] in resolving [the plaintiff's] civil rights claim,\" the judge concluded that the preclusive effect of the Federal judgment defeated the plaintiff's ability to prove intentional wrongful death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiff's brief does not mention self-defense, let alone discuss its various elements. She does not acknowledge or address the judge's reasoning in any way. She merely insists that \"an essential element of proof in [her] intentional wrongful death claims is evidence of the actors' subjective motives, intent, and state of mind.\" But even if such evidence is\n   <em>\n    necessary\n   </em>\n   to her case, she fails to make any argument as to how such evidence could be\n   <em>\n    sufficient\n   </em>\n   to overcome the fact-established in the Federal litigation-that the defendants' conduct was objectively reasonable. Issues not argued are waived.
