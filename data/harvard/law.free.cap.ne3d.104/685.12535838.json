General Laws c. 266, \u00a7 16A, as amended by St. 1966, c. 408, provides that \"[w]hoever in the nighttime or daytime breaks and enters a ... vehicle with intent to commit a misdemeanor shall be punished ....\" Here, as noted,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the defendant contests only the element of \"intent to commit a misdemeanor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   At trial, the victim testified that, at 2:00 P.M. on April 12, 2015, he was standing in his kitchen looking out of the window overlooking his driveway, when he saw the defendant leaning into the open window of his daughter's car; the defendant's head and chest were inside the car, which was parked in the driveway some thirty feet from the roadway. Initially the victim thought the person could be his daughter's friend, who might have left something in the car from the night before and was merely stopping by to pick it up. However, when he realized there was no other car or bike in the driveway-only the defendant holding a skateboard-he concluded, \"it just seemed, okay, this is not normal.\" When the victim went out into the driveway and confronted him, the defendant stated that he had not leaned into the car, rather, he was merely using the driveway to turn around.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   At trial, the defendant reiterated that he had entered the driveway (an upward slope) for the purpose of slowing, or stopping, his \"longboard\" skateboard near the bottom of the steep hill he was descending.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   He testified that it \"was really the only way to stop.\" The defendant also insisted that, when he executed his turn, he did not touch either of the two cars parked in the victim's driveway, nor did he reach any part of his body into the daughter's car. The defendant maintained that he was not in the driveway for very long before the victim came out of the house; by that time, he testified, he had already made his turn and his back was toward the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A reasonable jury could have found this evidence sufficient to prove that the defendant had reached into the car, intending to commit the crime of larceny. \"A person's knowledge or intent is a matter of fact, which is often not susceptible of proof by direct evidence, so resort is frequently made to proof by inference from all the facts and circumstances developed at the trial .... The inferences drawn by the jury need only be reasonable and possible and need not be necessary or inescapable.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"235437\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/50/730/#p735\">\n    50 Mass.

Here, the defendant's intent to steal may be inferred from the fact that he \"leaned\" his head and chest into the car through the open passenger window and, when confronted, offered no explanation for his behavior, but, rather, insisted that he had not \"reached into any cars that were in the driveway,\" but merely turned around in the driveway. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Shedd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"764079\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/140/451/#p453\">\n    140 Mass. 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 453 (1886) (\"There was evidence tending to prove that the defendant broke and opened the windows, which was the act alleged to have been done in the attempt to commit the burglary; and the jury might well have inferred, from the circumstances attending the act, and from the conduct and declarations of the defendant, that the act was done for the purpose of stealing\").

App. Ct. 901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 903 (1991). Although the defendant here offered contradicting evidence, the weight of the evidence was for the jury to determine.

That is, the jury reasonably could have concluded that the evidence was sufficient to prove that the defendant intended a larceny, albeit a misdemeanor, when he reached into the open window of the car while it was parked in the driveway of the victim's home.
