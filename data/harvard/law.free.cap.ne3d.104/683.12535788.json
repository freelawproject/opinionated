He appeals from that conviction and the denial of his motion for new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . Before trial, the defendant moved to suppress certain evidence. The motion was denied. During trial, on the basis of certain trial testimony that the defendant argued was in conflict with the evidence presented at the suppression hearing, the defendant moved to renew the suppression motion, pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 13(a)(5), as appearing in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=442%20Mass.%201516\">\n    442 Mass. 1516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). The trial judge referred the motion to renew to the motion judge; the motion was denied. After trial, the defendant moved for a new trial, which motion was denied. On appeal the defendant argues that his motion to suppress and his motion to renew should have been allowed, that certain errors occurred at trial, and that his motion for new trial should have been granted. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <em>\n    Facts from hearing on motion to suppress\n   </em>\n   . We summarize the facts found by the motion judge after the evidentiary hearing on the defendant's motion to suppress and supplement these findings with uncontested evidence from the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On July 18, 2011, at approximately 7:00 P.M. , Officer Richard Fucci of the Lynn police department was conducting surveillance in the area of Western Avenue and Ida Street, known as a high crime area where many drug offenses and crimes of violence had taken place. Fucci testified that he had made numerous drug arrests in this area and that the Prime Gas Station is a common place for drug transactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Fucci observed a red Dodge motor vehicle back into a parking space at the gas station. The driver of the Dodge, later identified as the defendant, did not exit the vehicle; instead, he appeared to be looking around while in the vehicle. The defendant then drove out of the parking lot, traveled about 100 feet, and parked in front of 19 Camden Street where he continued to look around.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Fucci called for backup and was joined on the scene by Officer Michael Kelter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The officers observed the defendant make a brief telephone call; then they saw a green Ford vehicle travel down Camden Street and stop across from the defendant's Dodge. The defendant then exited the Dodge and got into the Ford through the front passenger door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After running the Ford's license plate, Fucci drove up alongside the vehicle with the nose of his unmarked cruiser facing toward the nose of the Ford; Kelter pulled in behind the Ford. The officers did not activate their vehicles' lights or sirens. The Ford was not blocked in, and could have proceeded forward. Fucci then approached the driver while Kelter approached the defendant, who was still in the front passenger seat. As Fucci identified himself as \"Lynn Police,\" he observed a large quantity of cash and an empty plastic bag on the center console of the vehicle. Fucci testified that Kelter told him he had seen the defendant \"bend down under the passenger seat.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At that point, Kelter ordered the defendant out of the vehicle. The defendant complied, telling Kelter that he did not have anything on him and that the officer could check him. Kelter pat frisked the defendant, but found nothing of note. Kelter looked under the front passenger seat of the vehicle and found a large quantity of what appeared to be cocaine. Both the defendant and the driver of the Ford were taken into custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . 1.\n   <em>\n    Motion to suppress\n   </em>\n   .

Officers Fucci and Kelter had observed two motor vehicles meet at a location known for drug transactions. Fucci noted that the defendant remained in his vehicle and appeared to be looking around.

It was dark out at the time of the encounter, and the officers were aware that they were in a high crime area. Critically, the defendant's movements of bending over out-of-view and seemingly reaching underneath his seat suggested that he was moving some unknown object. Such movements are sufficient to raise rational safety concerns. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Stampley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"735035\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/437/323/#p327\">\n    437 Mass. 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 327 (2002), and cases cited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    The patfrisk and search\n   </em>\n   . The defendant next argues that the patfrisk and search of the vehicle were unlawful. The analysis whether a patfrisk is proper is the same as that used to determine whether the exit order is valid, that is, \"whether a reasonably prudent man in the policeman's position would be warranted in the belief that the safety of the police or that of other persons was in danger.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Torres\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"343542\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/433/669/#p673\">\n    433 Mass. at 675-676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted). A protective search may extend to the interior of an automobile as long as it is limited to what is minimally necessary to dispel safety concerns. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Silva\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"314503\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/366/402/#p408\">\n    366 Mass. 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 408 (1974) ;\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Almeida\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"323882\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/373/266/#p272\">\n    373 Mass. 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 272 (1977). Here, the same factors justifying the exit order and patfrisk of the defendant also supported the search of the automobile, including underneath his seat where the cocaine was found. The motion judge properly denied the motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Motion to renew motion to suppress\n   </em>\n   . The defendant also argues that the motion judge erred in denying his motion to renew his suppression motion, on the basis that Kelter's trial testimony was materially different from Fucci's testimony at the suppression hearing about Kelter's observations. A denial of a motion to renew is reviewed for abuse of discretion. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lahey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3844505\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/80/606/#p615\">\n    80 Mass. App. Ct. 606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 615 (2011). We conclude that the judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At trial, Kelter testified that he \"observed [the defendant] bend down, his head dipped down as Officer Fucci was approaching.\" At the motion hearing, Fucci had testified that \"Kelter informed me that he observed [the defendant] bend down under the passenger seat.\" The defendant argued that the discrepancy between Fucci's testimony at the motion hearing and Kelter's testimony at trial was significant. Under either account, the movement created the reasonable inference that the defendant had reached under the seat. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mercado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"890053\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/422/367/#p369\">\n    422 Mass. 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 369 (1996) (\"To qualify as reasonable, the officer's suspicion must be based on specific, articulable facts and reasonable inferences drawn therefrom\" [quotation omitted] ). Although the motion judge expressed skepticism that the motion to renew should have been referred back to him, he also observed that the additional evidence didn't \"sound to [him] like it's a whole lot different from what [he] found.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, no basis to disturb the ruling on the original motion existed, and the motion judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the motion to renew.
