Appellant alleged in her complaint that on October 17, 2014, at 5:45 p.m., while she was holding onto the handrail and walking on the ramp leading to the entrance doors, she tripped on an uneven area on the ramp covered by a rubber mat and sustained injuries. Appellee filed an answer on October 21, 2016. Appellee then filed a motion for summary judgment on April 11, 2017. Appellee alleged two doctrines barred appellant's negligence complaint: the open and obvious doctrine and the two-inch rule. Appellant filed a brief in opposition to appellee's motion for summary judgment and argued the two-inch rule did not apply and contended whether\n   the condition was open and obvious was a jury question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In her deposition, appellant stated that, as a result of her fall on October 17, 2014, she sustained a right leg puncture wound and her right femur was shattered such that the doctor had to put in a rod, plate, and screws. Appellant lives in Pennsylvania and came to Canton earlier that day to celebrate an occasion with her family. Appellant had never been to Wasabi House before. When she arrived at Wasabi House, appellant parked in the lot to the left-hand side of the building as the restaurant faces the street. Appellant stated when she arrived at Wasabi on October 17, 2014, it was 5:45 p.m., it was still light out, there was no precipitation, she had no visibility problems, and the light was such that she could see where she was walking. Appellant testified her niece and nephew were ahead of her with their children. Appellant does not have any visual or vision issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Appellant stated that as she began to go up the ramp, she could see it was a ramp, could see the condition of the ramp as she was walking, could see the ramp was going up to the landing, could see a black mat on the ramp, and knew the handrail ended at the top of the ramp. She was walking up the right-hand side of the ramp with her hand on the handrail. Appellant testified, \"she saw nothing to make [her] think there was any reason I shouldn't step up.\" Appellant knew she was walking up a ramp, could see the condition of the ramp, and was able to look down and see where she was putting her foot. She stated as she was walking upward, it was obvious it was a ramp and obvious there was a runner on the ramp. Appellant identified Exhibit A as a picture of the ramp she was walking up and stated she could see the ramp, black runner, and black mat on the day in question. Appellant testified she made the conscious decision to use the ramp.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Appellant stated as she was walking up the ramp, she could see the wood and rubber mat. Appellant testified the lead foot was her right foot, which went up onto the tile itself. Appellant believes her left toe hit something, causing her to fall, but when asked where her left toe hit, appellant stated, \"I'm going to say I'm not positive.\" Appellant stated she was able to see the tile as she was placing her right foot on the tile and, as she was beginning to move her left foot forward, she was able to see the area directly in front of her. She knew she was going from the ramp to the tile. Appellant testified there was nothing except people ahead of her walking up the ramp, and the area where she fell was capable of observation within her field of vision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Appellant confirmed she had just walked over the same area with her right foot safely. When asked what was different about moving her left foot that was different from her right foot, appellant responded, \"I don't know.\" Appellant testified that, at the time her fall occurred, her nephew holding an infant safely walked across the area, as did her niece and her sister. Appellant stated that one of the ambulance drivers told her this happened before at Wasabi, but appellant had no personal knowledge of any previous falls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Appellant stated her nephew returned to Wasabi after the accident and took photographs. As to the photographs taken by her nephew, appellant testified she believes the photographs taken by her nephew helped tell her what caused her to fall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On direct examination, appellant testified she could see there was a ramp in front of her, could see the runner from the bottom to the top, could see the black mat at the top, and none of these things looked\n   hazardous to her. Appellant stated she could not see what was under the black mat and that she was not there when they peeled back the black mat. Appellant testified there was \"nothing to distract her\" as she was walking towards the door, and that she looked at the floor and entrance as she was going up the ramp.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Appellant also attached her own affidavit to her response to the motion for summary judgment. In her affidavit, appellant averred there was nothing visible on the black mat that covered the end of the ramp and porch to cause her to trip and fall. She stated she had viewed the tiled porch and there appeared no obstructions before her. Appellant averred as she stepped off the end of the ramp and onto the porch with her right foot, the toe of her left foot caught, and she stumbled toward the entrance door seven feet away. When her left foot caught, it tripped her, and she could not recover. Appellant stated upon taking the step off the ramp and onto the porch, she was looking forward and following her family. Appellant averred there was no visible hazard on the black rubber mat as she walked on it and no abrupt difference in the level between the porch and the end of the ramp was visible to catch the toe of her left foot. Further, that she had no reason to look down at her left foot after her right foot reached the porch because the porch looked free and clear of anything that would impede her step.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Appellant averred that as she reached the top of the ramp and let go of the handrail, she was paying attention to her niece a step ahead of her, her sister Evelyn who was carrying a child, her nephew who was carrying a child, and to others entering the porch from the front stairs. She stated her attention was drawn to her family and other persons on the porch and the activity entering the restaurant through the door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Also attached to appellant's response to the motion for summary judgment is the affidavit of Dustin Willgohs (\"Willgohs\"), appellant's nephew. Willgohs averred that on the day in question, appellant was a step behind his wife as they all walked up the ramp and, as she was walking on the mat-covered end of the ramp where it adjoined the porch or landing, she stumbled forward towards the entrance door, falling on the tiled porch. Willgohs stated he returned to the restaurant on October 17, 2014 to see what caused appellant to fall and the ramp, runner on the ramp, and mat on the top of the ramp looked fine. However, he noticed some \"give\" to the mat upon downward pressure in the area of the ramp adjoining the porch. Willgohs took four photographs on October 17, 2014 of the area in question and went back on October 24, 2017 to take five additional photographs. The photographs are attached to his affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Appellant also submitted the affidavit of Kurtis Whitling (\"Whitling\"), a mechanical engineer at CED Technologies. Whitling stated he inspected the ramp at issue on December 30. He averred that, with the mat removed, the vertical height difference at the transition from the wooden ramp to the tile floor ranged from 1 1/8 inch at the west end, to 1 \u00bc inch in the center, to 7/8 inch at the east end of the ramp. Whitling opined the sharp vertical offset provided a tripping hazard which would be a dangerous condition for patrons and that the hazard was hidden by the black material and black rubber mat. Whitling also opined that the idea that a two-inch offset is insubstantial conflicts with all standards of construction. He concluded the vertical height difference between the tile and base of the ramp where appellant's left toe caught was between 1 1/8\n   inch and 1 \u00bc inch and caused her to stumble. Whitling also opined as to how the hazard should have been fixed by properly replacing the mortar built up on the west side of the ramp.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Appellant filed the deposition of Nan Lin (\"Lin\"). Lin testified that when the restaurant opened in 2009, the ramp is \"pretty much\" how it is now, and they have not changed the dimension or structure of the ramp at all. The ramp was there when Lin purchased the property. The tiles, handrails, and slope of the ramp have not changed since he purchased the restaurant in 2009. Lin did put in lights in the area to improve visibility and also put in a non-slip runner on the ramp.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The trial court issued a judgment entry on May 17, 2017. The trial court found that a black rubber mat ran over the top edge of the ramp and onto the tiled platform and, under the mat, the wooden ramp was slightly lower than the platform, and a small lip existed where the ramp transitioned to the platform. Further, that photographs taken shortly after the incident show a small hump visible beneath the rubber mat where it lay across the transition from the ramp to the platform. The trial court noted the height of the \"lip was reduced by the rubber mat lying across it,\" and, according to appellant's expert report, the height of the lip was approximately one inch. The trial court noted the following testimony of appellant: appellant admits she observed the black runner and could clearly see the area where the mat transitioned onto the tiled platform; appellant admits she was able to negotiate the transition with her right foot without any problem, but when she stepped with her left foot, her toe caught, she stumbled and fell; appellant admits the area where she was walking was observable and nothing obstructed her ability to view the ramp and tile platform; and while she stated in her affidavit she was paying attention to family and patrons ahead of her on the ramp, she testified in her deposition that she was not distracted by anything as she walked up the ramp.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The trial court found, based upon the testimony of appellant and the photographs submitted showing a slight lip at the transition from the end of the ramp to the tiled platform, the defect was open and obvious. The trial court stated the exposed lip at the edge of the black runner and slight hump in the mat is clearly shown in appellant's own photographs. Further, that the rubber mat served to smooth over the transition from the ramp to the platform without actually concealing the transition. The trial court noted appellant's admissions that she could see the ramp, knew the ramp was going up to the landing, and knew the black rubber mat lay across the transition. The trial court found appellant's testimony that she \"saw nothing to make me think there was any reason why I shouldn't step up\" important, as it meant appellant understood she had to step\n   <em>\n    up\n   </em>\n   onto the landing. The trial court found reasonable people viewing the photographs can only conclude the slight difference in height between the end of the ramp and tiled platform was open and obvious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Further, that appellant failed to produce any evidence of attendant circumstances. While she stated in her affidavit her \"anticipation and attention\" was drawn to her family and the activity entering through the restaurant, the trial court found these are not circumstances beyond her control. Rather, appellant was simply describing her own activities at the time of the fall. The trial court also relied on appellant's testimony that she was not distracted by anything when she fell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The trial court also found the trivial defect or two-inch rule applies to bar appellant's claim. The trial court stated\n   appellant's evidence establishes the greatest differential between the ramp and the platform was 1 \u00bc inch and these measurements were taken without the black runner or map over the lip. Further, appellant's expert report and photographs demonstrate that, with the mat present, the offset is approximately one inch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The trial court found there is no evidence of attendant circumstances to rebut the two-inch rule, as the weather was dry, it was light out, appellant stated she had no visibility problems, appellant testified there was nothing obstructing her view of the ramp or the threshold, appellant stated she was not distracted, appellant was able to negotiate the lip with her right foot without any difficulty an instant earlier, and appellant was not able to state with certainty what her left toe caught on. As to appellant's argument that the rubber mat itself was an attendant circumstance because it hid the offset, the trial court found appellant's photographs show the lip at the transition from the ramp to the tiled platform is clearly visible as one approached the top of the ramp. Further, appellant's self-serving affidavit that the difference in the level between the ramp and porch was not visible is contradicted by her own testimony and own photographs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The trial court found Wasabi House was entitled to judgment as a matter of law and granted Wasabi House's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Appellant appeals the May 17, 2017 judgment entry of the Stark County Court of Common Pleas and assigns the following as error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 21} \"I. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GRANTING APPELLEE'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT BY FINDING THAT THE APPELLANT WAS INJURED BY AN OPEN AND OBVIOUS HAZARD, WHERE THE TRIP HAZARD WAS HIDDEN FROM VIEW BY A FLEXIBLE BLACK RUBBER MAT THAT DEPRESSED AS THE APPELLANT WALKED OVER IT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 22} \"II. THE COURT ERRED IN GRANTING APPELLEE'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT BASED UPON THE \"TWO INCH RULE\" WHERE THE TRIP HAZARD WAS HIDDEN FROM VIEW AND NOT SUBJECT TO OBSERVATION BECAUSE THE HAZARD WAS COVERED WITH A FLEXIBLE BLACK RUBBER MAT THAT DEPRESSED AS THE APPELLANT WALKED OVER IT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 23} \"III.

Accordingly, we will review several of these assignments of error together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Summary Judgment Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Civil Rule 56(C) in reviewing a motion for summary judgment which provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence, and written stipulations of fact, if any, timely filed in the action, show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

Additionally, appellant specifically stated there was \"nothing to distract her\" as she was walking towards the door and she was capable of observing both the ramp and the threshold in her field of vision. Thus, there is no evidence her family or other people entering the restaurant distracted appellant to the point of reducing the degree of care an ordinary person would exercise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 50} Appellant also argues the black mat was an attendant circumstance because she was distracted by the mat. However, appellant testified she saw the ramp, saw the black mat on the ramp, understood she needed to step up to the tiled foyer, and nothing distracted her as she was walking towards the door. When asked where her left toe hit, appellant stated, \"I'm going to say I'm not positive.\" Further, when asked what was different about moving her left foot that was different from her right foot, appellant testified, \"I don't know.\" Additionally, there is evidence that the mat actually lessened the vertical distance at the transition between the wooden ramp to the tiled floor. Thus, the existence of the black mat is not a circumstance that significantly enhanced the danger of the defect or hazard and contributed to the injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 51} We find that reasonable minds could only conclude the threshold was open and obvious. We further find no evidence of any attendant circumstances which enhanced the danger to appellant and contributed to her fall. We therefore find Wasabi House owed no duty to appellant and the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to Wasabi House. Appellant's first, third, and fifth assignments of error are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   II., IV, VI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 52} In her second, fourth, and sixth assignments of error, appellant argues the trial court erred in finding the \"two inch rule\" or the \"trivial defect\" rule bars recovery in this case. Appellant contends the difference is substantial and the two-inch rule is not a bright-line test, but depends on the circumstances. Further, that the two-inch rule does not apply because the trip point beneath the mat could not be seen and the distance between appellant's right foot on the ramp and the step up to the foyer was greater than two inches. Appellant also contends there were attendant circumstances to render the defect substantial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 53} The Ohio Supreme Court has declined to hold property owners and occupiers liable as a matter of law for injuries due to minor or trivial imperfections that were not unreasonably dangerous, are commonly encountered, and to be expected.

In\n   <em>\n    Helms v. American Legion, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1787416\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-2d/5/60/\">\n    5 Ohio St.2d 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=213%20N.E.2d%20734\">\n    213 N.E.2d 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1966), the Ohio Supreme Court reaffirmed its holding in\n   <em>\n    Kimball\n   </em>\n   and extended the two-inch rule to privately owned or occupied properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 54} In\n   <em>\n    Cash v.

The Court clarified the two-inch\n   rule and stated courts must also consider any attendant circumstances in determining whether liability exists for trivial defects. Thus, in\n   <em>\n    Cash\n   </em>\n   , the Ohio Supreme Court established that a height difference of two inches or less is insubstantial as a matter of law, unless attendant circumstances are shown to elevate the defect to an unreasonably dangerous condition.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=421%20N.E.2d%201275\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 55} Appellant contends the two-inch rule is not applicable in this case because the hazard at issue is not a vertical distance of less than two inches. However, this argument is contradicted by her expert's testimony. Whitling stated that, with the mat removed, the vertical height difference at the transition from the wooden ramp to the tile floor varied from 7/8 inch to 1 \u00bc inch at the highest point. Further, with the mat on the ramp, Whitling approximated the height difference to be about one inch. Additionally, in the photographs provided by appellant, taken by her nephew shortly after the incident, the vertical height difference is shown to be less than two inches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 56} As discussed in detail above, appellant also argues attendant circumstances elevate the defect to an unreasonably dangerous condition. Appellant contends this case is analogous to\n   <em>\n    Cash, Hill, and\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Neura\n   </em>\n   , in which courts found attendant circumstances provided a genuine issue of material fact as to the two-inch rule. However, we find these cases distinguishable from the instant case.

The attendant circumstances present in\n   <em>\n    Cash\n   </em>\n   are not present in this case. In this case, appellant testified it was still light out, there was no precipitation, she had no visibility problems, she could see where she was walking, nothing obstructed her view of the ramp or threshold, she successfully negotiated the step up with her right foot, and there was \"nothing to distract her\" as she was walking towards the door.

In fact, the court noted, \"walking behind someone while that person is conversing and/or gesturing is not an unusual circumstance.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=88%20N.E.3d%20575\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In this case, appellant testified she could look down and see where she was putting her foot, could see the ramp, could see the runner, and the ramp and threshold were capable of observation within her field of vision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 58} Accordingly, we find reasonable minds could only conclude the defect was trivial and not rendered a substantial one because of any attendant circumstances.

Given the fact a person's normal gate is to put one foot ahead of the other when walking, it is not necessarily inconsistent Appellant's right foot may have safely stepped over the top of the ramp while Appellant's left foot caught on the lip created by the \"give\" of the mat where the gap existed. I find sufficient evidence exists to create a genuine dispute as to whether the alleged hazard was open and obvious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {\u00b6 64} I further disagree with the trial court's and majority's determination no liability exists because the \"two-inch rule\" bars recovery, finding the height differential was \"trivial.\" While the height differential may have been trivial, all the cases applying the two-inch rule involve situations where the height differential was observable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {\u00b6 65} Because the black mat covered the gap between the top of the ramp and the tile floor, the height differential caused by the give in the mat was not observable. As such, I find the two-inch rule inapplicable when the gap is not open to observation but rather covered or obscured.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
