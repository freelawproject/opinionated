It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">\u201c(c) A lawyer shall not prepare an instrument giving the lawyer or a person related to the lawyer or a person related to the lawyer as parent, child, sibling, or spouse any sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>stantial gift from a client, including a testamentary gift, except where:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-4\">\u201c(1) the client is related to the donee; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\">\u201c(2) the client is represented by independent counsel in</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">connection with the gift.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">This Rule was before this Court, involved in two disciplinary proceedings, during the 2003 Term: <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Stein, </em>373 Md. 531, 819 A.2d 372 (2003) and <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Brooke, </em>374 Md. 155, 821 A.2d 414 (2003). Interpreting the Rule, we defined and established its scope and application. We concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">\u201cThe Rule is mandatory and contains no provision for waiver of the provision to consult with independent counsel.... The Rule is qualified in only three ways: (1) if the gift is not \u2018substantial,\u2019 (2) if the client is related to the attorney, or (3) if the client has consulted with independent counsel. Unlike the provision under the Ethical Considerations of our prior rule, this provision and prohibition is express and mandatory.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-9\"><em>Stein, </em>373 Md. at 537, 819 A.2d at 375-76. Characterizing the violation of the Rule as \u201ca most serious one,\u201d <em>'id. </em>at 538, 819 A.2d at 376, we commented on the reasons for the Rule and the concerns at which it was directed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-10\">\u201cThere are many potential dangers inherent in an attorney drafting a will in which he or she is the beneficiary. Conflict of interest, the attorney\u2019s incompetency to testify because of a transaction with the deceased, the attorney\u2019s ability to influence the testator, the possible jeopardy to probate of the entire will if its admission is contested, the possible harm to other beneficiaries and the undermining of the public trust and confidence in the legal profession are some of the dangers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 538, 819 A.2d at 376, citing <em>In re Polevoy, </em>980 P.2d 985, 987 (Colo.1999); Philip White, Jr., Annotation, <em>Attorneys At Law: Disciplinary Proceedings for Drafting Instrument Such as Will or Trust Under Which Attorney-Drafter or Member of Attorney\u2019s Family or Law Firm is Beneficiary, Grantee, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number><em>Legatee, or Devisee, </em>80 A.L.R.5th 597 (2000). <em>Brooke, 374 Md. </em>at 178, 821 A.2d at 427. Moreover, ignorance of the Rule is not a defense. <em>Stein, </em>378 Md. at 542, 819 A.2d at 379; <em>Brooke, </em>374 Md. at 179-80, 821 A.2d at 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">N. Frank Lanocha, the respondent, drafted the Last Will and Testament for his client, Sarah Ann Ester Straw. By that will, the respondent\u2019s wife received a bequest of $1000<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, but for a second bequest for $2000 to Chimes, Inc., the rest and residue of the estate was bequeathed to the respondent\u2019s adult daughter. After the death of Ms. Straw and following the admission of the Last Will and Testament to probate in the Orphans\u2019 Court for Baltimore County, the Chief Judge of that Court wrote to Bar Counsel, informing him of a possible violation of Rule 1.8(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Thereafter, Bar Counsel, acting with the approval and at the direction of the Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland, the petitioner, <em>see </em>Rule 16-751,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> filed a <em>Petition For </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number><em>Disciplinary or Remedial Action </em>against the respondent. In addition to charging a violation of Rule 1.8(c), as expected, the petitioner also alleged a violation of Rule 8.4(d)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">Following a hearing, the Hon. Susan Souder of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, to whom, pursuant to Rules 16-752,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we forwarded the case, made findings of fact, <em>see </em>Rule 16-757(c),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> by clear and convincing evidence, <em>see </em>Rule 16-757(b),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>\u201cA will was prepared by respondent N. Frank Lanocha for his client, Sarah Ann Ester Straw to whom he was not related. The will provided a $1,000 bequest from Ms. Straw to Teresa W. Lanocha, Respondent\u2019s wife. In addition, the will also provided that the \u201crest and residue\u201d of Ms. Straw\u2019s \u00e9state was bequeathed to Teresa Lanocha-Sisson (also known as Teresa M. Sisson). In the event Ms. Lanocha-Sisson were to predecease Ms. Straw, the rest of Ms. Straw\u2019s estate was bequeathed to Ms. Lanocha-Sisson\u2019s sons, Respondent\u2019s grandsons. There is no dispute that the latter gift was substantial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-4\">\u201cThere is no indication that duress or improper influence were brought to bear on Ms. Straw by Respondent or anyone else. Ms. Straw was not represented by independent counsel in connection with will although Mr. Lanocha suggested that she consult other counsel. Ms. Straw did not wish to consult an attorney she did not know nor involve a stranger in her personal affairs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">\u201cRespondent \u2018had no knowledge whatsoever of Rule [1.8(c)] or its existence or content.\u2019 ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The hearing court concluded, on these facts, \u201cthat there was a violation of Rule 1.8(c) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Both the petitioner and the respondent took exception to the hearing court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">The petitioner\u2019s single exception is to the hearing court\u2019s failure to find a violation of Rule 8.4(d). It relies on <em>Brooke, </em>in which this Court overruled the respondent\u2019s exception to the hearing court\u2019s finding in that case of a violation of Rule 8.4,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in addition to the uncontested finding of the Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>1.8(c) violation. The petitioner reminds us that we held in <em>Brooke </em>that, because \u201c[a] violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct may be a basis for finding a violation of Rule 8.4,\u201d 874 Md. at 177, 821 A.2d at 426, the hearing court properly found that violation on the basis of the Rule 1.8(c) violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">The respondent acknowledges the <em>Brooke </em>holding and that it supports the petitioner\u2019s position. He asks that \u201cthe Court re-examine the need for or purpose of finding a violation of a specific rule in this instance MRPC 1.8(c), which itself affords a basis for imposing whatever sanction the Court deems appropriate, also is sanctionable, premised upon the same allegedly sanctionable conduct, under another rule, in this instance 8.4(d).\u201d The respondent offers as reasons for the reconsideration, reminiscent of the arguments Brooke made and the concerns we addressed in that case, the lack of any necessity to do so and avoidance of the \u201caura of \u2018piling on.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Responding to the arguments made by the respondent in that case, this Court, in <em>Brooke, </em>pointed out that the finding of a violation of one Rule of Professional Conduct based on the violation of another was not double punishment, did not run afoul of the purpose of attorney discipline and that, in any event, the finding of a rule violation differs from the sanction. 374 Md. at 177, 821 A.2d at 426. In the latter regard, we made clear that the number of violations does not determine the appropriate sanction, the facts and circumstances of the particular case do. <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Briscoe, </em>357 Md. 554, 568, 745 A.2d 1037, 1044 (2000) (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Milliken, </em>348 Md. 486, 519, 704 A.2d 1225, 1241 (1998)). We shall sustain the petitioner\u2019s exception, for the reasons stated in <em>Brooke.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>The respondent filed several exceptions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> First, he excepts to the hearing court\u2019s conclusion that he violated Rule 1.8(c). Next he excepts to the hearing court\u2019s failure to address the tension between a lawyer\u2019s duty to his client and his duty to comply with the disciplinary or other regulatory rules. Specifically, the respondent believes that the court should have dealt with, as he put it, \u201cthe issue regarding actual or potential tensions between a lawyer\u2019s duty and responsibility to carry out the instructions of a client, in this instance disposition, upon her demise, of all of Mrs. Straw\u2019s worldly possessions in the manner that she chose and looked to respondent to implement and respondent\u2019s obligation to comply with rules regulating lawyers\u2019 conduct, a patently difficult and demanding task which often requires not only wisdom, but a judicious exercise of sound judgment as well.\u201d Finally, positing that the disciplinary proceedings had their genesis in a caveat action filed in the Baltimore County Orphans\u2019 Court and noting that the caveat proceedings have been dismissed, and had been prior to his hearing in the Circuit Court, the respondent takes exception to the fact that the hearing court made no findings of fact or drew any conclusions of law \u201cwith respect to the effect on the instant disciplinary proceeding of dismissal of the underlying caveat case from which it arose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">The dispositive exception is the first one mentioned-to the conclusion, without further elaboration of facts than those found by the hearing court, that the respondent\u2019s drafting of a will, the terms of which made a substantial bequest to his daughter, for Mrs. Straw, his long-time client, to whom he was not related, and who, despite being advised to do so, did not seek, and therefore was not represented by independent counsel in connection with the will, violated Rule 1.8(c). If we continue to hold, as we held in both <em>Stein, </em>373 Md. at 537, 819 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>A.2d at 375, and <em>Brooke, </em>374 Md. at 180, 821 A.2d at 428 (\u201cRule 1.8(c) is absolute\u2014an attorney may not prepare an instrument designating himself as legatee under the circumstances presented herein\u201d), that the Rule\u2019s prohibition is both mandatory and absolute, the other two exceptions are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">The respondent recognizes that <em>Stein </em>and <em>Brooke </em>make compliance with the requirements of Rule 1.8(c) mandatory and that, therefore, a violation follows inexorably when they are not. Indeed, he characterizes the <em>Stein/Brooke </em>approach as a <em>\u201cper se </em>approach to Rule 1.8(c).\u201d Accordingly, the respondent proffers differences between his case and <em>Stein </em>and <em>Brooke, </em>which, he maintains, either require additional fact findings or demonstrate that the conclusion of the hearing court does not rest on the requisite evidentiary foundation. In <em>Stein, </em>he reminds us, the idea of the substantial gift which went to the attorney came from the attorney himself. <em>See </em>373 Md. at 543, 819 A.2d at 379. The respondent characterizes this difference as \u201cstriking and perhaps decisive.\u201d In both <em>Stein </em>and <em>Brooke, </em>unlike in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the respondent points out that the testamentary provision benefitted the lawyer who drafted the will. Here, the beneficiary was the respondent\u2019s daughter, who is both, the respondent asserts, adult and <em>\u201csui juris </em>and beyond respondent\u2019s control with respect to the late Mrs. Straw\u2019s testamentary gift to her.\u201d Finally, he says, the concern expressed by the Court with respect to the \u201cinevitable lack of primary evidence,\u201d after the testator\u2019s death, as to the circumstances of the gift or the making of the will are \u201calleviated or mollified\u201d in this case by the availability of two witnesses, one to be sure, being the respondent\u2019s daughter and beneficiary, the other a seemingly independent witness, Mrs. Straw\u2019s handyman and friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">These \u201cdifferences\u201d are not, singly or cumulatively, a sufficient basis for changing the approach that we took in <em>Stein </em>and continued in <em>Brooke </em>or for viewing the respondent\u2019s case from a different perspective. The concerns we identified in <em>Stein, </em>some of which the respondent relies on, simply drive the need for the Rule and make its violation a \u201cvery serious\u201d matter. That list was not, and was not intended to be, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>exhaustive list. <em>See </em>373 Md. at 537, 819 A.2d at 376. Nor did it list the concerns in the order of the importance that we ascribed to the various perceived \u201cdangers.\u201d We listed the public\u2019s confidence in the courts last and, yet, later reiterated that concern, and only that one, when announcing the sanction we determined to be the appropriate one:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-4\">\u201cWe find an indefinite suspension is warranted in this case. While respondent\u2019s lack of prior ethical violations is a mitigating factor, it does not justify a reprimand. As stated above, we consider a violation of Rule 1.8(c) to be most serious. Respondent\u2019s conduct undermines the public confidence in the legal professional in a particularly egregious manner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 543, 819 A.2d at 379. <em>See Brooke, </em>374 Md. at 180, 821 A.2d at 428 (\u201cDeterrence of such conduct and the public confidence in the legal profession can only be preserved by protecting against this behavior\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The respondent\u2019s exceptions are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Both the petitioner and the respondent submitted recommendations regarding sanction. Aware of the Court\u2019s imposition of an indefinite suspension in both <em>Stein </em>and <em>Brooke, </em>neither of whom had a disciplinary history, the petitioner recommends that the respondent be ordered indefinitely suspended from the practice of law, with the right to reapply after ninety (90) days. The recommendation is justified, the petitioner states, given the facts that the respondent was reprimanded in 2001 for violations of Rules 1.15(b)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and 8.1(b)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and because, unlike <em>Stein, </em>who suggested that he be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>made the beneficiary, the respondent did not suggest the bequest to his daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Although conceding that he meets all of the prerequisites for violating the rule\u2014he drafted the will, for a person to whom he was unrelated, the will bequeathed a substantial gift to his daughter and the testator was not represented by independent counsel and did not seek such counsel\u2014and that <em>Stein </em>and <em>Brooke </em>reflect this Court\u2019s adoption of a bright line rule as to the sanction to be administered for violation of Rule 1.8(c), the respondent nevertheless urges that the proceedings be dismissed and that no sanction be issued. He bases that recommendation on his view of the merits of his various exceptions. Those exceptions have been overruled, however. Anticipating that eventuality, the respondent\u2019s fail-back position is that the appropriate sanction is a reprimand or a period of suspension not to exceed thirty (30) days.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">In both <em>Stein </em>and <em>Brooke, </em>the beneficiaries of the client\u2019s substantial testamentary gift was the attorney who prepared the will. In one case, it was the attorney himself who suggested that he be given the bequest. In this case, although the beneficiary is the attorney\u2019s daughter, she is an adult and, as the respondent points out, <em>\u201cmi juris </em>and beyond respondent\u2019s compulsion and control with respect to the late Mrs. Straw\u2019s testamentary gift to her.\u201d There is no evidence that the respondent orchestrated the bequest to his daughter or will share in it in any way. Indeed, the opposite is the case, the hearing court was clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-7\">\u201cThere is no indication that duress or improper influence were brought to bear on Ms. Straw by Respondent or anyone else. Ms. Straw was not represented by independent counsel in connection with the will although Mr. Lanocha suggested that she consult counsel. Ms. Straw did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>wish to consult an attorney she did not know nor involve a stranger in her personal affairs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Under the circumstances, we believe that the appropriate sanction is a reprimand. <em>See State v. Eisenberg, </em>29 Wis.2d 233, 138 N.W.2d 235 (1965) (reprimanding an attorney for drafting a will, disinheriting his uncle\u2019s wife and daughter, in favor of his mother, from whom he might inherit); <em>In re Disciplinary Action Against Boulger, </em>637 N.W.2d 710 (N.D. 2001) (reprimanding attorney for drafting will codicil that included provisions giving him substantial contingent testamentary gift, even though the contingencies did not arise<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>). <em>See also In re Blair, </em>840 So.2d 1191 (La.2003) (imposing a three (3) month suspension on attorney, with no prior disciplinary record, who was relatively inexperienced and expressed sincere remorse, for preparing will for client that gave attorney\u2019s wife testamentary gift).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING THE COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-761, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION OF MARYLAND AGAINST N.

By Rules Order dated February 8, 2005, Rule 1.8(c) was revised, effective July 1, 2005. It now reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-9\">\"A lawyer shall not solicit any substantial gift from a client, including a testamentary gift, or prepare on behalf of a client an instrument giving the lawyer or a person related to the lawyer any substantial gift unless the lawyer or other recipient of the gift is related to the client. For purposes of this paragraph, related persons include a spouse, child, grandchild, parent, grandparent or other relative or individual with whom the lawyer or the client maintains a close, familial relationship.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">Because the respondent's misconduct occurred prior to the promulgation of the current 1.8(c), the former 1.8(c) applies to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">With respect to the present Rule, the Comment confirms that independent counsel still is contemplated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-12\">\u201cGifts to Lawyers</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-13\">\u201c[6] A lawyer may accept a gift from a client, if the transaction meets general standards of fairness. For example, a simple gift such as a present given at a holiday or as a token of appreciation is permitted. If a client offers the lawyer a more substantial gift, paragraph (c) does not prohibit the lawyer from accepting it, although such a gift may be voidable by the client under the doctrine of undue influence, which treats client gifts as presumptively fraudulent. In any event, due to concerns about overreaching and imposition on clients, a lawyer may not suggest that a substantial gift be made to the lawyer or for the lawyer's benefit, except where the lawyer is related to the client as set forth in paragraph (c).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-14\">\u201c[7] If effectuation of a substantial gift requires preparing a legal instrument such as a will or conveyance, the client should have the detached advice that another lawyer can provide. The sole exception to this Rule is where the client is a relative of the donee.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b266-6\"><em>. </em>No issue has been made as to the bequest to the respondent's wife; thus we do not address whether a bequest of $ 1000 is, or is not, \"substantial.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b266-7\">.

Subject to one critical caveat, 1 agree as well that, under the facts here, a reprimand would be the appropriate sanction to be imposed. The caveat is the one that I noted in my dissent in <em>Attorney Grievance v. Stein, </em>378 Md. 531, 545-49, 819 A.2d 372, 380-82 (2003). In my view, the only effective and practical way to enforce MRPC 1.8(c) is to require the errant lawyer to disgorge the fruits of his violation of the Rule by renouncing, or causing any family member who is selected as the beneficiary to renounce, the legacy obtained in violation of the Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">It may well be, and for purposes of this case I am willing to accept, that Mr. Lanocha\u2019s version of what occurred is entirely accurate\u2014that he did nothing to induce Ms. Straw to leave a substantial part of her Estate to Lanocha\u2019s daughter and that she insisted on making that gift\u2014but we will never really know, because Ms. Straw is dead and cannot testify. That is the problem in every one of these cases: we get only one side of the story.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The Court agrees that compliance with the Rule is mandatory and that a violation \u201cfollows inexorably\u201d when the requirements of the Rule are not satisfied. But notwithstanding the rhetoric, it insists on making the Rule a toothless and clawless tiger by providing no effective sanction for its violation. I continue to believe, and with each new case continue to believe even more firmly, that the way to avoid violations of the Rule is \u201cthe simple expedient of requiring the lawyer, as a minimal sanction for violating the Rule, to disgorge what the lawyer wrongfully created. If lawyers know that a violation of the Rule will bring them no financial gain, they will have no incentive to violate the Rule, and <em>that, </em>above all else, is what will protect the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 548, 819 A.2d at 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">The legacy here was not to Lanocha but to his adult daughter, and Lanocha has argued that he had no control over his daughter\u2019s acceptance of the legacy, that it was not within his power to have her renounce it. I am unwilling to accept that as a given. For one thing, there is nothing in the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>to indicate that he ever asked her to renounce it. A caveat was filed to the Will, and Lanocha was advised at that time by his own lawyer that what he had done was in violation of the Rule. I am deeply skeptical that, if Lanocha had informed his daughter that the result of her accepting the legacy might well be his suspension from the practice of law for violation of a Rule of Professional Conduct, she would nonetheless have insisted on accepting the legacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">I would suspend Mr. Lanocha indefinitely.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Dissenting Opinion by BATTAGLIA, J., which CATHELL, J., joins.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">I respectfully dissent. I do not believe that a reprimand is commensurate with the sanctions that we have imposed in cases involving violations of Rule 1.8(c). Based on the language of Rule 1.8(c), as well as the reasoning of this Court\u2019s opinions in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Stein, </em>873 Md. 531, 819 A.2d 372 (2003), and <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Brooke, </em>374 Md. 155, 821 A.2d 414 (2003), in which this Court ordered an indefinite suspension, I also would impose the sanction of an indefinite suspension upon Mr. Lanocha. In determining that a reprimand is appropriate, the majority distinguishes <em>Stein </em>and <em>Brooke </em>based on the fact that in both cases the attorney who prepared the will was also the beneficiary of a substantial testamentary gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">The version of Rule 1.8(c) that was in effect at the time of Mr. Lanocha\u2019s violation provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-9\">(c) A lawyer shall not prepare an instrument giving the lawyer or a person related to the lawyer as a parent, child, sibling, or spouse any substantial gift from a client, including a testamentary gift, except where:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-10\">(1) the client is related to the donee; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-11\">(2) the client is represented by independent counsel in connection with the gift.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 1.8(c) (2004).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As we noted in <em>Stein:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>The Rule is qualified in only three ways: (1) if the gift is not \u2018substantial,\u2019 (2) if the client is related to the attorney, or (3) if the client has consulted with independent counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-4\"><em>Stein, </em>373 Md. at 537, 819 A.2d at 375-76. This Rule makes no distinction between testamentary gifts made directly to the attorney and those made to relatives of the attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The majority\u2019s reliance on the fact that Mr. Lanocha\u2019s daughter is an adult is misplaced. Rule 1.8(c) contains no exception for substantial gifts to adult children of the attorney. Moreover, the assumption that in order for Mr. Lanocha to benefit from the bequest to his daughter, he would have to either share in it or maintain some control over it, is flawed. Certainly, the Rule anticipated that \u201cparents\u201d of the lawyer would be \u201cadults,\u201d such that adult status should not presumptively mitigate the attorney\u2019s violation of the Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The majority also relies upon the hearing court\u2019s determination that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">[tjhere is no indication that duress or improper influence were brought to bear on Ms. Straw by Respondent or anyone else. Ms. Straw was not represented by independent counsel in connection with the will although Mr. Lanocha suggested that she consult counsel. Ms. Straw did not wish to consult an attorney she did not know nor involve a stranger in her personal affairs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">The finding of a violation of Rule 1.8(c), however, does not turn on affirmative evidence of duress or improper influence by the attorney. Rather, such improper influence is presumed merely from the fact that the attorney drafted the testamentary instrument in which either the attorney or the attorney\u2019s relative benefitted. If the attorney advised his or her client that the client should seek independent counsel, which the client refused, and the attorney was reticent to withdraw from the undertaking because of the relationship with the client, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>very concerns that gave rise to the prohibition are present. The closeness of the relationship with the client mandates the intervention of independent counsel to insure that the client is not being influenced by the attorney.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-4\">Furthermore, this Court has previously observed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">[although some courts have imposed a reprimand for attorneys who draft such instruments, such decisions are typically under the Canons of Professional Ethics as opposed to the more stringent Rule 1.8(c). <em>See Florida Bar v. Miller, 555 </em>So.2d 854 (FIa.1990); <em>Iowa Supreme Court Bd. of Prof'l Ethics and Conduct v. Winkel, </em>541 N.W.2d 862 (Iowa 1995); <em>In re Prueter, </em>359 N.W.2d 613 (Minn.1984); <em>State v. Horan, </em>21 Wis.2d 66, 123 N.W.2d 488 (1963). <em>But see In re Mangold, </em>148 N.J. 76, 689 A.2d 722 (1997) (reprimanding attorney for violation of New Jersey's Rule 1.8(c) without discussion of circumstances of violation).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-6\"><em>Stein, </em>373 Md. at 543-44, 819 A.2d at 379. The majority relies on two cases from other jurisdictions in support of its determination that a reprimand is appropriate: <em>State v. Eisenberg, </em>29 Wis.2d 233, 138 N.W.2d 235 (1965), in which the Wisconsin Supreme Court reprimanded an attorney under the Canons of Professional Ethics for drafting a will that resulted in a substantial inheritance for the attorney\u2019s mother; and <em>In re Disciplinary Action Against Boulger, </em>637 N.W.2d 710 (N.D. 2001), wherein the North Dakota Supreme Court reprimanded the attorney based on the application of the North Dakota Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, which provided in the case of a conflict of interest caused by negligence that a reprimand is the appropriate sanction. Both are distinguishable from the case at bar based on the provision governing the imposition of the reprimand and provide no support for reprimanding Mr. Lanocha rather than indefinitely suspending him under our precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">For the foregoing reasons, I dissent from the majority\u2019s determination that a reprimand is the appropriate sanction and would impose an indefinite suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">Judge CATHELL joins in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b276-13\">. As the majority notes, by Rules Order dated February 8, 2005, Rule 1.8(c) was revised, effective July 1, 2005. The revision does not alter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>the independent counsel requirement of prior Rule 1.8(c), nor does it distinguish between gifts made to the attorney and those made to the attorney\u2019s relatives.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
