ELDRIDGE, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AyR\">Retired, Specially Assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">This case involves a challenge to a trial court\u2019s discovery order requiring the production of several internal hospital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>documents. The documents consist of e-mails, correspondence, letters, and testimony by hospital staff, regarding incidents which staff members believed should be investigated by a medical review committee, <em>ie., </em>a peer review group which monitors the quality of health services at the hospital. At issue is whether the documents are protected by the medical review committee privilege, which shields records, proceedings and files of such committees from discovery and admissibility in civil actions. We are also presented with the threshold question of whether the trial court\u2019s discovery order is appeal-able by the hospital, known as St. Joseph Medical Center, Inc. We shall hold that the order is appealable by St. Joseph, and we shall, on the merits, reverse the trial court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">On October 17, 2001, Cardiac Surgery Associates, P.A., filed an action in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County against MidAtlantic Cardiovascular Associates, P.A., alleging unfair competition and tortious interference with economic relations in connection with the parties\u2019 cardiac surgery practices. Cardiac Surgery and MidAtlantic both employ cardiac surgeons who practice extensively at St. Joseph Medical Center, Inc. St. Joseph, however, is not a party to the unfair competition lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Both sides in the unfair competition action sought discovery from St. Joseph by serving upon the hospital notices of deposition and subpoenas <em>duces tecum. </em>In response, St. Joseph produced over 29,000 pages of documents. Additionally, St. Joseph produced a privilege log, identifying those documents which it would not produce because, according to St. Joseph, they were covered by certain privileges, including the medical review committee privilege set forth in Maryland Code (1981, 2005 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 l-401(d)(l) of the Health Occupations Article. St. Joseph\u2019s assertion of privilege was not challenged by either party during the discovery process.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">St. Joseph later learned that 118 documents, which were listed in its privilege log, had been exchanged by the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>during discovery.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> St. Joseph wrote to each of the parties and advised them that the 118 documents in their possession were privileged, that the documents had improperly come into the custody of the parties, and St. Joseph demanded the immediate return of the documents to the hospital.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">When the documents were not returned, St. Joseph commenced the present action by filing in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County a motion for a protective order, asserting that the medical review committee privilege protected the 118 documents. St. Joseph requested the court to disallow the use of those documents at the trial of the unfair competition case and order the parties in that case to return them to the hospital. MidAtlantic filed a response, consenting to the relief sought by St. Joseph, as it had already returned the one document in its possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Cardiac Surgery responded to St. Joseph\u2019s motion by arguing that the medical review committee privilege did not apply to any of the documents listed in St. Joseph\u2019s privilege log, including the 118 documents which had been produced by the parties in the underlying suit. Cardiac Surgery further argued that, even if the privilege applied, the allegations of unfair competition in the underlying litigation outweighed any interest St. Joseph had in protecting the documents. In making this argument, Cardiac Surgery chiefly relied on <em>Price v. Howard County General Hospital, </em>950 F.Supp. 141 (D.Md. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">The Circuit Court granted St. Joseph\u2019s motion for a protective order in part and denied it in part. Initially, the court held that 19 of the 117 documents in Cardiac Surgery\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>possession were not protected by the medical review committee privilege under \u00a7 1-401 (d) of the Health Occupations Article. St. Joseph then withdrew its claim of privilege as to 5 of the disputed documents, in which the names of its patients had been redacted. Therefore, there are 14 of the documents in Cardiac Surgery\u2019s possession which have remained at issue. In addition to these 14 documents, the Circuit Court ordered that St. Joseph produce other documents, namely</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqM\">\u201call of the documents contained in [St. Joseph\u2019s] \u2018privilege log,\u2019 ... which are labeled \u2018peer review,\u2019 or \u2018utilization\u2019 are discoverable as they do not come within the meaning of medical review committee materials as meant by the Maryland legislature for reasons discussed below.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">The Circuit Court, in an accompanying opinion, explained its order as follows (emphasis in original):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-5\">\u201cIn its ruling this Court is fully cognizant and respectful of the need and purpose underlying the medical review committee privilege as codified in Maryland Health Occupations Article, \u00a7 1-401 (2002). That purpose is to \u2018ensure a high quality of peer review activity leading to the primary goal ... to provide better health care.\u2019 <em>Unnamed Physician v. Committee [Commission] on Medical Discipline, </em>285 Md. 1 [400 A.2d 396] (1979). * * * Nevertheless, the Court finds that the materials that [St. Joseph] seeks to protect are not materials instituted by an act of a <em>committee </em>for the purpose intended by the statute. These materials are emails, letters, correspondences, and testimony of certain hospital staff, mostly nurses, regarding incidents they had personally witnessed and issues they feel should be addressed or investigated. There has been no indication that these materials are the result of or involved in such an investigation by a peer review or medical review committee, which would certainly be privileged. These materials are not documented disciplinary records or proceedings or files or notes or minutes of the medical review committee under \u00a7 1-401 (d) of the statute. Rather, they are themselves observations and concerns, as yet not proven to be true, that tend to show that certain conduct of Defendant [in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>unfair competition litigation], namely patient diversion and self-referral, might not be in a patient\u2019s best interest, and more important, that may be unlawful. Additionally, the material is directly relevant to the allegations made by Plaintiff [Cardiac Surgery], namely that Defendant [is] intentionally engaging in unfair competition, and are not materials intended to publicly disparage, or call into question, a doctor\u2019s medical ability. Therefore, their discoverability will have no chilling effect on the purpose of the privilege.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-5\">\u201cThis Court agrees with the reasoning of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, which found that Maryland\u2019s medical review committee privilege did not apply to a federal antitrust claim because \u2018the driving force behind the federal antitrust laws\u2014free competition, outweigh the policies underlying the privilege.\u2019 Price <em>v. Howard County General Hospital, </em>950 F.Supp. 141 (1996). Maryland\u2019s unfair competition laws are akin to the federal laws and attempt to enforce the same policy, preserving free competition. In this case, the Court finds that the policy of lawful competition outweighs the policy of the privilege.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">St. Joseph noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, challenging the Circuit Court\u2019s order with regard to the 14 documents in Cardiac Surgery\u2019s possession and with regard to the other documents listed in the privilege log which the Circuit Court held were discoverable. The Court of Special Appeals initially ordered that St. Joseph produce for the appellate court the documents at issue, but the appellate court later rescinded this order. Cardiac Surgeiy filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, arguing that the trial court\u2019s order was not appealable as a final judgment and that it did not fall within the collateral order doctrine. In its motion, Cardiac Surgery asserted that the only way for St. Joseph to appeal such an order would be to refuse to comply with the order and then be adjudicated in contempt of court. In its response, St. Joseph argued that a finding of contempt was not necessary to trigger its right to appeal the Circuit Court\u2019s order and that the order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>was appealable as a final judgment under this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Department of Social Services v. Stein, </em>328 Md. 1, 612 A.2d 880 (1992). The Court of Special Appeals denied the motion to dismiss, without piejudice to the parties\u2019 right to reassert the appealability arguments in their briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Before any further proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals, this Court issued a writ of certiorari. <em>St. Joseph Medical v. Cardiac, </em>377 Md. 275, 833 A.2d 31 (2003). The parties in briefs and oral argument, in addition to addressing the merits of the Circuit Court\u2019s order, reiterate their contentions with respect to appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">We shall first address Cardiac Surgery\u2019s motion to dismiss St. Joseph\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">As this Court has emphasized on numerous occasions, very recently by Judge Raker for the Court in <em>Nnoli v. Nnoli, </em>389 Md. 315, 323, 884 A.2d 1215, 1219 (2005), \u201c[t]he general rule as to appeals is that, subject to a few, limited exceptions, a party may appeal only from a final judgment.\u201d <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1974, 2002 Repl.Vol), \u00a7 12-301 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Moreover, under Maryland law, the \u201cfew, limited exceptions\u201d to the final judgment rule number only three. Judge Wilner for the Court in <em>Salvagno v. Frew, </em>388 Md. 605, 615, 881 A.2d 660, 666 (2005), explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-9\">\u201c[W]e have made clear that the right to seek appellate review of a trial court\u2019s ruling ordinarily must await the entry of a final judgment that disposes of all claims against all parties, and that there are only three exceptions to that final judgment requirement: appeals from interlocutory orders specifically allowed by statute; immediate appeals permitted under Maiyland Rule 2-602; and appeals from interlocutory rulings allowed under the common law collateral order doctrine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number><em>See, e.g., Board of Education v. Bradford, </em>387 Md. 353, 382-386, 875 A.2d 703, 720-723 (2005); <em>In re Billy W., </em>386 Md. 675, 688-692, 874 A.2d 423, 430-434 (2005); <em>Smith v. Lead Industries, </em>386 Md. 12, 21-23, 871 A.2d 545, 550-551 (2005); <em>In re Samone H., </em>385 Md. 282, 297-298, 869 A.2d 370, 378-379 (2005); <em>Edwards v. Corbin, </em>379 Md. 278, 286 n. 4, 841 A.2d 845, 850 n. 4 (2004); <em>Frase v. Barnhart, </em>379 Md. 100, 115, 840 A.2d 114, 122-123 (2003); <em>Dawkins v. Baltimore City Police Department, </em>376 Md. 53, 58, 827 A.2d 115, 117-118 (2003); <em>Montgomery Co. v. Stevens, </em>337 Md. 471, 476-477, 654 A.2d 877, 879-880 (1995); <em>Public Service Comm\u2019n v. Patuxent Valley, </em>300 Md. 200, 207, 477 A.2d 759, 763 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">Cardiac Surgery, in arguing that the Circuit Court\u2019s decision is not appealable by St. Joseph, views the Circuit Court\u2019s order as if it were solely an interlocutory discovery order in the underlying unfair competition tort case. Thus, according to Cardiac Surgery, the order is not appealable as a final judgment and does not fall within any statute permitting interlocutory appeals. Cardiac Surgery maintains that the sole argument for appealability would be the collateral order doctrine, but that \u201cthe elements of the collateral order doctrine are not established.\u201d (Cardiac Surgery\u2019s brief at 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">If this discovery dispute were only between parties to the underlying unfair competition action, we would agree with Cardiac Surgery that no party to that action could take an immediate appeal from the discovery order. Under such circumstances, the order would be entirely interlocutory, and any appeal challenging the order would have to be by an aggrieved party after the final judgment terminating the unfair competition action in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">Furthermore, Cardiac Surgery correctly argues that the Circuit Court\u2019s order is not appealable under the collateral order doctrine. That doctrine is inapplicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">The collateral order doctrine allows, under extremely limited circumstances, an appeal from a trial court\u2019s interlocu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>tory order by a party aggrieved by that order. The doctrine was summarized in <em>Nnoli v. Nnoli, supra, </em>389 Md. at 329, 884 A.2d at 1223, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-4\">\u201cThe collateral order doctrine treats as final and appealable interlocutory orders that (1) conclusively determine the disputed question; (2) resolve an important issue; (3) resolve an issue that is completely separate from the merits of the action; and (4) would be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment. <em>Dawkins v. Baltimore Police, </em>376 Md. 53, 58, 827 A.2d 115, 118 (2003). The collateral order doctrine is a very narrow exception to the final judgment rule, and each of its four requirements is very strictly applied in Maryland. <em>Id. </em>at 58-59, 827 A.2d at 118. In particular, the fourth prong, unreviewability on appeal, \u2018is not satisfied except in \u201cextraordinary situations.\u201d\u2019 <em>Shoemaker v. Smith, </em>353 Md. 143, 170, 725 A.2d 549, 563 (1999) (quoting <em>Bunting v. State, </em>312 Md. 472, 482, 540 A.2d 805, 809 (1988))....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">The collateral order doctrine was further described in <em>Dawkins v. Baltimore City Police Department, supra, </em>376 Md. at 64, 827 A.2d at 121 (footnote omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-6\">\u201cThe collateral order doctrine is based upon a judicially created fiction, under which certain interlocutory orders are considered to be final judgments, even though such orders clearly are <em>not </em>final judgments. The justification for the fiction is a perceived necessity, in \u2018a very few ... extraordinary situations,\u2019 for immediate appellate review.\u201d Quoting <em>Bunting v. State, </em>312 Md. 472, 482, 540 A.2d 805, 809 (1988).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-7\"><em>See also, e.g., In re Foley, </em>373 Md. 627, 634, 820 A.2d 587, 591 (2003) (\u201c[I]n Maryland the four requirements of the collateral order doctrine are very strictly applied, and appeals under the doctrine may be entertained only in extraordinary circumstances\u201d); <em>In re Franklin P., </em>366 Md. 306, 327, 783 A.2d 673, 686 (2001) (\u201cThe four elements of the test are conjunctive in nature and ... each of the four elements must be met\u201d); <em>Pittsburgh Corning v. James, </em>353 Md. 657, 660-661, 728 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>210, 211-212 (1999); <em>Shoemaker v. Smith, </em>353 Md. 143, 169, 725 A.2d 549, 563 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">It is firmly settled in Maryland that, except in one very unusual situation, interlocutory discovery orders do not meet the requirements of the collateral order doctrine and are not appealable under that doctrine. Most discovery orders do not comply with the third requirement of the collateral order doctrine, as they generally are not completely separate from the merits of the lawsuit. Instead, \u201ca typical discovery order [is] aimed at ascertaining critical facts upon which the outcome of the ... controversy might depend.\u201d <em>In re Foley, supra, </em>373 Md. at 635, 820 A.2d at 587. In addition, discovery orders fail to meet the collateral order doctrine\u2019s fourth element, as they are effectively reviewable on appeal from a final judgment. <em>In re Foley, ibid. </em>A party aggrieved by a discovery order and aggrieved by the final judgment may challenge the discovery ruling on appeal from the final judgment. Furthermore, discovery orders rarely involve an \u201cextraordinary situation\u201d which is part of the collateral order doctrine\u2019s fourth element. <em>Foley, </em>373 Md. at 636, 820 A.2d at 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">As this Court concluded in the <em>Foley </em>opinion, 373 Md. at 636, 820 A.2d at 592-593,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-6\">\u201cwe have made it clear that discovery orders are only rarely appealable under the collateral order doctrine. The only circumstance in which we have upheld the appealability of interlocutory discovery orders involves a singular situation far removed from the facts of the instant case. <em>Montgomery Co. v. Stevens, supra, </em>337 Md. 471, 654 A.2d 877; <em>Public Service Comm\u2019n v. Patuxent Valley, supra, </em>300 Md. 200, 477 A.2d 759.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-7\"><em>See also Goodwich v. Nolan </em>343 Md. 130, 141 n. 8, 680 A.2d 1040, 1045 n. 8 (1996) (\u201cIn Maryland, \u2018discovery orders, being interlocutory in nature, are not ordinarily appealable prior to a final judgment terminating the case\u2019 \u201d); <em>Department of Social Services v. Stein, supra, </em>328 Md. at 7, 612 A.2d at 883 (\u201c[T]he order from which it has appealed is a discovery order, which normally is interlocutory and, consequently, nonappealable\u201d); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number><em>Price v. Orrison, </em>261 Md. 8, 9, 273 A.2d 183, 184 (1971) (Order denying \u201cseveral motions to prevent the taking of depositions\u201d was \u201cinterlocutory in nature and not falling within one of the statutory categories of appealable non-final orders;\u201d thus the appeal was dismissed).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">The \u201csingular situation,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in which this Court has held that interlocutory discovery orders are appealable under the collateral order doctrine, involves trial court orders permitting the depositions of high level governmental decision makers for the purpose of \u201c \u2018extensively] probing ... their individual decisional thought processes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Montgomery Co. v. Stevens, supra, </em>337 Md. at 479, 654 A.2d at 881, quoting <em>Public Service Comm\u2019n v. Patuxent Valley, supra, </em>300 Md. at 207, 477 A.2d at 763. The order in the present case obviously does not fall within this category.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Our conclusion that the Circuit Court\u2019s discovery order is not appealable under the collateral order doctrine, however, does not end the question of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Although the discovery order was interlocutory with regard to the underlying unfair competition litigation and the parties to that case, the order was not interlocutory with regard to St. Joseph. St. Joseph is not a party to the unfair competition case and would have no standing to challenge the discovery order by appealing from a final judgment in that case. <em>See Lopez-Sanchez v. State, </em>388 Md. 214, 224, 879 A.2d 695, 701 (2005)(\u201cA salient feature of [the general appeals] statute[ ] is that the grant of appellate rights extends only to parties\u201d). The only proceeding in which St. Joseph is a party is the \u201cmotion for a protective order\u201d proceeding pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-403<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Circuit Court\u2019s order finally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>terminated that proceeding adversely to St. Joseph. Analytically, and under our cases, the order was final as to St. Joseph and was appealable by St. Joseph as a final judgment. Under the circumstances here, and unlike the law in some other jurisdictions, Maryland law does not require a person or entity in St. Joseph\u2019s position to refuse compliance with the court\u2019s order, and be held in contempt, in order to challenge on appeal the adverse order.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\"><em>Department of Social Services v. Stein, supra, </em>328 Md. 1, 612 A.2d 880, is factually similar to the case at bar and very much on point. In <em>Stein, </em>there was pending in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City a tort action brought by tenants of residential property against their landlord, seeking damages for injuries to the tenants\u2019 child caused by lead paint poisoning. The defendant landlord had a subpoena issued to the Baltimore City Department of Social Services, seeking records of the Department relating to welfare payments to the plaintiffs and other records relating to the plaintiffs. The Baltimore City Department of Social Services was not a party to the underlying tort action. The Department filed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Circuit Court a motion for a protective order, asserting that the records sought were confidential and protected by privilege. The Circuit Court denied the motion for a protective order, and the Department appealed. The appellee Stein, arguing for the dismissal of the appeal, \u201cquestion[ed] whether the order has the requisite finality since the appellant has not been held in contempt.\u201d <em>Stein, </em>328 Md. at 8, 612 A.2d at 883.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">This Court in <em>Stein, </em>in an opinion by Judge Bell, pointed out that the federal cases, since the decision in <em>Alexander v. United States, </em>201 U.S. 117, 26 S.Ct. 356, 50 L.Ed. 686 (1906), would support the position of the appellee Stein and would require that one in the Department\u2019s position be held in contempt in order to challenge the order on appeal. The Court in <em>Stein </em>went on to point out that \u201c[w]e have declined to follow the <em>Alexander </em>rule,\u201d <em>Stein, </em>328 Md. at 16, 612 A.2d at 887, and that \u201c[t]he appellant\u2019s right to appeal is not dependent upon its being held in contempt.\u201d 328 Md. at 21, 612 A.2d at 891. In holding that the Department could appeal the order, the Court in <em>Stein </em>stated (328 Md. at 13, 612 A.2d at 886):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-5\">\u201cWith regard to the appellant and the appellee, the ruling has all of the attributes of finality recognized by this Court; it settles the rights of the appellant and the appellee in the records sought to be discovered....

Judicial Watch, </em>356 Md. 118, 126, 737 A.2d 592, 596 (1999) (This Court pointed out that the order in the <em>Stein </em>case was appealable because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>appellant \u201cwas a non-party to the underlying action, as to whom the discovery disclosure order had all the attributes of finality recognized by this Court\u201d); <em>Unnamed Attorney v.

In 1981, as part of the general re-codification of some of the statutes relating to health matters, the medical review committee privilege was re-codified, by Ch. 8 of the Acts of 1981, as \u00a7 14-601(d) and (e) of the Health Occupations Article. According to the Revisor\u2019s Note, the 1981 re-codification was \u201cwithout substantive change from Art. 43, \u00a7 134A.\u201d <em>See </em>Laws of Maryland 1981 at 605.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">From 1976 until October 1, 1997, the critical language of the medical review committee privilege remained unchanged. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>provided that \u201cthe proceedings, records, and files of a medical review committee are not discoverable and are not admissible in evidence in any civil action <em>arising out of matters that are being reviewed and evaluated by the medical review committee.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). By Ch. 696 of the Acts of 1997, effective October 1, 1997, the above-quoted italicized limitation was deleted so that the privilege applied \u201cin any civil action\u201d without limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">As a result of subsequent re-numbering of sections of the Health Occupations Article, the medical review committee privilege is now codified as \u00a7 l-401(d) and (e) of the Health Occupations Article. The pertinent language of \u00a7 1-401 (d) and (e) is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-5\">\u201c(d) <em>Proceedings, records, and files confidential and not admissible or </em>discoverable.\u2014(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the proceedings, records, and files of a medical review committee are not discoverable and are not admissible in evidence in any civil action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">\u201c(e) Same\u2014Exceptions.\u2014Subsection (d)(1) of this section does not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-8\">(1) A civil action brought by a party to the proceedings of the medical review committee who claims to be aggrieved by the decision of the medical review committee; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-9\">(2) Any record or document that is considered by the medical \u2022 review committee and that otherwise would be subject to discovery and introduction into evidence in a civil trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">In <em>Unnamed Physician v. Comm\u2019n, </em>285 Md. 1, 12, 400 A.2d 396, 402 (1979), Judge Cole for the Court indicated that the privilege would apply to \u201cthe matters reviewed by a medical review committee\u201d if the materials were sought in an action like \u201ca tort action for medical malpractice.\u201d With regard to the overall purpose of the privilege, Judge Cole continued (285 Md. at 13, 400 A.2d at 403):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>\u201cA ... fundamental reason for preserving confidentiality in these proceedings is to ensure a high quality of peer review activity leading to the primary goal of this legislation\u2014to provide better health care.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">The medical review committee privilege was again considered by this Court in <em>Baltimore Sun v. University of Maryland, Medical System,, </em>321 Md. 659, 584 A.2d 683 (1991). This Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Baltimore Sun, </em>written by Chief Judge Murphy, reiterated what was said in the <em>Unnamed Physician </em>case, and reviewed with approval numerous authorities emphasizing the importance and broad scope of the privilege (321 Md. at 666-667, 584 A.2d at 686-687):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-5\">\u201cThe statutory protection afforded medical review committee records by \u00a7 14-601(d) [now \u00a7 1-401 (d) ] is seemingly premised upon and consistent with the view expressed in Comment, <em>The Medical Review Committee Privilege: A Jtmsdictional Survey, </em>67 N.C.L.Rev. 179, at 179 (1988): \u2018[P]hysicians are frequently reluctant to participate in peer review evaluations for fear of exposure to liability, entanglement in malpractice litigation, loss of referrals from other doctors, and a variety of other reasons. To combat this reluctance and to enhance the improvement of medical care services, at least forty-six states now have statutes that protect the work of medical review committees.\u2019 Another commentator noted that the major purpose behind the medical review committee privilege is to permit the committee to work in a confidential setting in which individual members may engage in a candid and conscientious evaluation of clinical practices within the institution. <em>See </em>Hall, <em>Hospital Committee Proceedings and Reports: Their Legal Status, </em>1 Am.J.L. &amp; Med. 245, 25A-54 (1975). Statutory protection of peer review activities is supported by the notion that they result in increased peer review activity and that such activity improves medical care. Comment, <em>Medical Peer Review Protection in the Health Care Industry, </em>53 Temple L.Q. 552 (1979).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-6\">\u201cCourts in other states, in construing their own statutes have held that confidentiality is essential to the proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>functioning of medical review committees. For example, in <em>Jenkins v. Wu, </em>102 Ill.2d 468, 82 Ill.Dec. 382, 468 N.E.2d 1162, <em>supra </em>(1984), the court held that an exception in the Illinois medical review committee statute which granted a physician access to otherwise confidential materials in the \u2018limited circumstances of a hospital proceeding to decide upon a physician\u2019s staff privileges or in any judicial review thereof,\u2019 <em>id., </em>82 Ill.Dec. at 387, 468 N.E.2d at 1167 (citation omitted), did not open the door for discovery of those same documents in malpractice cases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">The <em>Baltimore Sun </em>opinion continued (321 Md. at 668, 584 A.2d at 687):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-5\">\u201cWe think it readily apparent that the statutory protection thereby afforded by \u00a7 14-601(d) is premised upon legislative appreciation that a high level of confidentiality is necessary for effective medical peer review. By protecting these records from public access in those situations covered by \u00a7 14-601(d), the legislature recognized that a system of effective medical peer review outweighs the need for complete public disclosure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">Turning to the case at bar, the issue and arguments before the Circuit Court exclusively concerned the meaning and scope of the basic privilege language in \u00a7 1^401(d)(l), which states that \u201cthe proceedings, records, and files of a medical review committee are not discoverable and are not admissible in evidence in any civil action.\u201d No party in the Circuit Court raised any issue with regard to the \u201cexceptions\u201d contained in \u00a7 l-401(e), and the trial judge did not consider subsection (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">The Circuit Court, in its opinion accompanying the order, gave two reasons for deciding that the \u201cemails, letters, correspondences, and testimony of certain hospital staff, mostly nurses,\u201d to a medical review committee, were not privileged under the language of \u00a7 l-401(d)(l). First, the Circuit Court held that the privilege protected only materials generated by the committee, <em>i.e. </em>in the court\u2019s language, \u201cmaterials institut<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>ed by an act of a <em>committee.\u201d </em>Second, the Circuit Court alternatively held that, even if the privilege were otherwise applicable, \u201cthe policy of lawful competition outweighs the policy of the privilege.\u201d As previously mentioned, the court, as did Cardiac Surgery, relied on <em>Price v. Howard County General Hospital, supra, </em>950 F.Supp. 141, in support of this position.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">We disagree with both reasons advanced by the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Nothing in the language of \u00a7 1-401 (d)(1) supports the position of the Circuit Court and Cardiac Surgery that only documents generated by the medical review committee itself are privileged, and that written statements and testimony submitted to the committee by nurses, physicians, or other hospital staff, concerning incidents involving physicians which staff members believe should be investigated or addressed by the committee, are not privileged. The critical statutory language is \u201cthe proceedings, records, and files of a medical review committee.\u201d The words \u201crecords\u201d and \u201cfiles\u201d are broad. A letter or testimony by a nurse to a review committee concerning an incident involving a physician, which is considered by the committee and may have resulted in a committee investigation or inquiry, would normally become part of the committee\u2019s \u201crecord\u201d or \u201cfile\u201d regarding the matter. The plain language of the statute is inconsistent with the Circuit Court\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">The Circuit Court\u2019s and Cardiac Surgery\u2019s interpretation of the statute would require the insertion, after the statutory phrase \u201crecords, and files of a medical review committee,\u201d of the words \u201cgenerated by the medical review committee.\u201d This Court, however, has repeatedly stated that \u201c[w]e will not ... \u2018judicially insert language [into a statute] to impose exceptions, limitations, or restrictions not set forth by the legislature.\u201d <em>O\u2019Connor v. Baltimore County, </em>382 Md. 102, 113, 854 A.2d 1191, 1198 (2004), quoting <em>Langston v. Langston, </em>366 Md. 490, 515, 784 A.2d 1086, 1100 (2001). <em>See e.g., Lee v. Cline, </em>384 Md. 245, 257, 863 A.2d 297, 304 (2004); <em>Melton v. State, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>379 Md. 471, 477, 842 A.2d 743, 746 (2004) (\u201c[W]e will not add or delete words from the statute\u201d). Neither the language nor the purpose of \u00a7 1\u2014401(d)(1) supports, the Circuit Court\u2019s and Cardiac Surgery\u2019s view of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Furthermore, nothing in the Department of Legislative Reference\u2019s bill file concerning Ch. 722 of the Acts of 1976 which originally enacted the privilege, or in subsequent legislative history associated with amendments to the privilege, suggests that the privilege is limited to documents generated by the medical review committee itself. The Department of Legislative Reference\u2019s bill file on Ch. 696 of the Acts of 1997, which broadened the privilege, is quite extensive, consisting of committee reports, testimony supporting the bill, and other documents. There is no indication in any of this material that the privilege attaches only to \u201cacts\u201d of a committee and excludes statements made to a committee. On the contrary, the reports and testimony underscore the breadth, need, and importance of the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Although most states have statutes creating a medical review committee privilege, the wording of the statutes varies considerably. Furthermore, there are only a limited number of state supreme court decisions dealing with the issue now before us, under statutes with the same or similar wording to that contained in \u00a7 l-401(d). For a general review of state statutes and judicial decisions, <em>see </em>Charles David Creek, <em>The Medical Review Committee Privilege: A Jurisdictional Survey, </em>67 N.C.L.Rev. 179 (1988); Susan O. Schentzow and Sylvia Lynn Gillis, <em>Confidentiality and Privilege of Peer Review Information: More Imagined Than Real, </em>7 Journal of Law and Health 169 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">One case very much on point is <em>Cruger v. Love, </em>599 So.2d 111 (Florida 1992). The section granting a privilege in Florida\u2019s medical review committee statute is worded like \u00a7 1-401(d)(1) of the Maryland statute, and in <em>Cruger, </em>599 So.2d at 113, the party seeking to discover documents argued that they were not privileged because they were \u201cnot generated by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>committee.... \u201d In rejecting the argument, the Supreme Court of Florida held as follows (599 So.2d at 113-114):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-v\">\u201cThe statutes do not define what constitutes records of a committee or board. Therefore, we must look to the legislative intent and policy behind the statutes to determine the extent of the privilege. See <em>White v. Pepsico, Inc., </em>568 So.2d 886, 889 (Fla.1990); <em>Devin v. City of Hollywood, </em>351 So.2d 1022, 1023 (Fla.[App.]1976). We have previously held that \u2018[t]he discovery privilege ... was clearly designed to provide that degree of confidentiality necessary for the full, frank medical peer evaluation which the legislature sought to encourage.\u2019 <em>Holly v. Auld, </em>450 So.2d at 220. Without the privilege, information necessary to the peer review process could not be obtained. <em>Feldman v. Glucroft, </em>522 So.2d 798, 801 (Fla.1988). While we recognized in <em>Holly </em>that the discovery privilege would impinge upon the rights of litigants to obtain information helpful or even essential to their cases, we assumed that the legislature balanced that against the benefits offered by effective self-policing by the medical community. <em>Holly, </em>450 So.2d at 220.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-4\">\u201cWe hold that the privilege provided by sections 766.101(5) and 395.011(9), Florida Statutes, protects any document considered by the committee or board as part of its decision-making process. The policy of encouraging full candor in peer review proceedings is advanced only if all documents considered by the committee or board during the peer review or credentialing process are protected. Committee members and those providing information to the committee must be able to operate without fear of reprisal. Similarly, it is essential that doctors seeking hospital privileges disclose all pertinent information to the committee. Physicians who fear that information provided in an application might someday be used against them by a third party will be reluctant to fully detail matters that the committee should consider.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-5\"><em>See, also, e.g., McGee v. Bruce Hospital System, </em>312 S.C. 58, 62, 439 S.E.2d 257, 260 (1993) (\u201cWe interpret the legislative intent to protect not only documents generated by the commit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>tee, but also documents acquired by the committee in the course of its proceedings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">The above-quoted holdings could also be applied to \u00a7 1-401(d)(1) of the Maryland statute. In light of the wording and purpose of \u00a7 l-401(d)(l), the basic coverage of the privilege statute is not limited to documents generated by a medical review committee itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The Circuit Court\u2019s alternative position, that the Maryland policy underlying an \u201cunfair competition\u201d tort case \u201coutweighs the policy of the privilege,\u201d and the court\u2019s reliance on Price <em>v. Howard County General Hospital, supra, </em>950 F.Supp. 141, were also clearly in error. The <em>Price </em>case was an action under the federal antitrust statutes, where \u201cfederal,\u201d not Maryland, \u201claw of privileges [was] applicable,\u201d and thus \u201cthe Maryland medical peer review privilege [was] not controlling.\u201d <em>Price, </em>950 F.Supp. at 142-143. As a matter <em>o\u00ed federal </em>law, the policy of \u201cthe federal antitrust laws\u201d was held to \u201coutweigh the policies underlying the state privilege.\u201d <em>Price, </em>950 F.Supp. at 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The present case, on the other hand, involves exclusively Maryland law and Maryland policy. The \u201cweighing\u201d was done by the Maryland General Assembly, which decided that, where the privilege was applicable, it outweighed the need for the privileged material \u201cin any civil action.\u201d \u00a7 l-401(d)(l). <em>See Baltimore Sun v. University of Maryland Medical System, supra, </em>321 Md. at 668, 584 A.2d at 687 (\u201c[T]he legislature recognized that a system of effective medical peer review outweighs the need for ... disclosure\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The expansion of the privilege, by Ch. 696 of the Acts of 1997, is particularly instructive in this regard. As earlier discussed, prior to 1997 the privilege only applied in a \u201ccivil action arising out of matters that are being reviewed and evaluated by the medical review committee.\u201d The 1997 change, however, extended the privilege to \u201cany civil action.\u201d Certainly, a Maryland tort action based on alleged unfair competition and interference with economic relations falls within the statutory phrase \u201cany civil action.\u201d The Floor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Report by the House Environmental Matters Committee on House Bill 775 of the 1997 General Assembly session, which bill became Ch. 696, stated as follows (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar\">\u201cUnder current law, the proceedings, records, and files of a medical review committee are not admissible in any civil action that arise out of matters that are being reviewed and evaluated by the medical review committee. HB 775 would expand coverage to all types of civil litigation. This is important because a hospital can get subpoenas in divorce actions, <em>antitrust actions, </em>car accidents, health insurance disputes, etc. This can make important documents public records and drag doctors into collateral litigation as witnesses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">There is little doubt that the General Assembly intended the privilege to be applicable in Maryland tort actions based on alleged unfair competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">In sum, the grounds for disallowing the privilege advanced by Cardiac Surgery in the trial court, and accepted by the trial court, are erroneous and do not support the trial court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">Cardiac Surgery, for the first time in its brief in this Court, relies on the exception to the privilege set forth in \u00a7 1-401(e)(2), which provides (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-9\">\u201cSubsection (d)(1) of this section does not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-10\">(2) Any record or document that is considered by the medical review committee and that <em>otherwise </em>would be subject to discovery and introduction into evidence in a civil trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">Cardiac Surgery, in this Court, contends that \u00a7 l-401(e)(2) supports its argument that only materials generated by a medical review committee fall within the privilege set forth in \u00a7 1\u2014401(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>As indicated above, no issue concerning \u00a7 1-401 (e)(2) was raised in the trial court or considered by the trial judge. Furthermore, although the \u201cprivilege log\u201d is contained in the record extract, none of the disputed documents themselves are before us. Accordingly, it would be difficult for this Court to finally decide anything regarding the specific disputed documents, other than our holdings, as set forth above, that the two grounds relied on by the trial court are erroneous and, therefore, do not support the trial court\u2019s order. Nevertheless, \u201cto guide the trial court\u201d and \u201cto avoid the expense and delay of another appeal\u201d (Rule 8\u2014181(a)), we shall comment on the applicability of \u00a7 1\u2014401(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">This Court in <em>Baltimore Sun v. University of Maryland Medical System, supra, </em>321 Md. 659, 584 A.2d 683, previously commented on the exception now set forth in \u00a7 l-401(e)(2), and then codified as \u00a7 14-601(e)(2). Chief Judge Murphy for the Court there stated (321 Md. at 665, 584 A.2d at 686):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayo\">\u201cThe subsequent recodification of these provisions as \u00a7 14-601(d) and (e)(1) and (2) was accomplished by ch. 8 of the Acts of 1981. According to the \u2018Revisor\u2019s Note,\u2019 the recodification was without substantive change from former Article 43, \u00a7 134A.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">There appears to be no additional legislative history, either in 1976 or 1981 or later, which casts any light on the General Assembly\u2019s intent concerning this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">As pointed out by the Revisor in 1981, a broad literal reading of the exception would do away with the privilege. Such an interpretation would be unreasonable and would violate the principle that statutes should not, if possible, be given an unreasonable interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>The only indication of \u00a7 l-401(e)(2)\u2019s meaning is found in judicial opinions from other states. Similar language has been interpreted to mean that, although a party to a lawsuit cannot get the documents from the hospital of which the review committee is a part, nevertheless if such documents are otherwise properly available from other sources and otherwise admissible, the party may obtain them from such other sources. The fact that they are also in a medical review committee\u2019s tile does not preclude obtaining them from other sources. <em>See, e.g., Sun Health Corp. v.

Whether documents in Cardiac Surgery\u2019s possession fall within the exception must be determined by the trial circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Our decision in this case does not go beyond the holding that the two grounds relied upon by the trial court, for deciding that the privilege was inapplicable, are not- valid.

Of those 118 documents, 117 of them had been produced by Cardiac Surgery and one had been produced by MidAtlantic.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b109-9\">. It is unclear how the parties gained control of the documents; however, employees of both Cardiac Surgery and MidAtlantic had access to many of the documents because they had participated in the peer review process of the medical review committees at St. Joseph. In fact, Dr. Garth McDonald, Cardiac Surgery's president, served as chief of the division of cardiac surgery at St. Joseph and wrote or received many of the contested documents in that capacity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b116-8\">. <em>In re Foley, supra, </em>373 Md. at 636, 820 A.2d at 593.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b116-9\">.

Cardiac Surgery also argues that St. Joseph lacked standing in the Circuit Court to file a motion for a protective order under Rule 2-403. Cardiac Surgery contends that St. Joseph was neither \u201ca party\u201d nor \u201ca person from whom discovery is sought\" within the language of the Rule. In our view, St. Joseph qualified as a person from whom discovery was sought within the intent of the Rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b128-5\"> Somewhat cryptically, the Revisor\u2019s Note appended to \u00a7 14-601 'calls to the attention of the General Assembly that present Art. 43, \u00a7 134A(d) states in its first sentence that certain documents are privileged from discovery and admission into evidence and then in its third sentence provides for an exception that seemingly is as broad as the privilege. The revised language in this section closely follows the present law. However, the Commission believes that present Art. 43, \u00a7 134A(d), and, in turn, this section, may not state the intent of the General Assembly.' \"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b130-6\">. House Bill 1035 of the 1976 General Assembly session became Ch. 722 of the Acts of 1976 which initially created medical review committees, provided that material in committee records and files was privileged, and granted immunity from damage suits for committees, members thereof, and persons or organizations providing information to committees. As originally introduced, the language of the exception, which later became \u00a7 1-401(e)(2), more clearly reflected the position of the above-cited out-of-state cases as to the exception's meaning. During House Bill 1035\u2019s journey through the General Assembly, the subsections relating to privilege and immunity from suit were entirely re-written. The final wording of the exception is essentially the same as the present wording of \u00a7 l-401(e)(2). While there is a Department of Legislative Reference file on House Bill 1035, it contains very little material and fails to explain why the language of the exception was changed. Whether the change was intended to be simply stylistic or, on the other hand, was intended to be substantive, is a mystery. Absent any indication of legislative intent to the contrary, we shall, as indicated above, assume that the change was simply stylistic.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
