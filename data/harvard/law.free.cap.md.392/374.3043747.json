Petitioner\u2019s condominium unit is located in Baltimore County at the condominium regime known as The Cloister\u2019s at Charles Condominium (\u201cCondominium\u201d). The Cloisters at Charles, Inc. (\u201cRespondent\u201d or \u201cCouncil\u201d) is a duly organized corporation, serving as the Condominium\u2019s council of owners. Petitioner asserts that the Condominium\u2019s Declaration gives her the right via an express grant of easement to install the <em>exterior </em>vent. In opposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>to that argument, respondent contends that such installation of an exterior vent is a violation of the Condominium\u2019s Bylaws\u2019 prohibition against alteration of the exterior facade of the condominium units.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">On July 1, 2003, respondent filed a Complaint for Permanent Injunction in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County against petitioner, seeking a court order for removal of the exterior dryer exhaust vent in question. On June 28, 2004, petitioner filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, which was denied. The Circuit Court found in favor of respondent and on August 18, 2004, issued a Memorandum Decision and Order entering a declaratory judgment and a mandatory injunction compelling petitioner to remove the aforementioned exhaust vent. On September 8, 2004, petitioner filed a Notice of Appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. In response, on September 9, 2004, the Circuit Court stayed the injunction pending resolution of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court. Petitioner filed a petition for writ of certiorari, which we granted. <em>Garfink v. The Cloisters, </em>389 Md. 398, 885 A.2d 823 (2005). We are presented three questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">\u201c1. Did the Court of Special Appeals err when it ruled that \u2018traditional easement law\u2019 does not apply to easements granted in condominium documents?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-8\">\u201c2. Did the Court of Special Appeals err when it affirmed the Trial Court\u2019s judgment that the easement contained in the condominium\u2019s declaration did not allow Petitioner, without the prior approval of Respondent, to repair a defect in her dryer vent system by relocating the vent to the exterior of her house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-9\">\u201c3. Did the Court of Special Appeals err when it affirmed the Trial Court\u2019s judgment that the by-laws of the condominium required Petitioner to obtain the prior approval of Respondent before she could repair a defect in her dryer vent system by relocating the vent to the exterior of her house?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>We find that traditional easement law applies to easements granted in condominium documents and, therefore, the Court of Special Appeals erred in its holding that the easement did not apply. In addition, under the particular factual circumstances extant in this case and due to our resolution in regards to the easement, we find that petitioner was within the bounds of the express grant of the easement to install the exterior dryer exhaust vent without the prior approval of respondent and, under the limited circumstances here present, was not subject to the \u201cprior approval\u201d provision contained within the Condominium\u2019s Bylaws and, in any event, because it came under an exception contained in the Bylaws, petitioner\u2019s actions did not violate the Bylaws\u2019 provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">We quote from the unreported opinion of the Court of Special Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">\u201c[Petitioner] is the owner of a condominium unit at the regime known as The Cloisters at Charles Condominiums, in Baltimore County. [Respondent] is the duly organized corporation which serves as the council of condominium unit owners. As such, [respondent] is obligated to provide maintenance and to enforce the declaration, rules, and regulations of the regime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-8\">\u201cIn 1991, [petitioner] purchased her condominium unit [one of the model units] at The Cloisters during the development and construction phase of the project. The original construction included installed household appliances in each unit, a clothes dryer among them. As originally installed, the clothes dryer was connected and vented into the furnace room, rather than to the outside of the building, contrary to the terms of the construction contract, and in violation of prevailing building codes and regulations.<footnotemark>[1]</footnotemark> The venting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>system ran from the clothes dryer through the kitchen floor and into the basement furnace room. During the normal operation of the clothes dryer, the vent system would carry and discharge the dryer\u2019s exhaust, heat, lint, and moisture into the furnace room. The furnace room contained two furnaces and a hot water heater, each of which were fired by gas burners. This potentially hazardous mixture of elements was extant for approximately nine years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-5\">\u201cIn 2000, the clothes dryer fell ill and [petitioner], in response, purchased a replacement from Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. After viewing the existing vent system, however, Sears refused to install the replacement because a \u2018fire hazzard [sic] was identified.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-6\">\u201cWith the discovery that the vent system posed a fire hazard, and upon refusal of Sears to install the new dryer to that system, [petitioner] took it upon herself to [have] the venting system [re-routed]. The new system was routed from the dryer through the wall of the laundry room into the adjoining garage, then through the garage and through the exterior wall. A standard vent appliance, which discharged the dryer exhaust and lint to the outside, was installed into the exterior of the garage wall. [Petitioner] concedes that she neither sought nor obtained permission of the [respondent] to install the exterior vent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-7\">\u201cIn short time, the new venting system created novel problems for [petitioner] and her immediate neighbor, Dr. Oscar Kantt. The new vent was within 17 feet of the front door of Dr. Kantt\u2019s residence. Objecting on various grounds to the placement of the vent, Dr. Kantt complained to the [respondent] about the discharge. [Petitioner], Dr. Kantt, and the [respondent] were unable to resolve the matter amicably; consequently, this litigation ensued.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-8\">\u201cBy virtue of her purchase of the condominium unit, [petitioner] agreed, as did all other purchasers, to the terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>of the Condominium Declaration and By-Laws.<footnotemark>[2]</footnotemark>\u201d [Footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">On July 1, 2003, respondent filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County requesting a permanent injunction in which petitioner would be required to immediately remove the exterior dryer exhaust vent and then make an application to respondent for permission to install an exterior dryer exhaust vent.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The absence of an exhaust vent for the dryer resulted from an inherently defective installation of the appliance. The builder apparently simply forgot to install the vent.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">The parties conceded that the Baltimore County Building Code<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> requires the venting of clothes dryer exhaust outside of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>a building and that, if application were made, respondent would have to authorize the installation of an exterior dryer exhaust vent in some shape or form. The trial court first stayed the proceedings in order to afford an opportunity to the parties to negotiate a resolution. The parties apparently could not agree on the placement of the vent. Some of the suggestions of the respondent would have further violated the building code. On July 28, 2004, after negotiations had failed in reaching an independent resolution, the Circuit Court conducted a one-day trial. As stated, the Circuit Court found in favor of respondent and issued a Memorandum Decision and Order on August 18, 2004. The order stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-5\">\u201cORDERED that the [respondent\u2019s] Motion for Injunctive Relief is GRANTED, to take effect sixty (60) days from the date of this Order and furthermore, until the effective date of said Injunction, [petitioner] may, in compliance with the rules and Bylaws of the condominium, seek approval from [respondent] in order to find a reasonable resolution to the location of the dryer vent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The Circuit Court based its decision upon an analysis of the Condominium\u2019s Declaration and Bylaws and, in the accompanying memorandum decision, discussed its reasoning, stating in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">\u201cViewed as a whole, including the pertinent sections of the Declaration and the Bylaws, they are not in conflict but rather compliment each other. Neither the Declaration nor the Bylaws authorize a unit owner to make any changes to the exterior of the unit such as those made by the [petitioner], The Court does not interpret the easement contained in section 15.2 of the Declaration to grant a unit owner the right to independently alter the exterior of her unit, especially when the easement is considered along with the prohibition on unapproved exterior alterations expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>identified in the Bylaws. After reviewing the relevant portions of the condominium documents, the Court finds that it was the intention of the Unit Owners to permit individual unit owners to maintain the services to their units in a manner that does not alter the exterior appearance of their unit. In the event that some alterations are necessary, the unit owners must adhere to the proper procedures as outlined in the Bylaws. [Footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\">\u201c[Petitioner] neither notified nor obtained consent from the [respondent] concerning her plans to install a dryer vent on the outside wall of her condominium unit. Upon learning of the unauthorized installation, the [respondent] notified [petitioner] that it did not approve of the vent because of its location and proximity to the front entrance of a neighboring unit. The [respondent] made numerous written demands on the [petitioner] to remove the vent and restore the common elements of the condominium to their original condition. The [petitioner] acted in direct contravention of these demands as well as of the express terms of the Bylaws.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">\u201cThe [petitioner] suggested that county codes and/or regulations require certain types of dryers to be vented outside. She argues that in order to comply with those regulations she was permitted to install the vent outside. Even if outside ventilation was required, there were other alternatives to the location chosen by the [petitioner]. Even the [petitioner\u2019s] experts agreed that the current location of the vent is not the only place where the dryer could be vented. Had the [petitioner] properly sought permission to install the vent and been unreasonably denied, that would have been another issue entirely. However, the [petitioner] never provided the [respondent] with an opportunity to suggest a reasonable solution or alternative to the placement of the vent prior to its installation. Instead, she chose to ignore the procedures governing pre-approval of structural modifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>cation and took the risk that the [respondent] might [ ] object to her unilateral decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">On September 8, 2004, petitioner timely noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals and on September 9, 2004, the Circuit Court stayed the injunction pending resolution of that appeal. The Court of Special Appeals heard arguments and, on July 22, 2005, filed an unreported opinion affirming the Circuit Court decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">The case <em>sub judice </em>was tried in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. Pursuant to Maryland Rule 8\u2014131(c), we review the case on both the law and the evidence. We give due regard to the trial court\u2019s judgment of the witnesses\u2019 credibility and will not set aside the judgment of the Circuit Court based upon the evidence unless we find it to be clearly erroneous. Md. Rule 8-131(c). As we recently stated in <em>Gray v. </em>State, 388 Md. 366, 879 A.2d 1064 (2005):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-8\">\u201cThe clearly erroneous standard does not apply to legal conclusions. <em>Nesbit v. GEICO, </em>382 Md. 65, 72, 854 A.2d 879, 883 (2004). \u2018When the trial court\u2019s order \u201cinvolves an interpretation and application of Maryland statutory and case law, our Court must determine whether the lower court\u2019s conclusions are legally correct under a <em>de novo </em>standard of review.\u201d \u2019 <em>Nesbit, </em>382 Md. at 72, 854 A.2d at 883 (quoting <em>Walter v. Gunter, </em>367 Md. 386, 392, 788 A.2d 609, 612 (2002)).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-9\"><em>Gray, </em>388 Md. at 374-75, 879 A.2d at 1068. In addition, discussing Maryland Rule 886, predecessor to Rule 8-131 (c), the Court found that \u201cit is equally obvious that the \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 portion of [the] Rule [ ] does not apply to a trial court\u2019s determinations of legal questions or conclusions of law based upon findings of fact.\u201d <em>Davis v. Davis, </em>280 Md. 119, 124, 372 A.2d 231, 233 (1977) (citing <em>Clemson v. Butler Aviation-Friendship, Inc., </em>266 Md. 666, 671, 296 A.2d 419, 422 (1972)). The issue of whether traditional easement law applies to condominiums is a question of law, and thus, we review it <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">In addressing tb\u00b0 questions before the Court it is first necessary to review some of the law relative to the condominium form of ownership. The Court in <em>Ridgely Condominium Association, Inc. v. Smyrnioudis, </em>343 Md. 357, 681 A.2d 494 (1996), succinctly described the structure of condominiums:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar5\">\u201cA condominium is a \u2018communal form of estate in property consisting of individually owned units which are supported by collectively held facilities and areas.\u2019 <em>Andrews v. City of Greenbelt, </em>293 Md. 69, 71, 441 A.2d 1064 (1982).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjK\">The term condominium may be defined generally as a system for providing separate ownership of individual units in multiple-unit developments. In addition to the interest acquired in a particular apartment, each unit owner also is a tenant in common in the underlying fee and in the spaces and building parts used in common by all the unit owners.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">4B Richard R. Powell, <em>Powell on Real Property </em>\u00b6 632.1[4] (1996). A condominium owner, therefore, holds a hybrid property interest consisting of an exclusive ownership of a particular unit or apartment and a tenancy in common with the other co-owners in the common elements.<footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark> <em>Andrews, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number><em>supra, </em>293 Md. at 73-74, 441 A.2d 1064; <em>see also Starfish Condo, v.

It is evident that condominiums are treated like real property, as \u201c[e]ach unit in a condominium has all of the incidents of real property.\u201d \u00a7 ll-106(a). Condominiums shall be governed by a council of unit owners comprised of all unit owners in the condominium. \u00a7 ll-109(a). In regards to improvements, alterations or additions by the unit owner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-7\"><em>\u201cSubject to the provisions of the declaration or bylaws </em>and other provisions of law, a unit owner:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-8\">(1) May make any improvements or alterations to his unit that do not impair the structural integrity or mechanical systems or lessen the support of any portion of the condominium;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-9\">(2) May not alter, make additions to, or change the appearance of the common elements, or the exterior appearance of a unit or any other portion of the condominium, without permission of the council of unit owners.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>\u00a7 11-115 (emphasis added). Section 11-124 provides guidance towards the harmonization of the various condominium instruments. Subsection (c) states that: \u201cThe declaration, bylaws, and condominium plat shall be construed together and shall be deemed to incorporate one another to the extent that any requirement of this title as to the content of one shall be deemed satisfied if the deficiency can be cured by reference to any of the others.\u201d \u00a7 ll-124(c). Subsection (e) provides the hierarchy of the condominium instruments should conflict arise, stating: \u201cIf there is any conflict among the provisions of this title, the declaration, condominium plat, bylaws, or rules adopted pursuant to \u00a7 11-111 of this title, the provisions of each shall control in the succession listed hereinbefore commencing with \u2018title\u2019.\u201d \u00a7 ll-124(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">It is against this backdrop of the Maryland Condominium Act that the questions presented in the case <em>sub judice </em>must be addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">A. <em>Traditional Easement Law Applies to Condominiums</em></p>\n<p id=\"AVa\">The Condominium\u2019s Declaration states in Article 15.2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-7\">\u201cIn addition to any easement established by law, each unit shall have, appurtenant thereto, <em>an easement in the common elements for the purposes of providing maintenance, support, repair or service for such unit to and for the ducts, pipes, conduits, vents, plumbing, wiring and other utility services to the unit.\u201d </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">The Court of Special Appeals, in its unreported opinion, discussed this language, finding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-9\">\u201cConversely, however, each such condominium unit must also shoulder the burden associated with that interest, thereby becoming both the servient <em>and, </em>the dominant estate. This scenario is distinguishable from the traditional concept of easement, whereby one party obtains an easement for his or her benefit and another party must shoulder the obligations associated with that benefit.<footnotemark>[7]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>\u201cWe believe [petitioner\u2019s] interpretation to be strained, and that the mutual obligations and benefits of condominium ownership do not call for the application of traditional easement law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Petitioner contends that the Court of Special Appeals erred in its decision finding that traditional easement law does not apply to condominiums. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">The Court of Special Appeals\u2019 reasoning in regards to the treatment of the easement is flawed. The traditional law of easements applies to condominiums. <em>See </em>\u00a7 11\u2014106(a) (\u201cEach unit in a condominium has <em>all </em>of the incidents of real property.\u201d (Emphasis added.)); <em>Ridgely, </em>343 Md. at 370, 681 A.2d at 501. Furthermore, the Condominium\u2019s Declaration specifically provides in Article 6.1 that \u201c[e]ach unit in the Condominium has <em>all </em>the incidents of real property and the owner of a unit shall have such estate therein as may be acquired in real property....\u201d [Emphasis added].</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">\u201cAn easement is the \u2018nonpossessory interest in the real property of another\u2019 and arises through express grant or implication.\u201d <em>Stansbury v. MDR, </em>390 Md. 476, 486, 889 A.2d 403, 409 (2006) (citing <em>Boucher v. Boyer, </em>301 Md. 679, 688, 484 A.2d 630, 635 (1984)); <em>Calvert Joint Venture </em># <em>140 v.

Summit Park Co., </em>146 Md. 234, 239, 126 A. 280, 281-82 (1924). \u2018In every instance of a private easement\u2014 that is, an easement not enjoyed by the public\u2014there exists the characteristic feature of two distinct tenements\u2014one dominant and the other servient.\u2019 <em>Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs of Garrett County v.

McCardell, </em>178 Md. 132, 136, 12 A.2d 522, 524 (1940) (citation omitted). The generally accepted rule for an express easement is \u2018that [because] an easement is a restriction upon the rights of the servient property owner, no alteration can be made by the owner of the dominant estate which would increase such restriction except by mutual consent of both parties.\u2019 <em>Reid v.

There are, however, in contrast to the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 opinion, instances in which a dominant and servient estate may <em>both </em>benefit and shoulder the burden of a particular covenant or easement. This can occur in the situation of an implied negative reciprocal easement. As we discussed in <em>McKenrick v.

In any case, while not explicitly stated in Maryland case law, we find that reciprocity of benefit and burden can exist between dominant and servient estates.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">In the case <em>sub judice </em>the language in Article 15.2 of the Condominium\u2019s Declaration creates an express easement. An easement is granted to the dominant estate, appurtenant to the individual condominium units (in this case petitioner\u2019s unit), \u201cin the common elements,\u201d i.e., the exterior of the unit, by the servient estate, the Condominium, \u201cfor the purpose of providing maintenance, support, repair or service for such unit and to and for the <em>ducts, </em>pipes, conduits, <em>vents, </em>plumbing, wiring and other utility services to the unit.\u201d [Emphasis added]. This easement was properly established when the Declaration was filed along with the Bylaws and Condominium plat, establishing the Condominium.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">The Court of Special Appeals contends that there is an inherent conflict created by such a grant of an easement in the context of a condominium. The court argues that because the individual condominium unit owner is also a member of the Condominium unit owners as a whole, she has an interest in \u201cboth the servient <em>and </em>dominant estate[s].\u201d In other words, petitioner is granted an easement over or through the common elements as the dominant estate represented by her condominium unit, but as a member of the Condominium she also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>has an interest in the servient estate by virtue of her interest in the common elements.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Court of Special Appeals finds this scenario to be distinguishable from the \u201ctraditional concept of easement, whereby one party obtains an easement for his or her benefit and another party must shoulder the obligations associated with that benefit.\u201d We find no conflict in this situation. While petitioner \u201ccan be said to have a tenancy in common in the general common elements with all of the other Condominium unit owners,\u201d petitioner owns her individual condominium unit in fee simple. <em>Jurgensen v. New Phoenix Atl. Condo. Council of Unit Owners, </em>380 Md. 106, 115, 843 A.2d 865, 870 (2004). These are two wholly different types of estates. There is no conflict extant between the two types of ownership in regards to the existence of the express easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">As such, we reiterate that traditional easement law applies to easements granted in condominium documents, in particular, to the easement granted by the Condominium Declaration in the case <em>sub judice.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">B. <em>Interpretation of the Express Easement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Our job now is to interpret what exactly the easement provides for. In doing this we look to standard constructs of contract interpretation. The establishment of an easement in a condominium declaration is analogous to the establishment of an easement by deed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We stated in <em>Miller:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>\u201cIn construing the language of a deed, the basic principles of contract interpretation apply.

The extent of an easement created by an express grant depends upon a proper construction of the conveyance by which the easement was created. <em>Id. </em>\u2018The primary rule for the construction of contracts generally\u2014and the rule is applicable to the construction of a grant of an easement\u2014is that a court should ascertain and give effect to the intention of the parties at the time the contract was made, if that be possible.\u2019 <em>Id.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">377 Md. at 351, 833 A.2d at 545.

We have explained:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\">A court construing an agreement under this test must first determine from the language of the agreement itself what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have meant at the time it was effectuated. In addition, when the language of the contract is plain and unambiguous there is no room for construction, and a court must presume that the parties meant what they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>expressed. In these circumstances, the true test of what is meant is not what the parties to the contract intended it to mean, but what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have thought it meant. Consequently, the clear and unambiguous language of an agreement will not give [way] to what the parties thought that the agreement meant or intended it to mean.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-5\"><em>General Motors Acceptance Corp. v. Daniels, </em>303 Md. 254, 261, 492 A.2d 1306, 1310 (1985) (citations omitted). The cardinal rule of contract interpretation is to give effect to the parties\u2019 intentions. <em>Owens-Illinois, </em>386 Md. at 497, 872 A.2d at 985.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">391 Md. at 13-14, 891 A.2d at 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">The pertinent language of the easement granted by Article 15.2 of the Condominium\u2019s Declaration is, as stated <em>supra: \u201c... </em>each unit shall have, appurtenant thereto, <em>an easement in the common elements for the purposes of providing maintenance, support, repair or service for such unit to and for the ducts, pipes, conduits, vents, plumbing, wiring and other utility services to the unit.\u201d </em>[Emphasis added]. From this language it is evident that condominium unit owners were to be provided with the ability to perform maintenance, support, repair or service on those items (ducts, pipes, conduits, vents, plumbing, wiring and other utility services) which pierced the \u201cshell\u201d of the unit, passing through the exterior walls or common element spaces. This type of easement is a logical extension of certain rights of individual unit owners. Otherwise, anytime something untoward occurred to one of the above-listed items the unit owner would be required to receive permission from respondent in order to remedy the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">The problem that arises in the case of petitioner\u2019s exercise of this easement, is that her particular exterior dryer installation was defective because the exhaust had not been properly vented at the time the unit was constructed and at the time of purchase in 1991, nor in fact did it exist when the Declaration establishing the easement was filed. Had a vent existed at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>the time the Declaration was filed, petitioner would clearly have an easement to pierce the common element in order to perform maintenance, support, repair or service on a preexisting vent. In fact, every other condominium unit in the Condominium has such an exterior dryer exhaust vent and each unit\u2019s respective owner has an easement to service those vents as provided by Article 15.2 of the Declaration without the necessity of seeking the permission of the Board. The intent of the easement provision of the Declaration was to provide all unit owners with the ability to maintain the essential ducts and vents which run through, or were intended to run through, the common elements that surround their condominium units. It can be assumed that when the Declaration was drafted and the grant of easement made, the drafters believed that the condominium units would be, or had been, built to code and that all ducts, pipes, conduits, vents, plumbing, wiring and other utility services would be, or had been, properly constructed. There appears to be no dispute that a vent was contemplated for the respective unit, but failed to be installed during the construction phase\u2014otherwise building codes and probably fire codes would have been violated. The fact that petitioner\u2019s unit was improperly constructed by the developer of The Cloisters does not negate this aspect of the easement. The unit requires an exterior dryer exhaust vent in order to comply with Baltimore County Building Code, <em>supra, </em>as the Court of Special Appeals recognized, stating that \u201cif application is made, the Council must authorize the installation of an exterior vent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">It was reasonable for petitioner to remedy the hazard created by the improper original construction of the dryer exhaust system. In order to reasonably enjoy the grant of the easement, petitioner was entitled to install an exterior dryer exhaust vent. In support of this, we look to some cases involving right-of-ways.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>It is well established that \u201c \u2018[n]othing passes as incident to such a grant, but that which is necessary for its reasonable and proper enjoyment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Baker v. Frick, </em>45 Md. 337, 340 (1876) (quoting 3 <em>Kent </em>419, 420); <em>Simon Distributing Corp. v. Bay Ridge Civic Ass\u2019n, </em>207 Md. 472, 479, 114 A.2d 829, 832-33 (1955); <em>Everdell v. Carroll, </em>25 Md.App. 458, 463-64, 336 A.2d 145, 149-50 (1975). In addition, the <em>Baker </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-5\">\u201cWhat is necessary for such reasonable and proper enjoyment of the way granted, and the limitations thereby imposed on the use of the land by the proprietor, depends upon the terms of the grant, <em>the purposes for which it was made, the nature and situation of the property subject to the easement, </em>and the manner in which it has been used and occupied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">45 Md. at 340 (emphasis added). While <em>Baker </em>dealt with the issue of a right-of-way across a servient estate and that servient estate\u2019s right to place gates upon the road, the language above is relevant to the case <em>sub judice.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We look to the intentions of the parties in interpreting the language of the easement and to what is reasonable and necessary for the proper enjoyment of such easement. It was the intention of the parties that existed at the time the Condominium was constructed and the Declaration placed on record that the condominium units be built to fire and building code specifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>tions and therefore, a proper dryer exhaust system was required for the unit at inception\u2014at which point no permission would have been necessary nor would there have been any respondent in existence. This intention is evidenced by the fact that every other one of the forty-seven additional condominium units has such an exterior dryer exhaust vent\u2014the repair of which do not require the permission of the Board. The installation of an exterior dryer exhaust vent is reasonable and necessary, nd was fully contemplated, for the proper, and more importantly, safe, operation of the dryer and its presence and maintenance was fully contemplated by Article 15.2 of the Declaration.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Respondent concedes that the easement grants unit owners control over certain systems which run through the common elements of the Condominium, but asserts that the easement does not \u201cserve to grant a unit owner the unfettered right to install a completely new system in an area in which it has previously not been installed.\u201d In support of this, respondent contends that such a holding would open and let loose a virtual Pandora\u2019s box of monstrosities on the Condominium, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AlX\">\u201cthen any unit owner could install a new gas heating system to replace the old electric heating system and run his new gas lines for same, in, through and around the exterior facade of the unit without seeking the approval of the Respondent. Moreover, any of the forty-seven (47) unit owners could punch holes in the exterior of their condominium unit whenever, wherever, and however they pleased; replace a window with an exhaust fan; install a new heat pump on her parking pad; attach solar panels to the garage door; or attach a satellite dish to her front steps, all without any prior consent of the Respondent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">Respondent\u2019s concerns are not valid in this case. The installation of the exterior dryer exhaust vent by petitioner is not something that is new or in addition to the original construction of the other forty-seven condominium units. Every other condominium unit in The Cloisters already has such an exteri- or dryer exhaust vent system and the owners are able to maintain those systems without the approval of the Board because of the easement granted by Article 15.2 of the Declaration. That venting system is equally essential in order for petitioner\u2019s condominium unit to comply with Baltimore County Building Code and is, thus, reasonable and necessary. Our holding does not allow unit owners the unfettered ability to make changes to the exterior of their condominium unit without prior approval by respondent. Rather, it reasonably allows only the petitioner, where an obvious construction defect exists relating to safety, to install the exterior vent in reliance on the rights granted by the express easement (and for that matter in exercise of the rights inherent in an exception contained in the Bylaws). It is obvious that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>intention of the drafters of the easement was that in the circumstances described in the easement, the unit owners would have the automatic right to maintain necessary and required venting and ducts without the permission of the Board. We believe that in the unusual circumstances of this case, the situation is the functional equivalent of maintenance necessary for the reasonable and safe operation of the dryer. Our holding is limited, however, to the particular situation here extant.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Respondent also argues that the easement language in Article 15.2 of the Declaration must be harmonized with the language in the Article IX of the Bylaws:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-6\">\n<em>\u201cArchitectural Standards</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHs\">1. <em>Architectural Standards Committee.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AiV\">a. Except for the original construction of the Condominium Units situate within the property by the Developer and any improvements to any Condominium Unit or to the General or Limited Common Elements accomplished concurrently with said original construction, and except for purposes of proper maintenance and repair<footnotemark>[14]</footnotemark> or as otherwise in these By-Laws provided, it shall be prohibited to install, erect, attach, apply, paste, hinge, screw, nail, build, alter, remove or construct any light, screens, awnings, patio covers, decorations, fences, aerials, antennas, dishes, radio or television broadcasting or receiving devices, slabs, sidewalks, patios, terraces, balconies, platforms, porches, walls or to make any change or otherwise alter, including any alteration in color, in any manner whatsoever, to the exteri- or of any Condominium Unit or upon any of the General or Limited Common Elements until the complete plans and specifications prepared at the expense of the Condominium <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>Unit Owner proposing the change, showing the location, nature, shape, height, material, color, type of construction and/or other proposed form of change, including, without limitation, any other information specified by the Board (or its designated Committee), shall have been submitted to, and approved or approved with conditions, in writing by the Board, or by an \u201cArchitectural Standards Committee\u201d designated by such Board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-4\">b. In the event the Board, or its designated Committee, fails to approve, or disapprove, such design and location within sixty (60) days after said plans and specifications have been submitted to it, approval will not be required and this Article will be deemed to have been fully complied with. If plans and specifications are not submitted, any and all alterations and/or changes shall be deemed violations of this Article.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Respondent asserts that, pursuant to the Maryland Condominium Act, the Declaration and Bylaws should be construed together. <em>See </em>\u00a7 ll-124(c) (\u201cThe declaration, bylaws, and condominium plat shall be construed together and shall be deemed to incorporate one another to the extent that any requirement of this title as to the content of one shall be deemed satisfied if the deficiency can be cured by reference to any of the others.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">In support of this contention, respondent cites to a Court of Special Appeals opinion, <em>Dulaney Towers Maintenance Corp. v. O\u2019Brey, </em>46 Md.App. 464, 418 A.2d 1233 (1980), which states: \u201cWhen a controversy arises as to a resident\u2019s right as a unit owner in a condominium, the courts must examine the condominium\u2019s enabling statutes for relevant provisions, consider the master deed or declaration, study the bylaws, and attempt to reconcile the three.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 465, 418 A.2d at 1235 (citing <em>Sterling Village Condo., Inc. v. Breitenbach, </em>251 So.2d 685 (Fla.App.1971)). Respondent is correct in its assertion that the Court should attempt to reconcile or harmonize the provisions of the Declaration and Bylaws. Both the Declaration and the Bylaws, under the limited circumstances of the present case, provide for the repair of an inherent defect relating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>to safety without Board approval, even to the point of providing for venting to the exterior. If, however, they are not so compatible and there is a conflict between the Declaration and the Bylaws that cannot be cured by construing the two pertinent provisions together, then the Declaration would prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The Maryland Condominium Act provides a resolution in the case of such conflict. <em>See </em>\u00a7 ll-124(e) (\u201cIf there is any conflict among the provisions of this title, the declaration, condominium plat, bylaws, or rules adopted pursuant to \u00a7 11-111 of this title, the provisions of each shall control in the succession listed hereinbefore commencing with \u2018title\u2019.\u201d).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In this case, the easement granted in Article 15.2 of the Condominium Declaration, if there were to be a conflict, would control over the language in Article IX of the Bylaws. Respondent further contends that \u00a7 11-115(2) of the Real Property Article provides a Title section which controls over the Declaration. This is an erroneous argument. Section 11-115 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-6\"><em>\u201cSubject to the provisions of the declaration </em>or bylaws and other provisions of law, a unit owner:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-8\">(2) May not alter, make additions to, or change the appearance of the common elements, or the exterior appearance of a unit or any other portion of the condominium, without permission of the council of unit owners.... \u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Though, pursuant to \u00a7 ll-124(e), title provisions control over the declaration provisions in this case, \u00a7 11-115 specifically states that it is \u201c[sjubject to the provisions of the declaration .... \u201d <em>See also Sea Watch Stores Limited Liability Co. v. Council of Unit Owners of Sea Watch Condo., </em>115 Md.App. 5, 43, 691 A.2d 750, 768 (1997) (discussing \u00a7 11-115(3) and holding that \u201cif the condominium documents conflict with the provisions of [the section], the condominium documents control, because the statute is made \u2018subject\u2019 to the condominium documents\u201d). Therefore, if a conflict existed, the Declaration would control in this instance. The easement is valid and applies to the Condominium and is in harmony, <em>under these limited circumstances, </em>with the Bylaw provision that permits breach of the exterior walls for repair and maintenance without prior approval of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">C. <em>The Easement (and the Bylaws Provision), Separately and Together, Allow Petitioner to Install the Dryer Exhaust Vent on the Exterior of her Condominium Unit Without Prior Approval of Respondent Where the Defect They Repaired is an Inherent Initial Defect, Relating to Public Safety, in the Construction, of a Unit</em></p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">We have consolidated and modified petitioner\u2019s second and third questions presented due to their overlap in subject matter. Petitioner contends that the Court of Special Appeals erred in finding that (1) the easement did not allow petitioner to repair the defect in her dryer exhaust system by installing the exterior vent without prior approval by respondent and (2), in concert, that the Condominium\u2019s Bylaws specifically require petitioner to obtain such prior approval. We find that the installation of the exterior dryer exhaust vent was necessary to correct an initial construction defect and further, it was necessary for reasonable, proper, and safe use of the unit and therefore petitioner was empowered by the Declaration and Bylaws with the opportunity to repair the inherent defect by installing the venting system without the prior approval of respondent. This repair was of an initial construction defect and, pursuant to the intent of the easement provisions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>Declaration and the express exception in the Bylaws themselves, prior approval of the Board was not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Our holding is limited to instances where the inherent problem results from an initial construction defect and where the Condominium Declaration contains an express easement <em>and </em>there is a Bylaw exception permitting the repair without prior approval. Furthermore, as our decision relates only to the issue of whether prior approval of the Board was necessary, it does not affect other individual unit owners\u2019 rights of recourse if their individual rights are adversely affected.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> But, the Condominium\u2019s Bylaws under the particular facts and circumstances of this case did not require petitioner to obtain prior approval for the installation from the respondent because of the easement granted by the Condominium\u2019s Declaration, as well as the Bylaws exception, as discussed <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">D. <em>Location of the Exterior Dryer Exhaust Vent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">The Circuit Court and the Court of Special Appeals, along with respondent, state that there were several alternate locations that the exterior- vent could have been placed in order that it not interfere with Dr. Kantt\u2019s enjoyment of his property. The record, however, does not reflect this. Respondent identifies four alternate locations. The first alternative is running a new dryer exhaust system up though the main furnace duct, which would vent out through a chimney in the roof of the house. This proposal is unacceptable, as it would violate section 504.4 of the International Mechanical Code, 2000, which states that the \u201c[cjlothes dryer exhaust ducts shall not be connected to a vent connector, vent or chimney.\u201d The second and third alternatives involved moving the exterior vent from its installed position either \u201ca couple of inches or a couple of feet\u201d or \u201ctwelve to sixteen inches.\u201d Neither of which is substantially different from where it was originally installed and would not serve to provide a remedy for Dr. Kantt\u2019s complaint. The final alternative was given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>when respondent\u2019s counsel questioned petitioner\u2019s expert witness at trial, as outlined in the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-4\">\u201c[Counsel:] ... In response to my question whether or not the alternatives that were discussed here were the only alternatives, your response was depends on how much money you want to spend?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-5\">[Witness:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">[Counsel:] Other alternatives exist?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">[Witness:] Based on your financial expenditures, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AcH\">[Counsel:] Right. And now, that directly contradicts what you testified to earlier, that other alternatives didn\u2019t exist?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYJk\">[Witness:] That is true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-8\">[Counsel:] Okay. So now what I need to be able to let the judge know is that some alternatives do exist besides the current placement of the vent. That is what I\u2019m hearing from you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-9\">[Witness:] Yeah. I believe my testimony was that we could move it six to twelve inches. And you asked me, if I heard you right, two things: Number 1, you said I said something out in the hallway that you didn\u2019t relate to and then you turn around and said to me that could it be moved and I said if you want to spend a lot of money. It is simple, we tear all the dry wall out of the garage, we tear out and drop the ceiling down and we can move the dryer to the second floor and shorten it up. We can move the dryer anyplace around that there is, move the garage out. If you want to spend the money, pal, give it to me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">It is not a viable alternative to, effectively, completely remodel petitioner\u2019s condominium unit by tearing down walls and dropping ceilings in order to be able to provide exterior ventilation for the clothes dryer in a different location. The exhaust system was improperly installed by the developer in the first instance when they had the opportunity to locate the exterior vent wherever would have been most preferable. Petitioner had the vent installed in the most logical place, as evidenced by the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 recitation of the facts of the case: \u201cThe new system was routed from the dryer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>through the wall of the laundry room into the adjoining garage, then through the garage and through the exterior wall.\u201d Thus, we find the location of petitioner\u2019s original installation of the exterior dryer exhaust vent to be the most reasonable option under the facts presented in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Article 15.2 of the Condominium\u2019s Declaration provides for an express easement and Article IX of the Bylaws provides an exclusion from the requirement of obtaining prior Board approval under the specific circumstances here present. The specific provisions of both documents allow this individual condominium unit owner to repair the inherent construction defect that relates to the safe use of her premises without prior approval. For the aforementioned reasons we reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

Occasionally, a court is faced with a situation in which the normal application of legal principles that are either well-established on their own or that would naturally flow from the objective interpretation of broader common law or statutory mandates will produce a result that the judges of the court feel is unduly harsh, or even unfair, to a litigant. The temptation arises not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>to apply those principles as the law would ordinarily require, and the judges, instead, look for some way to create a little bubble, or exception, to avoid the perceived harsh or unfair result. What often happens when they do that, of course, is that the law, itself, becomes less certain, less reliable, and, in the end, less just.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">That is what the Court is proposing to do here. The Court believes that Ms. Garfink should be able to dry her clothes without violating the county Fire Code, as indeed she should. To allow her to achieve that objective, however, the Court stretches the scope of an easement well beyond what the plain language of the easement would allow and gives less even than lip service to a clear and critical element of the condominium regime\u2014control over the common elements and building exterior by the council of unit owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">There are three problems with the Court\u2019s approach, apart from ignoring the wisdom of the adage that hard cases make bad law. The first is that, despite its valiant effort to circumscribe its ruling just to this case, the ruling cannot be so neatly cabined. The scope articulated by the Court is ambiguous and, as it attacks critical elements of nearly every residential condominium project and most other developments that are subject to reciprocal restrictive covenants, it will create considerable uncertainty and will likely generate a good bit of litigation in an area that should remain absolutely clear and certain. Second, even if the Court could make the contours of its self-created bubble clear, so that its ruling really is unique to this one situation, the ruling would then be wholly inconsistent with the long and consistent view of this Court that <em>certiorari </em>is not to be granted except to consider an issue of public importance, one that is beyond the interest of just the litigants. It is hardly consistent with that notion for this Court to establish a rule applicable only to one unique situation such as this, that has no interest to anyone beyond Ms. Garfink and the council of unit owners of The Cloisters at Charles, Inc. Finally, and perhaps most important, it is unnecessary in this case. One does not have to go through the legal gyrations and gymnastics\u2014the unwarranted stretching of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>some legal principles and the sharp contraction of others\u2014in order to permit Ms. Garfink to dry her clothes without violating the county Fire Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">As the Court notes, Ms. Garfink purchased her unit in 1991. It had been used by the developer as a model unit and apparently had a clothes dryer in it that was included with the sale. Where the dryer was located in the unit is not clear.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it is a fair inference that the dryer was not intended to be used while the unit served only as a model. Whether for that or some other reason, the dryer was vented into the furnace room and not to the outside. Whether that was a Code violation prior to the sale to Ms. Garfink, it certainly became one when she purchased the unit and began to use the dryer. Use it she did, however, luckily without incident, for about nine years. It was only when the dryer died, the service technician refused to install the new one because of the unlawful venting, and Ms. Garfink decided to deal with the matter by punching a hole in the exterior wall without seeking permission from the council of unit owners did the controversy before us surface.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The Court correctly identifies the relevant statutory, property, and contractual provisions that apply. Maryland Code, \u00a7 11-115 of the Real Property Article, which is part of the Maryland Condominium Act, provides that, \u201c[s]ubject to the provisions of the declaration or bylaws and other provisions of law,\u201d a unit owner may make improvements or alterations to his or her unit that do not impair the structural integrity or mechanical systems or lessen the support of any portion of the condominium, but may <em>not </em>alter, make additions to, or change the appearance <em>of the common elements, or the exterior appearance of a unit ... without permission of the council of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number><em>unit owners. </em>(Emphasis added). Section ll-124(c) requires that the declaration, bylaws, and condominium plat be construed together and be deemed to incorporate one another, <em>i.e., </em>to be read in harmony and not in a manner that would create conflict. Thus, unless the declaration, bylaws, or plat, construed together, dictate otherwise, the <em>law </em>requires a unit owner to get permission from the council of unit owners before making any alteration or addition that changes the appearance of a common element or the exterior appearance of a unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The pertinent provision in the condominium declaration is \u00a7 15.2, which grants an easement to each unit \u201cin the common elements <em>for the purposes of providing maintenance, support, repair or service </em>for such unit <em>to and for the ducts, pipes, conduits, vents, plumbing, wiring and other utility services to the unit.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied). If there are ducts, pipes, conduits, vents, plumbing, wiring, or other utility services serving the unit that intrude upon the common elements, the unit owner may, pursuant to that easement, enter the common elements for the limited purpose of maintaining, supporting, repairing, or servicing those ducts, pipes, conduits, or vents, etc. I see nothing in that easement, however, that permits a unit owner, without approval of the council of unity owners to install <em>new </em>ducts, pipes, conduits, vents, plumbing, wiring, or other utility services in the common elements where none previously existed. The Court apparently does\u2014but just for this one case; I do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Finally, there is Art. IX of the bylaws which, except for original construction of the units, improvements accomplished concurrently therewith, and \u201cproper maintenance and repair,\u201d prohibit unit owners from altering \u201cin any manner whatsoever\u201d the exterior of any condominium unit or any common element without approval of the council of unit owners. That clear, unambiguous provision in the bylaws can be read, and should be read, harmoniously with the easement contained in \u00a7 15.2 of the declaration and \u00a7 11-115 of the Real Property Article. If a unit owner wants to install a new duct or vent in the common element or exterior of the building, other than for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>the repair or maintenance of an existing one, he or she needs to get approval from the council.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">There is nothing harsh, strange, or oppressive about Art. IX. It is a requirement that is not only common but probably universal in residential condominium regimes, and it has an obviously beneficial purpose. As noted, <em>the law itself imposes that requirement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">On the supposition that, unless the requirement of council approval provided for by both the statute and Art. IX of the bylaws is somehow rendered inapplicable Ms. Garfink will not be able to dry her clothes, the Court holds that the requirement is, indeed, inapplicable. To achieve that objective, the Court tacitly construes the exception in Art. IX for \u201crepair\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as extending to punching holes in the exterior wall for <em>new </em>pipes, ducts, eondu' vents, and the like. That is a rather dramatic extension, for which the Court cites no authority, and creates a loophole that could well emasculate the requirement of council approval. Indeed, such a cavalier extension could well inject considerable confusion and uncertainty into the law of easements generally. Perhaps wary of the implications of such a tortuous ruling, the Court declares it applicable only \u201cto the particular situation here extant\u201d (Opinion at 898, 897 A.2d at 220) or \u201cto instances where the inherent problem results from an initial construction defect and where the Condominium Declaration contains an express easement <em>and </em>there is a Bylaw exception permitting the repair without prior approval\u201d Opinion at 402, 897 A.2d at 222). That continues to presume, however, that the exception in Art. IX for \u201crepair\u201d includes the installation of new invasions of the common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>elements and exterior walls, and thus is not so limiting as the Court perhaps intends.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Upon this analysis, it is not at all clear just how small the bubble is that the Court has created. What is \u201cthe particular situation here extant?\u201d What is a \u201cconstruction defect?\u201d Suppose the contract required an exhaust fan over the stove or in the bathroom and the developer forgot to install it or installed it improperly? Would Ms. Garfink, nine years later, be able to punch new holes in the exterior wall or roof, at a location of her choosing, to accommodate the belated addition of a range hood or bathroom exhaust fan on the theory that she was correcting a construction defect? The bubble requires that the condominium contain \u201can express easement.\u201d What kind of easement will suffice; does it matter how the easement is worded? Must the easement be precisely in the language of this one in order for the new special rule to apply and, if not, how much of a deviation will be allowed? Does the Court really intend to hold that the words \u201cmaintenance\u201d or \u201crepair,\u201d as used in the statute, the easement, and the bylaw, encompasses new invasions of the exterior walls and other common elements for the installation of new pipes, ducts, and vents? If so, the ruling in this case will affect virtually every condominium in the State, not to mention rights-of-way and other forms of easements. It will not be limited at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">That is the first problem with the Court\u2019s analysis; the contour of the bubble created for Ms. Garfink is not at all clear. Even if it could properly be construed as limited to Ms. Garfink\u2019s peculiar situation, how is such a ruling consistent with the long-standing principles governing the exercise of our discretion in granting <em>certiorari? </em>How is this case, as molded by the Court, of any importance to anyone other than Ms. Garfink and the council of unit owners of The Cloisters at Charles, Inc.? Is there another Ms. Garfink out there somewhere?</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Finally, on this record, the Court\u2019s disregard for the plain meaning of each of the provisions it acknowledges as relevant is wholly unnecessary. There is a far easier way to allow Ms. Garfink to connect her dryer to the outside world and a far more important principle to confirm. Although Ms. Garfink did not seek approval from the council before installing her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>vent\u2014hence the action for injunctive relief to require her to remove the vent\u2014the Circuit Court stayed its ruling in favor of the council so that the parties could negotiate a sensible solution. Unfortunately, it appears that egos got in the way of common sense. It seems clear from the record that the council <em>did </em>consider her proposed solution and rejected it in favor of alternatives that were either equally violative of the Fire Code or unreasonably expensive and that, as a result, were rejected by Ms. Garfink.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">When, either as part of a condominium regime or as a result of restrictive covenants in a deed, an owner is required to seek and obtain approval from a council, board, or association created by or through the property documents before undertaking some improvement or alteration to the exterior of the owner\u2019s property, the body with approval authority must act reasonably and in good faith. It may not reject an application arbitrarily or capriciously. <em>See Kirkley v. Seipelt, </em>212 Md. 127, 133, 128 A.2d 430, 434 (1957) (refusal \u201cwould have to be a reasonable determination made in good faith, and not highhanded, whimsical or captious in manner\u201d); <em>Carroll County v. Buckworth, </em>234 Md. 547, 553, 200 A.2d 145, 147 (1964) (\u201capproval or disapproval must be reasonable and ... the power must be exercised in good faith\u201d); <em>Harbor View Imp. Ass\u2019n v. Downey, </em>270 Md. 365, 373, 311 A.2d 422, 426 (1973); <em>Colandrea v. Wilde Lake, </em>361 Md. 371, 761 A.2d 899 (2000). In <em>Markey v. Wolf, </em>92 Md.App. 137, 163, 164, 607 A.2d 82, 95 (1992), the Court of Special Appeals (Cathell, J.) correctly noted that approvals and disapprovals are not treated equally, and that, because a disapproval may constitute a restraint on the free use and alienability of land, a disapproval \u201cshould be very closely scrutinized.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Ms. Garfink is entitled to have, and use, a clothes dryer in her home, and it must be vented to the outside in order to conform to the Fire Code. On this record, it is unclear where the most appropriate place for the vent is, comparable to where other dryer vents in the condominium are located. <em>See </em>n. 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>The only significance that this case, with its peculiar facts, really has is in confirming once again the principle that approval bodies must act reasonably. That <em>does </em>have public importance; that <em>is </em>a \u201ccert-worthy\u201d issue. Resolution of that issue as I propose it will allow Ms. Garfink to dry her clothes lawfully. It will achieve the Justice sought by the Court without torturing basic legal principles and making bad law. I too would reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, but I would remand the case to that court with instructions to reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court and remand to that court for the parties to introduce into evidence the documents reflecting where dryers are vented (and/or were vented at the time of original construction of the condominium units) in all units similar to the one Ms. Garfink occupies. With that basis in place, a reasonable resolution of this dispute should be clear. Should the parties not reach an amicable solution, the Circuit Court may assess the reasonableness of the parties\u2019 competing positions. I would continue the stay until a final resolution is achieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">Judges HARRELL and BATTAGLIA authorize me to state that they join in this dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b434-7\">.
