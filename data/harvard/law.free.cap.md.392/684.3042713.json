(\u201cMs. H.\u201d), had consented. Thereafter, Ms. H. filed a petition for writ of certiorari in this Court to consider the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-5\">Whether in a CINA proceeding, the right to a contested adjudicatory hearing may be waived only by the parent\u2019s personal,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">We granted the petition and issued the writ of certiorari, <em>In re Blessen H., </em>389 Md. 124, 883 A.2d 914 (2005). We shall hold that Ms. H.\u2019s attorney\u2019s acceptance of the stipulated facts in the CINA petition constituted a sufficient waiver of Ms. H.\u2019s right to a contested CINA adjudicatory hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">The relevant facts in this case are procedural. On July 29, 2003, the Montgomery County Department of Health and Human Services (the \u201cDepartment\u201d) filed a petition alleging that Blessen H. was a Child In Need of Assistance. On September 2, 2003, pursuant to Maryland Code (1973, 2002 Repl. Vol.), Section 3-817 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> an adjudicatory hearing was held in the Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>Court for Montgomery County, sitting as a juvenile court, to determine whether the allegations in the petition were true. The following colloquy ensued during the hearing at which Ms. H., her counsel, Sheldon A. (Blessen\u2019s father), and the Department were present:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-5\">THE COURT: Now, this is set for trial today. Tell me how we\u2019re proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-6\">THE DEPARTMENT: Well, Your Honor, we have had some discussions, I think as I indicated before we were on the record with this case, attempting to see if we could reach any type of agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-7\">This case is a little different than our normal scheduled cases because there was a conflict with the pretrial date. Counsel for the mother attempted to reschedule and file a motion, I believe, in that attempt, and because of different people\u2019s calendars and court calendar conflicts, we were never able to have a pretrial scheduled in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-8\">THE COURT: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-9\">THE DEPARTMENT: I had discussions with [Ms. H.\u2019s counsel] outside, and while she said her client was not of a mind, in the brief time that we were talking, to reach an agreement, she did talk to her about what her thoughts would be about discussion with a mediator. And I believe she had some comments on that point with regard to her client\u2019s willingness to have settlement discussions with us with the assistance of the mediator. If one were available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-10\">COUNSEL FOR MS. H.: Yes, I did discuss with my client, and she is in agreement. If we could try to mediate this, she is willing to do that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">The court then iterated that, should mediation not be successful, a trial would not be possible later that day, and asked the parties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>THE COURT: Tell me what you want to do? I\u2019ll start the trial right now. I will send you to mediation at 1:30. I will have this trial later this afternoon. We\u2019ll get the administrative judge to continue the trial if mediation is not fruitful, so we don\u2019t have to do it this afternoon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-5\">You just tell me what you want me to do. If you all think that mediation will be fruitful, then it\u2019s probably a good use of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-6\">THE DEPARTMENT: I would like to at least attempt mediation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-7\">COUNSEL FOR MS. H.: My client wants mediation. She wants to mediate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">Thereafter, the court adjourned, and the parties entered into mediation.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">Later that afternoon, after mediation, the parties returned to the courtroom and the adjudicatory hearing continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahc\">THE DEPARTMENT: Your Honor, we did reach an agreement based on an amended petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-11\">THE COURT: All right. You do have an amended petition? Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-12\">THE DEPARTMENT: The amended petition is amended by handwriting and I placed at the top, \u201cFactual Basis for CINA, September 2/03.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-13\">THE COURT: Does everybody have a copy of this, or do you want us to make copies? Did you make copies?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-14\">THE DEPARTMENT: We made copies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-15\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-16\">THE COURT: [I]s it everyone\u2019s position, then, that these facts should be sustained and form the basis for a finding of CINA?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-17\">COUNSEL FOR THE CHILDREN: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AzT\">COUNSEL FOR MS. H.: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-18\">SHELDON A.: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>THE COURT: All right. I will make such a finding, that based on the agreement of all counsel and parties, because Mr. A. is here without counsel, that the facts alleged are now facts sustained, and they form a basis for a finding of CI\u00d1A, and I will so find, that the child Blessen H. is a child in need of assistance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The parties\u2019 agreement was placed on the record by the Department; it called for Blessen H. to stay in foster care until successful completion of a home study of the paternal grandmother\u2019s home, after which Blessen H. would be placed with the paternal grandmother, with weekly supervised visitation with Sheldon A., monthly supervised visitation with Ms. H., and no visitation with her maternal grandmother, Ms. G.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">At the conclusion of the proceedings, the court brought Ms. G. into the courtroom to inform her that she was to have no contact with Blessen until further notice. Ms. G. then asked the judge if she could have the opportunity to explain her involvement in a prior incident with Blessen and Ms. H. that was of concern to the court, whereupon Ms. G. began to place blame for the incident on Ms. H., to which Ms. H. responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-7\">MS. H.: I can\u2019t deal with this. It\u2019s so many lies on this place. It\u2019s just ridiculous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-8\">COUNSEL FOR MS. H.: Shhhh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-9\">MS. H.: It really is. You know. I\u2019m trying to be the best parent I can be. I have already been slandered by DHS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-10\">Sheldon don\u2019t like some of this. And I have swallowed my pride to try to get this court hearing done. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-11\">I don\u2019t deserve this. I\u2019ve been the best mother I can be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-12\">I have listened to you, Your Honor, have saying things to me, and you haven\u2019t even asked me about my own character. You haven\u2019t even asked me\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-13\">THE COURT: Asked you about your own what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-14\">MS. H.: My own character. How did I end up in this situation. Why was I traveling? Why was my child not in a stable home? Some of these things are not\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>THE COURT: Well, you have an attorney, ma\u2019am, and I was listening to your attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-5\">MS. H.: I can\u2019t speak no more, Your Honor. I really can\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-6\">THE COURT: Well, then, don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-7\">MS. H.: I really can\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-8\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-9\">MS. H.: You can go ahead and do the trial. I need to sit outside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-11\">THE COURT: Well, there isn\u2019t any trial. This is finished.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-12\">Ms. H. subsequently appealed to the Court of Special Appeals alleging that her attorney\u2019s stipulation to the facts in the CINA petition was not sufficient to waive her right to a contested CINA adjudicatory hearing because the waiver had to have been made voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently by Ms. H. In a reported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s CINA determination and emphasized that the requirement of a personal, voluntary, knowing and intelligent waiver has only been applied in punitive proceedings that carry the risk of incarceration. The intermediate appellate court noted that, although CINA proceedings implicate the fundamental right of a parent to raise his or her children, thereby demanding a certain level of due process, it is less than that owed an individual who faces the loss of personal liberty, and therefore, a personal waiver under the <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938), standard was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-13\">Ms. H. contends that CINA adjudicatory hearings represent the first step towards termination of a parent\u2019s right to raise his or her children, which, as a fundamental right, requires the highest level of due process protection. The significance of CINA adjudicatory hearings, she alleges, is reflected in the requirement contained in Section 3-817(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article of the Maryland Code (1973, 2002 Repl. Yol.) of the strict application of the Maryland Rules of Evidence during the proceedings, as contrasted with the discretionary application of the Maryland Rules of Evidence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>CINA shelter care hearings,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> disposition hearings, permanency planning hearings,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and subsequent review hearings.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, Ms. H. points out that parents have the right to representation by counsel during CINA adjudicatory hearings, and that indigent parents are provided counsel at the State\u2019s cost.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Ms. H., therefore, maintains that, as due process requires both the strict application of the Maryland Rules of Evidence and representation by counsel during CINA adjudicatory hearings, so must it require the most stringent form of waiver to forego those proceedings. Ms. H. also claims that the strictest form of waiver is required because CINA proceedings can give rise to separate criminal proceedings against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>the parents. Accordingly, Ms. H. alleges that the right to a contested CINA adjudicatory hearing only can be waived where the record affirmatively discloses a personal, voluntary, knowing and intelligent relinquishment of the right by the parent herself, which requires a colloquy on the record in which the court would advise the parent of the right to have a contested CINA adjudicatory hearing, of the right to compel and present witnesses and to present evidence during the proceedings, that waiver of the hearing could lead to limitation of the parental rights, of the risk of making incriminating statements during the proceedings, and of the burden of proof assigned to the State, as well as would inquire into whether the parent is under the influence of alcohol or drugs, understands the English language, and is waiving the proceedings voluntarily, absent any duress or coercion.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Conversely, the State argues that the juvenile court was not required to make a personal inquiry of Ms. H. to confirm that her waiver of the contested adjudicatory hearing was voluntary, knowing and intelligent because, based upon the totality of the circumstances, it was clear to the court that Ms. H.\u2019s waiver was voluntary, knowing and intelligent. Moreover, the State argues that the stricter standard of waiver is not required for all proceedings that implicate fundamental rights, only those that are punitive in nature and present the possibility of incarceration, unlike CINA proceedings, which are remedial in nature and cannot result in confinement. Furthermore, the State asserts that the application of the personal, voluntary, knowing and intelligent standard of waiver to these proceedings would be inconsistent with other procedural aspects of CINA adjudicatory actions, such as the low burden of proof, a preponderance of the evidence, assigned to the State. The State also contends that the application of this heightened standard of waiver also would be inconsistent with <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 93321055, </em>344 Md. 458, 687 A.2d 681 (1997), where this Court held that Maryland\u2019s statutory scheme, which permits parents to waive their right to contest termination of their parental rights through inaction, does not violate due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>A. Fundamental Right of Parenting and CINA Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">Maryland has long recognized the right of parents to raise their children \u201cwith minimal state interference\u201d as a constitutionally protected fundamental right. <em>See In re Billy W., Jessica W., Mary S. &amp; George B., </em>386 Md. 675, 683, 874 A.2d 423, 428 (2005); <em>In re Samone H. and Marchay E., </em>385 Md. 282, 299, 869 A.2d 370, 380 (2005); <em>In re Mark </em>M., 365 Md. 687, 705, 782 A.2d 332, 342-43 (2001); <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 10941, </em>335 Md. 99, 112, 642 A.2d 201, 208 (1994) (quoting <em>Lassiter v. Department of Social Services, </em>452 U.S. 18, 101 S.Ct. 2153, 68 L.Ed.2d 640 (1981)). Indeed, we have iterated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-5\">A parent\u2019s interest in raising a child is, no doubt, a fundamental right, recognized by the United States Supreme Court and this Court. The United States Supreme Court has long avowed the basic civil right encompassed by child rearing and family life. <em>See Troxel v. Granville, </em>530 U.S. 57, 66, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 2060, 147 L.Ed.2d 49, 57 (2000) (stating that \u2018the Fourteenth Amendment protects the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children\u2019); <em>See also Santosky v. Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 753, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 1394-95, 71 L.Ed.2d 599, 606 (1982) (discussing \u2018the fundamental liberty interest of natural parents in the care, custody, and management of their child\u2019); <em>Stanley v. Illinois, </em>405 U.S. 645, 651, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 1212-13, 31 L.Ed.2d 551, 558-59 (1972)(stating that \u2018[t]he rights to conceive and to raise one\u2019s children have been deemed \u2018essential,\u2019 and that \u2018[t]he integrity of the family unit has found protection in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment ... the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment ... and the Ninth Amendment ....\u2019) (internal citations omitted). Maryland, too, has declared a parent\u2019s interest in raising a child to be so fundamental that it \u2018cannot be taken away unless clearly justified.\u2019 <em>Boswell v. Boswell, </em>352 Md. 204, 218, 721 A.2d 662, 669 (1998) (citing <em>In re Adoption No. 10941, </em>335 Md. 99, 112, 642 A.2d 201 (1994)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number><em>In re Samone H., </em>385 Md. at 300, 869 A.2d at 380 (quoting <em>In re Mark M., </em>365 Md. at 705, 782 A.2d at 342-43). This right, however, is not absolute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-5\">Pursuant to the doctrine of <em>parens patriae, </em>the State of Maryland has an interest in caring for those, such as minors, who cannot care for themselves. <em>See Boswell, </em>352 Md. at 218-19, 721 A.2d at 669. We have held that \u2018the best interests of the child may take precedence over the parent\u2019s liberty interest in the course of a custody, visitation, or adoption dispute.\u2019 <em>Boswell, </em>352 Md. at 219, 721 A.2d at 669; <em>see also In re Adoption No. 10941, </em>335 Md. at 113, 642 A.2d at 208 (stating that \u201cthe controlling factor ... is ... what best serves the interest of the child\u201d). That which will best promote the child\u2019s welfare becomes particularly consequential where the interests of a child are in jeopardy, as is often the case in situations involving sexual, physical, or emotional abuse by a parent. As we stated in <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. A91-71A, </em>334 Md. 538, 640 A.2d 1085 (1994), the child\u2019s welfare is \u2018a consideration that is of transcendent importance\u2019 when the child might otherwise be in jeopardy. <em>Id. </em>at 561, 640 A.2d at 1096 (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-6\">We have recognized that in cases where abuse or neglect is evidenced, particularly in a CI\u00d1A case, the court\u2019s role is necessarily more pro-active. <em>See In re Justin D., </em>[357 Md. 431, 448, 745 A.2d 408, 417 (2000) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-7\"><em>In re Mark M., </em>365 Md. at 705-07, 782 A.2d at 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">The federal and state roles in the child welfare system were explored in <em>In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. 551, 819 A.2d 1030 (2003) (quoting from Judge Karwacki in <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 10941, </em>335 Md. 99, 103-06, 642 A.2d 201, 203-05 (1994));</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-9\">The Maryland General Assembly has enacted a comprehensive statutory scheme to address those situations where a child is at risk because of his or her parents\u2019 inability or unwillingness to care for him or her.

This phenomenon became known as \u2018foster care drift\u2019 and resulted in the enactment by Congress of Public Law 96-272, the \u2018Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980,\u2019 codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 610-679 (1988). One of the important purposes of this law was to eliminate foster care drift by requiring states to adopt statutes to facilitate permanent placement for children as a condition to receiving federal funding for their foster care and adoption assistance programs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-5\">Under the federal act, a state is required, among other things, to provide a written case plan for each child for whom the state claims federal foster care maintenance payments. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 671(a)(16). The case plan must include a description of the home or institution into which the child is placed, a discussion of the appropriateness of the placement, and a description of the services provided to the parents, child and foster parents to facilitate return of the child to his or her own home or to establish another permanent placement for the child. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 675(1). The state must also implement a case review system that provides for administrative review of the case plan at least every six months and judicial review no later than eighteen months after placement and periodically thereafter. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 675(5)(B) and (C). The purpose of the judicial review is to \u2018determine the future status of the child\u2019 including whether the child should be returned to its biologi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>cal parents, continued in foster care for a specified period, placed for adoption, or because of the child\u2019s special needs or circumstances, continued in foster case on a long term basis. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 675(5)(C).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-5\">Maryland receives considerable federal funds pursuant to this Act. Accordingly, the Maryland General Assembly has enacted legislation to comply with the federal requirements. Under Maryland\u2019' \u2022statutory scheme, for those children committed to a local department of social services the department is required to develop and implement a permanency plan that is in the best interests of the child. F.L. \u00a7 5-525.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-6\">In developing the permanency plan, the department is required to consider a statutory hierarchy of placement options in descending order of priority. F.L. \u00a7 5-525(c). First and foremost, the department must consider returning the child to the child\u2019s natural parents or guardians. F.L. \u00a7 5\u2014525(c)(1). If reunification with the biological parents is not possible, the department must consider placing the child with relatives to whom adoption, guardianship, or care and custody, in descending order of priority, are planned to be granted. F.L. \u00a7 5\u2014525(c)(2). If placement with relatives is not possible, then the department must consider adoption by a current foster parent or other approved adoptive family. F.L. \u00a7 5\u2014525(c)(3). <em>Only in exceptional situations as defined by rule or regulation is a child to be placed in long term foster care. </em>F.L. \u00a7 5-525(c)(5).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-7\">If it is determined that reunification is not possible and that adoption is in the child\u2019s best interests, the juvenile court lacks jurisdiction to finalize this plan. <em>In re Darius A., </em>47 Md.App. 232, 235, 422 A.2d 71, 72 (1980); <em>see also </em>F.L. \u00a7 1-201. Instead, unless the parents consent to the adoption of their child, the department is required to petition the circuit court for guardianship pursuant to F.L. \u00a7 5-313. If the circuit court finds by clear and convincing evidence, after considering the statutorily enumerated factors, that it is in the best interests of a child previously adjudicated a CINA for parental rights to be terminated, the circuit court has authority to grant the department\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>petition for guardianship. Such award carries with it the right for the department to consent to the adoption of the child. F.L. \u00a7\u00a7 5-311 and 5-317(f).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-5\">The overriding theme of both the federal and state legislation is that a child should have permanency in his or her life. The valid premise is that it is in a child\u2019s best interest to be placed in a permanent home and to spend as little time as possible in foster care. Thus, Title 5 of the Family Law Article seeks to prevent the need for removal of a child from its home, to return a child to its home when possible, and where returning home is not possible, to place the child in another permanent placement that has legal status.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 573-76, 819 A.2d at 1043-45 (emphasis added); <em>see also In re Adoption/Guardianship Nos.

Voluntary, Knowing and Intelligent Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">In the case <em>sub judice </em>we are faced with the question of whether Ms. H.\u2019s attorney\u2019s agreement with the stipulated facts presented by the State constituted an effective waiver of Ms. H.\u2019s right to a contested CINA adjudicatory hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">The term \u201cwaiver,\u201d as noted by Justice Black, speaking for the Supreme Court in <em>Green v. U.S., </em>355 U.S. 184, 191, 78 S.Ct. 221, 226, 2 L.Ed.2d 199, 206 (1957), \u201cis a vague term used for a great variety of purposes, good and bad, in the law.\u201d Its ambiguity results from the infinite number of rights that can be waived and the various procedures available forwarder, as the Supreme Court illustrated in <em>U.S. v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-8\">[Wjaiver is the \u2018intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.\u2019 Whether a particular right is waivable; whether the defendant must participate personally in the waiver; whether certain procedures are required for waiver; and whether the defendant\u2019s choice must be particularly informed or voluntary, all depend on the right at stake.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 733, 113 S.Ct. at 1777, 123 L.Ed.2d. at 519 (citations omitted). Judge John C. Eldridge, writing for this Court, also has reflected upon the ambiguity inherent in the term \u201cwaiver\u201d in <em>Curtis v. State, </em>284 Md. 132, 395 A.2d 464 (1978):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Abl\">In the broadest sense of the word, any tactical decision by counsel, inaction by counsel, or procedural default, could be described as a \u201cwaiver.\u201d For example, an attorney must make numerous decisions in the course of a trial. Whenever he makes one, choosing to take or forego a particular action, the alternate choice could be said to have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>waived. However, with regard to constitutional rights in a criminal proceeding, in a much narrower sense the term waiver could be said to connote the intelligent and knowing relinquishment of certain basic constitutional rights under circumstances where the courts have held that only such intelligent and knowing action will bind the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AgO\"><em>Id. </em>at 147, 395 A.2d at 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Because of the plethora of opportunities to waive substantive rights, as well as procedural safeguards, the Supreme Court, as well as this Court, have required judges to personally address a party on the record only in limited circumstances, to ensure that the waiver is being made voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently. These circumstances have included only those proceedings in which the right sought to be waived was \u201cfundamental\u201d and from which confinement could result.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">The seminal case addressing voluntary, knowing and intelligent waivers and the limited circumstances in which \u201cpersonal\u201d waivers are required is <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938), a habeas corpus case in which the defendant complained he had been convicted of uttering and possession of counterfeit money without the benefit of counsel. Exploring the level of scrutiny that should be afforded a waiver of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, the Supreme Court emphasized that \u201c \u2018courts indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver\u2019 of fundamental constitutional rights,\u201d and determined that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-7\">[i]f the accused ... is not represented by counsel and has not competently and intelligently waived his constitutional right, the Sixth Amendment stands as a jurisdictional bar to a valid conviction and sentence depriving him of his life or his liberty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 464, 468, 58 S.Ct. at 1023, 1024, 82 L.Ed. at 1466, 1468. To ensure that \u201cthere is an intelligent and competent waiver by the accused,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 465, 58 S.Ct. at 1023, 82 L.Ed. at 1467, the Supreme Court determined that trial courts should inquire into \u201cthe background, experience, and conduct of the accused,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 464, 58 S.Ct. at 1023, 82 L.Ed. at 1466, and suggested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>that such inquiry \u201cappear upon the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 465, 58 S.Ct. at 1023, 82 L.Ed. at 1467. Therefore, the stricter standard of waiver requiring a colloquy arose with respect to the relinquishment of a fundamental right in a proceeding that could result in confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The Supreme Court further explored the heightened standard of waiver in <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973), in which the Court held that a knowing and intelligent waiver was not required for the defendant to consent to a search of his vehicle because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACH\">It would be unrealistic to expect that in the informal, unstructured context of a consent search, a policeman, upon pain of tainting the evidence obtained, could make the detailed type of examination demanded by <em>Johnson. </em>And, if for this reason a diluted form of \u2018waiver\u2019 were found acceptable, that would itself be ample recognition of the fact that there is no universal standard that must be applied in every situation where a person foregoes a constitutional right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9n\"><em>Id. </em>at 245, 93 S.Ct. at 2057, 36 L.Ed.2d at 873. Highlighting the distinctions between the protection against unreasonable searches contained in the Fourth Amendment and the promotion of a fair criminal trial in the Sixth Amendment, the Supreme Court acknowledged that the \u201ccases do not reflect an uncritical demand for a knowing and intelligent waiver in every situation where a person has failed to invoke a constitutional protection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 235, 93 S.Ct. at 2052, 36 L.Ed.2d at 867, but rather, a more personal or stricter standard of waiver is only required in proceedings in which fundamental rights are implicated and from which confinement could result:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-6\">A prime example is the right to counsel. For without that right, a wholly innocent accused faces the real and substantial danger that simply because of his lack of legal expertise he may be convicted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 241, 93 S.Ct. at 2055, 36 L.Ed.2d at 871.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">In addition to the right to counsel, the application of the stricter standard of waiver has also been extended to other fundamental procedural rights in proceedings which could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>result in confinement, such as waiver of the right to trial through entry of a guilty plea, <em>Boykin v. Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 243-44, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 1712, 23 L.Ed.2d 274, 280 (1969) (\u201cWhat is at stake for an accused facing death or imprisonment demands the utmost solicitude of which courts are capable in canvassing the matter with the accused to make sure he has a full understanding of what the plea connotes and of its consequence.\u201d); the waiver of the right to trial by jury, <em>Adams v. United States, </em>317 U.S. 269, 63 S.Ct. 236, 87 L.Ed. 268 (1942) (concluding that defendant had personally, intelligently and competently waived his right to a jury trial where the record showed that the trial court had informed defendant of his constitutional rights, inquired into the defendant\u2019s legal experience, and had been repeatedly assured by the defendant that he knew what he was doing); and the waiver of the right to counsel in juvenile delinquency determinations, <em>Application of Gault, </em>387 U.S. 1, 42, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 1451, 18 L.Ed.2d 527, 554 (1967) (\u201c[The parties] had a right expressly to be advised that they might retain counsel and to be confronted with the need for specific consideration of whether they did or did not choose to waive the right.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">We also have required the heightened standard of personal waiver of specific fundamental rights in proceedings that could result in confinement. <em>See e.g., Curtis v. State, </em>284 Md. at 143, 395 A.2d at 470 (\u201cThe determination of whether there has been an intelligent waiver of right to counsel must depend, in each case, upon the particular facts and circumstances surrounding that case, including the background, experience, and conduct of the accused.\u201d) (quoting <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. at 464, 58 S.Ct. at 1023, 82 L.Ed. at 1466);<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>State v. Priet, </em>289 Md. 267, 290, 424 A.2d 349, 360-61 (1981) (holding guilty pleas knowingly and voluntarily entered when trial judge questioned each defendant at length as to voluntariness of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>plea, and each defendant was informed of the penalty for the offense and of the constitutional and other rights waived by entry of the plea);<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Countess v.

S.L.J., </em>519 U.S. 102, 117 S.Ct. 555, 136 L.Ed.2d 473 (1996), due process requires application of the more stringent standard of waiver in CINA adjudicatory proceedings. In <em>M.L.B. v. S.L.J., </em>519 U.S. 102, 117 S.Ct. 555, 136 L.Ed.2d 473 (1996), a mother was denied her right to appeal the decision to terminate her parental rights because she could not afford to prepay the cost of the appellate proceedings as required by Mississippi law. Holding that the law denied the mother both equal protection and due process of law, the Supreme Court likened the termination proceedings to criminal and quasi-criminal proceedings for which a defendant\u2019s access to appeal could not be denied because of the inability to pay transcript fees. <em>Id. </em>at 123, 117 S.Ct. at 567, 136 L.Ed.2d at 492. The analogy, however, to criminal or quasi-criminal proceedings in access to appeal cases when the Court had theretofore mandated public assistance to indigents is inapposite to the case at bar because neither the Supreme Court nor this Court has ever required a personal waiver of fundamental rights in proceedings that could not result in confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">In <em>Hersch v. State, </em>317 Md. 200, 562 A.2d 1254 (1989), for example, this Court explored whether an attorney could waive the defendant\u2019s right to a contested probation revocation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>hearing or whether the waiver had to be elicited from the defendant himself. Noting that revocation of probation proceedings are civil proceedings, we explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0G\">the fact that a probation violation proceedings is civil in nature is also not dispositive.... A probation revocation proceeding can, and often does, result in <em>immediate deprivation of liberty. </em>Because the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees that no person shall be deprived of liberty without due process of law, the Supreme Court has said that many, though not all, of the constitutional protections available to criminal defendants must be afforded to persons facing revocation of parole or probation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 207, 562 A.2d at 1257 (emphasis added). Accordingly, we held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-6\">when the immediate consequences of a violation of probation may well be imprisonment, often for a significant period of time, we believe <em>Johnson v. Zerbst </em>standard must apply to the waiver of the important right that the probationer has to put the State to its proof---- [N]o particular litany is required to show a waiver of these rights by a probationer, but the record must show that \u2018the charge was explained to the probationer in understandable terms and that his response demonstrated that this actions were <em>knowing and voluntary.\u2019 </em>It takes but a few moments to ensure that the probationer <em>-personally understands </em>the nature of the charges of alleged violations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-9\"><em>Id,, </em>at 208-209, 562 A.2d at 1258 (emphasis added). In so doing, we reviewed the Supreme Court cases requiring a colloquy with the defendant only where there was a possibility of confinement and fundamental rights were implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">In <em>Jones v. State, </em>351 Md. 264, 718 A.2d 222 (1998), we addressed the question of whether a waiver of the defendant\u2019s right to a contested constructive civil contempt hearing under Maryland Rule 15-207(e)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> may be effectuated through the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>defendant\u2019s attorney, or whether the defendant himself personally had to waive the proceedings. Applying the reasoning in <em>Hersch, </em>we observed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-5\">[w]e imposed th[e] higher standard of waiver in violation of probation proceedings because we concluded that on balance, this standard \u2018goes a long way toward ensuring essential fairness in an important proceeding while imposing only a small additional burden upon the trial judge and permitting the proceeding to remain essentially informal.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-6\">Under Appellant\u2019s analysis, he is entitled to the procedural protections that defendants enjoy in violation of probation proceedings because, in his view, the court\u2019s finding of contempt exposes him to the \u2018threat of immediate incarceration.\u2019 He is incorrect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 275, 718 A.2d at 228. We determined that, because under Rule 15-207 the defendant must first be afforded the opportunity to show that he has the ability to purge his debt before imprisonment is permitted, the proceedings did not pose an immediate threat of incarceration to the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 275-77, 718 A.2d at 228-29. Accordingly, we held that a personal waiver of the right to the proceedings was not required. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">In <em>Zetty v. Piatt, </em>365 Md. 141, 776 A.2d 631 (2001), this Court explored whether a constructive civil contempt proceeding implicated Maryland Rule 15-206(e),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> which enumerates the procedures required for waiver of counsel, when the defendant was found to be in contempt and sentenced to 179 days incarceration. Holding that a personal waiver is required in constructive civil contempt proceedings where incarceration is sought, we emphasized that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-6\">[a] defendant\u2019s actual incarceration in a jail, as a result of a proceeding at which he was unrepresented by counsel and did not knowingly and intelligently waive the right to counsel, is fundamentally unfair.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 158, 776 A.2d at 641. Therefore, \u201cit is the fact of incarceration, and not the label placed upon the proceeding,\u201d which compels the requirement of a personal waiver. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">Ms. H. also contends, though, that because CINA adjudicatory proceedings could give rise to separate criminal proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>ings against the parent,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> a colloquy on the record is required to ensure that the parent is waiving her rights voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We had the opportunity to explore the character of CINA proceedings <em>In re John P. and Thomas P., </em>311 Md. 700, 537 A.2d 263 (1988), in which the juvenile court ruled that John P. and Thomas P. were not children in need of assistance and dismissed the case. Counsel for the children asked the court to reconsider, relying on Maryland Rule 916, which allowed for the modification or vacation of a juvenile court order if. it is within the best interests of the child. Ms. P., the mother of the children, opposed the motion on the ground that a retrial would be violative of double jeopardy. We noted that double jeopardy prohibitions only apply to bar criminal prosecutions, and that a CINA proceeding was civil in nature. <em>Id. </em>at 707, 537 A.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>267. Holding that the second CINA proceeding did not violate double jeopardy, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-5\">The General Assembly has classified juvenile proceedings as civil and not criminal in nature. Moreover, the legislative intention underlying a CINA proceeding is not to punish the parent; rather, the purpose is to protect the child and provide for his best interests. Additionally, it cannot be said that the potential CINA \u2018sanctions\u2019 are \u201c \u2018so punitive ... in .. . effect as to negate that intention.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 709, 537 A.2d at 268 (citations omitted). We further explicated that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-7\">[wjhile ordinarily a CINA proceeding is not a criminal action against a parent, the Maryland statute does allow the State to seek criminal sanctions against the parent.... Consequently a CINA case does have a criminal aspect to it. Here, however, the State did not seek criminal sanctions against Ms. P. in either the first proceeding or in the subsequent petition for reconsideration. When no sanctions of a criminal nature are sought by the State ... it would seem that the double jeopardy prohibition is inapplicable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9j\"><em>Id. </em>at 708, 537 A.2d at 267 (citations and footnote omitted). The State also did not seek criminal sanctions against Ms. H. in the instant case so that a personal waiver of the contested adjudicatory hearing was not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">Ms. H. further asserts that, under the balancing test enumerated by the Supreme Court in <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976), and employed by this Court in <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 93321055/ CAD, </em>344 Md. 458, 491, 687 A.2d 681, 697 (1997), we are compelled to require the stricter standard of waiver to CINA adjudicatory hearings because the State\u2019s interest in expediting CINA proceedings pales in comparison to the fundamentally important right of parents to raise their children, and the high risk of erroneous deprivation of that right in proceedings where the parent is forced to make decisions without proper advice by the Court. In <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 93321055/CAD, </em>we addressed whether Maryland Code (1984, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>1991 Rep. Yol.), Section 5-322(d) of the Family Law Article, which permits parents to waive the right to contest the adoption of their child by failing to file a notice of objection to a petition for guardianship by an enumerated deadline, affords parents sufficient due process of law.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In determining that the due process rights of parents were not offended when the failure to file a timely objection was deemed irrevocable, we emphasized the fairness and adequacy of the notice afforded the parent. Certainly if the due process rights of parents are not violated by the failure to file a timely notice of objection in termination of parental rights proceedings, their due process rights are not violated when they do not personally waive less intrusive CINA adjudicatory proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Contrary, then, ' the arguments raised by Ms. H., the stricter standard of waiver requiring the court to conduct a personal colloquy with a parent to establish her or his voluntary, knowing and intelligent waiver ordinarily only has been applied where the rights to be waived have been deemed to be \u201cfundamental,\u201d and the proceedings have been those that could result in confinement. In the present case, Ms. H.\u2019s waiver of a contested CINA adjudicatory hearing was sufficient when her attorney concurred with the stipulated facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

We do not, however, find these cases persuasive.

In the process, however, it ignores a threshold issue, whose importance and need to be addressed are made strikingly obvious by a colloquy that occurred shortly after the parties, with Ms. H. present, placed on the record the agreement resolving the CI\u00d1A case. That issue is whether Ms. H., having signed the mediation agreement negotiated between her attorney and Montgomery County (\u201cDepartment\u201d), continued to agree to it, or, as seems likely, withdrew her agreement after its entry on the record. The meaning of Ms. H.\u2019s statements, and the trial court\u2019s obligation to investigate that meaning, ought to be the true focus of our review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">A review of the relevant facts makes clear that the issue before us is the existence and nature of Ms. H.\u2019s consent to the CINA proceedings. The Department filed, in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, a petition requesting that Blessen H. be declared a Child In Need of Assistance (\u201cCINA\u201d). Thereafter, Ms. H., Blessen\u2019s mother, Ms. H.\u2019s counsel, counsel for the Department, a social worker with the Department, counsel for Blessen, and Mr. A., Blessen\u2019s father, appeared in the Circuit Court for the CINA adjudicatory hearing. As the parties had been unable to schedule a pretrial hearing, they were offered the opportunity to mediate the matter. All parties agreed to mediation, and the court adjourned while it took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Following the mediation, prior to their return to court, the parties and their counsel signed a written Mediated Consent Agreement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pursuant to that agreement, Blessen would remain committed to the department and in foster care until a home study for her paternal grandparents could be completed by New Jersey Social Services, at which point Ms. C., the paternal grandmother, would obtain custody. Ms. H.\u2019s visitation, supervised by the Department and located at the agency, would occur at least monthly for two or three hours per session.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further, Ms. H. would undergo a mental health evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">The Mediated Consent Agreement was prefaced by the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>\u201cHaving participated in a mediation session on Sept. 2, 2003, we, the undersigned parties, affirm that the following agreements were reached during the current mediation process. We are satisfied that the provisions of our agreement, as stated, are fair and reasonable, and we agree to abide by and fulfill the agreements we have made this day. We understand our Mediation Agreement is subject to review by the Court and to the extent that the Court has jurisdiction, the provisions of our agreement may be made Orders of the Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Ms. H. and Mr. A. signed the agreement, as did counsel for the Department, counsel for Ms. H., and the mediator. Though the form contains a signature line for both the child and the child\u2019s counsel, Blessen\u2019s court-appointed attorney, neither appears to have signed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">On their return to court, the parties represented that they had reached an agreement through mediation. The Court was provided with the mediation agreement, to which was attached the original petition with the words \u201cFactual Basis for CINA, 9/2/03\u201d handwritten at the top. After reviewing the documents, suggesting additional language be added to update the document as to Blessen\u2019s location and to address an outstanding warrant pertaining to Blessen while she was in Ms. H.\u2019s custody, and leaving \u201cit up to [the Department] to draft some language\u201d to that effect,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Court was advised by counsel, including Ms. H.\u2019s counsel, \u201cthat these facts should be sustained and form the basis for a finding of CINA[]\u201d. In response, the Court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-7\">\u201cAll right. I will make such a finding, that based on the agreement of all counsel and parties, because Mr. A. is here without counsel, that the facts alleged are now facts sustained, and that they form a basis for a finding of CINA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>and I will so find, that the child Blessen H. is a child in need of assistance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">It then addressed the recommendations for Blessen\u2019s care and visitation, contained in the mediation agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Although not a part of the mediation agreement, the Court next considered a no-contact order, directed to Blessen\u2019s maternal grandmother, Ms. G. Ms. H.\u2019s counsel argued that the order prohibiting Ms. G. from contacting the child be lifted and supervised visitation be permitted. The Court refused to accept that recommendation. When called back into the courtroom and advised of that decision, Ms. G. asked to be permitted to explain the behavior alleged to underlie the order. Thereafter, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: You know, you don\u2019t really need to. I don\u2019t know whether there are criminal charges still pending or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-7\">\u201cMS.

Do we have a good address on everybody? Do we have a six month?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-10\">\u201cTHE CLERK: I have a date, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: What is the date?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-12\">\u201cTHE CLERK: March 9, 2004 at 8:30, Courtroom 18.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: March 9, this courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-14\">\u201cMS.

Do we have your address, so I can send you a copy of the order?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-16\">\u201cMS. G: _A_H_Way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-17\">\u201cTHE COURT: Wait. My law clerk will hand it down to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-18\">\u201cMS. G: I think Ms. Rogers has it. Don\u2019t you Ms. Rogers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AK5\">\u201cMS ROGERS: I do have it. I can provide it to the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ank\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. That\u2019s fine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-19\">(Whereupon the hearing was concluded.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-20\">Three days after the hearing, the Adjudication and Disposition Order, reflecting the agreement orally discussed in court, was filed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The docket entries for that day state that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>adjudication order, finding certain facts were sustained, was entered, as was an order for commitment/care/custody to the Department. The docket entries for the day of the hearing indicate that the Mediated Consent Agreement was filed, the case was called for an adjudicatory hearing, an agreement was placed on the record, the court \u201c[found] the facts sustained,\u201d a disposition hearing was held, Blessen was found to be a CINA, the court placed Blessen with a relative, and a review hearing date was set. Thus, both the docket entries and the filing date stamped on the Order make clear that the Order, although signed earlier, was not actually filed until September 5, 2003, three days after the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">\u201cA consent judgment or consent order is an agreement of the parties with respect to the resolution of the issues in the case or in settlement of the case, that has been embodied in a court order and entered by the court, thus evidencing its acceptance by the court.\u201d <em>Long v.

Davis, </em>335 Md. 699, 646 A.2d 365 (1994). When, as here, a court indicates that its written opinion or oral remarks, made from the bench, are to be followed by a written order, the final judgment occurs upon the signing and filing of the written order unless the court subsequently decides not to issue a written order, instead directing judgment in some other way, or unless the written order is collateral to the judgment. <em>Rohrbeck v. Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. 28, 41-42, 566 A.2d 767, 774 (1989). It is clear that, in the present case, a written order was contemplated: the court stated \u201cthe order will generate as I just said\u201d and set about collecting addresses \u201cso I can send you a copy of the order[ ].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>and, pursuant to the aforementioned principles of law, the oral agreement submitted in open court on September 2, 2003 was, in part, a consent judgment, <em>i.e. </em>with regard to Blessen\u2019s status as CINA, her custody, both parents\u2019 visitation rights, Ms. H.\u2019s mental health evaluation, and both parties\u2019 obligation to attend parenting classes, and, in part, a \u201cpure\u201d court order, <em>i.e. </em>with respect to the no-contact order. This Order did not become a final judgment, pursuant to Rule 2-601, however, until September 5, 2003, when it was filed with the clerk and entered on the docket. This is so because, as is clear from the final remarks made during the September 2 hearing, the court contemplated writing and filing a written order based on its oral findings and the mediated agreement between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">It is clear from Ms. H.\u2019s comments that, at the very least, she either did not fully understand either the consequences, or the extent, of the agreement to which she had assented and which the court had outlined during the hearing, or that she may no longer have been satisfied with it. She stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-7\">\u201cI can\u2019t deal with this. It\u2019s so many lies on this place. It\u2019s just ridiculous ... It really is. You know. I\u2019m trying to be the best parent I can be. I have already been slandered by DHS. Sheldon don\u2019t like some of this. And I have swallowed my pride to try to get this court hearing done. Okay.

I\u2019ve been the best mother I can be.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>She went on to chide the court that it had not asked her about her \u201cown character,\u201d or the reasons why she had not maintained a stable home for Blessen. When the Court indicated its deference to her counsel, whom it thought was speaking for her, she concluded: \u201cI can\u2019t speak no more, Your Honor. I really can\u2019t,\u201d adding that the court could proceed with \u201cthe trial\u201d while she remained outside of the courtroom. This was said despite the fact that it was clear from the proceedings, and especially the mediation agreement, that there would be no trial; Ms. H.\u2019s agreement to Blessen\u2019s CINA status via that agreement meant that there was nothing, aside from Blessen\u2019s placement, the parents\u2019 visitation and services to be provided to them by the Department, and Ms. G.\u2019s access to the child, to be resolved. Although Ms. H.\u2019s counsel requested time to speak with her outside of the courtroom, and although the Court granted that request, the hearing was concluded shortly thereafter, after the social worker had given the clerk a copy of the mediation agreement and the Court had indicated that a final order would be issued, presumably by mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Because Ms. H. made the aforementioned, at best ambiguous, statements prior to the entry of judgment, albeit after the consent had been tendered and the court had indicated its intent to accept it, the Court had an obligation to question her further as to their meaning. More specifically, given the circumstances and the seriousness of the issue, it should have ascertained whether, in view of their ambiguity, the statements were an expression of her intent to withdraw her consent to the CINA finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">In <em>Chernick v. Chernick, </em>327 Md. 470, 610 A.2d 770 (1992), we considered whether, and when, a party could withdraw consent to a consent agreement. In <em>Chemick, </em>Mr. and Ms. Chernick entered into, and signed, an agreement resolving all matters concerning their divorce. <em>Id. </em>at 474, 610 A.2d at 771-772. Pursuant to that agreement, the parties cancelled their trial date, <em>id., </em>and mailed a copy of the agreement, as a proposed consent order, to the clerk, who filed it without first obtaining a judge\u2019s signature. <em>Id. </em>at 474-475, 610 A.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>771-772. Approximately two weeks later, Ms. Chernick\u2019s attorney filed a line stating that she had withdrawn her consent to the proposed consent order. <em>Id. </em>at 474-475, 610 A.2d at 772. We concluded that the proposed consent order was actually a proposed consent judgment, <em>id. </em>at 478, 610 A.2d at 773, and acknowledged that \u201centry of a judgment by consent implies that the terms and conditions have been agreed upon and consent thereto given in open court or by filed stipulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484, 610 A.2d at 776. We held, however, that because both Chernicks had agreed, and consented to, the terms of the order at the time that it was filed with the clerk, Ms. Chernick could not subsequently withdraw her consent, even though it had not been signed by the court when she sought to do so. <em>Id. </em>at 484, 610 A.2d at 777.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Similarly, in <em>Dorsey v. Wroten, </em>35 Md.App. 359, 370 A.2d 577 (1977), which we cited approvingly in <em>Chernick, </em>327 Md. at 483-484, 610 A.2d at 776, the parties agreed to mediate their dispute. <em>Dorsey, </em>35 Md.App. at 360, 370 A.2d at 578. Having reached a successful resolution, they communicated that fact to the trial court, <em>id. </em>at 360, 370 A.2d at 579, who asked counsel to prepare a consent decree and present it to the court for signature. <em>Id. </em>Several hours later, prior to the presentment of the decree, Dorsey informed his attorney that he no longer assented to the settlement agreement, and his attorney met with the trial judge and advised him accordingly. <em>Id. </em>at 360-361, 370 A.2d at 579. \u201cThe trial judge stated that he considered the matter settled and that he would sign the \u2018consent\u2019 decree when it was presented,\u201d and, in fact, did so. <em>Id. </em>at 361, 370 A.2d at 579. The Court of Special Appeals held that, although Dorsey had orally agreed to a settlement, \u201cit is obvious that he withdrew that consent before the final meeting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>with the trial judge. It is also apparent that both the trial judge and the appellees had full knowledge that the appellant was not consenting to the decree two days before it was signed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 362, 370 A.2d at 579. Accordingly, the judgment was reversed. <em>Id. </em>The court also noted, as we had indicated in <em>Chernick, </em>327 Md. at 483-484, 610 A.2d at 776, that \u201cby its nature ... a consent decree cannot be entered unless both parties agree to the order which is presented to the clerk.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 362 n. 1, 370 A.2d at 579 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">These cases, together with Rule 2-601, indicate that if the statements Ms. H. made in open court were sufficient to indicate an intention to withdraw her consent to the mediation agreement and, in fact, she did so, the withdrawal would have occurred prior to judgment being issued in the case. Since a consent decree cannot be entered unless both parties agree to its terms, the consent order would be invalid.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On this record, it is not clear whether Ms. H. intended to withdraw her consent. Her statements were so ambiguous that the trial court should have been prompted to, upon hearing them, inquire further\u2014to, through direct questioning, ascertain the meaning of her statements and to determine her intent. Specifically, the court should have inquired as to whether she was still agreeing to the facts in the CINA petition and intended to remain bound by the mediation agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\"><em>Commercial Carrier Corp. v. Guevara, </em>541 So.2d 774 (Fla. App.1989) is instructive. In that case, the appellee had filed a six-point counterclaim in response to appellant\u2019s original complaint, Count III of which alleged a statutory violation that, if proven, would have allowed the appellee to collect attorney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>fees. <em>Id. </em>at 774. The appellant \u201cmade an offer of judgment to appellee,\u201d pursuant to which judgment on the counterclaim, not to include attorney\u2019s fees, would be entered against the appellant. <em>Id. </em>The offer was accepted by the appellee, who, when giving notice of acceptance, stated that it did not include Count III of the counterclaim. <em>Id. </em>Subsequently, the appellant filed a written objection to the entry of any judgment on the offer and acceptance \u201con the grounds that no additional entitlement by way of attorney fees was contemplated by the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The trial court entered judgment over the appellant\u2019s objection. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, the District Court of Appeal of Florida, Third Circuit, reversed. It held: \u201cit was an abuse of discretion by the trial judge to fail to disapprove the offer and acceptance when confronted by a clear and certain expression of the parties\u2019 lack of understanding as to what was intended by the offer.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Similarly, in <em>Burnaman v. Heaton, </em>150 Tex. 833, 240 S.W.2d 288 (1951), the parties announced in court that they had settled their case. <em>Id. </em>at 335, 240 S.W.2d at 289. Later that same day, the trial judge made a notation on the docket reflecting the fact of settlement, not the amount, but only after the plaintiffs attorney had obtained \u201cconfirmation of the notation from the attorney for the defendants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 335, 240 S.W.2d at 289-290.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">The trial judge having been advised by a clerk that the plaintiff was \u201ctrying to back out on the settlement,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 336, 240 S.W.2d at 290, the attorneys for both parties appeared in court and again announced their settlement. <em>Id. </em>This was entered on the docket, <em>id.; </em>however, judgment was not entered at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">One week later, the trial judge received a letter from the plaintiff, in which she stated that she did not authorize the settlement. <em>Id. </em>Following a hearing to consider whether judgment should be entered, the plaintiff having been required to show cause why not and the defendant having filed a motion to enter judgment, the trial judge entered judgment as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>defendant had requested and over the plaintiffs objection. <em>Id. </em>at 336, 240 S.W.2d at 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">On appeal, the Texas Supreme Court determined that the trial court should not have accepted the settlement because \u201cthe announcement of settlement and docket entry were made after the court had received information that the plaintiff was dissatisfied ... the record reveals that she was opposed to the settlement and is still insisting upon her right to be heard upon the merits of her claim.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 336-337, 240 S.W.2d at 290. As the judgment entered was a consent judgment, consent was required at the \u201cvery moment\u201d the court made the agreement the judgment of the court. <em>Id. </em>at 338, 240 S.W.2d at 291. It further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-6\">\u201cWhen a trial court has knowledge that one of the parties to a suit does not consent to a judgment agreed to by his attorney, the trial court should refuse to give the agreement the sanction of the court so as to make it the judgment of the court. Any judgment rendered on the agreement under such circumstances will be set aside. The same reasons which impel the setting aside of a consent judgment rendered by the court with knowledge that a party does not consent thereto will, in the interest of justice, also impel the setting aside of a consent judgment rendered when the court is in possession of information which is reasonably calculated to prompt the court to make further inquiry into the party\u2019s consent thereto, which inquiry, if reasonably pursued, would disclose the want of consent ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-7\">\u201cWe think the information in the possession of the court was clearly sufficient and of such a nature as to put the court on notice that plaintiffs consent to the judgment rendered on March 23rd might be wanting and to require the court to make further inquiry before rendering judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 339-340, 240 S.W.2d at 291-292 (citations omitted). <em>See also Cureton v. Robbins, </em>319 S.W.2d 735, 737 (Tex.Civ.App. 1958); <em>Gregory v. White, </em>604 S.W.2d 402, 403 (Tex.Civ.App. 1980); <em>Trevathan v. Akins, </em>712 S.W.2d 559, 560 (Tex.App. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>Ms. H.\u2019s statements in open court clearly demonstrate a lack of understanding of the proceedings, of the mediation agreement, or of both, and, possibly, a desire to withdraw her consent to the CINA finding. Accordingly, and consistent with the nature of a consent judgment, in which consent must be present at the very moment the judgment is entered, the trial court had a duty to question her further as to the meaning of her statements and her intention, and to determine whether she still continued to consent to the CINA finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">Accordingly, I would reverse the Court of Special Appeals and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b737-6\">. Under Maryland Rule 8-131(b) we have the discretion to review issues although they were not explicitly raised by the petition for certiorari. <em>See Simpkins v. Ford Motor Credit Co., </em>389 Md. 426, 435 n. 14, 886 A.2d 126, 131 n. 14 (2005); <em>State v. Parker, </em>334 Md. 576, 596-597, 640 A.2d 1104, 1114 (1994); <em>see also Brewer v. Brewer, </em>386 Md. 183, 191, 872 A.2d 48, 53 (2005). In the case <em>sub judice, </em>resolution of an underlying issue is much preferable to resolution strictly on the basis of the petition for certiorari. Rule 8-131(b) provides as follows, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-7\"><em>\u201cIn Court of Appeals\u2014Additional Limitations. </em>(1) Prior appellate decision. Unless otherwise provided by the order granting the writ of certiorari, in reviewing a decision rendered by the Court of Special Appeals or by a circuit court acting in an appellate capacity, the Court of Appeals ordinarily will consider only an issue that has been raised in the petition for certiorari or any cross-petition and that has been preserved for review by the Court of Appeals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-8\">Further, in her brief Ms. H. did argue, though in the context of the waiver of her rights, that she did not understand the proceedings:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWT\">\u201cAs made evident by her plea that the court should \u201cgo ahead and do the trial,\u201d (App.47), she was under the impression that proceeding by way of a contested hearing was still an option available to her. Indeed, absent any advisement to the contrary, she could not have known or understood that she had foreclosed that avenue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-9\">In doing so, she implicitly argues that the trial court should have inquired as the meaning of her statements, as those statements may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>have indicated her desire to withdraw her consent to the mediation agreement.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b738-9\">. The CINA petition, amended by inserting at the top \u201cFactual Basis for CINA, 9/2/03,\u201d was attached to the Mediated Consent Agreement, as the factual basis for the CINA finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b738-10\">. The mediated agreement did not specify whether this visitation arrangement applied to Ms. H., Mr. A., or to both. Subsequent discussions on the record, however, indicate that Ms. H.\u2019s supervised visitation was to be monthly, while Mr. A.'s visitation was to be unsupervised and at least weekly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b739-8\">. The Department\u2019s counsel made the additions requested by the court. Prior to the conclusion of the hearing, she provided them to the court, representing that she had shown them to the other parties, whom, we must presume, agreed to them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b741-21\">. The Mediated Consent Agreement was less detailed than both the discussion in court and the Order issued by the court. The Order, after stating that Blessen\u2019s status as a CINA had been proven by a preponderance of the evidence, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-24\">\"ORDERED that the Respondent Child, Blessen H., shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aubq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>\"1. be committed to the Montgomery County Department of Health and Human Services and under the jurisdiction of the Court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-6\">\"2. be placed in foster care, pending an Interstate Compact Home Study for the Respondent\u2019s paternal grandmother, Leatha C.;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-7\">\"3. be placed in the home of her paternal grandmother once the home study is completed and approved;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-8\">\"4. have supervised visitation with her father, Sheldon A., minimum weekly, until such time that the Respondent moves to New Jersey, then visitation shall be liberal and unsupervised;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-9\">\"5. have supervised visitation with her mother, Tynetta H., minimum monthly (minimum three hours a day if she visits once a month; and two hours a day if she visits twice a month) and under the direction of the Department;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-10\">\"6. have NO CONTACT with her maternal grandmother, Rose G., until further Court order, and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-12\">\"ORDERED that the Respondent\u2019s father, Sheldon A. shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-13\">\"1. bring the Respondent Child to Maryland for visitation with her mother;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-14\">\"2. participate in and complete parenting classes, and it is further \"ORDERED that the Respondent's mother, Tynetta H., shall;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-15\">\"1. give the Montgomery County Department of Health and Human Services seven to ten days notice of visitation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-16\">\"2. participate in a mental health evaluation and follow all recommendations of the evaluation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-17\">\"3. participate in and complete parenting classes ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-18\">It was dated the date of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-19\">The court order differed from the Mediated Consent Agreement in that it specified the visitation arrangements as applied to each parent, required both parents to attend parenting classes, and maintained a no contact order between Blessen and Ms. G. As we have seen, the parties appeared to agree in open court to the details of visitation and to parenting classes. It is clear, on the other hand, that Ms. H. did not agree to the no-contact order placed upon her mother. Consequently, the no-contact order was purely an order of the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b743-8\">. We have also stated that a consent agreement, or settlement agreement, is a contract between two parties which is conditioned upon the court's acceptance of its terms. <em>Chernick v. Chernick, </em>327 Md. 470, 479, 610 A.2d 770, 774 (1992). This is consistent with the understanding of the parties to this case, for, as previously noted, the mediation agreement was prefaced, in part, with the statement: \u201cwe understand our Mediation Agreement is subject to review by the Court and to the extent that the Court has jurisdiction, the provisions of our agreement maybe made Orders of the Court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b743-9\">.

Our actual holding was limited as follows: \u201cOnce a consent judgment is agreed to by the parties, executed by the parties or their authorized agents, filed with the court, and the case is taken off the trial calendar, the court may sign that consent order. The fact that one of the parties may have changed his or her mind shortly before or shortly after the submitted consent order was signed by the court does not invalidate the signed consent judgment.\u201d <em>Chernick, </em>327 Md. at 484, 610 A.2d at 777.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b748-7\">.
