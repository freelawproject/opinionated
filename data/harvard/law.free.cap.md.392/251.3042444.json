The Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, ruling on the applicant\u2019s <em>Petition for Preliminary Injunction and/or Temporary Restraining Order, </em>determined that the ADA applied and that the applicant was entitled to the accommodation he sought. Accordingly, it granted the applicant\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the Board to provide \u201cADA accommodations,\u201d as specified.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We shall hold that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>authority over the bar admission process is solely within the jurisdiction of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The applicant was not diagnosed with, and appears not to have sought evaluation for, a learning disability until just prior to entering law school in 2002, after he had taken the Law School Aptitude Test (\u201cLSAT\u201d). He had previously taken the Scholastic Aptitude Test (\u201cSAT\u201d), entered Emory University, completed his Bachelor\u2019s Degree at that University with a 3.7 Grade Point Average, and taken the LSAT, all without disability accommodation. His dissatisfaction with his LSAT score prompted him to obtain an evaluation to determine if he had learning disabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">The psychologist he consulted, Dr. Anne Wake, after testing the applicant over four days, concluded that he has a specific processing learning disability, diagnosis 315.9 in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (\u201cDSM-IV\u201d). On the strength of that diagnosis and consistent with Dr. Wake\u2019s recommendation, he was given accommodation, typically amounting to double time and the use of a computer,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> throughout law school, at both the University of Baltimore Law School and the George Washington University School of Law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>On May 15, 2005, the applicant wrote to the Board of Law Examiners requesting ADA accommodation when he sat for the July 2005 Maryland bar examination.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He included in his letter reports from his psychologist, as well as letters from both of the law schools he had attended, the latter of which indicated that he had received such accommodations throughout his law school career. The applicant specifically asked that he be given double time to complete the examination and that he be permitted to use a word processing computer in doing so. The Board, consistent with its customary practice and its Rules, <em>see </em>Rule 3 d. of the Rules of the Maryland State Board of Law Examiners,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> forwarded the reports and the letters to its expert psychologist for review. On this occasion, the material was sent to Dr. Lawrence Lewandowski,</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The Board\u2019s psychologist concluded, on the documentary record,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that the applicant had not demonstrated a disability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>covered by the ADA and, therefore, was not entitled to accommodation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He consequently recommended that the applicant not be given accommodation. Based on that recommendation, on June 20, 2005, the Board denied the applicant\u2019s request for ADA accommodation. The reasons for the decision were amplified by its subsequent letter, dated June 21, 2005, responding to a further inquiry from the applicant for a fuller explanation of its decision. In that letter, the Board advised the applicant, as it had been informed by Dr. Lewandowski, that he did not meet the criteria for either a DSM-IV diagnosis of a learning disorder or as a qualified person under the ADA, explaining that he had demonstrated above average performance in \u201cvirtually every dimension of cognitive and academic functioning\u201d and that \u201c[b]ecause a test score is not as high as a superior IQ score, does not mean it is a deficit or impairment.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In addition, the Board invited the submission of \u201cadditional documentation,\u201d by way of \u201can appeal,\u201d to be filed with its Chair, within ten days.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>On July 1, 2005, the applicant, through counsel, filed, by letter, <em>Appeal of Denial of Request for Bar Exam Accommodation for Robert Kimmer,</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>with the Board\u2019s Chair. Arguing that he was evaluated by a highly-eredentialed expert in learning disabilities, that he has a learning disability, as demonstrated by the professional testing performed by that expert, and that his disability \u201csubstantially limits the major life activities of reading, writing ... [and] working, and [that he] has the proficiency and intellect required to practice law,\u201d the applicant concluded that he thus required and was entitled to accommodation. Moreover, the applicant asserted, professional examinations, such as bar examinations, fall under the purview of the ADA.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">This \u201cappeal,\u201d along with a supplemental letter from Dr. Wake addressing the deficiencies the Board identified in the applicant\u2019s submission seeking accommodation, were referred to Dr. Lewandowski for review. Finding that nothing new had been presented, Dr. Lewandowski\u2019s recommendation did not change. Based on that assessment and the Chair\u2019s review of all documentation, the Board, on July 21, 2005,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> denied the \u201cappeal,\u201d concluding \u201cthat there is no justification for granting the accommodations requested and they are therefore denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">On July 22, 2005, four days before the bar examination he intended to sit for was to be administered, the applicant filed, in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, a <em>Petition far </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number><em>Preliminary Injunction and/or Temporary Restraining Order </em>to enjoin the State Board of Law Examiners \u201cfrom denying ADA accommodations to [the applicant] on the July 2005 Maryland and multistate bar exam in the form of double time and the use of a computer on the essay exam.\u201d He argued in the petition, as he had similarly argued to the Board, that he suffers from a learning disability which substantially limits major life activities, namely reading, writing, and working, that he is thus impaired in his ability to compete with his peers on time restricted examinations, and that the failure of the Board to give him ADA accommodations as requested deprives him of his right to work in his chosen profession. Further, he urged that, because he was planning to take the July 26 and 27 bar examination, it was imperative that the Court quickly order that such accommodations be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Following a hearing held on the same day,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the trial court ordered the requested injunctive relief, namely, a temporary restraining order requiring that the applicant have the use of a computer for the essay portion of the examination and double time in which to take it and the multistate examination. It concluded that the applicant would likely be successful on the merits of the case, that the likelihood of prejudice regarding other examination takers was outweighed by the applicant\u2019s hardship, that the applicant would likely suffer irreparable harm if he was not accommodated and failed the examination, that the accommodations would be easy for the Board to make, and that public policy favored giving accommodations to those with ADA recognized disabilities.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>The Board fully complied with the court\u2019s order and provided the ordered accommodation for the applicant during the July 2005 examination. Subsequently, however, by letter dated August 2, 2005, long before the examination had been graded and two days before the expiration of the temporary restraining order, it informed the applicant, through counsel, that it was \u201cmaintaining] its position that [he] has not established that he is entitled, under the Americans with Disabilities Act, to the accommodations he received for the July 2005 Maryland bar examination.\u201d The Board also advised the applicant that, although it would grade his examination anonymously with the other examinees, it would not recommend his admission to the bar of Maryland, even if he passed the examination, \u201cprior to an adjudication on the merits of his entitlement to accommodations for taking the Maryland bar examination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">In response, on September 29, 2005,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the applicant filed a <em>Motion for Declaratory Relief. </em>Filed in the same case from which the temporary restraining order was issued, he, in effect, asked the Circuit Court to make the temporary restraining order it had issued on July 22 permanent and, further, for a ruling that the applicant be admitted to the Maryland Bar. In that regard, the applicant argued that the granting of the temporary restraining order would have been otherwise meaningless; in issuing the order, the court also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>must have intended that the Board recommend the applicant\u2019s admission upon his successful passing of the bar examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The Board timely opposed this motion. Noting that the motion was filed two months after both the expiration of the temporary restraining order and receipt of the Board\u2019s letter informing the applicant of its intention not to recommend the applicant\u2019s admission and, thus, characterizing it as \u201cimproperly seeking] to revive and extend the parameters of a long-expired temporary restraining order, contrary to the Rules, and to transmute it into permanent injunctive relief,\u201d the Board submitted that, \u201c[a]s the filing is unsupported by a proper complaint, it is plainly defective and [the Circuit] Court lacks jurisdiction to act on it. It must be stricken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">On November 4, 2005, as required by Rule 10(a) of the Rules Governing Admission to the Bar of Maryland,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the Board of Law Examiners reported the results of the July 2005 bar examination to the Court of Appeals, along with its recommendations for admission. The applicant was listed as having passed the examination. On the same date, pursuant to Rule 10(b),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> this Court passed an order setting December <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>5, 2005 as the date on which, in the absence of the filing of exceptions to any applicant, the Board\u2019s recommendation would be ratified, and, pursuant to Rule 10(c),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the Board filed its exceptions to the applicant\u2019s admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">Thereafter, by letter to the Court, dated November 17, 2005, the Board asked the Court to set the matter of its exception to the admission of the applicant in for a hearing, pursuant to Rule 10(c). It perceived the \u201cdiscrete issue before the Court [to be] whether [the applicant] is entitled to admission when he has not sought, nor obtained, an adjudication on the merits of his ADA claim.\u201d Accordingly, the Board offered in support of its request that \u201c[t]he qualification of an applicant for admission to the Bar is a matter which rests peculiarly within the jurisdiction of this Court.\u201d On December 2, 2005, this Court ordered that any proceedings in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County regarding the applicant\u2019s bar examination and admission be stayed, and scheduled the case for a hearing on the Board\u2019s exceptions and on the issue of the Circuit Court\u2019s jurisdiction over bar admission matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The regulation of the practice of law, including the regulation of the admissions to the bar, long has been, <em>see </em>Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>of April, 1715, ch. 48, \u00a7\u00a7 12, 13 (Maxcy ed., vol. 1, p. 132 (1811)),<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and is now, a judicial function. <em>Post v. Bregman </em>349 Md. 142, 162-63, 707 A.2d 806, 816 (1998); <em>Attorney General v. Waldron, </em>289 Md. 683, 692, 426 A.2d 929, 935 (1981); <em>Maryland State Bar Ass\u2019n v. Boone, </em>255 Md. 420, 258 A.2d 438 (1969); <em>Pub. Service Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Hahn Transportation, </em>253 Md. 571, 583, 253 A.2d 845, 852 (1969) (\u201cUnder our constitutional system of separation of powers, the determination of what constitutes the practice of law and the regulation of the practice and of its practitioners is, and essentially and appropriately should be a function of the judicial branch of the government.\u201d). This point was made most forcefully and completely in <em>Waldron, </em>where we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">\u201cCognizant of the constitutionally imposed responsibility with respect to the administration of justice in this State, this Court has heretofore recognized and held that the regulation of the practice of law, the admittance of new members to the bar, and the discipline of attorneys who fail to conform to the established standards governing their professional conduct are essentially judicial in nature and, accordingly, are encompassed in the constitutional grant of judicial authority to the courts of this State.... Thus, in <em>[Public Serv. Comm\u2019n v.] Hahn [Transp., Inc.], </em>253 Md. [571,] 583, 253 A.2d [845,] 852 [1969], Chief Judge Hammond stated for this Court that \u2018(u)nder our constitutional system of separation of powers, the determination of what consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>tutes the practice of law and the regulation of the practice and of its practitioners is, and essentially and appropriately should be, a function of the judicial branch of government.\u2019 A short time later, this Court determined, <em>inter alia, </em>that the following words of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts are \u2018highly persuasive\u2019:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\">\u201cIt is a necessary implication from the exclusive jurisdiction of the judicial department of control of membership in the bar that the judicial department is not restricted in the (manner) of review in such proceedings to methods prescribed by statute. If this were not true the judicial department would be restricted by legislative action in the performance of its duties with respect to membership in the bar of which it has \u2018exclusive cognizance.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Maryland State Bar Ass\u2019n v. Boone, </em>255 Md. at 431, 258 A.2d at 443.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">\u201cThe principle that the admission of attorneys to the bar as well as their supervision once admitted are by nature functions and concerns of the judicial branch of government is far from a novel concept. The history of the courts in the formative years of this nation, and indeed, the history of our ancestral English courts support the conclusion that this uniquely judicial responsibility is of ancient vintage. Even though the doctrine of separation of powers is not an integral part of the British system of government and is one whose fruition occurred on the western shores of the Atlantic, the English courts common law, chancery, admiralty and ecclesiastical have always exclusively admitted attorneys, solicitors and proctors to practice before them. Insofar as the other class of English legal practitioners is concerned, barristers traditionally were regulated by the educational societies known as the Inns of Court, which, in turn, generally are thought to have submitted to the control of judges as visitors to those bodies. All of this oversight and supervision of the English practitioners was accomplished independent of any authorization or predomination by any other department of government. <em>See State v. Cannon, </em>206 Wis. 589[374], 240 N.W. 441, 445-48 (1932), and <em>In re Day, </em>181 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Ill. 73, 54 N.E. 646, 648-50 (1899), and citations therein, for discussions of the history of the admission and regulation of lawyers in England. <em>See </em>also Note, <em>Admission to the Bar and the Separation of Powers, </em>7 Utah L.Rev. 82, 82-86 (1960). Similarly, there are early statements in opinions of courts of this country that declare the admission to practice to be an exercise of judicial power. <em>See, e. g., Ex parte Garland, </em>71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 333, 18 L.Ed. 366 (1867); <em>Ex parte Secombe, </em>60 U.S. (19 How.) 9, 15 L.Ed. 565 (1857); <em>In re Mosness, </em>39 Wis. 509, 20 Am.Rep. 55, 56-57 (1876). <em>See </em>also 1 E. Thornton, Attorneys at Law \u00a7\u00a7 756-61 (1914). As has been recognized by a distinguished scholar of these matters:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\">\u201cIt is undoubtedly true that the power to admit one to practice as an attorney at law is a judicial function. It is a power inherent in the court, which is to be exercised by a sound judicial discretion.... Early in the national jurisprudence it was held that the power to admit and remove was the exclusive province of a federal court. And this ruling has been consistently maintained. Where a state constitution lodges the judicial power exclusively in the courts, as a coordinate department of government, (as does Maryland\u2019s by Art. IV, \u00a7 1,) the legislature will not be permitted to encroach upon the judicial powers by assuming to make admission to the bar a legislative function. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 28, p. 31-32.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">\u201cMoreover, in more recent decades, various courts from many of our sister jurisdictions have pronounced that such authority, and the power generally to regulate matters regarding the profession and its practitioners, are reposed inherently in the judiciary....</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">\u201cThe statements of this and other courts announcing the obligation of the judicial branch of government to monitor and manage its own house are not hollow proclamations of power, for the placement of this responsibility with the judiciary represents a recognition of this special, and to a degree, unique relationship that has evolved over the years between the legal profession and the tribunals of justice it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>selves. In this country, it is a well known maxim that attorneys function as officers of the courts, and, as such, are a necessary and important adjunct to the administration of justice. This truism necessarily derives, in our view, from the very theory of the structure of our system of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ADh\">289 Md. at 692-695, 426 A.2d at 935-936 (and cases therein cited).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">To be sure, the judicial power of admitting attorneys to the practice of law was exercised, between 1715 and 1898, by both the county courts and this Court\u2014initially by the county courts exclusively, William H. Adkins, II, <em>What Doth the Board Require of Thee?, </em>28 Md. L.Rev. 103, 104 (1968); <em>see State v. Johnston, </em>2 H. &amp; McH. 160, 1786 WL 52, 2-3 (General Court, 1786) (refusing to grant certiorari to review the action of a lower court in admitting to practice one who had been a Tory),<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and, later, concurrently with this Court. Adkins, 28 Md. L.Rev. at 104. The current procedures for admitting attorneys have their genesis in Ch. 139, 1898 Md. Laws, the enactment of which placed in this Court exclusive jurisdiction over admissions.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Chapter 139 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>\u201cAll applications for admission to the bar in this State shall be made by petition to the Court of Appeals. A State Board of Law Examiners is hereby created to consist of three members of the bar of at least ten years\u2019 standing, who shall be appointed by the Court of Appeals, and shall hold office for the term of three years.... All applications for admission to the bar shall be referred by the Court of Appeals to the State Board of Law Examiners, who shall examine the applicant, touching his qualifications for admission to the bar. The said board shall report their proceedings in the examination of applicants to the Court of Appeals with any recommendations said board may desire to make. If the Court of Appeals shall then find the applicant to be qualified to discharge the duties of an attorney, and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>be of good moral character and worthy to be admitted, they shall pass an order admitting him to practice in all the courts of the State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Therefore, it has been clear, since 1898, that the Court of Appeals has had exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of, and admission to, the practice of law. <em>See Bastian v. Watkins, </em>230 Md. 325, 329, 187 A.2d 304, 306 (1963) (\u201c[I]n 1898, following a definite trend toward uniformity that apparently began as early as 1831, the Court of Appeals of Maryland was vested with exclusive power to admit applicants to practice law.\u201d); <em>Maryland State Bar Ass\u2019n v. Boone, </em>255 Md. 420, 430, 258 A.2d 438, 443 (1969) (\u201cSince the passage of Ch. 139 of the Laws of 1898 ... the Court of Appeals in the exercise of its inherent and fundamental judicial powers has supervised, regulated and controlled the admission of lawyers.\u201d); <em>Application of Allan S., </em>282 Md. 683, 689, 387 A.2d 271, 275 (1978) (\u201cUpon this Court falls the primary and ultimate responsibility for regulating the practice of law and the conduct and admission of attorneys in this State.\u201d); <em>In the Matter of the Application of William H. Hyland, </em>339 Md. 521, 534, 663 A.2d 1309, 1315 (1995). It follows that the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County simply had no jurisdiction over any aspect of the applicant\u2019s bar admission, including the circumstances surrounding his bar examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Despite the foregoing and its clarity on the question of this Court\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction, the applicant nevertheless argues, on this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-8\">\u201cAlthough the Court\u2019s order could only have meant that the Board (1) administer the bar exam, (2) anonymously grade the bar exam, and (3) if Mr. Kimmer passed the anonymously graded bar exam, report the results to this Court in the same manner that it would for any other successful candidate, the Board refused to report the favorable results <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>unless Mr. Kimmer obtained another court <em>order,</em><footnotemark><em>[21]</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in a separate hearing on the merits, ruling that he was entitled to ADA accommodations, even though, under the Circuit Court\u2019s order, Mr. Kimmer\u2019s July 2005 exam, as administered, would forever be his only July 2005 exam.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Notwithstanding the implications of this argument, the applicant denies that he has sought, or is seeking, \u201cto have the trial court direct his admission to the bar.\u201d Rather, he says, he merely used appropriate legal process to obtain \u201cvalid enforcement of his federal ADA rights,\u201d <em>i.e. </em>injunctive relief. Moreover, he asserts that, because the ADA preempts state and local law to the contrary, it \u201ccontrols\u201d even in cases of bar licensure, which the applicant concedes is an issue for this Court. Further, the applicant notes, and emphasizes, that state courts, and consequently Maryland circuit courts, have concurrent jurisdiction with the federal judiciary over ADA claims. The applicant thus concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">\u201cMerely because Mr. Kimmer\u2019s ADA issue arises in the context of the bar exam does not place it outside the statutory jurisdiction of the Circuit Court. No one would suggest that an applicant for a CPA exam or a medical board certification would litigate the denial of ADA accommodations before accountant or medical licensure bodies, simply because they, like this Court, ultimately control the licensure process of their profession.\u201d <footnotemark>[22]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Notwithstanding the applicant\u2019s protestations to the contrary, the thrust of his argument is that the trial court\u2019s preliminary ruling is dispositive, and not only of the ADA accommodation question, but also of the Board\u2019s obligation not simply to report the applicant\u2019s favorable results but, as it would do in the case of a person taking the examination without accommodation, to recommend his admission to the bar. That is necessarily the case when the effect of other actions that must be taken subsequent to the court\u2019s temporary ruling necessarily must be informed by, and conform to, what the court must have meant when it made the ruling, whether or not the issue driving the ruling was contested. The implications of adopting that argument in this context are clear; at least with regard to applicants to the bar who claim to have disabilities covered by the ADA, the circuit courts will have concurrent jurisdiction with this Court with regard to their bar admission. While the regulation of the practice of law, including the admission to the bar, was at one time a shared responsibility between the county courts and the General Court and then, later, between the county courts and this Court, that no longer is the case. We decline to retreat to that earlier time.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">Sidestepping the historical basis of this Court\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction over bar admission matters, the applicant attempts to argue that concurrent jurisdiction between this Court and the circuit courts is necessary in instances where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>immediate relief, which, presumably, only the circuit courts are equipped to grant, is required. Of course, he believes his case is one of these instances; his reasoning is that, because he submitted his request for accommodations to the Board well within the Board\u2019s own deadline, and because he followed each action by the Board with speedy action of his own, the fact that he still had an unfavorable outcome four days before the bar examination for which he planned to sit required that, to obtain the ADA accommodations he sought, he had to seek immediate injunctive relief through the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The premise on which this argument proceeds is faulty. Neither this applicant nor any other has the right to take a particular bar examination at a particular time, nor to be admitted to the bar at any particular time. That the Board of Law Examiners took longer than the applicant would have liked to render its final decision does not mean that it acted unreasonably or placed the applicant in a situation which could be remedied only by obtaining injunctive relief from the Circuit Court. With respect to the July bar examination, the applicant had two choices: he could have taken the examination unaccommodated, or he could have postponed taking the examination to pursue, through the administrative process, the accommodation to which he believed he was entitled. To be sure, the applicant, without accommodation, may have failed the bar examination had he taken it, or he may have had to delay taking the examination. That, however, is irrelevant to our analysis and to the procedures prescribed by this Court in bar admission matters. There simply is no such immediate need present in bar admission matters such that circuit court jurisdiction is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Further, that our own jurisdictional rules require the applicant to bring his bar admission-related ADA claim to the Board and this Court rather than to any other state court does not contradict the ADA and its preemption provisions, contrary to the applicant\u2019s arguments. The applicant is correct in that cases arising under the ADA may be heard in either federal or state courts, <em>Yellow Freight System, Inc. v. Donnel</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number><em>ly, </em>494 U.S. 820, 823, 110 S.Ct. 1566, 1568, 108 L.Ed.2d 834, 839 (1990); <em>R.A. Ponte Architects v. Investors\u2019 Alert, Inc., </em>382 Md. 689, 715, 857 A.2d 1, 16 (2004); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 (2006), and rules which would outrightly prohibit such claims, or their adjudication, are preempted. <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. State Energy Resources Conser. &amp; Dev. Comm\u2019n, </em>461 U.S. 190, 203-204, 103 S.Ct. 1713, 1722, 75 L.Ed.2d 752, 765 (1983). The ADA does not mandate specific state court procedures by which a plaintiff must be heard, however. Ware <em>v. Wyoming Board of Law Examiners, </em>973 F.Supp. 1339, 1353 (D.Wy.1997) (\u201cThe ADA does not completely preempt or displace a state\u2019s procedure for licensing attorneys, rather \u2018the ADA merely prohibits states from discriminating on the basis of disability.\u2019 \u201d). Federal preemption of state laws occurs only to the extent to which there is a conflict between the state court procedure and the ADA. <em>Pacific Gas and Electric Co. v. State Energy Resources Conser. &amp; Dev. Comm\u2019n, </em>461 U.S. 190, 203-204, 103 S.Ct. 1713, 1722, 75 L.Ed.2d 752, 765 (1983). Therefore, that our rules require the applicant to present his ADA accommodation entitlement claim to the Board of Law Examiners for determination, with the ultimate resolution being entrusted to this Court, and not to any other state court, does not violate the ADA. The applicant\u2019s opportunity to be heard, albeit through procedures which differ from those that govern ADA claims which do not arise in the bar admission context, is nevertheless preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">It should be noted that similar conclusions have been reached by other courts. In <em>Varad v. Barshak, </em>261 F.Supp.2d 47 (D.Mass.2003), plaintiff/applicant orally requested ADA accommodations during the bar examination from a member of the Massachusetts Board of Bar Examiners (\u201cBBE\u201d), but did not make that request in writing or within seventy-five days prior to the bar examination, as the BBE required. <em>Id. </em>at 55. Because she had failed to follow the processes dictated by the BBE, and, thus, failed to exhaust her remedies under the BBE, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court refused to hear the case, to intervene, or to grant her accommodations. <em>Id. </em>at 52. The applicant sought relief from the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>District Court for the District of Massachusetts. That court similarly denied the applicant\u2019s request, on summary judgment, because, despite having received notice of the procedures necessary to obtain accommodations, the applicant had failed to comply with them. <em>Id. </em>at 55. Thus, it was determined, if only implicitly, that the Massachusetts Board of Bar Examiners\u2019 rules and procedures for obtaining ADA accommodations did not violate the ADA or deny the applicant her right to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">As our historical analysis and jurisprudence make clear, this Court, since 1898, is the only court with jurisdiction over bar admission matters. None of the applicant\u2019s arguments to the contrary has merit. The Circuit Court simply had no jurisdiction to order the injunctive relief in this case. Accordingly, the Board\u2019s exceptions are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Neither Title 10 of the Maryland Code, Business Occupations and Professions Article nor the Rules Governing Admission to the Bar of Maryland [Rules] specifically addresses procedures to be followed in a situation such as the applicant\u2019s, where an applicant seeks further review of the Board of Law Examiner\u2019s decision to deny him ADA accommodations for the bar examination. There are, however, Rules that are pertinent and, therefore, instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">Rules 5<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>, 10 <footnotemark>24</footnotemark>, and 13<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> of the Rules Governing Admission to the Bar of Maryland describe the general procedures by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>which bar admissions are controlled. Rule 5 addresses character review. Pursuant to that Rule, an applicant\u2019s character questionnaire is submitted to the Character Committee for investigation and report. Rule 5(b)(1). If the Committee concludes that there may be a basis to recommend denial of the applicant\u2019s application, after affording the applicant the opportunity for an on-the-record hearing, at which the applicant may be represented by counsel, present witnesses, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>testify, it will transmit the transcript of the hearing, along with its report and recommendation, to the Board. Rule 5(b)(2). The Board shall also afford the applicant, as to whom it concludes there is a basis to recommend that his or her application be denied, an opportunity for a hearing, and, if it so recommends, an opportunity to withdraw the application. Rule 5(c). If the Board recommends that an applicant be denied admission or recommends admission contrary to an adverse recommendation of the Character Committee, and the Committee excepts, proceedings on the record (in the case of the former, the applicant being required to show cause and, in the case of the latter, a hearing on the Committee\u2019s exceptions) will be held in the Court of Appeals. Rule 5(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">Rule 10 governs the report and recommendation required to be made by the Board to the Court, as to each successful applicant. Rule 10(a). This Rule permits \u201cany person,\u201d including the Board, to take exceptions to the admission of any applicant. Rule 10(c). As we have seen, the board excepted to the applicant\u2019s admission. Rule 10(c) also provides, as relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">\u201cA hearing on the exceptions shall be held to allow the exceptant and candidate to present evidence in support of or in opposition to the exceptions and the Board and Character Committee to be heard. The Court may hold the hearing or may refer the exceptions to the Board, the Character Committee, or an examiner for hearing. The Board, Character Committee, or examiner hearing the exceptions shall file with the Court, as soon as practicable after the hearing, a report of the proceedings. The Court may decide the exceptions without further hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Rule 13 describes the procedures by which out-of-state attorneys are admitted to the bar of Maryland. After receipt and investigation of an applicant\u2019s petition and supporting data, if the Board concludes that there are grounds to reject the petition, it must afford the petitioner an opportunity for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>hearing. Rule 13(j). If the Board recommends rejection, the petitioner may file exceptions with the Court of Appeals. Rule 13(k). The Court will determine whether to hear the exceptions or appoint an examiner to hear the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">In analyzing each of these rules, a general process of review begins to emerge: if there is a basis for the Board to recommend denial of an applicant\u2019s application or petition, it shall afford the applicant a hearing. If the Board does recommend denial, the applicant is entitled to be heard, and the Court will issue a show cause order or the applicant may file exceptions with this Court. Except with respect to character matters, where the proceedings will be on the records made before the Character Committee and the Board, the Court will either hear the issue or designate the Board or another body or person to hear the issue. In no circumstance does the applicant remain unheard.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Similarly, the applicant here, upon receiving the Board\u2019s letter denying his \u201cappeal,\u201d could, and perhaps should, have filed a request for a hearing with the Board. Thereafter, he could have sought review, by exceptions, in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Rather than pursue the matter of his entitlement to ADA accommodation in this Court, the applicant sought relief in the Circuit Court, thus circumventing this Court\u2019s admission procedures and, in the process, undermining this Court\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction. Were we to hold that circuit courts have jurisdiction to decide ADA, and other issues, in the bar admission context, we would be participating in the undermining of our jurisdiction; we would be relinquishing our exclusive power over bar admission matters. That exclusivity has existed unabated and unassailed since 1898. We have no intention of relinquishing it to any degree or extent. As indicated, the exceptions of the Board of Law Examiners are sustained. Accordingly, the applicant\u2019s admission to the Bar of the State of Maryland is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b282-8\">. In analyzing the Circuit Court's jurisdiction over bar admission matters, we use the term \u201cjurisdiction\u201d fundamentally, to indicate the actual power, rather than the propriety, of the Circuit Court acting in such matters. We discussed this issue in <em>Maryland Bd. of Nursing v. Nechay, </em>347 Md. 396, 405-406, 701 A.2d 405, 410 (1997). There, we observed, as we previously had done in <em>Moore v. McAllister, </em>216 Md. 497, 507, 141 A.2d 176, 182 (1958), and long had recognized, that \"[jluridically, jurisdiction refers to two quite distinct concepts: (i) the power of a court to render a valid decree, and (ii) the propriety of granting the relief sought.\u201d (Citing 1 Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence (5th ed.1941), \u00a7\u00a7 129-31). <em>See First Federated Commodity Trust Corp. v. Commissioner of Securities for Maryland, </em>272 Md. 329, 334, 322 A.2d 539, 543 (1974). Noting that the former concept involves jurisdiction in its fundamental sense, <em>Nechay, </em>347 Md. at 405-406, 701 A.2d at 410, citing <em>McAllister, </em>216 Md. at 507, 141 A.2d at 182, we offered the explication of the concept set out in <em>Kaouris v.

[to] establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>minimum criteria for the learning and character of persons admitted to the bar of this State.\u201d We were clear, however, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiR\">\"There can be no doubt ... that the deferential respect accorded the legislative branch by the judicial must neither undermine nor dilute the fundamental authority and responsibility vested in the judiciary to carry out its constitutionally required function, an aspect of which, as we have seen, is the supervision of practicing attorneys,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AM1\">and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">\u201csince admission to the bar is a judicial function, the Legislature may not prescribe the maximum qualifications necessary for admittance, for this Court is always free to adopt any additional requirements it deems necessary to maintain a high level of professional competence in the bar and promote public trust in and respect for the profession.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Thus, the Judiciary's responsibility and obligation with regard to the practice and admission process are recognized throughout the statute. Section 10-103 provides for the Court to \"adopt rules that govern the standards and procedures for admission to the Bar.\" Section 10-206 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-8\">\"(a) Except as otherwise provided by law, before an individual may practice law in the State, the individual shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-9\">\u201c(1) be admitted to the Bar; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-10\">\u201c(2) meet any requirement that the Court of Appeals may set by rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">Section 10-207(f) pi escribes that, to qualify for admission to the bar, in addition to the statutory provisions, \"[a]n applicant shall meet any other qualification or requirement that the Court of Appeals establishes by rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-12\">Moreover, the Rules Governing Admission to the Bar of Maryland are comprehensive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[21]\">\n<p id=\"b298-7\">21. This is not correct. The Board did report the applicant\u2019s favorable results to the Court, but then filed an exception to his admission, as it was permitted by Rule 10(c) to do.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-8\">It also is worth remembering that the trial court's ruling was a temporary ruling and was only intended to be as much. The order contained a provision making this fact crystal clear; by its terms, the temporary restraining order would expire in ten days from the date of the order. Tellingly, it was the trial judge herself who penciled in that provision. Moreover, the propriety of issuing the temporary restraining order was a contested issue, and its resolution on a temporary basis did not, as the Board\u2019s letter of August 2, 2005 made amply clear, amount to its resolution on a permanent basis. Certainly, the Board did not acquiesce in the decision.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[22]\">\n<p id=\"b298-9\">22. We are not persuaded. This Court acts both legislatively and judicially. We act legislatively when we promulgate rules of procedure and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>practice, <em>i.e., </em>the Maryland Rules of Practice and Procedure, or to regulate the profession, <em>i.e., </em>the Rules Governing Admission to the Bar of Maryland. The source of our legislative power is the Maryland Constitution, Md. Const Art. IV, \u00a7 18(a), and the separation of powers doctrine, Md. Const, Declaration of Rights, Art. 8. Thus, we have, by rule, <em>see </em>Rule 3 of the Rules of the Maryland State Board of Law Examiners, required applicants to present their bar admission-related ADA claims to the Board of Law Examiners for consideration and decision and thus, ultimately, to this Court. Adjudication of this case is pursuant to this Court's constitutional responsibility and jurisdiction, as the highest Court in this state, to regulate the practice and oversee admissions to the bar. The comparison of our process to a professional licensure board\u2019s hearing of an ADA claim is, consequently, and to say the least, inappropriate and inapposite.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b302-9\">. \u201cRule 5.
