Yol.), \u00a7\u00a7 10-611 through 10-628 of the State Government Article, by an inmate of a Maryland correctional institution who seeks access to certain public records. The sole issue before us is whether the Prisoner Litigation Act, Maryland Code (1974, 2002 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 5-1001 through 5-1007 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, precludes this action on the ground that the plaintiff has not \u201cfully exhausted all administrative remedies for resolving [his] complaint or grievance.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 5-1003(a)(1) and (c) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. We shall hold that the exhaustion of administrative remedies provision of the Prisoner Litigation Act has no application to, and thus does not preclude, the statutory cause of action under the Public Information Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">The case was decided in the Circuit Court by a grant of the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the plaintiffs complaint. Consequently, for purposes of these appellate proceedings, the factual allegations in the complaint are accepted as true and constitute the basic facts of the case. <em>Benson v.

Massey, Jr., an inmate at the Western Correctional Institution in Cumberland, Maryland, on July 16, 2002, filed in the Circuit Court for Allegany County a complaint under the Maryland Public Information Act, Code (1984, 2004 Repl. Yol.), \u00a7 10-623 of the State Government Article, against Jon P. Galley, the Warden of the Western Correctional Institution. The complaint alleged that Galley is the custodian of records at the Western Correctional Institution (WCI), and that on May 28, 2002, Massey mailed to Galley a request that Massey be allowed to inspect the following public records in Galley\u2019s custody:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-6\">\u201ca. The contract between the State of Maryland and Prison Health services, Inc. (PHS) which is currently effective and applies to provisions of medical care at WCI.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-7\">b. Any and all records of lawful authorization for the WCI commissary to charge inmates any amount beyond costs of items sold, including specifleation(s) of any percentage/amount allowable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-8\">c. Any and all records, including contracts, pertaining to the use of photocopier machines for/by inmates housed at WCI and currently effective.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-9\">d. Any and all financial records, such as monthly reports, pertaining to the photocopier cards sold by the WCI commissary to inmates, including the amount(s) and destination(s) of funds obtained by said sales during the current fiscal year.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">The complaint alleged that Massey, not having received any response to his request, on June 30, 2002, again mailed to Galley a request to inspect the documents. The complaint further alleged that Massey had still not received any response to his request, that Galley had not asked for an extension of time to respond as provided by \u00a7 10\u2014614(b)(4) of the State Government Article, and that Galley had not \u201ctemporarily denied\u201d Massey\u2019s request pursuant to \u00a7 10-619 of the State Government Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>The complaint went on to state that Massey, being a \u201cperson\u201d within the meaning of the Public Information Act, has a right to inspect public records which are not exempt from inspection, that Galley \u201chas not made a good faith effort to comply with the Act,\u201d and that Galley\u2019s \u201cknowing and willful denial of disclosure renders his action/inaction arbitrary and capricious.\u201d Massey sought an \u201corder[] that [the] records requested be produced for inspection,\u201d as well as other relief pursuant to \u00a7 10-628 of the State Government Article.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Massey\u2019s complaint in the Circuit Court did not allege, or even intimate, that he had any type of complaint or grievance concerning his confinement, or the defendant, or any other officers or personnel connected with the institution or the Maryland Division of Correction. Massey alleged that he simply wanted access to the records as a \u201cperson\u201d who has a statutory right to such access.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">The defendant Galley filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the Circuit Court \u201clack[ed] subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs claims, as Plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies prior to initiating this lawsuit.\u201d The defendant asserted that Massey had an administrative remedy before the Inmate Grievance Office pursuant to Code (1999), \u00a7\u00a7 10-201 through 10-210 of the Correctional Services Article. The motion to dismiss went on to state that the Prisoner Litigation Act, \u00a7 5-1003(a)(l) and (c) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, precluded this action under the Public Information Act because of Massey\u2019s failure to exhaust his Inmate Grievance Office administrative remedy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>The Circuit Court granted the defendant Galley\u2019s motion to dismiss. Upon Massey\u2019s appeal, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed. <em>Massey v. Galley, </em>154 Md.App. 437, 840 A.2d 183 (2003). Thereafter, this Court granted Massey\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari. <em>Massey v. Galley, </em>381 Md. 324, 849 A.2d 473 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">This case involves three separate state statutes, and a dispute concerning the relationship among them. Thus, we shall first briefly review each of the statutes as well as the parties\u2019 arguments based upon them.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">The statute creating the Inmate Grievance Office (formerly named the Inmate Grievance Commission), and providing for an adjudicatory administrative remedy and judicial review for inmate \u201cgrievances,\u201d was enacted by Ch. 210 of the Acts of 1971, and is presently codified as \u00a7\u00a7 10-201 through 10-210 of the Correctional Seivices Article. For discussions of the statute, <em>see, e.g., Watkins v. Department of Public Safety, </em>377 Md. 34, 45-47, 831 A.2d 1079, 1086-1087 (2003); <em>Adamson v. Correctional Medical Services, supra, </em>359 Md. at 250-257, 753 A.2d at 507-511; <em>McCullough v. Wittner, </em>314 Md. 602, 604-610, 552 A.2d 881, 882-885 (1989), and cases there cited. The administrative remedy under that statute is applicable only when an inmate, in the custody of a state correctional institution or the Commissioner of Correction, \u201chas a grievance against an official or employee of the Division of Correction or the Patuxent Institution,\u201d \u00a7 10-206(a) of the Correctional Services Article. The Inmate Grievance Office statute also provides that \u201c[a] court may not consider an individual\u2019s grievance that is within the jurisdiction of the Office ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>unless the individual has exhausted the remedies provided in this subtitle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The Maryland Public Information Act was initially enacted by Ch. 698 of the Acts of 1970, and has been substantially revised on several occasions since that time. The Act was extensively revised by Ch. 1006 of the Acts of 1978 which provided, <em>inter alia, </em>that, in the case of denials of the right to inspect records by agencies subject to the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act, the person seeking inspection may pursue an administrative remedy under that Act, but that such administrative \u201cremedy need not be exhausted prior to filing suit in the circuit court pursuant to this article.\u201d <em>IV Laws of Maryland, 1978, </em>at 2894-2895. The provision is presently codified in \u00a7 10-622(c) of the State Government Article. Another revision of the Public Information Act, by Ch. 481 of the Acts of 1982, required the custodian of a public record, upon a written request for access to a record, to \u201cgrant the request and produce the record immediately or within a reasonable period, not to exceed 80 days, as may be required to retrieve the information,\u201d or to deny the request within 30 days. <em>TV Laws of Maryland 1982, </em>at 2957. <em>See </em>\u00a7 10-614(b)(1) of the State Government Article (\u201cThe custodian shall grant or deny the application promptly, but not to exceed 30 days after receiving the application\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">Underscoring the General Assembly\u2019s concern for expedition with regard to requests under the Public Information Act, is the provision in \u00a7 10-623(c)(l) of the State Government Article that a judicial action by a person denied inspection of a public record \u201cshall: (i) take precedence on the docket; (ii) be heard at the earliest practicable date; and (iii) be expedited in every way.\u201d Furthermore, the \u201cdefendant: (i) has the burden of sustaining a decision to deny inspection of a public record .... \u201d \u00a7 10\u2014623(b)(2)(i) of the State Government Article. <em>See Governor v. Washington Post, </em>360 Md. 520, 545, 759 A.2d 249, 263 (2000); <em>Fioretti v. Maryland, Board, of Dental Examiners, </em>351 Md. 66, 78, 716 A.2d 258, 264 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>In applying the provisions of the Public Information Act, this Court on numerous occasions has pointed out that \u201c[t]he presumption of the statute is in favor of disclosure.\u201d <em>Stromberg v. University of Maryland, </em>382 Md. 151, 160, 854 A.2d 1220, 1226 (2004). <em>See, e.g., University System v. Baltimore Sun, </em>381 Md. 79, 87-88, 95, 847 A.2d 427, 429 (2004) (The Public Information Act\u2019s provisions \u201c \u2018reflect the legislative intent that the citizens of the State of Maryland be accorded <em>unde ranging access </em>to public information concerning the operation of their government.\u2019 \u201d The Act \u201cis to be construed in favor of permitting inspection of public records\u201d); <em>Hammen v.

Gallagher, </em>359 Md. 341, 343, 753 A.2d 1036, 1037 (2000) (\u201cIn order to carry out this right of access, the Act is to be construed in favor of disclosure\u201d); <em>Fioretti v. Maryland Board of Dental Examiners, supra, </em>351 Md. at 73, 716 A.2d at 262 (\u201c \u2018[T]he provisions of the Public Information Act reflect the legislative intent\u2019\u201d favoring \u201c \u2018wide-ranging access to public information,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>A.S. Abell Publishing Co. v. Mezzanote, </em>297 Md. 26, 32, 464 A.2d 1068, 1071 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Moreover, the Maryland Public Information Act contains no limitations as to those persons entitled to inspect public records. Section 10-612(a) of the State Government Article provides that \u201c[a]ll persons are entitled to have [such] access.... \u201d Thus, an inmate in a correctional institution has a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>right to inspect public records. <em>Attorney General v. Galla</em>gher; <em>supra, </em>359 Md. at 343, 753 A.2d at 1037.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The Prisoner Litigation Act was enacted by Ch. 495 of the Acts of 1997. According to the first words of the Title to Ch. 495, the purpose of the Act was to impose certain requirements upon \u201ca prisoner who files a civil action relating to the <em>conditions of confinement.'\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). The Department of Legislative Reference\u2019s file on House Bill 926 of the 1997 legislative session, which became Ch. 95, indicates that the bill as originally introduced was patterned after federal legislation concerning prisoner actions in the federal courts. Nonetheless, the bill was substantially amended in the course of its progress through the General Assembly. For a detailed review of the Prisoner Litigation Act, including its history and purpose, <em>see </em>Judge Harrell\u2019s opinion for the Court in <em>Adamson v. Correctional Medical Services, supra, </em>359 Md. 238, 753 A.2d 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">The Department of Fiscal Services\u2019 Fiscal Note and Analysis of House Bill 926 of the 1997 legislative session states that \u201c[t]he bill is intended to reduce the number of civil suits filed by inmates <em>relating to the conditions of confinement, </em>especially the number of frivolous suits.\u201d (Emphasis added). The Department of Legislative Reference\u2019s file on House Bill 926 contains a list of \u201cExamples of Frivolous State Court Inmate Litigation\u201d at which the Bill was aimed. The entire list is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-8\">\u201c1. <em>Earl Wilkins v.

Correctional Medical Services, supra, </em>359 Md. at 264-265, 753 A.2d at 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">The first section of the Prisoner Litigation Act, setting forth the Act\u2019s \u201cdefinitions,\u201d largely delineates the scope of the Act. Section 5\u20141001(b) defines \u201cadministrative remedy\u201d as \u201cany procedure for review of a prisoner\u2019s complaint or grievance,\u201d and specifically includes proceedings under the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act and the Inmate Grievance Office Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 5\u20141001(c)(1) defines a \u201ccivil action\u201d as a legal action seeking various types of relief \u201cthat relates to or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>involves a prisoner\u2019s conditions of confinement.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Act in \u00a7 5-1001(d) defines \u201cconditions of confinement\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Az6\">\u201c(d) <em>Conditions of </em>confinement.\u2014\u2018Conditions of confinement\u2019 means any circumstance, situation or event that involves a prisoner\u2019s custody, transportation, incarceration, or supervision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The Prisoner Litigation Act goes on to set forth requirements concerning filing fees for civil actions brought by prisoners (\u00a7 5-1002), certain grounds for dismissal of prisoner civil actions (\u00a7 5-1004), sanctions for filing \u201cfrivolous actions\u201d (\u00a7 5-1005), and regulations with respect to compensatory and punitive damages (\u00a7 5-1006).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">As earlier indicated, the Prisoner Litigation Act\u2019s requirement which is involved in the present case is found in \u00a7 5-1003(a)(1), which provides that a \u201cprisoner may not maintain a civil action until the prisoner has fully exhausted all administrative remedies for resolving\u201d the prisoner\u2019s grievance.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">In arguing that he need not attempt to exhaust any administrative remedies, including a possible remedy before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>the Inmate Grievance Office, the petitioner Massey relies on the nature of the Public Information Act, including the nature of a legal action pursuant to that Act. Massey contends that an action under the Public Information Act does not meet the definition of \u201ccivil action\u201d set forth in the Prisoner Litigation Act. Therefore, according to Massey, the prohibition of a \u201ccivil action\u201d without exhausting administrative remedies is entirely inapplicable to a lawsuit authorized by the Public Information Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">The respondent Galley broadly argues that the Prisoner Litigation Act\u2019s \u201cexhaustion requirements apply to virtually every kind of civil matter that could be brought by a DOC [Division of Correction] inmate in State court.\u201d (Respondent\u2019s brief in this Court at 5). Galley submits that the failure to grant Massey access to the information sought constitutes a \u201cgrievance\u201d within the meaning of the Prisoner Litigation Act. <em>(Id. </em>at 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Galley acknowledges that, if the Prisoner Litigation Act had not been enacted, Massey could maintain this action under the Maryland Public Information Act (MPIA) because \u201cthe MPIA permits a person to seek immediate judicial intervention when a custodian of records denies a requested inspection____\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 11). Nevertheless, Galley takes the position that \u201can irreconcilable conflict between [the] statutes exists\u201d and that \u201cthe more recently enacted\u201d Prisoner Litigation Act prevails and constitutes \u201cthe governing law.\u201d <em>(Ibid.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">Preliminarily, it would be useful to reiterate precisely what is before us and what is not. The only issue before the Court is whether the Prisoner Litigation Act precludes a suit under the Public Information Act, by a Maryland inmate, when the inmate has not shown that he or she has exhausted administrative remedies. The failure to exhaust administrative remedies was the only basis for the motion to dismiss and was the ground on which the Circuit Court granted the motion. No issues are presented as to whether the documents sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>constitute \u201cpublic records,\u201d or whether Galley is the custodian, or whether the records are exempt from inspection on any grounds under the Public Information Act, \u00a7\u00a7 10-616 through 10-618 of the State Government Article. In fact, at oral argument before this Court, the Attorney General\u2019s Office representing Warden Galley candidly conceded that the documents sought constituted public records and that the Warden should have given them to Massey.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">This Court has frequently emphasized the distinction between \u201cany person\u2019s\u201d right to bring an action under the Public Information Act to inspect public records and an aggrieved party\u2019s administrative or judicial action against government officials or others based upon a complaint or grievance against the defendants. For example, in <em>Superintendent v. Henschen, </em>279 Md. 468, 369 A.2d 558 (1977), decided almost 30 years ago, the Superintendent of the Maryland State Police had revoked Mr. Henschen\u2019s permit to carry a handgun, and Henschen took an appeal to the Handgun Permit Review Board. While that administrative appeal was pending, Henschen brought an action under the Maryland Public Information Act to inspect certain documents in the Superintendent\u2019s possession, arguing that he needed them for the administrative proceeding. The Superintendent, on the other hand, relied on an exception in the Public Information Act. This Court pointed out that the two entirely different actions should not be confused, stating (279 Md. at 473-474, 369 A.2d at 561, footnotes omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqg\">\u201c[I]t is desirable to emphasize just what is before us for decision in this case and what is not. This is an action under the Public Information Act and not a proceeding to review an administrative decision revoking a handgun permit. The Public Information Act provides that, subject to certain enumerated exceptions, \u2018the custodian of any public records shall allow <em>any person </em>the right of inspection of such records.... \u2019 (Art. 76A, \u00a7 3(a), emphasis supplied.) The general right of inspection is not limited to a \u2018person aggrieved\u2019 or \u2018person in interest.\u2019 The term \u2018person\u2019 is broadly defined to include \u2018any natural person, corporation, partnership, firm or association.\u2019 (Art. 76A, \u00a7 1(g).) Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>sequently, if the Superintendent\u2019s refusal to disclose in this case is not justified by one of the Public Information Act\u2019s exceptions, Mr. Henschen would be entitled to the information regardless of the pendency of an appeal to the Handgun Permit Review Board. Moreover, the applicability of the exception upon which the Superintendent relies in this case, the exception for records of investigations (\u00a7 3(b)(i)), does not at all depend upon whether the records would be available to a party in litigation with the agency. Thus, whether or not due process considerations might make the records available to Mr. Henschen as a party in the administrative proceeding before the Handgun Permit Review Board does not determine whether they are available under the Public Informatioxi Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-5\">\u201cOn the other hand, a ruling that the records need not be disclosed under the Public Information Act, because of the exception in \u00a7 3(b)(i), does not determine whether Mr. Henschen may be entitled to see them in connection with this Handgun Permit Review Board proceeding. A particular document may not be available to \u2018any person\u2019 under the Public Information Act in light of that Act\u2019s exceptions, but procedural due process requirements may yet make that same document available to a party, or unavailable for use against a party, in an administrative or judicial proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-7\">\u201cThe issue in this case, therefore, is not whether the records here involved may be used against Mr. Henschen in the Handgun Permit Review Board proceeding or may be available to him in that proceeding. The issue is whether \u2018any person\u2019 would be entitled to inspect the records under the Public Information Act....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-8\"><em>See also, e.g., Hammen v. Baltimore Police, supra, </em>373 Md. at 452-457, 818 A.2d at 1132-1135 (\u201cThe affording of broad access to public records by citizens is the very purpose of the MPIA.... Such situations are very different from [other] civil actions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number> It is true that one might seek access to a public record in order use the record in a pending grievance or other proceeding involving a public official or agency, or use the public record to determine whether to institute a grievance proceeding or other action. Nevertheless, as pointed out in <em>H enseben </em>and other cases, that is not the purpose of or an essential characteristic of an action under the Public Information Act. A person may seek access to a public record simply out of curiosity. As previously noted, the <em>purpose </em>of the Act is to provide any person with \u201c \u2018wide-ranging access to public information concerning the operation of government,\u2019 \u201d <em>Fioretti v. Maryland Board of Dental Examiners, supra, </em>351 Md. at 73, 716 A.2d at 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">From the standpoint of the Public Information Act, this case would be no different if a non-inmate friend or relative of Massey\u2019s had sought to inspect the same records and later intended to disclose the information to Massey, or if a stranger had sought the records out of mere curiosity. In these situations, no \u201cexhaustion\u201d issue could be raised. When the exceptions in the Public Information Act are not involved, the focus of the Act is not upon the person seeking access to the public record. Instead, the Act is aimed at the custodian of the record, imposing upon the custodian the duty of disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Another problem with the respondent\u2019s focus upon the status of the plaintiff in a Public Information Act proceeding, and the respondent\u2019s \u201cexhaustion\u201d argument, is that an inmate may seek records which are not within the custody of the Division of Correction or the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services. <em>See, e.g., Attorney General v. Gallagher, supra, </em>359 Md. 341, 753 A.2d 1036 (An inmate sought records which were in the custody of the Attorney General of Maryland). The Inmate Grievance Office and the Secretary of Public Safety and Correctional Services <em>might </em>have jurisdiction over an inmate\u2019s request under the Public Information Act to require that a custodian within the Division of Correction or the Patuxent Institution permit the inspection of public records. <em>See </em>\u00a7 10-206(a) of the Correctional Services Article. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>It is clear, however, that the Inmate Grievance Office and the Secretary of Public Safety and Correctional Services would have no authority to order that a custodian outside of the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services permit access to records. <em>Adamson v. Correctional Medical Services, supra, </em>359 Md. at 269, 753 A.2d at 517 (\u201cWe cannot require the exhaustion of an administrative remedy process that is inapplicable to a prisoner\u2019s alleged grievance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Finally, we reject the respondent Galley\u2019s argument that there exists \u201can irreconcilable conflict\u201d between the Public Information Act and the Prisoner Litigation act, and that the Prisoner Litigation Act, as the later enacted statute, prevails. There is no such conflict.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As discussed above, the Public Information Act is not aimed at \u201cgrievances\u201d but is concerned with any person\u2019s access to most public records regardless of the person\u2019s reason for desiring such access. The Prisoner Litigation Act on the other hand, like the earlier Inmate Grievance Office Act, is concerned with inmate \u201cgrievances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The exhaustion requirement of the Prisoner Litigation Act precludes a \u201ccivil action,\u201d as defined in that Act, if a prisoner has not exhausted administrative remedies for resolving the prisoner\u2019s \u201cgrievance.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 5-1003(a)(l) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. \u201cAdministrative remedy,\u201d within the meaning of the Act, \u201cmeans any procedure for review of a prisoner\u2019s complaint or grievance,\u201d \u00a7 5-1001(b). \u201cCivil Action\u201d as defined in the Prisoner Litigation Act \u201cmeans a legal action ... that relates to or involves a prisoner\u2019s <em>conditions of confinement,\u201d </em>\u00a7 5-1001(e), emphasis added.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">Under the plain and commonly understood meaning of the language, a mere request to inspect a public record does <em>not </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>relate to or involve a prisoner\u2019s \u201cconditions of confinement.\u201d Nothing in the language of the statute or its legislative history suggests that the statute might encompass a request for public information or the denial of such request.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The respondent would have the Prisoner Litigation Act\u2019s exhaustion requirement apply to any judicial action brought by a Maryland prisoner. In <em>Adamson v. Correctional Medical Services, supra, </em>359 Md. at 269, 753 A.2d at 517, although not involving the Public Information Act, this Court rejected a similar sweeping interpretation of the Prisoner Litigation Act, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-6\">\u201cNothing in the statutes would lend the slightest hint that the legislature intended the statute\u2019s exhaustion requirement be as all encompassing as Respondent alleges.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">The same statement is applicable to the respondent\u2019s argument in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">This action, authorized by the Maryland Public Information act, should not have been dismissed on' the ground that the plaintiff had failed to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED, AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ALLEGANY COUNTY AND REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.
