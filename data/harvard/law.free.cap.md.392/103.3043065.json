Moreover, the Commission is charged with developing standards and policies consistent with the SHP that relate to the Certificate of Need (\u201cCON\u201d) process. \u00a7 19-118(d)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These standards, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201c[s]hall address the availability, accessibility, cost, and quality of health care,\u201d \u00a7 19-118(d)(2)(i),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and \u201cshall take into account the relevant methodologies of the Health Services Cost Review Commission.\u201d \u00a7 19-118(d)(3).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Commission also is authorized to promulgate regulations in order more effectively to manage and implement the duties prescribed under Md.Code \u00a7 19-118. Section 19-118(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>\u201c(c) The Commission shall adopt rules and regulations that ensure broad public input, public hearings, and consideration of local health plans in development of the State health plan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The issue in this case is whether a request by a merged asset hospital system to relocate a portion of its existing cardiac surgery program from one location to another triggers or engages the comparative review process required upon application for a CON for a new cardiac surgery program, or whether such request is to be resolved by a CON process that is separate and distinct. The problem, and accordingly, the resolution, relates solely to the interpretation of the Code of Maryland Administrative Regulations (\u201cCOMAR\u201d) 10.24.17.04F, the section entitled \u201cMerged Hospital Systems,\u201d and, specifically, Policy 6.0 contained therein. COMAR 10.24.17.04F provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\">\u201cThe regionalization of cardiac surgery services plays an important role in the strategic planning and placement of these programs to achieve an optimal balance between promoting patient access, containing costs, and maintaining quality of care. By regulating the number of cardiac surgery programs needed by Maryland residents in order to ensure adequate caseloads, the Commission acts to strengthen quality and avoid unnecessary costs to the healthcare system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">\u201cIn recent years, the Commission has encouraged and overseen several mergers and consolidations of two or more hospitals as part of statewide initiatives to promote efficiencies and contain health costs. This has created an opportunity, under specified conditions, for merged institutions to relocate all or part of an existing service from one hospital to another under that merged system by obtaining an exemption from Certificate of Need. While the General Assembly has created this opportunity for the reconfiguration of existing services, its intention was not to promote the expansion of a service which otherwise would be subject to Certificate of Need coverage. The potential relocation or dividing of cardiac surgery programs may result in prolifer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>ation of programs in the absence of need, and defeat the principles of regional planning. For this reason, the Commission establishes the following policy:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-5\">\u201cPolicy 6.0 A merged hospital system may not relocate any part of its existing cardiac surgery capacity to another hospital within its system without obtaining a Certificate of Need.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The Commission interpreted COMAR 10.24.17.04F to mean that a relocation of a portion of an existing cardiac surgery program is subject to the CON process required for a new program. In so doing, it rejected the interpretation advocated by the appellant, Adventist Health Care, Inc., the parent of the merged hospitals, Washington Adventist Hospital and Shady Grove Hospital. Adventist had urged, and continues in this Court to do so, that its relocation application was entitled to be reviewed in a separate and distinct process from the comparative review required for the establishment of a new program. Consequently, it maintained on judicial review, and again in this Court, that, by interpreting Policy 6.0 and COMAR 10.24.17.04F the way it did, the Commission exceeded its authority. On judicial review, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City affirmed the Commission\u2019s interpretation. We also shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">Adventist is a merged asset hospital system that includes, as indicated, both the Washington Adventist Hospital and Shady Grove Hospital. The Washington Adventist Hospital has an existing cardiac surgery program. Interested in relocating a portion of that existing cardiac surgery program to Shady Grove Hospital, Adventist submitted to the Commission a Letter of Intent (\u201cLOI\u201d) to do so. The LOI described the proposed project, the quantity and types of health services beds that would be affected, and, under the applicable need methodology in the SHP, the jurisdictions the new service would affect. Explaining that the new joint program would have \u201ccommon medical staffs for Program services, a single <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>set of Program policies and procedures,\u201d Adventist concluded that the relocation \u201cwould not result in the establishment of a new Program but rather [only in] the relocation of a portion of the existing Program at Washington Adventist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">To be clear as to the latter point, Adventist submitted to the Commission, along with the LOI, a separate letter in which it reaffirmed that it was not seeking a Certificate of Need for a new program, and stated that it was not responding to an earlier notice, issued by the Commission, requesting LOI\u2019s for new cardiac surgery programs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Adventist explained, in that regard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-5\">\u201cWe wish to avoid a situation wherein the Commission would either reject this letter of intent or any subsequently filed application. We are therefore seeking your guidance whether there is any reason why this letter of intent cannot be accepted. We further request a determination that the project proposed in the letter of intent is considered a partial relocation of an existing program and not the establishment of a new program.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Responding, the Commission advised that it considered Adventist\u2019s LOI to relocate a portion of its cardiac surgery program to be a request for a new program. It explained that \u201c[i]t is the Commission\u2019s view that Policy 6.0 ... considers the relocation of a cardiac surgery program by a merged asset system as the establishment of a new program, and, therefore, subject to all of the policies and standards under COMAR 10.24.17.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">This prompted Adventist to file its \u201cPetition for Acceptance of Letter of Intent for Partial Relocation of an Existing Cardiac Surgery and Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Program\u201d (\u201cAdventist Petition\u201d). In a supporting memoran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>dum accompanying the Petition, Adventist described what had already transpired, and argued that the LOI complied with Policy 6.0, that Policy 6.0\u2019s plain language required an independent, non-comparative review of its LOI, and that the health care resources that Adventist already possessed most efficiently would be utilized by allowing the relocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">The Petition relied on three examples which, it maintained, demonstrated that the Commission\u2019s regulations allowed for the relocation of all, or part, of existing services between hospitals within a merged asset system: the Health Resources Planning Commission\u2019s granting of an exemption, pursuant to which Greater Laurel Beltsville Hospital (now Laurel Regional Hospital) was permitted to establish an obstetrics program under its merged asset system, the Commission\u2019s approval of the partial relocation from Sinai Hospital of Baltimore to Northwest Hospital Center, of inpatient psychiatric services, without the need for establishing a need for a new health care service, and the Commission\u2019s Proposed Decision granting the University of Maryland Medical System an exemption to relocate an obstetrics program. As to this third example, Adventist pointed out that the Commission noted that an allowable change in patient services among the components of a merged organization included the establishment of a service at a facility within the merged organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Adventist acknowledged that all of these examples involved a merger exemption, but insisted that they nevertheless reflected a distinction being drawn between the treatment of \u201cnew\u201d and \u201cexisting\u201d services. Furthermore, it asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">\u201c[t]he Commission, in fact, has adopted other regulations permitting CON exemptions for merged asset systems for projects which otherwise would require CON coverage. It would be illogical and inconsistent for the Commission to, on the one hand, apply the \u2018merger and consolidation\u2019 exemption process to permit the establishment of a service that was not previously available at a hospital within a merged asset system while, on the other hand[,] treating a partial relocation of another service as a \u2018new<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> service.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Pursuant to this, Adventist argued that treating its proposal as a \u201cnew program\u201d would be inconsistent with these and other examples, and with the Commission\u2019s enabling statute. The petition further asserted that the language of Policy 6.0 did not equate a partially relocated program to a \u201cnew\u201d program.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">Over Adventist\u2019s objection, the Commission submitted Adventist\u2019s LOI and Petition to the hospitals participating in the comparative review for a new cardiac surgery program for their review and comment, pursuant to \u00a7 19-126.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Suburban Hospital, the other appellee in this case, and Holy Cross Hospital, responded as interested parties<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and opposed the Adventist Petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Following the comparative review proceedings and as a part of the CON review process,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Commission issued its deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>sion with respect to the proper forum for deciding Adventist\u2019s relocation petition.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It confirmed its preliminary determination, that the 2004 SHP required Adventist\u2019s petition for partial relocation of its cardiac surgery program to be considered within the ongoing comparative review process normally engaged to evaluate CON\u2019s for new programs. The Commission reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-4\">\u201cif every hospital that is a member of a merged asset system were able to establish an open heart surgery program ... the number of open heart surgery programs would more than double, none of which would be considered \u2018new\u2019 capacity, ... undermining] the intent of the policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>and the principles of regional planning for specialized services.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">Addressing directly the examples Adventist proffered as demonstrating that a relocation CON is subject to a different review process than is a new health care service CON, the Commission determined that there was \u201cno inconsistency between these cases and the Commission\u2019s rejection of Adventist HealthCare\u2019s request for a separate CON review,\u201d pointing out that they \u201cinvolved the applicability of the merger exemption to the CON process,\u201d and \u201care focused on the General Assembly\u2019s intent in creating the merger exemption for certain projects.\u201d It concluded that the merger exemption was not at issue in this case and, in any event, \u201cthe reconfiguration of obstetrics and psychiatric services in the way proposed by the hospital systems in those cases were the kind of service reconfiguration the General Assembly intended to permit via the CON exemption process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">In addition, the Commission mentioned that the disposition of the cases relied on by Adventist was supported by the applicable SHP Chapter. It then observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">\u201c[B]y contrast, Policy 6 of the OHS Chapter is predicated on the Commission\u2019s determination that \u2018partial relocations\u2019 of regionally-planned-for services like open heart surgery services should be treated like new programs. As a practical matter, any \u2018partial relocation\u2019 of these specialized services operates more like the establishment of a new program than does a relocation of obstetrics or psychiatric beds. For example, because of volume/quality concerns present in planning for open heart surgery services and because the quality of an open heart surgery service is highly dependent on a team of health care practitioners working together on a high volume of surgeries, it is not possible, nor is Adventist Healthcare proposing, to simply relocate the [Washington Adventist Hospital\u2019s] staff to [Shady Grove Adventist Hospital] or to divide Staff time between the two hospitals. Even if the training protocols and the surgeons remain the same across the system, the [Shady Grove Adventist Hospital\u2019s] program will inevitably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>have a different support team of nurses and technicians who, through an integral part of the program, may not have the same experience working with each other or with the cardiac surgeons in [Washington Adventist Hospital\u2019s] high volume program. In this respect, the \u2018partial relocation\u2019 of the [Washington Adventist Hospital] program resembles a new program.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">It concluded, more explicitly, \u201c[a] partial relocation within a system can be expected to have some impact on volumes of other service providers just as a new program would.... Reviewing these proposals separately, based simply on a distinction in nomenclature, makes no sense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Finally, the Commission rejected the argument that if Adventist\u2019s proposal was not a \u201cnew\u201d program, it was obliged to treat it as Adventist maintains, and review it as a separate and distinct matter. That, the Commission asserted, does not follow. Finding no legal requirement that it do so, the Commission found it acceptable to treat Adventist\u2019s proposal and a typical CON application as similar types of proposals in a single comparative review because both involved open heart services and both required a CON. The Commission concluded that \u201cadministrative efficiency and fairness, as well as the public interest in the Commission making a reasoned decision in light of all material evidence, compel the conclusion that a separate CON review of the Adventist\u2019s proposal is unwarranted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Adventist filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City a petition for judicial review, pursuant to Maryland Rule 7-202.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">Following a hearing, the Circuit Court issued its Memorandum and Order affirming the Commission\u2019s decision. Perceiving the issue to be \u201cthe interpretation of state regulations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>promulgated by [the Commission]\u201d the court noted, preliminary to proceeding with its analysis, that \u201c[w]hen faced with a problem of statutory construction, this Court shows great deference to the interpretation given the statute by the officers or agency charged with its administration... .When the construction of an administrative regulation rather than a statute is at issue, deference is even more clearly in order.\u201d <em>Udall v. Tallman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 16, 85 S.Ct. 792, 801, 13 L.Ed.2d 616, 625 (1965). <em>See also Maryland Transp. Authority v. King, </em>369 Md. 274, 288, 799 A.2d 1246, 1254 (2002); <em>Maryland Comm\u2019n on Human Relations v. Bethlehem Steel, </em>295 Md. 586, 593, 457 A.2d 1146, 1150 (1983). Then, finding the language of Policy 6.0 to be \u201cambiguous as to the manner in which the Commission should address applications from \u2018new\u2019 programs in relation to application for \u2018relocated\u2019 programs,\u201d the court reviewed the Policy\u2019s history and the Commission\u2019s intent in promulgating Policy 6.0, concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-4\">\u201c [i]t is clear from examining this history that insofar as cardiac programs were concerned, the Commission intended that \u2018new\u2019 and \u2018relocated\u2019 programs were to be treated the same and would be reviewed in the same manner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9k\">Significant to that conclusion was an exchange between Adventist and the Commission staff, during the thirty-day informal comment period, pursuant to COMAR 10.24.01.08D (2)(b),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> prior to the adoption of Rule 6.0, concerning its meaning. Adventist sought an interpretation consistent with the one it now advocates. Believing that the Policy, as proposed, could not be so interpreted, it wrote the Commission, urging:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-5\">\u201cThe Draft Revision would continue to prohibit merged asset systems from operating a [cardiac surgery] program at more than one of its hospitals. We submit that where it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>can be demonstrated that two hospitals in the same region are part of a merged asset system and can put in place credentialing, staff training, and clinical support so that teams can function effectively at either institution, this should not be considered the establishment of a new [cardiac surgery] program.... The [State Health Plan] should permit the opportunity to demonstrate effective use of merged asset system resources without this being considered a \u2018new\u2019 program.\u2019\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Letter from William G. Robertson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Adventist Healthcare, Inc., to the Maryland Health Care Commission 8-9 (Aug. 20, 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The Staff responded, taking much the same position as the Commission takes on this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-6\">\u201cAdventist Healthcare believes that reconfiguration of existing capacity is not, and should not be, defined as the establishment of a \u2018new\u2019 program. According to Adventist Healthcare, reconfiguration of open heart surgery capacity would not have an impact on the ability of other hospitals to apply for [Certificate of Need] approval to meet new identified need, and would not diminish the amount of newly identified need. Staff would point out that if every hospital that is a member of a merged asset system were able to establish an open heart surgery program based on this principle, the number of open heart surgery programs in Maryland would more than double, none of which would be considered \u2018new\u2019 capacity. The argument that reconfiguration of existing program capacity to another hospital within a merged asset system should not be considered a \u2018new<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> program would clearly undermine the intent of the policy and the principles of regional planning for highly specialized services.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Analysis of Informal Public Comments and Staff Recommendations, Maryland Health Care Commission 26-27 (Sept. 18, 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">Moreover, the Circuit Court observed that there was a lack of \u201ca single instruction\u201d in the applicable regulations or in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>Maryland Code \u201cthat a \u2018relocated\u2019 program must be subject to a review process separate from the comparative process established for \u2018new\u2019 programs.\u201d Nor was the court willing to take the \u201cinferential leap\u201d from the \u201cthe mere fact that Policy 6.0 refers only to \u2018relocated\u2019 programs\u201d to the conclusion \u201cthat the whole Chapter 2004 delineates between \u2018new\u2019 and \u2018relocated\u2019 programs, to the extent that it requires separate review process.\u201d On the contrary, it found, \u201ca far more reasonable explanation for Policy 6.0\u2019s requirement that \u2018relocated\u2019 cardiac programs obtain Certificates of Need was that it was meant to distinguish cardiac programs from the other specialties in the State Health Plan that allow relocation of programs without obtaining a new Certificate of Need.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">Adventist filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, which we granted, <em>Adventist Health v. Health Care, </em>389 Md. 398, 885 A.2d 823 (2005). As indicated, we shall affirm, and for the reasons that follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">It is important clarify what is at issue in this case. The case <em>sub judice </em>presents a different issue, as well as different circumstances, than our recent decisions in <em>Medstar Health v. Maryland Health Care Comm\u2019n, </em>376 Md. 1, 827 A.2d 83 (2003) <em>(\u201cMedstar I </em>\u201d), and <em>Medstar Health v. Maryland Health Care Comm\u2019n, </em>391 Md. 427, 893 A.2d 1099 (2006) <em>(\u201cMedstar II \u201d). </em>In both of those cases, the Commission was charged with exceeding its power under its enabling statute by the promulgation of invalid regulations. Nothing concerning the meaning of the regulation at issue was presented; each of the regulations was quite clear, in fact. Despite the contrasting results, both cases involved the Commission\u2019s quasi-legislative role, in which the interpretation of a regulation played no part.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>Here, the critical issue is whether Adventist is entitled to a CON for the relocation of a portion of its existing cardiac surgery program from one hospital in the merged system to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>another. Resolution of that question requires the determination of the proper procedure to be used to address the issue. That involves an interpretation of regulations relevant to the issue. Those regulations, as we have seen, were promulgated by the Commission, which now must interpret them. Thus, we are faced, specifically, with a situation involving an administrative agency interpreting its own regulations in the context of its quasi-judicial role.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">Administrative agencies possess an \u201cexpertise\u201d and, thus, have a greater ability to evaluate and determine the matters and issues that regularly arise, or can be expected to be presented, in the field in which they operate or in connection with the statute that they administer. In <em>Board of Phys. Quality Assur., </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-5\">\u201c[A] \u2018court\u2019s task in review is not to substitute its judgment for the expertise of those persons who constitute the administrative agency.\u2019 ...

Consequently, the interpretation of a statute by the agency charged with administering the statute is entitled to great weight. <em>McCullough v. Wittner, </em>314 Md. 602, 612, 552 A.2d 881, 886 (1989). <em>See, e.g., Board of Phys. Quality Assur., </em>354 Md. at 68-69, 729 A.2d at 381; <em>Sinai Hosp. v.

Adventist argues that the Commission\u2019s decision to reject its application for a relocation CON was error, but only because the Commission\u2019s interpretation of Policy 6.0 as requiring its application to be considered in the CON process, with comparative review, for new programs was incorrect. Thus, in this sense, Adventist challenges the legality of the Commission\u2019s decision. Although the construction of statutes and regulations is a legal matter, not factual, this Court has made clear that, because \u201cthe expertise of the agency in its own field should be respected,\u201d <em>Board of Phys. Quality Assur., </em>354 Md. at 69, 729 A.2d at 381, that \u201c[e]ven with regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68, 729 A.2d at 381. As we have seen, that deference, which we characterized as \u201cconsiderable weight,\u201d <em>id., </em>is due the agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute it administers and to the agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations. <em>King, </em>369 Md. at 288, 799 A.2d at 1254. Deference to the interpretation of the agency, however, does not mean acquiescence or abdication of our construction responsibility. Despite the deference, \u201cit is always within our prerogative to determine whether an agency\u2019s conclusions of law are correct.\u201d <em>Kushell v. Department of Natural Resources, </em>385 Md. 563, 576, 870 A.2d 186, 193 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>C.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">Because this case involves the interpretation of COMAR 10.24.17.04F, and Policy 6.0 contained within, and does not involve a challenge to the legality of the promulgated regulation itself, nor, except for the interpretation issue, a challenge to the Commission\u2019s decision to reject Adventist\u2019s proposal, the primary question is which party is correct: the Commission or appellant? Typically, a Maryland hospital that wishes to create a new cardiac surgery program must apply for and be granted a CON from the Commission. Md.Code Ann., Health Gen. \u00a7 19\u2014120(j)(2)(iii)(2). The Commission uses the CON approval process to address and regulate the medical needs of the State of Maryland. Because CON reviews apply to all cardiac surgery services, this court defers to the Commission with regard to these programs, because of their specialized nature. These services treat \u201c[t]he most complex health problems\u201d in \u201csegments of the population that are most severely ill and at the highest risk for poor outcomes,\u201d and are \u201chighly-specialized regional acute care programs requiring the use of technologically-advanced skills or equipment, or both.\u201d COMAR 10.24.17.02D.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Adventist claims that, giving Policy 6.0 its plain meaning, the Commission wrongly treated the Adventist LOI as a request to open a new program, rather than, consistent with the policy, as a more limited request for a relocation CON. That, it asserts, \u201cviolated] two cardinal rules of statutory interpretation at the same time\u201d: the Commission\u2019s interpretation ignores the plain meaning of the words of the regulation, which allows a \u201cmerged asset system\u201d with an \u201cexisting program\u201d to file a CON to \u201crelocate any part of its existing cardiac surgery capacity to another hospital within its system\u201d and inserts terms into Policy 6.0 that are not there, adding the phrase \u201cfor a new program\u201d on the end of Policy 6.0, such that it would read, \u201ca merged hospital system may not relocate any part of its existing cardiac surgery capacity to another hospital within its system without obtaining a Certificate of Need <em>for a new program.\u201d </em>It relies heavily on our recent holding in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number><em>Kushell, </em>especially what we said with regards to the plain meaning of statutes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-4\">\u201c[OJrdinary, popular understanding of the English Language dictates interpretation of its terminology.

Md.Code (1973, 2000 Repl.Vol., 2001 Cum. Supp.) \u00a7 8-716(c) of the State Boat Act, \u00a7\u00a7 8-701 et seq. of the Natural Resources Article imposed Maryland\u2019s boat excise tax. Section 8-716(e)(l)(iv) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-7\">\u201c(1) Except as provided in \u00a7 8-715(d) of this subtitle and in subsections (e) and (f) of this section, and in addition to the fees prescribed in subsection (b) of this section, an excise tax is levied at the rate of 5% of the fair market value of the vessel on:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-8\">\u201c(iv) The possession within the State of a vessel purchased outside the State to be used principally in the State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">Although Kushell had purchased his boat outside Maryland, without any intent of using it principally in Maryland, and, in fact, did not so use it, and relied on, and abided by, the Department\u2019s representations with regard to what constituted \u201cused principally in Maryland,\u201d 385 Md. at 567, 870 A.2d at 187, he was assessed excise taxes for the calendar year 2001. 385 Md. at 569, 870 A.2d at 189. Following an unsuccessful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>appeal of the assessment, the result of which was affirmed on judicial review, and Kushell\u2019s appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, we granted certiorari. <em>Kushell v. Department of Natural Resources, </em>383 Md. 569, 861 A.2d 60 (2004). Both the Administrative Law Judge and the Circuit Court, construing \u00a7 8-716(c)(l)(iv), held that it did not have an intent element, \u25a0that the imposition of the tax did not depend on the purchaser\u2019s intention to use the boat principally in Maryland. 385 Md. at 569, 870 A.2d at 189. In this Court, Kushell argued, <em>inter alia, </em>relying on the plain and, he maintained, unambiguous, language of \u00a7 8-716(c)(l)(iv), that the tax is imposed only on the possession of a vessel which, at the time of sale, was purchased with the specific intent of using it principally in Maryland. <em>Id. </em>at 570, 870 A.2d at 190. To hold otherwise, he asserted, would render the phrase, \u201cto be,\u201d nugatory. <em>Id. </em>The Department Natural Resources contended otherwise, however. While maintaining that the interpretation given the statute by the Administrative Law judge and the Circuit Court, which it adopted and advocated, 385 Md. at 570, 870 A.2d at 189, was correct, it urged that the result was also dictated because its interpretation was entitled to judicial deference. 385 Md. at 573, 870 A.2d at 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">We held in favor of Kushell. 385 Md. at 581, 870 A.2d at 196. Recognizing that the issue was one of statutory construction, as to which our review is <em>de novo, </em>385 Md. at 576, 870 A.2d at 193, and notwithstanding the deference due the interpretation of the administrative agency, after reviewing the applicable canons of construction,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> we concluded: \u201c[ujnder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>ordinary rules of English grammar, ... the plain text supports Kushell\u2019s reading.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 577, 870 A.2d at 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">Thus, while Adventist is correct in its reliance on the legal principles articulated in <em>Kushell, </em>application of those principles, however, do not assist Adventist\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">In <em>Kushell, </em>the statute was so plain, and clear, that the Department\u2019s expertise in the matter could not, and did not, make a difference. Deference to the Department\u2019s expertise simply could not carry the day; no matter how much expertise the Department of Natural Resources had, it could not trump the statute itself. The plain meaning of the statute, lacking any ambiguities, dictated the result. Although the deference to which the Department\u2019s interpretation was entitled could not, and did not, cause the Department\u2019s position to prevail, the proposition for which it advocated, that deference should be afforded to its decisions, was by no means rejected or undermined.</p>\n<p id=\"AAm\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>The case <em>sub judice </em>is an entirely different circumstance. The language of Policy 6.0 and COMAE. 10.24.17.04F is, at best, as articulated by the Circuit Court, \u201cambiguous.\u201d This is not a case where the regulation in question has \u201cno ambiguity\u201d such that \u201cwe do not need to resort to the various, and sometimes inconsistent, external rules of construction ...\u201d 385 Md. at 577, 870 A.2d at 193-194. Instead, giving deference to the Department\u2019s interpretation of its regulation in the case <em>sub judice </em>may be appropriate to resolve ambiguity, as long as there is a substantial basis, when all is said and done, for that interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Adventist argues that by interpreting Policy 6.0 the way it does, the Commission ignores the 2004 SHP\u2019s general distinctions between \u201cnew\u201d and \u201cexisting\u201d programs, citing to a number of sections of the 2004 SHP which explicitly govern each type of program separately. For example, it refers to the following sections involving \u201cnew\u201d programs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-5\">\u201cPolicy 1.3 A Certificate of Need issued by the Commission .for the establishment of a <em>new </em>cardiac surgery program will require as a condition of issuance that the program achieve minimum volume standards within 24-months of beginning operation and maintain the minimum utilization level in subsequent years of operation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">\u201c.05B Commission Program Policies; Consideration of <em>New </em>Program</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">\u201cThe Commission will consider a <em>new </em>program in a Regional Service Area under the following circumstances ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-8\">\u201c.05C(2) Approval Policies</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-9\">\u201cApproval of a <em>New </em>Program.\u2014The Commission will approve the establishment of a <em>new </em>program ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">By contrast, Adventist cites a number of sections that refer to \u201cexisting\u201d programs; for example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-11\">\u201c.03B(3) If an <em>existing </em>program does not meet the required minimum volumes ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-12\">\u201c.04(B) These <em>existing </em>programs focus primarily on quality improvement relative to CABG surgery ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>\u201cPolicy 9.1 The Commission will determine whether <em>existing </em>programs in a Regional Service Area have demonstrated compliance with the Commission\u2019s public reporting requirements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Based on these examples, Adventist argues that, implicitly, at least, the Commission intended for these \u201cnew\u201d programs and \u201cexisting\u201d programs to be treated differently. It concludes: \u201cPolicy 6.0, cannot, as a matter of law, possibly mean that applications to partially relocate \u2018existing\u2019 programs are no different than applications that seek to open a \u2018new\u2019 program because that result is inconsistent \u2018grammatically and in relationship to other statutory provisions.\u2019 <em>Kushell, </em>385 Md. at 581[, 870 A.2d at 196.]\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">The Commission rejects all of Adventist\u2019s claims, offering instead, its own interpretation of Policy 6.0. It notes first that during the formulation of the 2004 SHP, in its \u201cAnalysis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Informal Public Comments and Staff Recommendations,\u201d it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-4\">\u201cStaff would point out that if every hospital that is a member of a merged asset system were able to establish an open heart surgery program based on this principle, the number of ... programs in Maryland would more than double.... [Adventist\u2019s] argument that reconfiguration of existing program capacity ... should not be considered a \u2018new\u2019 program would clearly undermine the intent of the policy and the principles of regional planning for highly specialized services.... Given the limited number of programs offering cardiac surgery, it seems appropriate that changes in the location of those programs be the subject of a full Certificate of Need review. Staff believes that the Commission should maintain the policy that a merged asset hospital system may not relocate any part of an existing cardiac surgery program to another hospital within its system without obtaining a Certificate of Need.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">It is the Commission\u2019s general position that CONs for relocation are no different than CONs for new programs. They have been addressed separately in the SHP simply to specify the situations in which the Commission exercises its control. It further notes that the Cardiac Surgery Chapter of the SHP had always prevented merged asset systems from operating cardiac surgery services at more than one of its hospitals, even prior to the 2004 revision, a fact that Adventist was aware of and acknowledged.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This, it contends, resolves any questions surrounding the statutory intent of Policy 6.0.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Furthermore, the Commission maintains that fairness and efficiency dictated its decision to submit the Adventist proposal to comparative review. As with a CON for a new program, the Commission was merely undergoing the same process in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>order to fully ascertain the effect of a relocated program on surrounding hospitals. \u201cAdventist is not entitled to override the Commission\u2019s choices about the effective administration of its CON program,\u201d the Commission asserts, reminding this Court that \u201c[t]he Court of Appeals will \u2018review the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to the agency, since decisions of administrative agencies are prima facie correct and carry with them the presumption of validity.\u201d <em>(Quoting Carriage Hill-Cabin John, Inc. v. Maryland Health Res. Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>125 Md.App. 183, 212, 724 A.2d 745, 760 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">In approaching this question, we repeat the well-settled precedent: an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute it administers, <em>Board of Phys. Quality Assur., </em>354 Md. at 69, 729 A.2d at 381, and the regulations it promulgates pursuant thereto and in furtherance thereof, <em>King, </em>369 Md. at 289, 799 A.2d at 1254, ordinarily is entitled to \u201cconsiderable weight by reviewing courts.\u201d <em>Board of Phys. Quality Assur., </em>354 Md. at 69, 729 A.2d at 381 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The Commission submitted the Adventist LOI to comparative review pursuant to Policy 6.0 because it believed that allowing requests for relocation to circumvent the typical CON processes would lead to the unchecked proliferation of cardiac surgery programs in violation of the overarching policy of the 2004 SHP favoring \u201ca system of higher volume programs\u201d as opposed to \u201ca system where all hospitals perform at only the minimum volume.\u201d COMAR 10.24.17.04A (3). This issue was specifically addressed during the consideration of the 2004 SHP and prior to its promulgation. This is relevant to the Commission\u2019s intent in adopting Policy 6.0. Moreover, despite the use of \u201cnew\u201d and \u201cexisting\u201d in different sections of the 2004 SHP, there is no explicit indication that the Commission intended programs wishing to be relocated to be treated differently than new programs in regards to the CON application process.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Furthermore, reading Policy 6.0 in context with the other provisions of the SHP, as we are required to do, <em>Kushell, </em>385 Md. at 577, 870 A.2d at 193, we are satisfied that, while the Commission may recognize differences in the treatment of programs that already exist, and programs that wish to exist, in a variety of other administrative areas, these distinctions do not indicate that the process through which an application for the placement of a program in a new area should be analyzed differently depending on the pre-placement status of such that program.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">The dire consequences that Adventist suggests will result from affirming the Commission\u2019s interpretation, primarily that CONs for relocation will be treated unfairly under a traditional CON review process, rest primarily on the foundational premise that there is a difference between placing a new program in an area previously lacking a cardiac surgery program, and partially relocating a previously existing cardiac surgery program to an area previously lacking a cardiac surgery program. On this point, we defer to the Commission\u2019s expertise. It has determined that there is no difference in the resulting impact to surrounding programs whether the program is new or relocated, a policy concern of the Commission\u2019s. Both program placements have the potential of affecting surrounding patient volumes. Thus, Adventist\u2019s foundational premise is unfirm, and the resulting consequences are similarly ineffectual.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">We agree with the Circuit Court\u2019s conclusion, and the Commission\u2019s position, that, absent a provision that explicitly requires that relocation CONs be submitted to a different process than CONs for new programs or that demonstrate that the Commission intended for the two different types of programs to undergo the same evaluative procedure, we shall defer to the Commission\u2019s expertise. Accordingly, there is no basis to reverse the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b134-8\">.

Furthermore, we pointed out, deference is especially appropriate to be given to \"agencies working in the area of health and safety, which rely extensively on their specialized knowledge of that area in promulgating regulations.\u201d <em>Fogle, </em>337 Md. at 455, 654 A.2d at 456 <em>(citing Givner v.

Nevertheless, in this context, an inward look by the agency at the original intent of the regulation in determining its validity may be appropriate.

In upholding the exception, we concluded, in view of the agency's explanation, that most two-family dwellings were occupied by family groups which would presumably exercise greater care in regard to cleaning of facilities and to exercising health precautions, that the classification was a rational one. 207 Md. at 192-193, 113 A.2d at 903.

Statutory construction begins with the plain language of the statute, and ordinary, popular understanding of the English language dictates interpretation of its terminology. <em>Deville </em>v. <em>State, </em>383 Md. 217, 223, 858 A.2d 484, 487 (2004).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-7\">\u201cIn construing the plain language, \u2018[a] court may neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute; nor may it construe the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>statute with forced or subtle interpretations that limit or extend its application.\u2019 <em>Price v.

Three other arguments made by appellant also fall short. Adventist claims that by treating Policy 6.0 as applicable to new programs, the Commission renders it superfluous and thus violates another statutory tenet, that one section of a statute cannot render meaningless another section of the same statute. It does not follow, however, that, the mere fact that the 2004 SHP refers in some sections to \u201cexisting\u201d programs and in others, to \u201cnew\u201d programs means that Policy 6.0 requires a separate and distinct CON process for \"existing\u201d programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Adventist also argues that considering the Adventist LOI outside of comparative review would not violate the principles of regional planning as the Commission claimed. The Commission determined, however, that the impact of a partially relocated program to an area previously lacking a cardiac surgery program could be substantial, and thus, must be evaluated using the same principles as are applicable in the evaluation of new programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">Finally, Adventist denies that it \"should have known\u201d that, in view of the Commission Staff\u2019s addressing of the issue when the 2004 SHP was being considered, its LOI to partially relocate would be treated as a request for a new program. It argues, rather, that the Staff comments did not, in fact, indicate an intent on the part of the Commission to treat relocated programs and new programs the same. Indeed, it points out that at no time did the Commission Staff indicate \u201cthat a CON seeking partial relocation [would be] synonymous with a CON seeking a new program ...\u201d Whether Adventist anticipated, or should have, the Commission\u2019s interpretation of Policy 6.0, does not answer the question we must decide\u2014whether that interpretation, whenever arrived at, is correct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b156-7\">.
