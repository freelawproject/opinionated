It was the duty of the plaintiff to prove by a preponderance of evidence, not only negligence on the part of defendant, in which we say the proofs entirely fail, but that this negligence was the <em>sole </em>cause of the injury; citing <em>Mynning v. Railroad Co., </em>59 Mich. 257; <em>Brezee v. Powers, </em>80 Id. 172; and any contributory negligence of the plaintiff, however slight, precludes his recovery; citing <em>Balle v.

Where a person is injured while unnecessarily standing in a place which he knows to be dangerous, he is guilty of contributory negligence; citing <em>Billings v.

Plaintiff had charge of -a truck, and defendant\u2019s truck was in charge of a servant, one Orozier.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-12\">The Wabash Eailroad freight-house at Detroit extends along the river front, about 40 feet distant from the edge of the wharf, and this 40 feet is a covered way, and is used for the temporary storage of freight as well. On the day in question plaintiff drove in upon this way from the east, passing defendant\u2019s truck, which was discharging freight at one of the freight-house doors, and stopped about 150 feet west of defendant\u2019s truck. Plaintiff\u2019s claim .is that at this point he unloaded a single box of freight, which he placed in the warehouse, and then returned to the south side of his truck, and, while there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>engaged in removing a half-barrel of sugar from the rear and southerly side of his truck to the front thereof, he was struck by defendant\u2019s truck, which was being driven past where he then stood, and knocked down, one of the rear wheels of defendant\u2019s truck passing over one of his legs, seriously injuring it. At the time of the injury the north side of plaintiff\u2019s truck was about 7 feet -from the wall of the freight-house, and the south side of his truck was about 28 feet distant from the edge of the wharf. Plaintiff testified that he had no knowledge of the approach of defendant\u2019s truck, and did not see or hear it coming. The defendant insisted that it was customary to unload from the freight-house side of the truck; that plaintiff was negligent, in that at the time of the accident he was in fact unloading the box of freight, which weighed about 150 pounds, on the southerly side of his truck, and, as defendant\u2019s truck was being di\u2019iven by, plaintiff stepped back before the hind wheel of defendant\u2019s truck, and was struck, and turned round, and fell to the ground, and the box which he was handling fell upon his leg, inflicting the injury. Testimony was introduced to show that defendant\u2019s truck was at the time of the collision three or four feet from plaintiff\u2019s truck; that the approach of the truck was accompanied with considerable noise, and that plaintiff must have seen and heard its approach; and it was urged that he was guilty of negligence in not avoiding the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">After the close of all the proofs defendant asked the court to direct a verdict for the defendant on the ground that the all\u00e9gatio'ns in the declaration were insufficient; that there was no allegation in the declaration that plaintiff had been run over by defendant\u2019s truck. The declaration alleges that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-5\">\u201cThe said horses and truck of the said defendant then and there ran and struck with great force and violence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>the said plaintiff, and thereby the said plaintiff was then and there cast and thrown with great force and violence to and upon the ground; and by means of the said several premises aforesaid the said plaintiff was then and there greatly bruised, hurt, and wounded, and his leg and foot fractured and broken.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">Thereupon, at plaintiff\u2019s request, the court permitted plaintiff .to amend, by inserting after the words \u201c to and upon the ground\u201d the following, \u201cand the wheel of said truck ran over his leg.\u201d The defendant excepted, and the first error assigned is the allowance of the amendment. This was not error. No clpim of surprise was made, and \u2018 not only had the court full power to permit the amendment under the statute of amendments, but it was his duty so to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Other assignments of error relate to the refusal of the court to give certain of defendant\u2019s requests, which were predicated upon isolated portions of the testimony in support of defendant\u2019s theory of the case. To illustrate, error is assigned because of the refusal of the court to give the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">\u201c The testimony is undisputed that a truck, with horses moving, as defendant\u2019s truck did, made a noise which could be heard for a distance of from 100 to 200 feet. If, therefore, the jury believe that a man standing in the same position as plaintiff stood, with fair hearing, could have heard a team approaching, then plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence in starting or continuing to remove freight from his truck, or to move freight on his truck, on the river side of said truck, and cannot recover.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">It does not follow that if plaintiff had heard the approach of the truck he was bound to assume that Crozier, with 18 feet of a drive-way, would drive over plaintiff. Again, this request assumes that plaintiff was removing the box from the south side of his truck, while plaintiff insisted that he was not. This request was properly refused, as were others similar in character.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>The other requests presented\u2019 by defendant, upon the refusal to give which error is assigned, ask the court to direct the jury that unloading goods from the river side of the truck was negligence; that it was plaintiff's duty to look out for passing teams, and, failing so to do, he was negligent; and that, if defendant's truck was driven at a distance of three or four feet from plaintiff's truck, defendant's servant was not guilty of negligence. These requests were properly refused. The court instructed the jury that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-4\">\u201cOne who has been damnified, even by the negligence of another, cannot recover unless he himself is free from fault, unless he himself is not guilty of contributory negligence; that is to say, gentleman of the jury, unless he himself is free from any act of carelessness,- without which carelessness on his part the accident would not have happened.''</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Again, the court says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\">\u201cYou must find that the plaintiff himself was free from any act of carelessness which contributed to the accident.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Again, he says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-8\">\u201cAny injury to the plaintiff, even though the act of Crozier in driving might have been the efficient cause of the injury, will not entitle the plaintiff to recover, if by using ordinary care he might have escaped being injured; and the burden of proof is upon the plaintiff not only to show negligence on the part of the defendant's servant in driving the truck, but also a want of negligence \u2014 freedom from negligence \u2014 on the part of plaintiff himself.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">This case is ruled by <em>Boick v. Bissell, </em>80 Mich. 260, and <em>Lazell v. Kapp, </em>83 Id. 36. In each of those cases the plaintiff was at the time of the injury in a public highway; but here plaintiff was in a private way, where there was not only less travel, but less rapid travel, and therefore a lower degree of care or diligence on plaintiff's <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>part would be required. The questions of negligence were very properly left to the jury under clear and explicit instructions from the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">The judgment below is affirmed, with costs of both courts.</p>\n<judges id=\"b54-5\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
