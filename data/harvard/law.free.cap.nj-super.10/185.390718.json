J. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number><em>Super. </em>398 <em>(Ch. Div. </em>1950); we agree with his conclusion that it established a valid gift on Thanksgiving Day, 1948, from the decedent to the defendant of the sum on deposit in the savings account at the Savings Investment and Trust Company of East Orange.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\"> The appellant urges that under <em>R. S. </em>2:97-2 the court should have excluded the defendant\u2019s testimony of her conversation with the decedent at the time of the gift. However, the first objection to this testimony was not made until long after it was completed; it came too late. See <em>Rowland v. Rowland, </em>40 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>281, 284 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1885). Furthermore, it was admissible since the complaint included a charge of misrepresentation, fraud and deceit. See <em>Neuman v. Fantl, </em>119 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>351, 355 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The appellant further urges that the gift was incomplete because the withdrawal slip was signed by the decedent in blank. We consider this point to be without merit. The delivery of the savings bank book with donative intent, plus the signed withdrawal slip with authority in the defendant to fill it in, effectively stripped the decedent of dominion and control of the account; indeed, our courts have recognized the validity of such gift even where the delivery of the book was not accompanied by any withdrawal slip. See <em>In re Curran, </em>3 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>717 <em>(Orphans Ct. </em>1925); <em>Hickey v. Kahl, </em>129 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>233, 238 <em>(Ch. </em>1941). <em>Cf. Long Branch Banking Co. v. Winter, </em>112 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>218, 220 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
