A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A4-\">Plaintiffs appeal from an adverse judgment entered upon a verdict in the Superior Court, Law Division, in a negligence action arising out of a collision between an automobile owned and operated by the defendant Parker, and an automobile owned and operated by the plaintiff Ciardella, in which plaintiff Louise Carbone was an occupant. Ciardella sued for damages for the repairs to his automobile, and Louise Carbone sought damages for personal injuries sustained by her.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-13\">There was a sharp conflict in the testimony as to the cause of the collision. Plaintiffs\u2019 theory was that their car was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>parked oil the highway when defendant\u2019s car struck the rear of the Ciardella car. On the other hand, defendant contended that Ciardella suddenly backed his automobile into the highway from a driveway, striking defendant\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The plaintiffs advance three grounds for reversal of the judgment against them: (a) the examination of the witness Hannold constituted harmful error; (b) the court erred in its charge; (c) the court erred in its refusal to charge as requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Hannold, chief of police of the municipality where the collision occurred, was calied as a witness for the defendant. After asking the witness to identify himself and also bringing out that he had been subpoenaed by the plaintiffs (but not called by them), defendant\u2019s attorney, over objection, was permitted to show the witness a written statement. Hannold testified that the statement contained his signature. Over objection, the witness was allowed to read the statement to himself, after which he testified as to the position of the ears when he arrived at the scene of the collision. The witness was then interrogated by defendant\u2019s attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-7\">\u201cQ. Now, Officer Hannold, did Mr. Ciardella make any statement to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-8\">\u201cA. Sir, not that I recall.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">Defendant\u2019s attorney thereupon pleaded surprise and asked permission to cross-examine the witness, which the court granted. The examination continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-10\">\u201cQ. Did you on October 28, 1948, make the statement that I permitted you to read a few minutes ago?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-11\">\u201cA. Yes, sir, that is my handwriting there and my signature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-12\">After a colloquy between the court and counsel, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-13\">\u201cQ. Now, did Mr. Ciardella make any statement to you concerning the accident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-14\">\u201cA. Sir, not that I recall. That night, there was a lot of excitement. There was quite a crowd around there, and being a police officer, and you see the girl was hurt, she was crying, I could not say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>\u201cQ. Did lie, Officer, make the following statement to you:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-4\">\u201c T talked to the drivers of both cars, and the driver of the car that was in the driveway told me he would pay for the damages as it was his fault.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-5\">\u201cDid he make that statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-6\">\u201cMr. Chashin: Your Honor, I object on all the grounds which I previously have stated, if your Honor please. I thought you would prefer I would not repeat the reasons. They are all comprised within the objection to the prior question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-7\">\u201cThe Court: I will allow it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-8\">\u201cQ. Do you want the question re-read or can you answer it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-9\">\u201cA. X would like to ask that question over again.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-10\">(The last question read by the Reporter.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-11\">\u201cThe Witness: I cannot recall that he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-12\">\u201cQ. Did you in your statement of October 28tli, 1948, say, \u2018I talked to the driver of both cars, and the driver of the car that was in the driveway told me that he would pay for the damages as it was his fault\u2019?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-13\">The answer, not being responsive, was struck.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-14\">Later the defendant called a witness, Grist, an investigator, who testified he took a statement, signed by Hannold, on October 28, 1948. On objection, the written statement was not admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-15\">It is clear that a party whose cause or defense is injured by the unexpected answer of his own witness may, upon a showing of surprise, neutralize the effect of the adverse testimony by proving that, at a previous time, the witness had made a statement inconsistent with his testimony. <em>Stappenbeck v. Jagels Fuel </em>Corp., 131 <em>N. J. L. </em>215 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1944). This may be accomplished by cross-examination of the witness. <em>State v. Hogan, </em>137 <em>N. J. L. </em>497 (old <em>Sup. Ct. </em>1948); affirmed, 1 <em>N. J. </em>375 (1949). However, the purpose of such cross-examination is limited, as stated by Justice Burling in <em>State v. Hogan, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-16\">\u201cThis cross-examination is permitted for the sole purpose of neutralizing or of wiping the slate clean of the unexpected adverse testimony of the witness and is to be clearly distinguished from impeachment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-17\">In the present case there was no \u201cadverse\u201d or hurtful testimony given by Hannold and, consequently, there was nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>to be erased. The effect of neutralizing the testimony of the witness should never be more than the cancellation of the adverse answer by which the party is surprised. <em>Moon v. Lewis, </em>116 <em>N. J. L. </em>521 (E. <em>&amp; A. </em>1936); <em>State v. D\u2019Adame, </em>84 <em>N. J. L. </em>386 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1913). Therefore, where the witness, as here, gives no testimony injurious to the party calling him but only fails to render the assistance which was expected, because of a failure of recollection, there is no basis for neutralizing under the rule. While a party should not be denied the right to defend his case by an unwilling or hostile witness, yet he should not be permitted to read before the jury an unsworn statement of such witness under the pretense of neutralizing his testimony. See cases in <em>Note, </em>74 <em>A. L. R. </em>at 1064 <em>et seq.; Note, </em>117 <em>A. L. R. </em>326; <em>Note, </em>42 <em>L. R. A. (N. S.) </em>747; 58 <em>Am. Jur. </em>445, \u00a7 800 <em>et seq. </em>See also <em>Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd Ed., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1018, 1043.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\"> Under the circumstances, it was unusual for the defendant to be permitted to show his own witness the signed statement and to require the witness to read it before he had been asked any questions concerning a fact in issue. After Hannold testified that the written statement contained his signature but that he did not recall Ciardella\u2019s making any statement to him, defendant\u2019s counsel was permitted, in the presence of the jury, to read to the witness, in the form of a question, a damaging admission allegedly made by Ciardella. The written statement itself, of course, was not competent as proof of the facts stated therein. <em>Moon v. Lewis, supra. </em>Since Hannold had not given any testimony injurious to the defendant nor manifested any bias, it seems clear .that the interrogation was prejudicial to the plaintiffs in that it allowed the jury to consider the content of his unsworn statement assertively expressing, as it did, that Ciardella by his own admission was at fault. The result of such interrogation was to put in the mouth of the witness the very allegations of fact which defendant wished him to verify by an affirmative answer. See <em>Fisher v. Hart, </em>149 <em>Pa. St. </em>232, 24 <em>A. </em>225 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1892). Even if we assume that it was proper for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>defendant\u2019s attorney to read excerpts from the statement in the presence of the jury, such excerpts have no substantive or independent testimonial value, and the jury should have been instructed to that effect. <em>State v. D\u2019Adame, supra; State v. Kysilka, </em>85 <em>N. J. L. </em>712 <em>(E. </em>&amp; <em>A. </em>1914); <em>State v. Rappise, </em>3 <em>N. J. Super. </em>30 <em>(App. Div. </em>1949); <em>Wigmore on Evidence, </em>3rd <em>Ed., </em>\u00a7 1018. <em>Compare Kulinka v. Flockhart Foundry Co., </em>9 <em>N. J. Super. </em>495, 500 <em>(Essex Cty. Ct. </em>1950). Moreover, an admission by Ciardella would not be binding on plaintiff Carbone.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Uor can the interrogation be justified on the ground of refreshing Hannold\u2019s recollection. It was evident that the witness\u2019 memory was not refreshed, and the use of the statement was then at an end. Thereafter, it was improper for the defendant\u2019s attorney to call attention to its contents by way of interrogation under the guise of refreshing his recollection. <em>Wigmore on Evidence, </em>3rd <em>Ed., </em>\u00a7 763; see also <em>Note, </em>125 <em>A. L. R. </em>at 65; <em>cf. Crothers v. Caroselli, </em>126 <em>N. J. L. </em>590 <em>(E. </em>&amp; <em>A. </em>1941); <em>Cooper v. Endress Motors, Inc., </em>123 <em>N. J. L. </em>290 <em>(E. </em>&amp; <em>A. </em>1939); <em>North Hudson County Railway Co. v. May, </em>48 <em>N. J. L. </em>401 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1886).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">The cases of <em>State v. Kwiatkowski, </em>83 <em>N. J. L. </em>650 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1912), and <em>State v. Silver, </em>2 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>479 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1924); affirmed, 101 <em>N. J. L. </em>232 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1925), are not applicable. In each of those cases the witness had given testimony at an earlier trial, and it was with this former testimony that he was confronted at the later trial. A witness\u2019 prior testimony is ordinarily usable to refresh his memory either on direct or cross-examination. See <em>Note, </em>125 <em>A. L. R. </em>at 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">We conclude the interrogation of Hannold constituted prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">We find that the remaining reasons assigned for reversal are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">Reversed and remanded, costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
