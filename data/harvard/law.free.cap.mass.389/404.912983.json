L. c. 161A, \u00a7 21<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>) governing ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>tians for death, personal injury, or property damage against the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) is unenforceable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The plaintiff was struck by a bus, the property of the MBTA, on June 30, 1979, while he was operating a bicycle on a public way in Boston. On April 14, 1982, approximately two years and ten months after the accident, he filed a complaint against the MBTA alleging the bus operator\u2019s negligence and seeking damages for his resultant injuries. From the judgment following the allowance of the MBTA\u2019s motion to dismiss on the ground of the statute of limitations, the plaintiff appealed to the Appeals Court, and we granted his application for direct appellate review. See G. L. c. 211 A, \u00a7 10(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">We interpret the plaintiff\u2019s argument as raising two distinct, but related issues: (1) the denial of equal protection of the laws because of the disparity in time between the statute of limitations governing the commencement of actions against only the MBTA in G. L. c. 161A, \u00a7 21 (two years), and the general statutes of limitation in G. L. c. 260, \u00a7\u00a7 2A and 4, controlling the commencement of actions in most contract and tort actions for personal injuries (three years); and (2) the implied repeal of \u00a7 21, in 1973, when the time limitations of \u00a7 \u00a7 2A and 4 were extended to three years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> St. 1973, c. 777, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>1. <em>Equal protection. </em>The plaintiff argues that he has been denied the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution because, by the wholly adventitious misfortune of being struck by the defendant\u2019s bus, he was required to bring his action within a period of time which is one year shorter than would be required if he had been struck by any other motor vehicle. He claims that this disparate treatment is founded on no rational basis. However, his arguments fall short of overcoming the presumption of validity which we have always given to such statutes. <em>American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>374 Mass. 181, 190 (1978). The task of overcoming this presumption has been described as a \u201cheavy burden.\u201d <em>El Paso </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>379 U.S. 497, 508-509 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The Legislature could have provided the same time restraints for bringing action against the MET A as it had provided for commencing actions against others. However, there is a rational basis for providing a different time limitation for actions against the META, because of its unique position as a provider of public transportation to a large segment of the population. We take notice that the META is responsible for public transportation to a major portion of the largest metropolitan area in the Commonwealth. The META was created by the Legislature in 1964. G. L. c. 161A, inserted by St. 1964, c. 563, \u00a7 18. At a point early in the MBTA\u2019s existence, this court had occasion to note the public purpose of the META and the fact that \u201c[transportation concerns every inhabitant of the Commonwealth and every aspect of our society.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth. </em>v. <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>348 Mass. 538, 542 (1965). In a word, the Legislature could have concluded that there is a rational basis for treating the META differently from others because of its special public obligations. See <em>Fujimura </em>v. <em>Chicago Transit Auth., </em>67 Ill. 2d 506 (1977).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>The plaintiff does not persuade us by arguing for uniformity and by protesting the lack of logic and wisdom in the disparity of treatment of people who become plaintiffs in personal injury and property damage cases. It is not for the court to decide whether a statute is wise or effective so long as it can be supported on any rational basis that can be conceived to sustain it. See <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Catalano, </em>386 Mass. 701, 707 (1982); <em>Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. on the Necessaries of Life, </em>307 Mass. 408, 418 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">2. <em>Implied repeal. </em>We read the plaintiff s brief as arguing that the Legislature impliedly repealed the two-year statute of limitations created in 1964 in G. L. c. 161 A, \u00a7 21, when, in 1973, it extended from two years to three years the time constraints in \u00a7\u00a7 2A and 4 which limit the commencement of personal injury and property damage actions similar to those encompassed by \u00a7 21. Implied repeal is a doctrine that has never been favored by our law. Its application has been limited to those rare instances where the \u201cstatute is so repugnant to and inconsistent with the later enactment that both cannot stand.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bloomberg, </em>302 Mass. 349, 352 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Furthermore, the Legislature has specifically recognized the viability of special statutes of limitation such as that contained in \u00a7 21. General Laws c. 260, \u00a7 19, provides: \u201cIf a special provision is otherwise made relative to the limitation of any action, any provision of this chapter inconsistent therewith shall not apply.\u201d Section 21 is such a special provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>There was no error in the entry of judgment allowing the MBTA\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b420-15\"> General Laws c. 161A, \u00a7 21, inserted by St. 1964, c. 563, \u00a7 18, states in part: \u201cThe authority shall be liable for the acts and negligence of the directors and of the servants and employess of the authority in management and operation of the authority and of the properties owned, leased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>and operated by it to the same extent as though the authority were a street railway company, but the directors shall not be personally liable except for malfeasance in office.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">\u201cThe authority shall be liable in tort to passengers, and to persons in the exercise of due care who are not passengers or in the employment of the authority, for personal injury and for death and for damages to property in the same manner as though it were a street railway company; provided that any action for such personal injury or property damage shall be commenced only within two years next after the date of such injury or damage and in case of death only within two years next after the date of the injury which caused the death.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b421-9\"> In <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Trans.
