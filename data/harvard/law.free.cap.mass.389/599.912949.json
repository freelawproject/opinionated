Brown, Jr., appeals from a judgment of the Superior Court which affirmed the decision of the defendant Board of Appeal on Motor Vehicle Liability Policies and Bonds (board). The board\u2019s decision upheld an earlier action of the defendant Registrar of Motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>Vehicles (Registrar), refusing to reinstate Brown\u2019s license. Brown filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment of the Superior Court, and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">On January 12, 1982, Brown was found guilty by a judge of the Wrentham Division of the District Court Department of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor and of operating a motor vehicle recklessly. After receiving notice of the convictions, the Registrar, on February 9, 1982, revoked Brown\u2019s operator\u2019s license. See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (b), as appearing in St. 1964, c. 200, \u00a7 1, and \u00a7 24 (2) <em>(b), </em>as amended by St. 1964, c. 200, \u00a7 4. Brown then appealed, requesting a trial de nova in the jury of six session of the District Court. On March 16, 1982, Brown appeared before a judge of the District Court, sitting in the jury of six session. Brown agreed to participate in an alcohol education program, and his case was continued without a finding, for one year, until March 16, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">On March 24, 1982, Brown requested that the Registrar return his license. The Registrar denied the request, stating that the license was to remain \u201crevoked until case is terminated in favor of [the] defendant.\u201d Brown appealed the Registrar\u2019s action to the board. See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 28. After a hearing, the board affirmed the Registrar\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Brown\u2019s claim is that he was entitled to retain his license, pending completion of an alcohol education program, once his case was continued without a finding in the jury of six session. He argues that G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24D, as amended by St. 1975, c. 758, \u00a7 4, and \u00a7 24E, as appearing in St. 1975, c. 505, \u00a7 2, provided for an alternative disposition for persons who enroll in an alcohol education program and required the Registrar to reinstate the license once a case was continued without a finding. We disagree.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>We turn to consider the language of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7\u00a7 24, 24D, and 24E, as they existed at the time of Brown\u2019s conviction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (b), provided, in relevant part, that a person who has been convicted of operating of motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor shall have his license revoked immediately by the Registrar and that \u201cno appeal . . . shall operate to stay the revocation of the license.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (c), as amended through St. 1974, c. 647, \u00a7 2, provided, in relevant part, that \u201c[t]he registrar, after having revoked the license . . . shall not issue a new license ... to such person, except in his discretion if the prosecution of such person has terminated in favor of the defendant . . . until one year after the date of revocation following a conviction . . . except as provided in section twenty-four D.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Read literally, the statute imposed a duty on the Registrar to revoke, for one year, the license of a person convicted of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor unless the prosecution has terminated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>favor of that person. Since a conviction after a bench trial was a conviction within the meaning of the statute, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (d), the Registrar was bound to revoke the license. The Registrar was not relieved of that duty because Brown appealed his conviction to the jury of six session. G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (b). Further, a continuance without a finding was not a termination of the prosecution in Brown\u2019s favor, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eaton, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 732, 737 (1981), and did not serve to relieve the Registrar of his duty to revoke the license for a period of at least one year. This general scheme has not been thought to offend constitutional principles. See <em>Boyle </em>v. <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles, </em>368 Mass. 141 (1975); <em>Almeida </em>v. <em>Lucey, </em>372 F. Supp. 109 (D. Mass.), aff\u2019d, 419 U.S. 806 (1974). See also <em>Ludwig </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>427 U.S. 618, 622 (1976) (noting that conviction after a bench trial may have adverse collateral consequences for a defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Brown argues, however, that once he enrolled in an alcohol education program and had his case continued without a finding, the terms of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7\u00a7 24D<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>24E,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> required the Registrar to issue a new license.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He seeks to draw an inference from certain language of \u00a7 24E, which provided that a license may be revoked in certain circumstances.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He claims that this language is evidence that the Legislature intended that every person who has had his case continued before the jury of six session and entered an alcohol education program would have a new license issued to him, regardless of a bench trial conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Reliance on either \u00a7 24D or \u00a7 24E does not carry the day for Rrown. Section 24D did not contemplate any automatic issuance of a new license. It only states that the Registrar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>is to report to the court \u201cwhether said person should later be eligible for early reinstatement of his license.\u201d G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24D. Section 24E did not support Browns position either. It provided a means through which a person may obtain an early dismissal of the charge. If the charge were dismissed, the prosecution would be terminated in the defendant\u2019s favor, and the Registrar would be authorized to issue the person a new license. The language which Brown points to would then be relevant. The license obtained after the dismissal of the charges could be revoked later if the court determined that either the person has failed to comply satisfactorily with the driver alcohol education program or the person\u2019s operation of a motor vehicle constituted a threat to the public safety. Thus, this language does not manifest a legislative intent that a new license will be issued before a termination of the prosecution in favor of the defendant. The Registrar therefore had no authority on March 24, 1982, to issue a new license to Brown.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b616-8\"> The board has raised the issue whether the case is moot, given that one year has passed since the revocation of the license. See <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Panora, </em>593 F.2d 161 (1st Cir. 1979). Thus, the Registrar would appear to have the authority to reinstate Brown\u2019s license, but the statute by its terms does not require that he do so. During oral argument before this court, Brown\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>counsel represented that Brown had not received his license. Since there is a live dispute between the parties until Brown receives his license, the case does not appear to be moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b617-8\"> The amendment of these statutes by St. 1982, c. 373, is not applicable to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b617-9\"> General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (b), as appearing in St. 1964, c. 200, \u00a7 1, provided: \u201cA conviction of a violation of the preceding paragraph of this section shall be reported forthwith by the court or magistrate to the registrar, who shall revoke immediately the license or the right to operate of the person so convicted, and no appeal, motion for new trial or exceptions shall operate to stay the revocation of the license or right to operate.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b617-10\"> General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (c), as amended through St. 1974, c. 647, \u00a7 2, provided, in part: \u201cThe registrar, after having revoked the license or the right to operate of any person under the preceding paragraph of this section, shall not issue a new license or reinstate the right to operate to such person, except in his discretion if the prosecution of such person has terminated in favor of the defendant, until five years after the date of revocation following a conviction of a violation of paragraph <em>(a) </em>hereof committed within six years after conviction of a violation of said paragraph, nor until one year after the date of revocation following a conviction of any violation of said paragraph other than one committed within six years as aforesaid except as provided in section twenty-four D . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b618-6\"> General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 24D, as appearing in St. 1975, c. 505, \u00a7 1, provided, in relevant part: \u201cAny person convicted of or charged with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor may if he consents, be placed on probation for one year and shall, as a condition of probation, be assigned to a driver alcohol education program as provided herein and, if deemed necessary by the court, to an alcohol treatment or rehabilitation program or to both as provided herein. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">\u201cIn order to qualify for disposition under this section, said person shall cooperate in an investigation conducted by the probation staff of the court for the supervision of cases of operating under the influence of intoxicating liquor in such manner as the commissioner [of] probation shall determine.
