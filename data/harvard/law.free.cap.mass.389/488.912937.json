L. c. 89, \u00a7 9,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for which she had received a citation pursuant to G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 20F, inserted by St. 1978, c. 478, \u00a7 41. A single justice transferred the case to the Superior Court, see G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 4A, and thereafter the parties filed a stipulation of agreed facts. On March 16, 1982, the trial judge denied the State defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the action, and thereafter the single justice granted the joint motion of all the parties to retransfer the case to this court. The single justice reserved and reported the case to the full court on September 29, 1982. We conclude that the plaintiff\u2019s complaint should have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The complaint challenges the constitutionality of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 20F, on various grounds. The plaintiff concedes that our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtin, </em>386 Mass. 587 (1982), which was rendered after the judge denied the State defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss this action, disposes of her constitutional claims. We decline to reconsider that decision. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Germano, </em>379 Mass. 268 (1979). The plaintiff\u2019s remaining claims, that there was a fatal delay between the alleged violation and the citation, that the citation form was inadequate, and that the prosecution waived its right to appeal from the clerk-magistrate\u2019s finding that she was not responsible, can be raised as defenses to the proceeding now pending in the District Court. That proceeding affords the plaintiff a fully adequate remedy. See <em>Norcisa </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Provincetown, </em>368 Mass. 161, 168-173 (1975) (court of equity generally should not grant injunctive or declaratory relief where the only injury which would result from pending criminal action is that incidental to a lawful criminal action brought in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>good faith).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See also <em>Jacoby </em>v. <em>Babcock Artificial Kidney Center, Inc., </em>364 Mass. 561, 562-564 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">No exceptional circumstances are presented here which warrant the granting of declaratory relief. See <em>District Attorney for the Suffolk Dist. </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>381 Mass. 648, 659-660 (1980); <em>Bunker Hill Distrib., Inc. </em>v. <em>District Attorney for the Suffolk Dist., </em>376 Mass. 142, 146 (1978). General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 20F, was repealed by St. 1982, c. 586, \u00a7 1, after the present action was instituted. The new provisions governing procedures for motor vehicle offenses are now in G. L. c. 90C, effective April 22, 1983. St. 1982, c. 586, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 4. No question respecting the new provisions is properly before us. The case is remanded to the Supreme Judicial Court for the county of Suffolk for entry of a judgment dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b505-6\"> The plaintiff was cited for disregarding a traffic light. Her automobile was allegedly involved in an accident with a police cruiser.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b506-7\"> In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtin, </em>386 Mass. 587 (1982), we held that \u201cno hearing was contemplated [in G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 20F] by the Legislature unless the offender elects a criminal proceeding,\u201d and that a person contesting the issuance of a citation could elect a preliminary hearing before a clerk-magistrate, appealable by either party to a judge of a District Court. If the judge decides process should issue, another judge conducts a de nova hearing on the merits, appealable after conviction to a de nova trial in a jury of six session. <em>Id. </em>at 589, 590-591.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
