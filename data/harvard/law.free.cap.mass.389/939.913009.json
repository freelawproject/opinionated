At the time of his appointment by vote of the Lawrence city council, Patrick Schiavone and the plaintiffs were captains in the Lawrence police department and the only persons on the civil service list eligible for appointment to chief. Also at that time, as had been the case for several years, Patrick Schiavone\u2019s brother Terrance was the director of public safety, and, as an alderman, a member of the Lawrence city council. The plaintiffs\u2019 principal challenges to Patrick Schiavone\u2019s appointment are founded, directly or indirectly, on the fraternal relationship of Patrick and Terrance Schiavone.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-10\">A judge of the Superior Court reserved decision and reported the case to the Appeals Court on a statement of agreed facts, constituting a case stated. The report stated that certain questions, set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> were pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>sented for determination. We transferred the case here on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">As an initial matter it is important to state what we regard as before us. We believe that the judge and the parties intended to present for our determination only the questions that are set forth in the judge\u2019s reservation and report. It is true that the parties agreed to an \u201cAgreed Statement of Facts Constituting a Case Stated\u201d and thus might be regarded as having presented the entire matter for determination on the agreed record. However, the apparent purpose of the agreement as to facts was only to present facts bearing on the stated questions. The reservation and report says: \u201cThe following questions are presented for determination\u201d and \u201c[tjhis report contains all the evidence material to the questions reported.\u201d The parties have argued these questions and no other issues. Therefore, we shall only answer the questions presented. We conclude that the plaintiffs have standing to raise the question of the lawfulness of Patrick Schiavone\u2019s appointment, that Alderman Schiavone violated the conflict of interest law when he appointed his brother to the positions of lieutenant and captain in the police force, and that the ordinance pursuant to which Patrick Schiavone was appointed chief of police is lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>The two plaintiffs moved up through various ranks in the Lawrence police department to become captains. Tylus became a captain in 1970; Sciuto became a captain in August, 1971. The defendant Patrick Schiavone became a permanent police officer in 1966. In December, 1971, he was appointed a sergeant. Alderman Schiavone, as director of public safety, appointed his brother Patrick to the position of lieutenant in December, 1977, and to the position of captain in November, 1978. In each instance, Patrick Schiavone\u2019s name appeared on a list certified by the personnel administrator of the Civil Service Commission (commission). In December, 1976, before either appointment, the then city solicitor gave a requested opinion to Alderman Schiavone that, if his brother were to pass a civil service examination and were to be certified by the commission, Alderman Schiavone could lawfully appoint his brother to a higher position in the police department, although such an appointment could be considered a violation of the standards of conduct set forth in G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 23, \u201cfor which there is no statutory provision for disciplinary action.\u201d Patrick Schiavone\u2019s impressive rise in rank from sergeant to lieutenant to captain followed in the next two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">In 1980, the position of chief of police became open,,and the personnel administrator of the commission certified Tylus, Sciuto, and Patrick Schiavone as eligible for appointment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiffs did not challenge Patrick Schiavone\u2019s eligibility to take the examination at or before the time he took it. After Patrick Schiavone\u2019s name appeared on the civil service list, Alderman Schiavone requested an opinion from the city solicitor, not the one who gave the earlier opinion, whether he could properly appoint his brother to the position of chief. The city solicitor advised that the appointment \u201cmight be improper.\u201d On August 14, 1980, on the suggestion of Alderman Schiavone, but without his further participation, the Lawrence city council, acting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>through the unanimous vote of its other four members, amended the revised ordinances of the city to provide that the city council, and not the director of public safety, would appoint the chief of police.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">On August 22, 1980, the plaintiffs commenced this action challenging past promotions of Patrick Schiavone as violations of the conflict of interest law (G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 19), arguing that his appointment as chief would be unlawful, and contending that the August 14, 1980, amendment of the city\u2019s ordinances was invalid. On August 29, 1980, a judge of the Superior Court denied the plaintiffs a preliminary injunction. On September 2, 1980, the city council, in the absence of Alderman Schiavone, voted to appoint Patrick Schiavone to the position of chief of police.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">1. The August 14, 1980, amendment of the revised ordinances, providing for the appointment of the chief of police by the city council, is lawful. The September 2, 1980, city council vote appointing Patrick Schiavone to the position of chief of police was consistent with the provisions of the amended ordinance. Alderman Schiavone did not participate in these votes. The fact that he suggested that the city ordinance be amended does not present grounds to invalidate the amendment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">A provision in a city ordinance giving the city council authority to appoint the chief of police does not offend the separation of powers principles of art. 30 of the Declaration of Rights of the Constitution of the Commonwealth. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>true that the appointment of a particular person to an office is traditionally the function of the executive department. See <em>Commissioner of Admin. </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>350 Mass. 501, 505 (1966). We are aware of no case, however, in which separation of powers principles have been applied in this Commonwealth to invalidate the allocation of power to a city council, or similar body, to appoint a municipal officer. The plaintiffs\u2019 art. 30 challenge to the ordinance, if accepted, would call into question the entire form of government in effect in Lawrence, where the city council appoints various city officials (including the city clerk, the city treasurer, and the city solicitor [see St. 1955, c. 98, \u00a7 2]) and where each alderman serves as the director and administrative head of a branch of the city government.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">We find no merit in the plaintiffs\u2019 further contention that the difference in the process by which the chief of police is appointed (by the city council) from the process by which many other municipal officers are appointed (by city councillor-department heads) violates art. 10 of the Declaration of Rights. On its face, the amended ordinance does not single out any person for special privileges or advantages at the expense of the rights of another. See <em>Commissioner of Pub. Health </em>v. <em>Bessie M. Burke Memorial Hosp., </em>366 Mass. 734, 741-744 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">2. The plaintiffs\u2019 basic contention is that, assuming the amended ordinance is valid, Patrick Schiavone was not entitled to appointment to the position of chief of police because his earlier appointments to the positions of lieutenant and captain were made by his brother in violation of G. L. c. 268A. Under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 59, Patrick Schiavone would have been eligible to take the civil service examination for chief only if at least one, and perhaps both, of these appointments had been made.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The plaintiffs argue that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>Patrick Schiavone was not entitled to be considered for appointment to chief because those earlier appointments, which were essential to his eligibility for appointment to chief, were made in violation of G. L. c. 268A.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">The defendants argue that we need not reach these issues for a variety of reasons. They contend that the plaintiffs have raised their challenges to the earlier appointments too late, that the action is barred by loches, and that they failed to take seasonable appeals under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 2 <em>(b), </em>to the commission when Patrick Schiavone\u2019s name appeared on earlier civil service lists for appointment to lieutenant and to captain. The plaintiffs were already captains when the earlier appointments were made. Thus, they would not have then been \u201cpersons aggrieved\u201d who are entitled under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 2 <em>(b), </em>to appeal to the commission from the personnel administrator\u2019s inclusion of Patrick Schiavone\u2019s name on the list of candidates. For the same general reasons, we see no basis for concluding that the plaintiffs were guilty of loches. They were not adversely affected by the earlier appointments at the time they were made, and their delay in making any challenge was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">The defendants also contend that the plaintiffs should have appealed to the commission under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 2 <em>(b), </em>when Patrick Schiavone\u2019s name appeared with theirs on the civil service list for appointment as chief of police. We think the commission had no role to play either in deciding whether the appointment of Patrick Schiavone might violate the conflict of interest law or in concluding that, for this reason, his name should not appear on a civil service eligibility list.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>The plaintiffs had standing to maintain an action challenging the appointment of Patrick Schiavone to the position of chief of police. In <em>Graham </em>v. <em>McGrail, </em>370 Mass. 133, 136-137 (1976), we upheld the right of a school committee member to obtain prospective declaratory relief, concerning the propriety of certain action under G. L. c. 268A, when other school committee members who had children employed in the school system participated in various budget decisions. We noted, but did not have to decide, the question whether a member of a school committee could invoke the civil remedies of rescission and restitution of G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 21 <em>(a), </em>as to certain actions of the school committee. <em>Id. </em>at 134. Earlier, we had held that in particular circumstances a private citizen could invoke the recission remedy of \u00a7 21 <em>(a). Everett Town Taxi, Inc. </em>v. <em>Aldermen of Everett, </em>366 Mass. 534, 535 (1974). We noted in that case that the conflict of interest law had been \u201cenacted as part of \u2018comprehensive legislation . . . [to] strike at corruption in public office, inequality of treatment of citizens and the use of public office for private gain.\u2019 Report of the Special Commission on Code of Ethics, 1962 House Doc. No. 3650, [at] 18.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 536. We said further that \u201c[i]n light of these objectives it is apparent that, if a right of action is denied to all private parties, there would be a frustration of the statute,\u201d and noted that, if only municipal officials could act under \u00a7 21 <em>(a), </em>there would be no action at all if those officials were the principal parties in interest. <em>Id. </em>We concluded that competitors of corporations allegedly benefited by violations of the conflict of interest law could maintain an action under \u00a7 21 (a), if they were engaged in a regulated industry and were challenging governmental action threatening their competitive position. <em>Id. </em>at 538-539.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b963-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>The principles that underlay our decision to grant standing to the plaintiffs in the <em>Everett Town Taxi </em>case support the grant of standing to the plaintiffs here. They and Patrick Schiavone were the only persons presented on the civil service list for appointment to the position of chief of police. They were eligible competitors for the appointment to the position. No public official or anyone else was likely to challenge the appointment of Patrick Schiavone because the interested public officials favored the appointment and no one else had as direct an interest in the matter as did the plaintiffs. See <em>Charbonnier </em>v. <em>Amico, 367 </em>Mass. 146, 151 n.10 (1975) (residency alone does not confer standing under \u00a7 21 [a]). The objectives of the conflict of interest law would be considerably frustrated if we were to deny standing to the plaintiffs in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">Because we reject the defendants\u2019 various challenges to the plaintiffs\u2019 right to seek rescission of the appointment of Patrick Schiavone to the position of chief of police, we must answer the further question whether the earlier appointments were unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">3. Alderman Schiavone\u2019s appointments of his brother to the positions of lieutenant and captain in the Lawrence police force were violations of the conflict of interest law. In <em>Graham </em>v. <em>McGrail, </em>370 Mass. 133 (1976), we concluded that a school committee member who participates in decisions when his child\u2019s compensation as a school employee is directly and immediately concerned violates the provisions of G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 19 <em>(a). </em>Such a school committee member is, we said, \u201ca municipal employee who participates as such an employee in a particular matter in which to his knowledge ... his immediate family . . . has a financial interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 137. \u201cImmediate family\u201d includes a child or brother of an employee. G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 1 <em>(e). </em>Participation includes participating personally and substantially as a municipal employee through \u201capproval\u201d or \u201cdecision\u201d or \u201cotherwise.\u201d G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 1 (j). \u201cParticular matter\u201d includes an \u201capplication,\u201d \u201ccontract,\u201d \u201cdecision,\u201d and \u201cdetermination.\u201d G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 1 <em>(k), </em>as appearing in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>St. 1982, c. 612, \u00a7 1. Alderman Schiavone is a municipal employee (see <em>District Attorney for Hampden Dist. </em>v. <em>Grucci, </em>384 Mass. 525, 528 [1981]) and his appointment of his brother to the positions of lieutenant and captain presumably involved a matter in which his brother had a financial interest.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">The defendants argue that \u201cnepotism\u201d is not covered by those sections of the conflict of interest law that contain criminal penalties. They point to a statement in the Report of the Special Commission on Code of Ethics, 1962 House Doc. No. 3650, at 9, in support of this argument.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This statement is difficult to reconcile with the express reference to \u201cimmediate family\u201d in \u00a7 19 <em>(a) </em>(and in other sections of G. L. c. 268A), unless one were to treat the word \u201cnepotism\u201d as necessarily including only more distant relatives than parents, children, and siblings.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> One member of that commission, later the author of this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Graham </em>v. <em>McGrail, supra, </em>commented that \u201cif the compensation of a member of [a municipal employee\u2019s] \u2018immediate family\u2019 is in issue, Section 19 would seem to apply, contrary to the statement of the recess commission that nepotism is excluded from the criminal provisions and covered only by the code of ethics (Section 23).\u201d Braucher, Conflict of In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>terest in Massachusetts, in Perspectives of Law, Essays for Austin Wakeman Scott, 25 (1964). This comment anticipated the conclusion that Justice Braucher expressed for this court in the <em>Graham </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">4. We answer the six questions as follows: Question one \u2014 \u201cYes.\u201d The promotions of Patrick Schiavone to lieutenant and captain made by his brother were made in violation of G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 19. To questions two and three, we answer that the plaintiffs are not precluded from maintaining this action nor barred by loches. We answer questions four and five that the plaintiffs have standing to challenge the appointments of Patrick Schiavone to lieutenant and captain as those appointments bear on the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the appointment to the position of chief of police should be rescinded. In answer to question six, the ordinance adopted by the city council designating it as the appointing authority for the chief of police was a valid exercise of the city council\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">5. The remaining issues in this case, apparent from the record, concern the application of G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 21 <em>(a), </em>as appearing in St. 1962, c. 779, \u00a7 1. Section 21 <em>(a) </em>provides that a violation of the conflict of interest law (such as occurred in the promotion of Patrick Schiavone to the positions of lieutenant and captain) \u201cwhich has substantially influenced\u201d the action taken by the municipal agency (i.e., the city council appointing him chief of police) \u201cshall be grounds for avoiding, rescinding or cancelling the action on such terms as the interest of the municipality and innocent third persons require.\u201d A majority of this court believe that, on the record before us, as a matter of law the violations of \u00a7 21 <em>(a) </em>\u201csubstantially influenced\u201d the city council\u2019s action in appointing Patrick Schiavone to the position of chief of police. In any event, there are issues to be considered in the Superior Court beyond those submitted on this reservation and report. The case is remanded to the Superi- or Court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b956-11\"> The questions are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-12\">\u201c1.

The judge reported the case to the Appeals Court on October 22, 1981, and the record was assembled in November, 1981. No party filed an application for direct appellate review in this court. We transferred the case here in December, 1982, and heard oral argument in February of this year.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b959-9\"> Even if Alderman Schiavone\u2019s action in suggesting the amendment of the ordinance so that the city council could appoint his brother chief of police violated the conflict of interest law, a point the plaintiffs raise only as a possibility, the record does not show that such a violation, if it was one, \u201csubstantially influenced\u201d the action taken by the city council in amending the ordinance so as to justify invalidation of the ordinance under G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 21 <em>(a).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b960-7\"> General Laws c. 31, \u00a7 59, concerns who may take an examination, generally permitting only those in the next lower title in the force to take an examination for a promotional appointment, except where, because of a shortage of applicants for the examination, persons in still lower titles are permitted to participate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b961-7\"> Amendments to G.

L. c. 268A, \u00a7 21 <em>(a), </em>provides that \u201c[i]n addition to any other remedies provided by law,\u201d a violation of certain sections of G.

We concluded by stating that \u201cit may well be that parties such as the plaintiffs have the greatest incentive to uncover conflicts of interest and bring suit under \u00a7 21 <em>(a) </em>to enforce the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 539.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b964-6\"> Although the record does not explicitly so state, we assume that the salary of each successively higher position in the Lawrence police department was greater than the salary in the next lower position.
