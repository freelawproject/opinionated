Mclnerney. On November 18, 1971, a single justice entered an order suspending Mr. Mclnerney from the practice of law and specified that Mr. Mclnerney could not seek the termination of the order of suspension for at least one year. Mr. Mclnerney did not pursue his right of appeal from the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-15\">Following the order of suspension, evidence of additional improper conduct by Mr. Mclnerney came to light. Between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>1974 and 1977, a series of hearings was held before the single justice concerning these matters and to consider motions by Mr. Mclnerney to terminate his suspension. On September 25, 1981, the single justice filed a memorandum and findings of fact and ordered that a hearing be held concerning disposition. This hearing was held on March 8, 1982. At that time, a stipulation by the respondent and Bar Counsel was filed with the single justice containing a recommendation that Mr. Mclnerney be disbarred, effective May 16, 1977. Having received the stipulation and certain additional exhibits, the single justice entered a memorandum and order for judgment disbarring Mr. Mclnerney, effective May 27, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Mr. Mclnerney argues that the single justice abused his discretion and committed an error of law by making the order of disbarment effective May 27, 1982, rather than May 16, 1977.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have the memoranda and findings of fact filed by the single justice as the source of facts relevant to this appeal. We also have before us the stipulation filed by the parties, a transcript of the March 8, 1982, hearing, and various exhibits and documents. We affirm the judgment of the single justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">1. <em>Standard of Review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">We consider first the standard of review we shall apply to a decision of a single justice in a bar discipline matter in the circumstances of the instant case. We recently said, in a case involving the discipline of a lawyer who had been convicted of serious crimes, that \u201cthe full court, in reviewing any disciplinary decision, should inquire whether the judgment is markedly disparate from those ordinarily entered by the various single justices in similar cases.\u201d <em>Matter of Alter, ante </em>153, 156 (1983). That particular standard is of limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>usefulness here because the instant case presents circumstances which can be described only as unique.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Mr. Mclnerney argues that we should review the decision of the single justice to determine whether it is supported by sufficient evidence, constitutes an abuse of discretion, and is free from any error of law. For the purposes of deciding this case, we will apply this standard.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">2. <em>Misconduct Through and Including 1977.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Mr. Mclnerney argues that the single justice\u2019s decision constituted an abuse of discretion because disbarment, even if effective May 16, 1977, was an extreme and excessive penalty.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The thrust of this argument is that Mr. Mclnerney never committed an act serious enough to warrant disbarment. He also seeks to mitigate the seriousness of his actions during the period of his suspension by pointing out that before June 3, 1974,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> this court had not adopted explicit rules concerning the proper conduct of a suspended attorney. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>The flaw in Mr. Mclnerney\u2019s first point is that it fails to consider the totality of the circumstances. The single justice had before him a persistent and extended pattern of improper and unethical behavior by Mr. Mclnerney which was undeterred by the imposition of lesser sanctions. The various circumstances which occasioned Mr. Mclnerney\u2019s suspension, and the circumstances which followed his suspension, provided the single justice with more than sufficient evidence to conclude that Mr. Mclnerney\u2019s failure to meet the ethical obligations imposed on an attorney were neither isolated nor unintentional.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\"><em>Mr. Mclnerney\u2019s suspension in 1971. </em>Mr. Mclnerney was suspended for his part in the execution of a deed by Flora Hayden, an eighty year old woman who was under a conservatorship, conveying a parcel of land to Mr. Mclnerney\u2019s client, a stepson of Hayden. A judge of the Superior Court set aside the deed, stating that it had been \u201cprocured by undue influence exercised on (the grantor therein) by (the grantee) with the knowledge and participation of Mr. Mclnerney.\u201d After a hearing on the matter, the single justice entered the November 18, 1971, order suspending Mr. Mclnerney.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The single justice found that Flora Hayden had been under conservatorship by reason of mental weakness at all times since September 23, 1962. When Mr. Mclnerney spoke to her about the preparation of the deed, and when he procured the execution of the deed by her on September 5, 1965, at a nursing home, she did not have sufficient mental capacity to understand the nature, significance, effect, and consequences of the execution and delivery of the deed. She was incapable of transacting such business. At all times material to the case, Mr. Mclnerney knew the facts of the conservatorship of the grantor and knew of her lack of sufficient mental capacity to understand, execute, and deliver a deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">The flagrant nature of what the single justice referred to as Mr. Mclnerney\u2019s \u201cgross misconduct\u201d is shown in the findings of the single justice that between the date that Mr. Me<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Inerney first spoke to the grantor about preparing the deed and the date that he procured its execution, Mr. Inerney received written notice from the conservator about the grant- or\u2019s lack of mental capacity. Despite such knowledge, and despite the written notice from the conservator, Mr. Mclnerney prepared and caused the deed to be executed by the incompetent grantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\"><em>Other improper conduct. </em>At the October 2, 1975, hearing, evidence was presented concerning Mr. Mclnerney\u2019s dealings with Agnes and Ella O\u2019Connor, aged eighty-eight and eighty-six, respectively.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In June, 1975, Mr. Mclnerney assisted the O\u2019Connors in creating several joint bank accounts and joint ownership of certain securities. The single justice found Mr. Mclnerney\u2019s conduct improper in that his acts were akin to practicing law. Since the establishment of these joint accounts could produce results different from the testamentary schemes which the O\u2019Connors provided for in their wills, the single justice found that \u201c[tjhey were entitled to have the advice of a lawyer in good standing on the question of [the] impact of the new joint ownerships . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Also, in 1973 the full court referred to the single justice certain information about four cases in which this court had occasion to include words of sharp reproof for Mr. Mclnerney\u2019s misconduct. In <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>State Taxi, Inc., </em>336 Mass. 28, 30 (1957), the court stated that Mr. Mclnerney had made an \u201cimproper\u201d argument to a jury and court \u201cfar beyond permissible limits.\u201d In <em>McInerney </em>v. <em>Massasoit Greyhound Ass\u2019n, </em>359 Mass. 339, 348 (1971), we said that Mr. Mclnerney\u2019s \u201cevident wilful noncompliance with clear restrictions well known to him, and his arrangement of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>transaction with his client whereby she was also not to comply with them, are actions not becoming a lawyer.\u201d We also noted that Mr. Mclnerney\u2019s failure to disclose to the Probate Court his personal interest in the divorce settlement did \u201cnot commend itself to us,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 351, and that his fee agreement in the divorce matter constituted overreaching on his part. <em>Id. </em>at 354. The fee agreement was the basis for the subsequent action against Massasoit Greyhound Association. In <em>Leone </em>v. <em>Doran, 363 </em>Mass. 1, 19 (1973), we criticized in the strongest terms Mr. McInerney\u2019s \u201coverreaching and impermissible trial tactics,\u201d and in <em>Roddy </em>v. <em>Fleischman Distilling Sales Corp., </em>360 Mass. 623, 624-628 (1971), we commented upon the \u201cimpropriety\u201d of Mr. Mclnerney\u2019s distortion of the evidence by his use of a series of impermissible questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\"><em>Failure to comply with suspension. </em>During hearings held on July 10 and 11, 1974, October 2, 1975, January 2, 1977, and May 16, 1977, the single justice heard evidence demonstrating that Mr. Mclnerney had failed to comply with the order of suspension. Based on the evidence presented at the July, 1974, hearings, the single justice found that Mr. Mclnerney had held himself out as a lawyer in good standing, failed to inform his clients of his suspension, failed to withdraw his appearance in a pending case, solicited a fee improperly, failed to respond to repeated inquiries concerning matters entrusted to him, misrepresented that he was on \u201ca sabbatical from the law,\u201d failed to respond promptly to an inquiry from the Boston Bar Association concerning his professional conduct, permitted a client\u2019s case to be nonsuited for failure to answer interrogatories, caused other lawyers to enter an appearance to file interrogatories without the clients\u2019 consent or knowledge,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and transferred cases to other lawyers without the knowledge or consent of his clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>The later hearings revealed additional evidence of improper behavior.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> At the October 2, 1975, hearing, Mr. Mclnerney admitted that he still had sixteen active litigation files in his office, almost four years after he had been suspended. He had his counsel make representation to the single justice, however, that he had only then sent letters to the clients and attorneys of record in those cases informing them of his suspension, and that he was in the process of withdrawing his appearances in all pending cases. Yet, based on evidence presented at the January 2, 1977, hearing, the single justice found that Mr. Mclnerney had not withdrawn his appearance in a pending case until December 22, 1976. Further, based on evidence presented at the May 16, 1977, hearing, the single justice found that Mr. Mclnerney had not withdrawn his appearance in another case until after January 19, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">We do not need to review in further detail the persistent failure of Mr. Mclnerney to accept the consequences of his suspension. Mr. Mclnerney\u2019s claim that the absence of a specific rule governing the conduct of a suspended attorney excused his behavior is not responsive to the circumstances of this case. First, we doubt that even before 1974 a suspended attorney could conclude reasonably that he was entitled, as Mr. Mclnerney claims, to maintain \u201chis contact\u201d with cases in his office. Second, his failure to notify his clients and to withdraw his appearances extended at least through January 19,1977, long after the adoption of the bar discipline rules. In this regard, Mr. Mclnerney intentionally and wilfully violated the terms of his suspension and, further, misled the single justice on these matters. Third, Mr. Mclnerney engaged in improper behavior beyond failing to notify his clients and withdraw his appearances. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>actively misled his clients into believing that he had not been suspended; he neglected matters entrusted to him and allowed his clients to be nonsuited; he failed to respond to the obviously legitimate inquiries of his clients; he solicited other attorneys to enter appearances in cases, without the knowledge or consent of his clients.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Fourth, we agree with the single justice that Mr. Mclnerney\u2019s performance in the O\u2019Connor matter, even prior to 1977, was \u201cnot consistent with a good faith intent to recognize and comply with the natural consequences of his suspension as a lawyer.\u201d Mr. Mclnerney\u2019s conduct cannot be dismissed as stemming from the arguably uncertain scope of his duties as a suspended attorney before 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Thus, considering the circumstances up to 1977, we believe that disbarment would be an appropriate disposition. In any discipline case, the primary factor for our consideration \u201cis the effect upon, and perception of, the public and the bar.\u201d <em>Matter of Alter, ante </em>153, 156 (1983). <em>Matter of Keenan, </em>314 Mass. 544, 547 (1943). This is not a case where an attorney engaged in an isolated course of improper conduct and has recognized the wrongfulness of his actions. In cases such as this, disciplinary measures are necessary to deter future misconduct on the part of all members of the bar and to preserve public confidence in the bar. See <em>Matter of Alter, supra. </em>This case presented circumstances where disbarment would be appropriate as a prophylactic measure to prevent further misconduct by the offending individual. The record before the single justice clearly established Mr. Mclnerney\u2019s willingness to violate the terms of his suspension order and to mislead the court as to the nature and extent of his activities. It also establishes an abiding disregard for the interests of his clients. Disbar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>ment or discipline as of 1977, in addition to the original order of suspension, would have been neither extreme nor excessive. See <em>Matter of Alter, supra </em>at 156-157; <em>Matter of Osserman, </em>2 Mass. Att\u2019y Discipline Rep. 172 (1981); <em>Matter of Farrand, </em>2 Mass. Att\u2019y Discipline Rep. 71 (1981). Cf. <em>Matter of Sondej, </em>2 Mass. Att\u2019y Discipline Rep. 191 (1981) (minimum four-year suspension); <em>Matter of Sederman, </em>2 Mass. Att\u2019y Discipline Rep. 184 (1980) (minimum five-year suspension).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">3. <em>Misconduct and Improprieties After 1977.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Mr. Mclnerney\u2019s next contention is that the single justice committed an error of law by ordering that Mr. Mclnerney\u2019s disbarment be effective May 27, 1982, rather than on May 16, 1977. He argues that the evidence before the single justice did not warrant the conclusion that he engaged in improper acts after May 16, 1977. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">First, the single justice took judicial notice of the fact that Mr. Mclnerney continued to list himself as an attorney in the west suburban Roston telephone directory for 1980-1981 and 1981-1982.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Given the extensive evidence concerning Mr. Mclnerney\u2019s conduct in holding himself out as an attorney in good standing prior to 1977, the single justice was warranted in concluding that Mr. Mclnerney intended to hold himself out as a practicing attorney by listing himself as an attorney in the directory. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Imbruglia, </em>377 Mass. 682, 695-696 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">Mr. Mclnerney asks us to overlook the single justice\u2019s findings on this point by claiming that the single justice did not request any further explanation of the matter. After issuing his findings of fact in 1981, the single justice afforded the parties an opportunity to present evidence on any factual issue not already heard. If an explanation of the matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>was relevant, it was for Mr. Mclnerney to come forward with it. There is no cause to complain now.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Second, the single justice, in his memorandum of May 27, 1982, considered Mr. McInerney\u2019s handling of the affairs of Ella O\u2019Connor.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The facts regarding the matter are undisputed, and the question before the single justice turned on the conclusion which should be drawn from those facts. Between May, 1974, and November, 1980, Ella O\u2019Connor executed three wills and one codicil. These wills were drafted by an attorney who was recommended to Ella O\u2019Connor by Mr. McInerney. The first will made substantial provisions for several relatives and for Mr. McInerney. The subsequent wills contained provisions which were increasingly favorable to Mr. McInerney. The third will essentially left the bulk of the O\u2019Connor estate to Mr. McInerney, or his children, as a residuary legatee.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The single justice also inquired into certain inter vivas transfers of assets by Ella O\u2019Connor to herself and Mr. McInerney as joint tenants.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In 1980, two bank accounts were transferred to joint ownership, and most of the remaining assets were placed in joint ownership in June, 1981, about the time when Ella O\u2019Connor was moved from a nursing home in Norwood, Massachusetts, to one in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Mr. McInerney arranged to have Ella\u2019s bank accounts closed out and transferred to a joint account in a New Hampshire bank.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> After Ella O\u2019Connor\u2019s death in November, 1981, at age ninety-three, Mr. McInerney, as executor, reported to a New Hampshire Probate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Court that her estate consisted of personal property in the amount of $19,500, and that property held in joint tenancy in the amount of $372,485.98 passed to him as the surviving joint tenant.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Mr. McInerney listed his address as \u201cChester Rd., RFD 2, Derry, New Hampshire 03038.\u201d Ear Counsel stipulated that \u201cMr. McInerney represents that the joint assets . . . were placed in the joint names of Ms. O\u2019Connor and Mr. Mclnerney in order to facilitate Mr. McInerney in assisting Ms. O\u2019Connor in managing her fiscal affairs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Mr. Mclnerney\u2019s counsel admitted that the arrangement concerning the joint tenancies was unusual and had the effect of ensuring that any changes in O\u2019Connor\u2019s will would not reduce significantly the amount of the estate which would pass to Mr. Mclnerney. Further, Mr. Mclnerney\u2019s actions after O\u2019Connor\u2019s death were inconsistent with the assertion that the joint tenancies were created simply to facilitate the management of O\u2019Connor\u2019s affairs. As executor of the estate, he reported that all property held in joint tenancy had passed to him at the time of Ella O\u2019Con-nor\u2019s death and did not pass under her will. These undisputed facts warranted the conclusion that Mr. Mclnerney\u2019s actions were improper. As the single justice stated in his findings after the 1975 hearing, when the facts then known as to Mr. Mclnerney\u2019s dealings with Ella O\u2019Connor and her sister were revealed, \u201c[tjhey were entitled to have the advice of a lawyer in good standing on the question of [the] impact of the new joint ownerships . . . .\u201d We note that there is also a substantial question concerning Mr. Mclnerney\u2019s intentions in listing himself as a resident of New Hampshire. These circumstances, together with the cumulative evidence of Mr. Mclnerney\u2019s flouting of the order of suspension, provided sufficient support for the decision of the single justice to make the disbarment effective May 27, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>4. <em>Delay.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Mr. McInerney\u2019s final argument is that the single justice\u2019s delay in adjudicating this matter deprived him of due process of law and is an additional circumstance which we may consider. It is possible that the single justice could have acted with greater promptness. Yet a large share of the responsibility for the length of these proceedings falls squarely on Mr. McInerney. Had he complied with the terms of his suspension, these proceedings would have been concluded in a timely fashion. While we have considered the delay which has accompanied these proceedings, we do not find that this factor alone requires us to overturn the decision of the single justice. We note that none of the mitigating circumstances listed in the <em>Alter </em>case are present here. See <em>Matter of Alter, supra </em>at 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">We need not decide whether the single justice\u2019s actions constituted a deprivation of due process. Mr. Mclnerney never raised this issue before the single justice and therefore has not preserved his right to argue the point here. We note that Mr. Mclnerney\u2019s counsel never suggested, during the hearing on disposition, that constitutional principles would be violated if the single justice did not accept the recommendation of the parties to make the disbarment effective on May 16, 1977.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b545-8\"> If the disbarment were made effective May 16, 1977, Mr. McInerney would now be eligible to apply for readmission to the bar.

Thus, we note that prior decisions of the single justices reveal that various acts of misconduct of the same type which are the subject of these proceedings have been viewed with extreme disfavor. See, e.g., <em>Matter of Sondej, </em>2 Mass. Att\u2019y Discipline Rep. 191 (1981) (consistent pattern of neglect and dishonesty in dealings had serious adverse implications regarding attorney\u2019s fitness to practice law); <em>Matter of Farrand, </em>2 Mass. Att\u2019y Discipline Rep. 71 (1981) (neglect of a legal matter entrusted to attorney together with other misconduct warranted disbarment); <em>Matter of Barkin, 2 </em>Mass. Att\u2019y Discipline Rep. 9, 10 (1980) (practice of law while under an order of suspension is a serious misstep).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b546-9\"> Mr. Mclnerney does not argue that we should apply a stricter standard of review or that we should review the single justice\u2019s decision de nova. He has waived, therefore, those claims. Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 919 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b546-10\"> This argument is made despite the stipulation that disbarment as of May 16, 1977, would be an appropriate disposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b546-11\"> On June 3, 1974, this court promulgated S.J.C.

The rule became effective on September 1, 1974. 365 Mass. at 696.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b548-7\"> As will be seen, <em>infra, </em>the single justice during the 1982 proceedings which resulted in the order of disbarment reconsidered the O\u2019Connor matter in light of significant facts which occurred after 1975.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b548-8\"> The single justice also found that Mr. McInerney represented himself wrongfully to be a lawyer to staff members at Deaconess Hospital during his visits to Agnes O\u2019Connor in May, 1975. He also noted that Mr. Mclnerney failed to inform his counsel, Bar Counsel, or the court that Agnes O\u2019Connor had died during the course of the bar discipline hearings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b549-6\"> It also appears that Mr. McInerney did not consult with his clients concerning the content of the answers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b550-6\"> At the May 16,1977, hearing, evidence similar to that presented at the July, 1974, hearings was introduced. The single justice found that in another case Mr. McInerney had misrepresented his status as a lawyer, permitted a case to be nonsuited, maintained that the case was pending, and arranged to have another attorney enter an appearance without the knowledge and consent of his client.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b551-6\"> Mr. McInerney\u2019s conduct is similar to that which led to the disbarment of an attorney in <em>Office of Disciplinary Counsel </em>v. <em>Herman, </em>493 Pa. 267, 271 (1981). The unauthorized practice of law has been found to be adequate grounds for disbarment in other jurisdictions. See <em>Florida Bar </em>v. <em>Hartnett, </em>398 So. 2d 1352 (Fla. 1981); <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Bucci, </em>R.I. (1982) (442 A.2d 865 [R.I. 1982]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b552-9\"> We note that the decisions from other jurisdictions hold \u201cthat unauthorized practice of law includes the mere holding out by a disbarred attorney that he is practicing or is entitled to practice law.\u201d <em>Matter of Peterson, </em>274 N.W.2d 922, 926 (Minn. 1979). See <em>Farnham </em>v. <em>State Bar of Cal., </em>17 Cal. 3d 605 (1976). Such acts would be a sufficient basis for a judgment of disbarment.
