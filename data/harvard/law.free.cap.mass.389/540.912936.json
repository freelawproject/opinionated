Breese was convicted of murder in the first degree on February 1, 1979, after being tried on theories of deliberate premeditation and extreme atrocity or cruelty. We affirmed the conviction in a decision rendered June 26, 1980. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Breese, </em>381 Mass. 13 (1980). Breese now appeals from the denial of his motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>for a new trial, filed after rescript. See G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. He argues that the trial judge erred in instructing the jury that they should not consider evidence of the defendant\u2019s intoxication in determining whether the murder was committed with extreme atrocity or cruelty. Since the challenged instructions accurately reflected the law as revealed by our decisions prior to Breese\u2019s trial, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monsen, </em>377 Mass. 245, 254 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Appleby, </em>358 Mass. 407, 415-416 &amp; n.5 (1970), the validity of Breese\u2019s claim of error depends on whether our holding in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>385 Mass. 639, 648-649 (1982), applies retroactively to his trial. In <em>Perry, </em>which was decided more than three years after Breese\u2019s trial, we held that the jury must be permitted to consider the defendant\u2019s intoxication in determining whether he murdered with extreme atrocity or cruelty. <em>Id. </em>There was evidence that Breese was intoxicated at the time of the killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">We hold that <em>Perry </em>is the law only in cases tried after our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>380 Mass. 672 (1980). Since Breese was tried before <em>Gould </em>was decided, the judge\u2019s instructions on extreme atrocity or cruelty were not erroneous. Finding no error, we affirm the denial of Breese\u2019s motion for a new trial. The defendant\u2019s appeal does not bring to the court \u201cthe whole case for its consideration of the law and the evidence.\u201d G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, as amended through St. 1979, c. 346, \u00a7 2. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>381 Mass. 141, 146 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harrington, </em>379 Mass. 446, 448 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nolin, </em>373 Mass. 45, 52 (1977). Consequently, we do not inquire whether, even in the absence of error, justice requires a new trial or the entry of a verdict of a lesser degree of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">In deciding whether <em>Perry </em>is retroactive, we first must resolve whether the decision announced a new rule. Decisional law usually is retroactive. When a decision announces a new rule, however, the issue arises whether it will be applied only prospectively. The issue is resolved by the application of a three-part test which we discuss later in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>opinion. That test is not triggered, however, unless the rule announced is new. The requirement of newness has been stated in various ways. In <em>Chevron Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Huson, </em>404 U.S. 97, 106 (1971), the Supreme Court declared that in order for one of its decisions \u201cto be applied nonretroactively [it] must establish a new principle of law, either by overruling clear past precedent on which litigants may have relied ... or by deciding an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed <em>. . . .\u201d </em>See <em>Desist </em>v. <em>United States, </em>394 U.S. 244, 248 (1969) (for decision to be applied prospectively only, it must be \u201ca clear break with the past\u201d); <em>Hanover Shoe, Inc. </em>v. <em>United Shoe Mach. Corp., </em>392 U.S. 481, 499 (1968) (question of nonretroactive application of decision not presented unless decision \u201cconstitute[d] a sharp break in the line of earlier authority or an avulsive change which caused the current of the law thereafter to flow between new banks\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\"><em>Perry </em>did not announce a new rule. The decision was \u201cclearly foreshadowed\u201d by <em>Gould. </em>In <em>Gould, supra </em>at 684-685, we reasoned that, \u201cif a malicious mind may be considered as evidence that a defendant committed a murder with extreme atrocity or cruelty, then fairness requires that an impaired mind may also be considered as evidence bearing on whether or not the defendant committed the murder with extreme atrocity or cruelty.\u201d We reasoned further that \u201c[t]he jurors\u2019 broad discretion [in determining whether a murder was committed with extreme atrocity or cruelty] will more accurately reflect the community\u2019s conscience, goals, and norms, if the jurors are . . . permitted to consider the defendant\u2019s peculiar mental state . ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 685. Finally, we remarked that \u201c[i]mpairment of a defendant\u2019s ability to make a decision in a normal manner may have a direct bearing on the degree of murder, and consequently, on the issue of extreme atrocity or cruelty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 686. In <em>Perry, </em>we recognized that a defendant\u2019s mental state may be affected by intoxication as well as by mental illness. Our holding that the jury must be permitted to consider the defendant\u2019s intoxication in determining his degree of culpability was based exclusively on <em>Gould.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Since <em>Perry </em>did not announce a new rule, but was clearly foreshadowed by <em>Gould, </em>we hold that the law as stated in <em>Perry </em>applies retroactively to all trials conducted after the date of the <em>Gould </em>decision. See <em>Whitinsville Plaza, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kotseas, 378 </em>Mass. 85, 97-98 (1979). Reaching this conclusion, however, does not help Breese, who was tried before <em>Gould </em>was decided. Consequently, we must consider whether <em>Perry </em>is retroactive to cases tried prior to <em>Gould. </em>In making this determination, we consider whether <em>Gould </em>is retroactive. <em>Perry </em>was a mere application of principles set forth in <em>Gould. </em>The issue of their retroactive effect should be resolved consistently.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">In determining whether <em>Gould </em>is retroactive, we first examine the opinion. In <em>Gould, </em>we reversed the first degree murder conviction of a mentally impaired defendant who had been tried under a theory of extreme atrocity or cruelty. We did so, not because the judge\u2019s instructions on extreme atrocity or cruelty were erroneous, but pursuant to our duty under G.L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, \u201cto consider broadly the whole case on the law and the facts to determine whether the verdict is \u2018consonant with justice.\u2019\u201d <em>Gould, </em>380 Mass. at 680, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>380 Mass. 1, 15 n.20 (1980). We noted that \u201cGeneral Laws c. 278, \u00a7 33E, \u2018operates as a type of \u201csafety valve\u201d by ensuring review as to all aspects of cases regardless of the absence of claim of error.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>376 Mass. 156, 168 (1978).\u201d <em>Gould, supra, </em>quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>380 Mass. 30, 38-39 (1980). Thus, theprin\u201eiple that a defendant is entitled to have the jury consider his mental impairment on the issue of extreme atrocity or cruelty was not applied retroactively even to Gould.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">In five direct appeals argued subsequent to <em>Gould, </em>defendants convicted prior to <em>Gould </em>sought either a reversal or a modification of their convictions on the ground that the instructions at their trials on deliberate premeditation or extreme atrocity or cruelty were not consistent with the principles announced in <em>Gould. </em>In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cunneen, ante </em>216 (1983), <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, 387 </em>Mass. 220, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>225-227 (1982), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shelley, </em>381 Mass. 340, 354-355 (1980), the defendants did not assert that the failure to give instructions consistent with <em>Gould </em>was error. Instead, the defendants sought relief only under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. As a consequence, the question whether <em>Gould </em>was retroactive was not presented. We reviewed the defendants\u2019 claims only to determine whether the verdicts were consonant with justice, using the facts of <em>Gould </em>as a benchmark. We concluded in those cases that, since the evidence of mental impairment was weaker than it was in <em>Gould, </em>the judges\u2019 failure to instruct the jury in terms consistent with <em>Gould </em>created no likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. Those cases shed no light on the retroactivity of <em>Gould. </em>In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>386 Mass. 17, 32-33 (1982), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chubbuck, </em>384 Mass. 746, 756-757 (1981), the defendants asserted that the failure to give jury instructions in accordance with <em>Gould </em>was error, and requested relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. We did not apply <em>Gould </em>retroactively, and we denied relief under c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">We have never given retroactive effect to <em>Gould. </em>This case requires us to decide whether the law as stated in <em>Gould </em>applies retroactively to the defendant\u2019s trial. If <em>Gould </em>is retroactive to any date before it was decided, it must be retroactive to all trials that took place on or after that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">As the first step in our analysis, we consider whether <em>Gould, </em>in holding that the jury may consider a defendant\u2019s mental illness in determining whether a murder was committed with extreme atrocity or cruelty, announced a new rule. Prior to <em>Gould, </em>the court long had held that neither specific intent nor a knowledge of the nature of one\u2019s acts was necessary for conviction of murder with extreme atrocity or cruelty. In 1858, the Legislature classified the three types of murder in the first degree in language substantially the same as that now appearing in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 1. See St. 1858, c. 154, \u00a7 1. Two years later, this court held that proof of murder committed \u201cwith extreme atrocity or cruel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>ty\u201d did not require proof of premeditation. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Desmarteau, </em>16 Gray 1, 9-10 (1860).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>165 Mass. 45 (1895), the court considered in more detail the state of mind required for conviction of murder with extreme atrocity or cruelty. It concluded: \u201cKnowledge that the crime was extremely atrocious or cruel is not required. . . . [T]he statute providing that murder committed with extreme atrocity or cruelty is murder in the first degree calls for no greater degree of knowledge than is required for a conviction of murder in the second degree. . . . [T]he requirement of deliberate premeditation clearly is not attached to murder committed with extreme atrocity or cruelty; nor is any degree of purpose, intention, or knowledge, beyond what is involved in the commission of murder with malice aforethought. ... A murder committed with malice aforethought may be found to have been committed with extreme atrocity or cruelty, even though the murderer did not know that his act was extremely atrocious or cruel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 58-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The court\u2019s conclusions in <em>Gilbert </em>were echoed by decisions in the decade preceding <em>Gould. </em>In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Appleby, </em>358 Mass. 407 (1970), the court said: \u201cIt is not necessary ... to show that [murder with extreme] atrocity or cruelty was premeditated or that the defendant knew his conduct constituted extreme atrocity or cruelty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 415. The court held that evidence of the defendant\u2019s intoxication was not admissible on the issue of extreme atrocity or cruelty because the intent to be cruel was not relevant. <em>Id. </em>at 416 &amp; n.5. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Golston, </em>373 Mass. 249, 260 (1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1039 (1978), the court stated: \u201cThere is no requirement that the defendant know that his act was extremely atrocious or cruel, and no requirement of deliberate premeditation.\u201d Finally, in Commonwealth v. <em>Monsen, 377 </em>Mass. 245 (1979), the court observed: \u201cTo import a mens rea requirement into the words \u2018extreme atrocity or cruelty\u2019 would be to blur the distinction between that form of murder in the first degree and the premeditated variety. . . . Although the inference that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>the actor possesses a particularly brutal state of mind might be warranted by the objective circumstances of the killing, no such inference is necessary in order to convict. . . . Once malice . . . [is] shown, we need look only to objective evidence of extreme atrocity or cruelty to support a conviction . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 254-255.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">In addition to discussing the nature of the crime,'the court in decisions rendered prior to <em>Gould </em>detailed certain factors the jury were permitted to consider in determining whether a murder was committed with extreme atrocity or cruelty. These factors reflected the court\u2019s view that the defendant\u2019s guilt was to be determined by objective criteria, not focusing on the defendant\u2019s mental state. The jury were permitted to consider the consciousness and degree of suffering of the victim, the disproportion between the means actually needed to inflict death and those employed, the instrumentalities employed, and the extent of the physical injury or indignities inflicted. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>380 Mass. at 686 n.16; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cadwell, </em>374 Mass. 308, 318 (1978). Thus, the inquiry as to whether the murder was committed with extreme atrocity or cruelty \u201cfocuse[d] both on the defendant\u2019s actions, in terms of the manner and means of inflicting death, and on the resulting effect on the victim.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gould, supra </em>at 684, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lacy, </em>371 Mass. 363, 367 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">In <em>Gould, </em>the court concluded that the jury should no longer be \u201crestricted to considering only the defendant\u2019s course of action, but [should be] permitted to consider the defendant\u2019s peculiar mental state as an additional factor to be weighed in determining whether the murder was committed with extreme atrocity or cruelty.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gould, supra </em>at 685-686. This ruling was a \u201cclear break with the past,\u201d representing a major change in Massachusetts law. Accordingly, we consider whether <em>Gould </em>should apply only prospectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">We look to decisions of the United States Supreme Court for guidance in determining whether a new rule affecting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>the rights of criminal defendants should be applied only prospectively. We begin by noting that the Supreme Court has not distinguished between constitutional and non-constitutional decisions in addressing the question of retro-activity. In <em>Linkletter </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>381 U.S. 618 (1965), the Supreme Court for the first time denied retroactive effect to a decision announcing a new principle of constitutional law. In developing a doctrinal basis for its holding that the rule it announced in <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643 (1961), applied prospectively only, the Court in <em>Linkletter </em>drew from cases \u201cdealfing] with the invalidity of statutes or the effect of a decision overturning long-established common-law rules.\u201d 381 U.S. at 628. The Court concluded: \u201c[T]here seems to be no impediment \u2014 constitutional or philosophical \u2014 to the use of the same rule in the constitutional area where the exigencies of the situation require such an application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The clear implication of the Court\u2019s reasoning is that the same principles should govern the determination of the retroactive effect of constitutional and nonconstitutional decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">In <em>Halliday </em>v. <em>United States, </em>394 U.S. 831 (1969), the Court expressly adopted this reading of <em>Linkletter. </em>At issue in <em>Halliday </em>was whether the Court\u2019s holding in <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>United States, </em>394 U.S. 459 (1969), should apply retroactively. <em>Halliday, supra </em>at 831. In <em>McCarthy, supra </em>at 463-464, the Court held that, when a defendant\u2019s guilty plea is accepted in violation of Fed. R. Crim. P. 11, the defendant must be allowed to plead anew. <em>Halliday, supra. </em>The Court in <em>Halliday </em>stated: \u201cIn <em>McCarthy </em>we took care to note that our holding was based solely upon the application of rule 11 and not upon constitutional grounds. Nevertheless, it is appropriate to analyze the question of that decision\u2019s retroactivity in terms of the same criteria we have employed to determine whether constitutionally grounded decisions that depart from precedent should be applied retroactively. See <em>Linkletter </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>381 U.S. 618, 622-629 (1965).\u201d 394 U.S. at 832. See also <em>Chevron Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Huson, </em>404 U.S. 97, 105-107, where the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>stated that the test for determining the retroactivity of decisions announcing new constitutional rules of criminal procedure applied to civil, nonconstitutional decisions as well. We adopt the approach of the Supreme Court. In our view, it is not significant that the rule in <em>Gould </em>was not constitutionally compelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">To decide whether <em>Gould </em>applies retroactively to trials conducted prior to the date of that decision, we employ a test which \u201ccontemplates the consideration of three criteria: \u2018(a) the purpose to be served by the new standards, (b) the extent of the reliance by law enforcement authorities on the old standards, and (c) the effect on the administration of justice of a retroactive application of the new standards.\u2019 <em>Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>388 U.S. 293, 297 (1967).\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>447 U.S. 323, 328 (1980) (plurality opinion of Brennan, J.). \u201cForemost among these factors is the purpose to be served by the new . . . rule.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Desist </em>v. <em>United States, </em>394 U.S. 244, 249 (1969). \u201cWhere the major purpose of new . . . doctrine is to overcome an aspect of the criminal trial that substantially impairs its truth-finding function and so raises serious questions about the accuracy of guilty verdicts in past trials, the new rule [is] given complete retroactive effect. Neither good-faith reliance by state or federal authorities on prior . . . law or accepted practice, nor severe impact on the administration of justice ... require^] prospective application in these circumstances.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Louisiana, supra, </em>quoting <em>Williams </em>v. <em>United States, </em>401 U.S. 646, 653 (1971) (plurality opinion of White, J.). Accord <em>Hankerson </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>432 U.S. 233, 243 (1977); <em>Gosa </em>v. <em>Mayden, </em>413 U.S. 665, 679 (1973) (plurality opinion of Blackmun, J.); <em>Ivan V. </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>407 U.S. 203, 204 (1972). Reliance on the old rule by law enforcement authorities and the impact retroactivity would have on the administration of justice are controlling \u201conly when the purpose of the rule in question [does] not clearly favor either retroactivity or prospectivity.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Louisiana, supra, </em>quoting from <em>Desist </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>The threshold question in this case is whether the major purpose of the rule announced in <em>Gould </em>was to overcome an aspect of the criminal trial that substantially impaired its truth-finding function and so raises serious questions about the accuracy of guilty verdicts in past trials. In making this inquiry, we bear in mind that the extent to which a practice infects the integrity of the truth-determining process of trial \u201cis necessarily a matter of degree.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>384 U.S. 719, 729 (1966). See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Louisiana, supra </em>at 328, 329 n.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">In <em>Reddick </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>381 Mass. 398, 400-401 (1980), we observed that the Supreme Court has given full retroactive effect to newly created constitutional rules involving the reasonable doubt standard of proof in criminal trials <em>(Ivan V. </em>v. <em>City of New York, supra; Hankerson </em>v. <em>North Carolina, supra), </em>an indigent\u2019s right to the advice of counsel at trial <em>(Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335 [1963] ), and an accused\u2019s right to exclude an involuntary confession from trial <em>(Jackson </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>378 U.S. 368 [1964] ). Those rules go to the heart of the fact-finding process. <em>Gould, </em>on the other hand, established only that a defendant\u2019s impaired mind may be considered as one factor among many in determining extreme atrocity or cruelty. <em>Gould, </em>380 Mass. at 683-684 &amp; n.14, 685-686 &amp; n.16. <em>Gould </em>did not add a new element to the crime of murder committed with extreme atrocity or cruelty. After <em>Gould, </em>malice aforethought remains the only requisite mental element for that crime. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cunneen, ante </em>216, 227 (1983). Failure on the part of juries to consider mental impairment as one of the factors bearing on extreme atrocity or cruelty does not constitute so substantial an impairment of the truth-finding function as to raise serious questions about the accuracy of guilty verdicts in trials before <em>Gould. </em>Therefore, the purpose of the new rule expressed in <em>Gould </em>favors its application prospectively only.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">Reliance on the old rule by law enforcement authorities and the impact retroactivity would have on the administration of justice also support the application of <em>Gould </em>prospec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>lively only.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Since the rule established by <em>Gould </em>was a \u201cclear break with the past,\u201d reliance by the Commonwealth on <em>pre-Gould </em>standards was justified. In addition, although we cannot predict how many defendants convicted before <em>Gould </em>of murder in the first degree on the basis of extreme atrocity or cruelty would seek to attack their convictions on the ground that the trial judge erred in failing to instruct the jury in accordance with <em>Gould, </em>we are confident that the number of such attacks and resulting appeals and retrials would be enough to burden substantially the administration of criminal justice in the Commonwealth. We conclude that <em>Gould </em>is not retroactive. Consequently, we also conclude that <em>Perry </em>is not retroactive beyond the date of <em>Gould.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">We summarize as follows. The question before the court is whether the judge at Breese\u2019s trial committed error by instructing the jury that they should not consider Breese\u2019s intoxication in determining whether Breese murdered with extreme atrocity or cruelty. The answer depends on whether <em>Perry </em>is retroactive to Breese\u2019s trial, that is, whether the law as stated in <em>Perry </em>was the law at the time of Breese\u2019s trial. Since <em>Perry </em>did not announce a new rule, but was clearly foreshadowed by <em>Gould, </em>our holding in <em>Perry </em>applies retroactively to trials conducted after <em>Gould. Perry </em>is not retroactive to trials conducted prior to <em>Gould, </em>however, since <em>Gould </em>itself is not retroactive. Breese was tried be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>fore the <em>Gould </em>decision. Consequently, the rule expressed in <em>Perry </em>was not the law at his trial, and there was no error in the judge\u2019s instructions on extreme atrocity or cruelty.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">\n<em>Order denying motion for a new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b566-6\"> Compare <em>Diaz </em>v. <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>364 Mass. 153, 167-168 (1973), a civil case overruling precedent by holding that either spouse may recover from a third party for loss of consortium arising from personal injury of the other spouse caused by the negligence of the third party.
