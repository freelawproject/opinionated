Busny, trustee (taxpayer), appeals pursuant to G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13, from a decision of the Appellate Tax Board (board) upholding the refusal of the board of assessors of Boston (assessors) to abate real estate taxes assessed on the taxpayer\u2019s property for fiscal year 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-12\">On January 1, 1979, the assessment date for fiscal year 1980, see G. L. c. 59, \u00a7\u00a7 11, 21, 38, the taxpayer owned a parcel of real estate at 33 Broad Street, Boston. An eleven-story commercial building stood on the parcel, which measured approximately 3,680 square feet. The assessors valued the property at $320,000, and assessed a tax thereon in the amount of $80,928, based on a rate of $252.90 per thousand dollars of value. The taxpayer\u2019s application for an abatement of the tax was denied by the assessors, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>the taxpayer appealed to the board. After a hearing, the board issued a decision for the assessors, and thereafter issued its findings of fact and report.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The taxpayer\u2019s contention before the board and before this court is that the assessed value of the property for fiscal year 1980 was excessive. In support of this claim, the taxpayer introduced at the hearing before the board a copy of a decision of the board which granted the taxpayer an abatement of taxes assessed on the property for fiscal year 1979. The abatement was granted because the taxpayer\u2019s property had been assessed at a higher percentage of fair cash value than had other classes of property in the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The board calculated the taxpayer\u2019s abatement for fiscal year 1979 by determining the fair cash value of the taxpayer\u2019s property, and then reducing that value to 22.4%, which was the percentage of fair cash value at which the most favored class of property had been assessed. See <em>Keniston </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>380 Mass. 888, 906 (1980); <em>Tregor </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>377 Mass. 602, 602, 609-612, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 841 (1979); <em>Assessors of Weymouth </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>375 Mass. 493, 501 (1978); <em>Shoppers\u2019 World, Inc. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Framingham, </em>348 Mass. 366, 377-378 n.10 (1965) (dictum).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The fair cash value of the property as determined by the board was $346,784. The property\u2019s value as adjusted for disproportionate assessment was $77,680. In its fiscal year 1980 appeal, the taxpayer simply rested on the board\u2019s determination of the property\u2019s value for fiscal year 1979, and introduced no additional evidence of value.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">As in <em>Beal </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, ante </em>648 (1983), also decided today, the taxpayer\u2019s appeal is grounded on the contention that G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 12A, inserted by St. 1943, c. 430, applies to this case,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that, consequently, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>assessors had the burden of satisfying the board that the assessed value of the property was warranted. The taxpayer contends that that burden was not satisfied. The taxpayer concedes that if \u00a7 12A does not apply, his appeal must fail. This is because, in appeals to which \u00a7 12A does not apply, \u201cthe taxpayer bears the burden of proof on the issue of overvaluation.\u201d <em>Foxboro Assocs. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Foxborough, </em>385 Mass. 679, 684 (1982). The taxpayer in this case presented no evidence of overvaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">In <em>Beal, supra, </em>we ruled that G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 12A, inserted by St. 1943, c. 430, applies only to those cases in which the assessed value of the taxpayer\u2019s property is greater than the board\u2019s unadjusted determination of the property\u2019s value during the three-year period described by \u00a7 12A. Section 12A does not apply to the taxpayer\u2019s appeal because the assessed value of the property was $320,000, and the board\u2019s prior unadjusted determination of value was $346,784. Consequently, the taxpayer\u2019s appeal must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The decision of the Appellate Tax Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b671-8\"> For fiscal years 1980-1983, see G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 14; St. 1979, c. 797, \u00a7 24; <em>Keniston </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, supra </em>at 888, 890, 891-892 &amp; nn. 5 &amp; 6, 904, 905-906 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b671-9\"> The statute provides in pertinent part: \u201cIf, at a hearing of an appeal relative to the assessed value of property brought within three years after a determination by the appellate tax board of the value thereof, it appears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>that the assessed value is greater than the value as so determined, the burden shall be on the appellee [assessors] to satisfy the board that the increased value was warranted . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">Section 12A was amended by St. 1978, c. 580, \u00a7 13. As amended, \u00a7 12A applies to property taxes assessed for fiscal year 1981. St. 1978, c. 580, \u00a7 40, as amended by St. 1979, c. 578, \u00a7 2. Since the taxpayer\u2019s appeal relates to property taxes assessed for fiscal year 1980, we construe G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 12A, as it read prior to the 1978 amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
