The decision was affirmed by a judge of a District Court. Pursuant to G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 42, this case came here for direct review with a report from that judge. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">We summarize the facts as found by the board.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The claimant was employed by J. P. Gillig (employer) as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>management trainee from December 23, 1979, through February 10. 1980. During that time, she earned $200 a week based on fifty hours of work. As a management trainee, one of the conditions of her employment was \u201cto be available at all times for all shifts.\u201d The job\u2019s early shift begins at 5 a.m. The claimant had expressed her reluctance to work the early shift, although she had done so on occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">In early 1980, the employer closed one of his restaurants, and consolidated the management trainees at another restaurant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The employer was also forced to reduce the management staff and to ensure that all the trainees would be available for all shifts. Because the claimant stated her dislike of working at the early hour at which the early shift began, her job was terminated. The board adopted the director\u2019s finding that the claimant\u2019s \u201cunwillingness to [begin work early] was a matter of preference and the claimant could have continued in employment if she had been willing to work the early shift.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">After a hearing, the director decided that the claimant had left work voluntarily and without compelling reasons or \u201cgood cause attributable to the employing unit,\u201d as required by G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25(e)(1). The Director therefore denied benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">The board reversed that decision, finding as a matter of law that the early shift was \u201cunsuitable\u201d employment within the meaning of G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25(c) (4), as amended through St. 1968, c. 323, \u00a7 5, which states in pertinent part: \u201cNo work shall be deemed suitable, and benefits shall not be denied under this, chapter to any otherwise eligible individual for refusing to accept new work under any of the following conditions: ... (4) If in the case of a female the acceptance of such work would require her to work between the hours of twelve midnight and six o\u2019clock ante <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>meridian.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, the board determined that her refusal of work and voluntary leaving was with good cause attributable to the employing unit. The board found her to be \u201centitled to benefits if otherwise eligible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">When the employer applied to the District Court for judicial review of the board\u2019s decision, the judge determined that the employer had no standing to challenge the validity of G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25(c)(4), on the ground that it constitutes unlawful sex discrimination, because the employer did not suffer such discrimination. In his appeal to this court, the employer asserts that he has standing as a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d by the decision; that G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25(c)(4) applies only if \u201cnew work\u201d was offered to the claimant, a fact not supported by the record; and that \u00a7 25(c)(4) is invalid and unenforceable as a disparate employment condition based on sex. We conclude that no new work was involved, and therefore it was error to award the claimant benefits.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus we do not reach the other issues raised by the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">General Laws c. 151A, \u00a7 25(c), denies unemployment benefits to those employees who fail \u201cwithout good cause, to apply for suitable employment.\u201d Suitable employment is assessed by taking into consideration various statutory criteria, as well as all of the attendant circumstances. See <em>Graves </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>384 Mass. 766, 768 (1981); <em>Pacific Mills </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>322 Mass. 345, 350 (1948). Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>25 (c) goes on to state that \u201cbenefits shall not be denied . . . for refusing to accept new work\u201d in four statutorily defined categories of jobs which are to be considered per se unsuitable for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">In this case, the board determined that the work offered to the claimant was unsuitable under G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25(c) (4). In so doing, the board ignored the statutory requirement that \u201cnew work\u201d must be involved in order for that section of the statute to be applied. \u201cIt is a well established principle of statutory interpretation that \u2018[n]one of the words of a statute is to be regarded as superfluous, but each is to be given its ordinary meaning without overemphasizing its effect upon the other terms appearing in the statute, so that the enactment considered as a whole shall constitute a consistent and harmonious statutory provision capable of effectuating the presumed intention of the Legislature.\u2019\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Auth., </em>352 Mass. 617, 618 (1967), quoting <em>Bolster </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation, </em>319 Mass. 81, 84-85 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The board failed to apply this principle, and gave no meaning to the words \u201cnew work.\u201d Since the Legislature has mandated that \u201cnew work\u201d is essential for the.application of G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25(c)(4), the board erred in granting benefits, disregarding that requirement. Further, this construction brings our statute into compliance with Federal law, which prohibits States from denying benefits to \u201cany otherwise eligible individual for refusing to accept new work\u201d in similar situations. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3304(a)(5) (1976).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In addition, other States with similar statutes have determined \u201cnew work\u201d to be an essential condition for application of the rule. See <em>Campos </em>v. <em>California Employment Dev. Dep\u2019t, </em>132 Cal. App. 3d 961 (1982); <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Top O\u2019Michigan Rural Elec. Co., </em>118 Mich. App. 275, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>282-283 (1982); <em>Cointreau, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Board of Review, </em>171 N.J. Super. 407, 411 (1979); <em>Texas Employment Comm\u2019n v. E-Systems, Inc., </em>540 S.W.2d 761 (Tex. Civ. App. 1976).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">In this case before us, the board found, and it is undisputed, that the shift declined by the claimant was a shift which she was required to be available to work, and which she had worked in the past. Since work on that shift was a true condition of her employment, the change in shifts was not an offer of new work, as required for the automatic application of G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25(c)(4). As the facts were uncontested, the board erred as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Although the claimant was not entitled to benefits under \u00a7 25(c) (4), her job nevertheless could have been deemed to be unsuitable by the board on other grounds, if they existed. However, as the claimant raised no objections to the early shift other than her preference not to work so early, there was no other basis on which the board could have granted relief. See <em>Graves </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>384 Mass. 766, 767 (1981); <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>376 Mass. 551, 556 (1978). The claimant also failed to assert any \u201cgood cause\u201d to decline the early shift, which might have included \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d such as those discussed in <em>Manias </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., 388 </em>Mass. 201 (1983), or <em>Conlon </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>382 Mass. 19, 22 (1980). Such reasons are deemed to be significant factors for the board to consider in a decision to grant or deny benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Although the board erroneously applied G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25(c)(4), to the claimant\u2019s request for benefits, the board adopted the findings and conclusions of the review examiner in every other respect. Thus, we reverse the judgment below and remand for entry of judgment denying benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b499-14\"> The board adopted the findings of the review examiner, but differed with the review examiner\u2019s legal conclusion on the interpretation of G.

L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25(c)(4). An employer usually has standing to challenge board decisions from \u201cthe fact that the amount of its contributions to the unemployment compensation fund is affected by the amount of unemployment benefits paid to its employees who are laid off.\u201d <em>Pacific Mills </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>322 Mass. 345, 346 (1948). See G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 14(d)(3). In his brief, the Director of the Division of Employment Security estimates the employer\u2019s liability to be approximately $152.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b502-7\"> The Commonwealth must comply with the Federal statute \u201cto qualify for Federal certification.\u201d See <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec. </em>v. <em>Roman Catholic Bishop, </em>383 Mass. 501, 503 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b503-9\"> We have already implicitly recognized this interpretation of the section.
