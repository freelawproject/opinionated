Richardson </em>suggested that a civil action had been commenced by <em>Brown </em>against these defendants for the same assault and batter, which was now pending, and he moved the Court that this indictment be continued until the civil action should be decided.</p><p id=\"b336-10\"><em>The Attorney-General </em>observed that there was no ground for a continuance, unless the party injured was to be used as a witness for the government, upon the trial of the indictment, which was not intended in this case; and he said that this point was so ruled by the Chief Justice at the sittings in <em>Middlesex </em>after the last October term. And of this opinion was the whole Court. The defendants were ordered to recognize for their appearance <em>de die in diem, </em>until their trial. They afterwards retracted their plea of not guilty, pleaded guilty, and were severally sentenced to thirty days\u2019 imprisonment. <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
