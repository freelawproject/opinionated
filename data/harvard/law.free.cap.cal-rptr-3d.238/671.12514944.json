J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff and respondent San Diego Unified Port District (District) unsuccessfully asked defendant and appellant California Coastal Commission (Commission) to certify an amendment of District's port master plan (at times, the amendment) to authorize specified hotel development in the East Harbor Island subarea, including construction of a 175-room hotel by real party in interest Sunroad Marina Partners, LP (Sunroad). District filed a petition for peremptory writ of mandate challenging Commission's denial of certification, and the trial court in January 2017 issued the writ, finding Commission violated provisions of the California Coastal Act of 1976 (at times the Act; Pub. Res. Code, 1 \u00a7 30000 et seq.) and \"impermissibly set policy\" by setting a maximum rental rate or fixing an amount certain for room rental rates. Commission did not appeal that ruling, but reheard District's application and again denied certification, finding the master plan amendment lacked sufficient specificity to adequately protect lower cost visitor and public recreational opportunities, including overnight accommodations. On objections by District and Sunroad, the trial court in August 2017 ruled that Commission had essentially conditioned its certification on the provision of lower cost overnight accommodations, which \"infring[ed] on the wide discretion afforded to the District to determine the contents of land use plans and how to implement those plans.\" The court ruled that Commission had acted in excess of its jurisdiction and did not proceed in the manner required by law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Commission appeals from the August 2017 postjudgment order. It contends it complied with the writ, but afterwards in the face of Port's and Sunroad's objections the trial court expanded the writ's scope, thereby exceeding its jurisdiction. Commission asks this court to find it complied with the writ as issued, reverse the order sustaining District and Sunroad's objection, and direct the trial court to discharge the writ. Commission further contends it properly denied District's proposed amendment on remand, arguing: (1) substantial evidence supports its finding the proposed amendment does not conform to the Act's policies; (2) Commission, not District, has the ultimate authority to decide whether a proposed amendment is consistent with the Act; and (3) Commission did not set hotel rates in violation of the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In this context, we narrowly review the correctness of the trial court's postjudgment ruling that Commission exceeded its jurisdiction or acted contrary to law in denying certification of District's proposed master plan amendment. Doing so, we hold the court erred by relying in part on provisions of the Act governing a local\n   government's authority and imposing limits on Commission's jurisdiction with respect to local coastal programs, which do not pertain to port master plans or master plan amendments. We further conclude the lower court engaged in an impermissibly broad interpretation of a provision of the Act barring Commission from modifying a master plan amendment as a condition of certification. (\u00a7 30714.) We reverse the order and direct the trial court to discharge the writ of mandate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2015, District submitted to Commission Port Master Plan Amendment No. PMP-6-PSD-14-003-2 (the amendment) for certain development on the East Harbor Island subarea. The amendment proposed to revise District's existing master plan, which had allowed for a single 500-room hotel, to permit development of a 175-room hotel by Sunroad as well as up to two additional hotels with a total of 325 rooms, for a combined total of 500 rooms. About a year earlier, District submitted this proposed amendment but withdrew it after Commission staff recommended Commission deny certification due to \"inconsistency with the public access and recreation policies of the Coastal Act that protect and encourage lower-cost visitor and public recreational opportunities.\" Specifically, Commission staff had observed the proposal did not include any specific requirement for the provision of lower cost accommodations; it did not \"include policy language that either reserves a portion of this subarea for lower cost hotel units or identifies an alternative location where such lower cost accommodations will be developed to which ... in-lieu fees may apply.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Commission staff concluded the proposal did not meet the requirements of section 30213 of the Act, providing in part that lower cost visitor and recreational facilities \"shall be protected, encouraged, and, where feasible, provided.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After District resubmitted the amendment in 2015, Commission staff again recommended denial of certification due to inadequacies with the recreation and lower cost overnight accommodation policies. Commission staff had offered language to include in the amendment that would reserve a portion of the subarea's land, as well as a minimum of 25 percent of the 500 hotel rooms, for lower cost overnight accommodations, but District decided there was inadequate direction from its board to incorporate it into the submittal. Instead, District added a paragraph into its final submittal to address the development of the remaining 325 rooms: \"If the District issues a Request for Proposals (RFP) to develop the one or two hotels (up to 325 rooms) on the southwesternmost area of Subarea 23 before the District has completed a lower cost visitor accommodations study, the RFP shall specify that no less than 25 [percent] of the hotel rooms will be midscale or economy, as defined by Smith Travel Research. The developer of the midscale or economy hotel rooms shall be required to include amenities that lower the cost of stay. Examples of amenities that could lower the cost of stay may include the provision of kitchenettes, refrigerators and/or microwaves in guest rooms, it could also include provision of complimentary services such as Wi-Fi, continental breakfast and/or parking. If a\n   hotel is developed at a midscale or economy product, it need not pay the in-lieu fee identified earlier in this precise plan.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Commission staff determined the language was inadequate: \"[I]t is unlikely that these [midscale or economy] rooms would be what the Commission considers lower cost overnight accommodations. Based on the Commission's past practice, a lower cost overnight accommodation in the San Diego region would be one whose rate is below approximately $106. Based on Commission staff's research of other midscale and economy hotel chains in the vicinity, it is very unlikely that the market rate of new hotel rooms on the waterfront developed as an economy product-let alone a midscale product-would fall into this category. In addition, the deletion of in-lieu fees should not be considered or permitted without detailed criteria and evidence regarding a project's design to ensure a reduction or deletion in the fee is warranted. In this case, the proposed language is too general to determine whether the midscale/economy hotel rooms and amenities would result in accommodations that are truly lower cost, and would allow build-out of the remainder of the room allocation for the subarea. Full-buildout should not occur until it has been determined that this subarea is not required to accommodate a lower-cost hotel and/or a very low cost option, such as a hostel, through use of in-lieu fee payments and to fulfill the results of [District's] study described below.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   According to Commission staff, though District's proposed amendment acknowledged that the hotel developers must contribute a \" 'fair share' \" of on-site or off-site lower cost visitor accommodations or pay an in-lieu fee based on a study District was to prepare, that study had not been completed, and the \"policy language does not establish or identify the number of lower cost units needed to meet public demand, or the potential location and timeframe for development of lower cost accommodations elsewhere within the Port.\" Commission adopted its staff's findings in its final report. It denied certification of the amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   District petitioned for a writ of mandate ( Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 1085, 1094.5 ; Pub. Res. Code, \u00a7 30801 ) setting out four causes of action, and Sunroad joined in District's supporting arguments. District asked the court to have Commission rescind its decision and remand District's application to Commission to either hold a new hearing or deem the amendment certified by operation of law. It asked the court to exercise continuing jurisdiction over the matter to ensure Commission complied with the writ and the court's judicial declaration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In January 2017, the trial court granted the writ as to the second cause of action seeking to compel Commission to vacate its denial based on violations of the Act, finding Commission acted \" 'without, or in excess of [its] jurisdiction.' \" In part, the court stated it was \"not persuaded by the Commission's argument that the Commission did not modify the [amendment] or require the District to accept any language as a condition of certification. By designating $106 as the rate for a 'lower cost overnight accommodation' the Commission set a maximum rental rate and thereby 'fixed an amount certain' for room rental rates necessary for the District to obtain certification of the [amendment] in violation of [sections 30213 and 30714].\" The court further ruled Commission \"impermissibly set policy\" and that, \"while [section] 30213 protects, encourages and prefers 'lower cost visitor and recreational facilities' the Commission lacks the authority to determine the precise method by\n   which the District should implement [section] 30213's broad policy objective.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   District submitted a proposed judgment granting the peremptory writ and a proposed writ. Commission then objected to the proposed writ on several grounds, including that in preparing the proposed writ, District had relied on section 30512.2, which did not apply to port district master plans; District had included unnecessary language; and District had included a provision going beyond the Court's tentative ruling and statement of decision. The court sustained several of Commission's objections and modified the proposed peremptory writ accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In March 2017, the court entered judgment granting the peremptory writ of mandate. It issued a writ ordering Commission to vacate its August 2015 action to deny certification of the amendment and to \"[n]otice and conduct a new public hearing in accordance with applicable regulations and the California Coastal Act during the May 2017 ... Commission meeting scheduled to be held in San Diego and, following the hearing, take action on the [amendment] application, without consideration of a requirement to provide overnight accommodations at a rate of $106 [per] night, or any other specific rate, as a means of establishing 'lower cost overnight accommodations.' \" The writ further provided: \"Nothing in this writ shall limit or control the discretion legally vested in you.\" The court retained jurisdiction over the matter \"until such time as the court has determined that the ... Commission has complied with this writ by taking the mandated actions in accordance with the Coastal Act.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On remand, Commission staff sought to reach agreement with District staff regarding lower cost overnight accommodation provisions but District elected not to modify its amendment. Additionally, staff reported that District had discontinued its study on lower cost overnight accommodations, instead passing guidelines that\n   Commission staff stated lacked specific procedures for protecting, encouraging or providing for lower cost overnight visitor accommodations within District and delayed consideration of how such accommodations could be provided. Staff explained: \"As proposed, the [amendment] language acknowledges the hotel developer(s) must contribute a 'fair-share' of on-site or off-site lower cost visitor accommodations or pay in in-lieu fee based on a study conducted by the District; however, ... the study is no longer being pursued by the Port, so it is unclear how these requirements would be implemented. In addition, the language proposed in the [amendment] would be similar to that included in other [amendments] approved by the Commission for other specific hotel project; however, reliance on this language has not resulted in the actual provision of additional lower cost overnight accommodations within the Port. For example, of the existing 8,035 overnight accommodations within the Port, only 3 [percent] are lower cost (237 RV sites at Chula Vista RV Resort). There is an increasing need for lower cost overnight accommodations within the Port in the form of a specific program that will result in units as opposed to deferred collection of in-lieu fees.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, staff found it unlikely any new hotel developed as an economy or mid-scale product would be lower cost given the \"prime location\" of the subject subarea: \"In order for overnight accommodations on East Harbor Island to be lower cost, and maintained as such, they would need to be a type of development that is designed in such a manner to be intrinsically lower cost.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Staff stated that while the Act emphasized the need to protect and provide public access and lower cost visitor and recreational facilities, the proposed amendment \"does not include any specific requirement for the provision of lower cost accommodations on-site or in the subarea and does not meet the requirements of [s]ection 30213.\" Nor did it contain an in-lieu fee for the remaining 325 rooms if developed as mid-scale\n   or economy to mitigate the loss of public trust lands that could otherwise be used for lower cost accommodations. Staff stated \"that the proposed Port Master Plan amendment, as submitted, does not conform to the provisions of Section 30711 of the Coastal Act. The proposed changes in land use do not contain sufficient detail in the [port master plan] submittal for the Commission to make a determination of the proposed amendment's consistency with Sections 30210, 30211, and 30213 of the Coastal Act.\" Staff again recommended certification be denied in part on grounds the amendment \"does not conform with or carry out the policies of Chapter 3 and Chapter 8 of the Coastal Act.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Commission held a new public hearing, which took place in May 2017. At the hearing, a District representative agreed to include in the amendment a provision that the hotel developer pay an in-lieu mitigation fee of $41,020 per room for 25 percent of all 500 hotel rooms and the Port would include in its future master plan update a plan to address \"lower cost facilities including overnight accommodations.\" Accounting for that agreement, the commissioners nevertheless unanimously voted to deny certification. Observing that the current level of low-cost visitor accommodations within District was only about 3 percent, the commissioners urged that Commission, as the trustee of public trust lands, not accept money in exchange for overnight housing, but instead ensure that the plan \"delineate[ ] numbers of what rooms can be low cost\" and \"actually provide overnight accommodations that are affordable for people.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In June 2017, Commission filed a return to the peremptory petition for writ of mandate, stating that it had denied certification of the amendment. It \"found that the [amendment] does not conform with or carry out the Chapter 3 and Chapter 8 policies of the Coastal Act.\" The return further states: \"As directed by the Court, the Commission did not consider a requirement to provide overnight accommodations at a rate of $106 [per] night or any other specific rate.\" Commission asserted it had fully complied with the writ issued by the court, and requested that it be discharged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   District objected and moved to set aside Commission's return and again remand the matter to Commission to comply with the writ. It argued Commission had exceeded its jurisdiction and violated the Act, as reflected by commentary of some of the commissioners during the May 2017 hearing, by making a \"specific policy of lower cost overnight accommodations ... dispositive in voting on [the amendment].\" More specifically, District objected that Commission \"demand[ed] a specific policy (a land set aside for low-cost overnight accommodations over public recreational facilities) and ... articulat[ed] how that policy must be carried out (must designate 25 [percent] of new hotel rooms to be provided at lower cost-hostel, yurts, cabins and camping) ....\" It characterized Commission's jurisdictional role in reviewing master plan amendments as \"limited\" by section 30714, which states that Commission may not modify a plan as submitted as a condition of certification, and section 30512.2, which prohibited Commission from diminishing or abridging a local government's authority to \"adopt and establish, by ordinance, the precise content of its land use plan.\" District also objected that Commission interpreted the writ as merely prohibiting it from mentioning dollar figures as a technicality; that by its actions Commission engaged in \"specific policy making\" and it attempted to indirectly set room rates. Sunroad joined in the objections and motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In August 2017, the trial court sustained the objections of District and Sunroad\n   and granted the motion to set aside Commission's action. The court found Commission had satisfied the writ's directive not to consider a requirement to provide overnight accommodations at a $106 rate or any other specific rate as a means of establishing lower cost overnight accommodations. However, it ruled that Commission nevertheless acted in excess of its jurisdiction and did not proceed in the manner required by law when it again denied certification. In part, the court found Commission was \"in essence, requiring that the [amendment] include a provision for 'lower-cost overnight visitor servicing accommodations' as a condition of certification\" and in that way Commission \"infringe[d] on the wide discretion afforded to the District to determine the contents of land use plans and how to implement these plans.\" The court issued another peremptory writ of mandate, commanding Commission to vacate its May 2017 action denying certification, to conduct a new public hearing in accordance with applicable regulations and the Act, and to take action on the amendment application \"in compliance with the Coastal Act and consistent with the court's prior rulings in this case.\" The writ again provides: \"Nothing in this writ shall limit or control the discretion legally vested in you.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Commission filed this appeal from the trial court's August 2017 order after judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Commission presents two issues: First, it contends the lower court exceeded its jurisdiction when it found Commission had failed to comply with the writ. According to Commission, in reaching this ruling, the court enforced portions of the writ it had previously struck as beyond the scope of its decision in response to Commission's objections, and thus the court \"improperly expanded the scope of the judgment and writ.\" Commission relies on\n   <em>\n    Craven v. Crout\n   </em>\n   (1985)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2124038\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d/163/779/\">\n    163 Cal.App.3d 779\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=209%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20649\">\n    209 Cal.Rptr. 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , holding a court loses power to change a previously-entered judgment. Commission maintains that if we find it complied with the writ \"as issued,\" we\n   should reverse the order and direct the trial court to discharge the writ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Second, Commission contends it properly denied certification of the amendment on remand. It maintains substantial evidence supports its decision that the amendment does not conform to the Act's Chapter 3 policies, including section 30213, and specifically its finding that the amendment lacked sufficient specificity to adequately protect, encourage or provide lower cost visitor and public recreational facilities, including lower cost overnight accommodations, and was inconsistent with the public access and recreation policies of the Act. Commission maintains it is its role, not District's, to exercise discretion to determine whether an amendment meets the Act's standards, based on cases such as\n   <em>\n    City of Chula Vista v. Superior Court\n   </em>\n   (1982)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2092570\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d/133/472/\">\n    133 Cal.App.3d 472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=183%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20909\">\n    183 Cal.Rptr. 909\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    City of Chula Vista\n   </em>\n   ) and\n   <em>\n    City of Malibu v.

Commission maintains we may reverse only if a reasonable person would not have reached the conclusions made by it based on the evidence before it. Further, Commission maintains this court must defer, and give great weight, to its interpretation of the controlling statutes and regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   District and Sunroad point out that because Commission did not appeal from the court's January 2017 decision to grant the writ, it has waived its right to appeal from that judgment or the writ's directives.

It characterizes Commission as having a limited statutory role in certifying master plans. District argues the Coastal Act is structured so that \"precise policy\" originates with a legislative body; that District is charged with creating the policies to implement the Act whereas Commission is an executive branch agency charged only with verifying consistency with the plan and the Act. According to District, section 30714 of the Act \"expressly prohibits [Commission from] engaging in developing policy suggestions to port master plans.\" District challenges Commission's power to articulate how District should carry out the Act's public access policies, arguing Commission lacks authority to \"originate policy,\" require or dictate specific policies and policy choices, or engage in \"policymaking.\" District argues \"[t]he California Legislature put the Port District-not Commission-in charge of figuring out how to achieve the Port Act's mission and advance the policies of the Coastal Act.\" The latter contention is asserted without citation to authority, and on\n   that ground alone we do not consider it.

And District's arguments are not supported by section 30714, which, unlike the LCP provisions of the Act, says nothing about Commission's ability to dictate or suggest the type of visitor facilities and alternatives that would comply with coastal policy. Under the trial court's reasoning, when Commission determined that coastal policy required District to actually provide lower cost overnight accommodations in its master plan amendment and identified the sorts of development meeting that standard, Commission modified the plan as a condition of certification in violation of section 30714. But such a conclusion is based on an impermissibly broad reading of the limit placed on Commission in section 30714, providing it \"may not modify the [master] plan as submitted as a condition of certification.\" Strictly construing that limitation as we must, section 30714 prohibits Commission only from\n   <em>\n    conditionally approving\n   </em>\n   a master plan, that is, granting certification subject to a specified modification. To conclude otherwise would prevent Commission from denying certification of a master plan with specific factual and legal findings as to its deficiencies or suggestions for compliance, as any such decision would be construed as an unacceptable conditional approval or modification of the plan in violation of section 30714. Commission did not conditionally approve certification, but denied it on grounds the proposed amendment did not further the Act's public access policies or contain sufficient specificity or detail to permit it to find it complied with those policies, including the Act's mandate that \"lower cost visitor ... facilities\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   be ... provided.\" (\u00a7 30213, italics added.) Commission's suggestions as to how District could meet that mandate did not tell District to amend its plan in any particular way. In denying certification, Commission expressly acknowledged that it was not permitted to make such modifications, but was required to approve or deny the plan amendment as submitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Neither the port master plan provisions nor the public access provisions of the Act contain a broad legislative mandate in favor of District's authority over the \"precise details\" of port master plans; though District's governing body prepares the master plan and Commission may not modify it as submitted as a condition of certification (\u00a7 30714), it ultimately remains Commission's primary role and responsibility as the statewide supervisory agency to implement the Act and ensure a port master plan furthers the Act's policies.

The statute itself refers to visitor facilities as places for overnight lodging. And such an interpretation is consistent with statewide coastal policy-reflected in amendments effective in 2018-that lower cost overnight accommodations \"including hotels, motels, hostels, cabins, and camping opportunities, are essential elements of coastal ... access\" because \"[a] lack of affordable accommodations remains a barrier to coastal access.\" (\u00a7 31411, added by Stats. 2017, ch. 838, \u00a7 3, eff. Jan. 1, 2018.)

Rather, it is within Commission's broad authority to apply its expertise and devise solutions to promote the policy of providing \"lower cost visitor ... facilities,\" including by specifying overnight accommodations that are the \"type of development ... designed in such a manner to be intrinsically lower cost,\" in District's master plan. Likewise, the Act does not prevent Commission from deciding that collection of in-lieu mitigation fees no longer furthers or carries out the legislative mandate that lower cost visitor facilities be provided. District points out that the trigger for collecting such fees has not occurred for some of the past hotel projects and it collected fees for another hotel that can be transferred if not used. But Commission is entitled to conclude that the built-in delays with in-lieu mitigation fees render them ineffectual in actually providing lower cost visitor facilities in connection with the present plan amendment. The fact Commission previously certified District's master plan without provision of such lower cost accommodations or subject to in-lieu mitigation fees does not prevent Commission from now concluding that District's proposed amendment does not further the Act's mandate for lower cost overnight accommodations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Additionally, Commission's denial was based on a finding that District's proposed amendment was insufficiently specific to permit it to conclude that it met the Act's public access policies, a conclusion well within its review authority under the master plan provisions of the Act. ( \u00a7 30711, subds. (a)(4), (b) [requiring master plans contain \"information in sufficient detail\" to permit a determination of consistency with public access and port master plan policies].) Neither District nor Sunroad meaningfully challenge the conclusion that the amendment lacked specific requirements for the provision of lower cost accommodations either on the site or in the subarea generally. District merely argues that Commission's rejections of economy and midscale accommodations with kitchenettes, refrigerators or microwaves indirectly sets room rates, a claim the trial court properly rejected. Though District also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting Commission's findings, it makes these assertions without explanation or citation to the administrative record, then argues Commission's findings \"amount to little more than staff speculation and guesswork ....\" The trial court in initially reviewing Commission's decision was required to presume it was supported by substantial evidence unless District or Sunroad showed otherwise.

(\u00a7 30715, subd. (a).) The specifically referenced permit authority is for coastal development permits, which are not at issue in this proceeding.

Staff additionally found the Smith Travel Research definition used by District was unclear; it had not specified which standard its proposed language was based on and what it meant: \"The ambiguity of the proposed language is confusing and the [proposed master plan] should include more specifically defined terms.

Sunroad argues this decision is relevant to the procedural history of District's master plan amendment at issue, the length of time the amendment has been pending unresolved and efforts of respondents to complete the CEQA and administrative process. Sunroad states its counsel made reference to this decision in discussing the legislative history of section 30213 of the Act at the July 2014 hearing before Commission on the amendment, but that the findings were not included in the administrative record. Sunroad's arguments concerning the 2016 minute order related to the EIR do not convince us that the\n    <em>\n     San Diego Navy Broadway Complex Coalition\n    </em>\n    order is relevant to whether the trial judge in this case correctly decided Commission either exceeded its jurisdiction or acted in a manner contrary to law in connection with its 2017 decision to again deny certification of the amendment.

We declined to find the scope of Commission's power dictated by the fact local entities were charged with the primary land planning function: \"The fact City is the first agency to work on the plan is not determinative of the scope of Commission's powers. ... Local government is to be included, but statewide standards are to be formulated; local government plans, but a statewide commission reviews. Surely the Legislature did not go to all this trouble to create a statewide rubber stamp agency which does no more than review local legislation for arbitrary and capricious enactments.

We explained in that context that \"the entire scheme of the Act provides for the initial planning to be done locally and the final approval to be done by a statewide agency with an eye to statewide policies and limitations. The function of the statewide agency would be trivial and its existence unjustifiable if its function were purely to review City's action for rationality, for conceivable conformity to the state standards rather than actual compliance.\n    <em>\n     Clearly, the Commission must exercise its independent judgment to decide if such conformity has been achieved because that decision cannot be completely delegated to the local entity where it is likely to be subject to local economic and political pressures which cannot so readily influence the Commission\n    </em>\n    .\" (\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at p. 489,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=183%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20909\">\n     183 Cal.Rptr. 909\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , italics added.) If Commission is empowered to exercise its independent judgment in the context of an LCP with the attendant limitations on its power to dictate precise land use policies, then certainly Commission may exercise its independent judgment with respect to a port master plan, where its powers with regard to development policy are not so limited.
