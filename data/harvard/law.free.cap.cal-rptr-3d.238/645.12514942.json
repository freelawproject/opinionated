In other words, where an LLC elects not to be taxed as a corporation, its status as a separate entity is \"disregarded\" for income tax purposes, and it is taxed as part of its owner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In 2005-the taxable year at issue in this case-none of Bunzl's single member LLC's elected to be taxed as corporations, and all were therefore considered disregarded entities for income tax purposes. That year, each of those LLC's filed a return under section 18633.5, subdivision (a), which provides that every LLC doing business in California must file a \"return.\" In addition, as disregarded entities, each LLC was subject to section 18633.5, subdivision (i), which requires disregarded LLC's to file a return that includes information necessary to verify its liability under sections 17941, which charges a \"tax\" of at least $25 \"for the privilege of doing business in this state,\" and 17942, which charges a \"fee\" of at least $900 depending on \"the total income from all sources derived from or attributable to\" this state. (\u00a7 18633.5, subd. (i)(1).) Section 18633.5 further mandates that a disregarded LLC must provide its sole owner's name and taxpayer identification number and include the consent of the owner to California tax jurisdiction. (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   .) \"If the owner's consent [to California tax jurisdiction] is not included [in the return], the [LLC] shall pay on behalf of its owner an amount [specified in subdivision (e) ].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , subd. (i)(2).) In accord with these provisions, Bunzl's six single member LLC's provided the necessary information in their returns. And, when the single member owners of the LLC's declined to consent to California tax jurisdiction,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the LLC's reported their collective income and paid a total of $244,502 on behalf of their owners under section 18633.5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Bunzl then calculated its California tax liability under UDITPA's apportionment\n   formula. In doing so, Bunzl excluded the property, payroll, and sales factors of its single member LLC's from the numerator of the apportionment formula on the basis that it had already paid California a tax and fee for those LLC's under section 18633.5. Excluding the property, payroll, and sales factors of the six single member LLC's from the numerator of the apportionment formula drastically decreased the overall apportionment ratio, thereby reducing the amount of Bunzl's income that was apportionable to California. Bunzl reported an overall California apportionment factor/ratio of 0.0131 percent and multiplied this factor by $193,908,364-Bunzl's combined report net income for the year-concluding that only $25,402 of its income was attributable to, and therefore taxable in, California. Accordingly, Bunzl paid $2,246 in California income tax liability for the year 2005 under UDITPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The FTB rejected Bunzl's approach and found that the property, payroll, and sales factors of the six single member LLC's should have been included in the numerator of the UDITPA apportionment formula. Including the property, payroll, and sales factors of the six LLC's in the numerator of the apportionment formula boosted Bunzl's California income tax liability under UDITPA to slightly more than $1.4 million. Deducting the $244,502 already paid by the LLC's under section 18633.5, the FTB assessed Bunzl $1,159,093. Bunzl paid this amount plus interest, exhausted its administrative remedies to get it refunded, and commenced this action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After the trial court granted the FTB's motion for summary adjudication of Bunzl's causes of action for refund, Bunzl elected not to proceed with its remaining causes of action in order to expedite appellate review. To that end, Bunzl and the FTB stipulated to entry of the judgment, and Bunzl timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Bunzl's Argument\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Bunzl's essential argument can be summarized as follows: Where the nonresident corporate owner of a single member, disregarded LLC declines to consent to California tax jurisdiction, and the LLC files a return and pays a tax and fee under section 18633.5, the LLC becomes a separate, \"stand-alone\" entity that is no longer treated as part of its owner for income tax purposes. Bunzl's argument appears to be twofold: (1) because its LLC's paid the requisite fees and taxes under section 18633.5, the LLC's property, payroll, and sales factors should have been excluded from UDITPA's apportionment formula; and (2) because the owners of the LLC's did not do any business in California apart from the LLC's, they had no property, payroll, and sales factors attributable to California that could be included in the apportionment formula. We reject Bunzl's argument. The plain language of section 18633.5 and its legislative history show that the statute was limited in scope and was not intended to reduce the tax liability of disregarded single member LLC's that are part of a unitary business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Bunzl first argues that section 18633.5 constitutes an \"alternative\" taxation scheme that allows an otherwise disregarded single member LLC to be taxed for all purposes as a separate, stand-alone\n   entity, so that the LLC's property, payroll, and sales factors are removed from the apportionment formula of UDITPA, even if it is part of a unitary business. There is, however, nothing in the language of section 18633.5 that suggests the statute was meant to replace the well-established apportionment principles set forth in UDITPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Instead, section 18633.5 merely provides that a disregarded LLC must pay a certain tax and fee on behalf of its owner when its owner declines to consent to California tax jurisdiction. (\u00a7 18633.5, subd. (i)(2).) It does not state that an owner is absolved of all other tax liability so long as the LLC pays that tax and fee on the owner's behalf. In fact, the statute presumes the owner will be responsible for paying taxes separate and aside from what is required under the section. Subdivision (g) provides: \"Any amount paid by the [LLC] to this state pursuant to [this section] shall be considered to be a payment by the member\n   <em>\n    on account of the income tax imposed by this state on the member for the taxable period\n   </em>\n   .\" (Italics added.) In other words, the tax and fee an LLC pays under section 18633.5 is to be credited against its owner's separate tax liability. This supports our conclusion that section 18633.5 did not replace other tax-assessing statutes such as UDITPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Further, although the disregarded LLC can be viewed as a separate entity for the limited purpose of paying the tax and fee required by section 18633.5, the statute does not state that the LLC is to be treated as a separate entity for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   purposes, including income tax purposes. California Code of Regulations, title 18, section 23038(b)-1, subdivision (a)(4), supports our conclusion that section 18633.5 was not intended to treat the LLC's as separate entities for all purposes. The regulation provides that single member LLC's \"can choose to be recognized or disregarded as entities separate from their owners, subject to certain statutory provisions which recognize the existence of otherwise disregarded entities\n   <em>\n    for certain purposes\n   </em>\n   including the tax and fee of [an LLC] under Sections 17941 and 17942 ..., the return filing requirements of [an LLC] under Section 18633.5 ..., and the credit limitations of a disregarded entity under Sections 17039 and 23036....\" (Italics added; see also \u00a7 23038 [a disregarded LLC can be treated as a separate entity under four limited circumstances, including for the purpose of section 18633.5].) In other words, a single member LLC that elects to be considered a disregarded entity will be treated as a separate entity for \"certain purposes\" only, including for the purpose of paying a tax and fee under sections 18633.5, 17941 and 17942.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Recent California authority also supports our conclusion. The Court of Appeal in\n   <em>\n    City of Los Angeles v. Furman Selz Capital Management\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 121 Cal.App.4th at pages 516 to 517,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20139\">\n    17 Cal.Rptr.3d 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , declined to treat a disregarded LLC as a separate entity from its owner for income tax purposes. The court observed: \"Had the Legislature intended to adopt other exceptions to the disregard of the separate existence of the [LLC] for tax purposes, it would certainly have so stated. ... It did not do so.\" Similarly, we observe that if the Legislature had intended for section 18633.5 to immunize a single member LLC or the owner of the LLC from the standard apportionment and tax rules of UDITPA, it would have so provided. It did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Bunzl next argues that the legislative history of section 18633.5, as well as section 23038\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   -which incorporates section\n   18633.5 by reference-supports its position that the Legislature intended to remove the income of \"stand-alone\" LLC's from the apportionment formula of UDITPA. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The bill analyses on which Bunzl relies show the Legislature amended sections 18633.5 and 23038 simply to bring California into conformity with the federal practice of allowing LLC's to elect whether to be taxed as a corporation. The bill passed without a dissenting vote in both the Senate and the Assembly. (Sen. Bill No. 1234 (1997-1998 Reg. Sess.) Complete Bill Hist., p. 1.) The appropriations committee for each chamber evaluated the measure as essentially revenue-neutral (see Sen. Com. on Appropriations, fiscal summary of Sen. Bill No. 1234 (1997-1998 Reg. Sess.) as amended May 1, 1997, pp. 1-2 [\"FTB estimates ... relatively little net revenue effect\"]; Assem. Com. on Appropriations, Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 1234 (1997-1998 Reg. Sess.) as amended Aug. 25, 1997, p. 1 [\"the [FTB] stated this bill would not significantly impact personal income tax or bank and corporation tax revenues\" and would \"result[ ] in minor net revenue effect\"] ), as did the revenue and taxation committees. (See Sen. Com. on Rev. &amp; Tax., 3d reading analysis of Sen. Bill No. 1234 (1997-1998 Reg. Sess.) as amended Aug. 25, 1997, p. 2 [\"\n   <em>\n    FISCAL EFFECT\n   </em>\n   : Minor\"]; Assem.

Sess.) as amended May 1, 1997, p. 2 [\"FISCAL EFFECT: [\u00b6] None\"].) These references reveal that the Legislature expected relatively minor revenue loss from the amendments to the statutes upon which Bunzl relies. Moreover, the comments accompanying the amendments to these statutes support our conclusion that the Legislature, in amending the statutes, did not intend for a unitary business to significantly reduce its tax liability absent a \"change in the underlying economic realities\" of its business. (\n   <em>\n    Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes\n   </em>\n   (1980)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777870\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/425/#p441\">\n    445 U.S. 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 441,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777870\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/425/#p441\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777870\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/425/#p441\">\n    63 L.Ed.2d 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We also find it significant that the terms \"UDITPA,\" \"unitary business,\" and \"interstate taxation\" are not mentioned anywhere in the numerous committee reports and bill analyses. Courts are reluctant to accept that legislatures enact important or fundamental changes by silent indirection. (See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    California Cannabis Coalition v.

Because section 18633.5 does not replace the apportionment formula of UDITPA, Bunzl should have included the property, payroll, and sales of its single member LLC's in the numerators of its combined reporting group's apportionment factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Bunzl's Additional Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Joined by the California Taxpayers Association as amicus curiae, Bunzl argues\n   that the owners of the single member LLC's \"do not have [a] nexus with California\" and therefore are beyond the state's taxing power. Bunzl relies in part on\n   <em>\n    Swart Enterprises, Inc. v. Franchise Tax Bd.\n   </em>\n   (2017)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12452428\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-5th/7/497/\">\n    7 Cal.App.5th 497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=212%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20670\">\n    212 Cal.Rptr.3d 670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but the case is distinguishable. There, the Court of Appeal held that an out-of-state corporation was not doing business in California and was therefore not subject to an $800 minimum franchise tax because the corporation's only connection to California was its passive ownership of a 0.2-percent membership interest in a California LLC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 504,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=212%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20670\">\n    212 Cal.Rptr.3d 670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Here, in contrast, there is substantial nexus because Bunzl, Bunzl Western, and Bunzl Midcentral are 100-percent owners of LLC's that conduct significant business in California. Moreover, as discussed above, because the LLC's in this case are part of a unitary enterprise, Bunzl, Bunzl Western, and Bunzl Midcentral cannot remove themselves from the reach of UDITPA simply by filing returns and paying taxes and fees under sections 18633.5, 17941, and 17942.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In a similar vein, Bunzl suggests through a few references in its opening brief that it is the victim of double taxation, raising the specter that California is exceeding its proper territorial jurisdiction. For example, Bunzl argues: \"Limitations imposed by the 'Due Process and Commerce Clauses ... do not allow a State to tax income arising out of interstate activities-even on a proportional basis-unless there is a \"minimal connection\" or \"nexus\" between the interstate activities and the taxing State, and a rational relationship between the income attributed to the State and the intrastate values of the enterprise.' [Citation.]\" Bunzl argues: \"This case involves an attempt to tax a legal entity's California income twice....\" We reject Bunzl's suggestion that it is a victim of double taxation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Preliminarily, we note the double taxation issue is not sufficiently raised in Bunzl's opening brief. Isolated references in a brief do not constitute a cognizable argument. Under identifying headings, \"a brief must contain ' \"meaningful legal analysis supported by citations to authority and citations to facts in the record that support the claim of error\" ' and contain adequate record citations, or else we will deem all points 'to be forfeited as unsupported by \"adequate factual or legal analysis.\" ' \" (\n   <em>\n    Fernandes v.

In light of the fact that section 18633.5 contains no reference to UDITPA, it is more appropriate to view Bunzl as arguing that its LLC's are not covered by UDITPA, i.e., that Bunzl is claiming an exemption from UDITPA.

In light of our conclusion that Bunzl was not entitled to a refund, we need not-and therefore will not-address the additional claims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Section 23038 provides in relevant part: \"If the separate existence of an eligible business entity is disregarded for federal tax purposes, the separate existence of that business entity shall be disregarded for purposes of this part, Part 10 ..., and Part 10.2 ..., other than Section 17941 (relating to the tax of [an LLC] ), Section 17942 (relating to the fee of [an LLC] ), Section 18633.5 (relating to the return of [an LLC] ), and Sections 17039 and 23036 (relating to tax credits).\" (\u00a7 23038, subd. (b)(2)(B)(iii).)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    To the extent Bunzl is claiming that the owners of its LLC's should not have been required to pay California taxes because they declined to consent to California tax jurisdiction, the claim is meritless. Bunzl presents no relevant authority to support its position that an LLC owner can, simply by withholding consent, deprive California of its jurisdiction to tax the portion of a business's income that is generated from California sources. As noted, the jurisdiction to tax is not dependent upon a taxpayer's consent. (\n    <em>\n     Valentino v.
