Walker\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced the base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine offenses. On appeal, Walker, who was sentenced based on his status as a career offender, acknowledges that, in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009), we held that defendants whose sentencing ranges were based on their career offender status are not eligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 706. Walker asserts, however, that <em>Moore </em>was wrongly decided, and, pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court should have reevaluated the substantive reasonableness of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-25\">\u201cUnder the well-established prior panel precedent rule of this Circuit, the holding of the first panel to address an issue is the law of this Circuit, thereby binding all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>subsequent panels unless and until the first panel\u2019s holding is overruled by the Court sitting en banc or by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Smith v. GTE Corp., </em>236 F.3d 1292, 1300 n. 8 (11th Cir.2001). Thus, we affirm the denial of Walker\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion in accordance with <em>Moore. </em>541 F.3d at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
