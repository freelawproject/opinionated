We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2004), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-24\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on Kumar\u2019s admission that he made false statements regarding incidents of past persecution to immigration officials in the United Kingdom, <em>see Al-Harbi v. INS, </em>242 F.3d 882, 889-90 (9th Cir.2001) (changing story regarding incidents of past persecution supported adverse credibility finding), and his submission of a fraudulent document that goes to the heart of his claim, <em>see Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741, 745 (9th Cir.2004) (use of fraudulent documents supported adverse credibility finding). In the absence of credible testimony, Kumar has failed to establish that he is eligible for asylum or withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-25\">Because Kumar\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same evidence the agency found not credible, and he points to no other evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>dence to show it is more likely than not he would be tortured if returned to India, his CAT claim fails. <em>See id. </em>at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b653-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
