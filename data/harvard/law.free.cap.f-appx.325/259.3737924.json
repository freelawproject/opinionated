We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Addison pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine and fifty grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A); 846 (2006). Based on a total offense level of forty-one and a criminal history category of VI, his resulting Guidelines range of imprisonment was 360 months to life. However, because he had two prior felony drug convictions, his statutory mandatory minimum sentence was life, which became his Guideline sentence. At sentencing, based on the Government\u2019s motion for a downward departure under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) (2006), the district court departed downward and sentenced Addison to 292 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court subsequently denied Addison\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c), finding the statutory mandatory minimum sentence was not affected by the Guidelines amendments. The court noted Addison was not eligible for the reduction because he was subjected to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence from which the court previously departed based on his substantial assistance. The court did grant the Government\u2019s Fed. R.Crim.P. 35 motion and resentenced Addison to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The legal interpretations of the Sentencing Guidelines and the amendments are reviewed de novo. Factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>See United States v. Turner, </em>59 F.3d 481, 483-84 (4th Cir.1995). We review the denial of a motion for a reduction in the sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Goines, </em>357 F.3d 469, 478 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">We find the district court properly found it was without authority to modify Addison\u2019s sentence pursuant to Amendments 706 and 711 of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Hood, </em>556 F.3d 226, 233-36 (4th Cir.2009). In <em>Hood, </em>the court held that Amendment 706 did not lower the statutory mandatory minimum sentence and did not have the effect of lowering Hood\u2019s Guidelines range of imprisonment. <em>Hood, </em>556 F.3d at 235-36. Likewise, because Addison\u2019s sentence was not based on a sentencing range authorized by <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2D1.1, which Amendments 706 and 711 amended, it was not available for a modification under \u00a7 3582(c). <em>See Hood, </em>556 F.3d at 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order and amended judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
