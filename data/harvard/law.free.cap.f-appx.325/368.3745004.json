Noorani does not challenge the denial of relief under the Convention Against Torture in her petition before this court. The issue is therefore deemed abandoned. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">When, as here, the BIA agrees with the immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) determination that the applicant is not credible without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s grounds for decision this court reviews both the BIA\u2019s and the IJ\u2019s opinions, including portions of the IJ\u2019s decision not explicitly discussed by the BIA. <em>Yun-Zui v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005); <em>see also Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994) (this court may review credibility finding made by the IJ if adopted by the BIA). This court reviews the factual findings for substantial evidence. <em>Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 594 (5th Cir.2007). Under the substantial evidence standard, a petition for review will not be granted unless this court decides \u201cnot only that the evidence supports a contrary conclusion, but also that the evidence compels it.\u201d <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-14\">Contrary to Noorani\u2019s contentions, there is substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s credibility determinations. Noorani\u2019s assertions regarding the status of the Pakistan People\u2019s Party (\u201cPPP\u201d) was in conflict with the evidence in the Country Reports. Further, Noorani\u2019s own testimony regarding her husband\u2019s participation in the PPP was both internally inconsistent and in direct conflict with her application. Although it is arguable that the IJ misspoke when he stated that the lack of corroborating evidence impeached Noorani\u2019s credibility, the IJ correctly applied the law as it related to the requirements of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(i), (ii). Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED. <em>See Chen, </em>470 F.3d at 1134.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b397-10\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
