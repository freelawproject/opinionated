Co., </em>532 F.3d 252, 265 (3d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">In 1982, Kasteleba was sentenced to a three-year term of imprisonment and seven years of probation after pleading guilty to false imprisonment and attempted robbery in Broward County, Florida. While serving his probation, Kasteleba moved to Pennsylvania. Supervision was transferred to the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole (\u201cBoard\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On February 25, 1985, Kasteleba was arrested for a probation violation after being identified as the person who had assaulted two people (and robbed one of them at gunpoint) in a bar in Plains, Pennsylvania, a week earlier.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The Interstate Compact required Pennsylvania to hold a probable cause hearing on Kasteleba\u2019s alleged probation violations and to forward the findings to Florida for final disposition. The probable cause hearing was held on March 5, 1985. Judge, the parole agent assigned to supervise Kasteleba, testified that he had interviewed the two victims, and that both had identified Kasteleba \u201cwith certainty.\u201d Although the victims later submitted mistaken identity withdrawal of prosecution forms, Judge stated his belief that they had been intimidated by Kasteleba into doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">On the hearing examiner\u2019s recommendation, the Board made a written request to the State of Florida to issue a warrant for Kasteleba\u2019s extradition. However, the Board did not receive a response, and Kas-teleba was released from custody on April 18, 1985. Kasteleba claims that upon his release Judge threatened that he would \u201cget him.\u201d The Board eventually terminated Kasteleba\u2019s supervision. Judge dictated a final supervision report on December 2, 1985. Judge had no further contact with Kasteleba until this lawsuit was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">On April 30, 1985, twelve days after Kasteleba\u2019s release, a Broward County, Florida judge issued a warrant for Kas-teleba\u2019s arrest, presumably in response to the Board\u2019s extradition request. In October of 1985, Kasteleba was injured in an automobile accident in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. While hospitalized, Kas-teleba was held under armed guard pending extradition pursuant to the Broward County warrant. When no official from Florida appeared to take custody of Kas-teleba, he was again released.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Despite having been informed of the outstanding Broward County warrant while in the hospital, Kasteleba never made inquiry of Florida authorities to have the warrant cleared.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-13\">Nineteen years later, on April 20, 2004, Kasteleba was stopped in Lee County, Florida, for failing to stop at a stop sign. A routine traffic check uncovered the 1985 Broward County warrant, and Kasteleba was arrested. Kasteleba was released from custody on July 9, 2004, after it was determined that Kasteleba\u2019s Florida probation had been terminated in April of 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-14\">The District Court ruled that Kastele-ba\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims were time-barred. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>agree with the District Court\u2019s well-reasoned opinion. The period of limitations for a \u00a7 1983 action is governed by the forum state\u2019s statute for personal injury actions. <em>See Wilson v. Garcia, </em>471 U.S. 261, 276-280, 105 S.Ct. 1938, 85 L.Ed.2d 254 (1985), <em>superseded, by statute on other grounds, </em>as stated in <em>Jones v. R.R. Don-nelley &amp; Sons Co., </em>541 U.S. 369, 377-378, 124 S.Ct. 1836, 158 L.Ed.2d 645 (2004). Thus, in Pennsylvania, the limitations period for a \u00a7 1983 action is two years. <em>See </em>42 Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 5524; <em>see also Ahmed v. Dragovich, </em>297 F.3d 201, 206 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">It is \u201cthe standard rule that [accrual occurs] when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action, that is, when the plaintiff can file suit and obtain relief.\u201d <em>Wallace v. Koto, </em>549 U.S. 384, 388, 127 S.Ct. 1091, 166 L.Ed.2d 973 (2007) (alteration in original) (citations omitted). Here, Kasteleba\u2019s cause of action unmistakably accrued in October of 1985, when Kastele-ba was held under armed guard awaiting extradition. Kasteleba\u2019s arguments that Judge was responsible for the issuance of the Broward County warrant because of personal animus for Kasteleba lends nothing to the analysis. He did not bring suit until August 3, 2005, almost twenty years after he first had a \u201ccomplete and present cause of action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Substantially for the reasons stated by the District Court, we will affirm the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b182-13\">. The complaint originally named a number of individual defendants, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole. By agreement of the parties, all defendants were dismissed except for Judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b182-23\">. We have jurisdiction to hear the appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b183-8\">. The Board accepted supervision of Kastele-ba pursuant to the Interstate Compact for the Supervision of Parolees and Probationers, Act of June 25, 1937, P.L. 2086, No. 415 (codified as amended at 61 Pa. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 321-323).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b183-9\">. Kasteleba was cited by the Board for failing to report a change in employment status, changing employment without authorization, possession of a dangerous weapon, engaging in assaultive conduct, and failing to pay his outstanding public defender fees in Florida.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b183-16\">. Kasteleba was not extradited to Florida because, according to Florida probation records, \"witnesses stated in trial that D was not the man that assaulted them. He was not guilty.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
