Kastl was an instructor for and a student of MCCCD. Following complaints that a man was using the women\u2019s restroom, MCCCD banned Kastl, who is transsexual, from using the women\u2019s restroom until she could prove completion of sex reassignment surgery.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Kastl\u2019s contract was subsequently not renewed by MCCCD. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C., \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-17\">In <em>Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, </em>490 U.S. 228, 251, 109 S.Ct. 1775, 104 L.Ed.2d 268 (1989), the Supreme Court explained that gender stereotyping is direct evidence of sex discrimination prohibited by Title VII. Relying oh <em>Hopkins, </em>in <em>Schwenk v. Hartford, </em>204 F.3d 1187, 1201-02 (9th Cir.2000), we held, in the context of the Gender Motivated Violence Act, that transgender individuals may state viable sex discrimination claims on the theory that the perpetrator was motivated by the victim\u2019s real or perceived non-conformance to socially-constructed gender norms. After <em>Hopkins </em>and <em>Schwenk, </em>it is unlawful to discriminate against a transgender (or any other) person because he or she does not behave in accordance with an employer\u2019s expectations for men or women. <em>Accord Smith v. City of Salem, Ohio, </em>378 F.3d 566, 575 (6th Cir.2004). Thus, Kastl states a prima facie case of gender discrimination under Title VII on the theory that impermissible gender stereotypes were a motivating factor in MCCCD\u2019s actions against her. MCCCD satisfied its burden of pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>duction under the second stage of the analysis set forth in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), when it proffered evidence that it banned Kastl from using the women\u2019s restroom for safety reasons. Because Kastl did not put forward sufficient evidence demonstrating that MCCCD was motivated by Kastl\u2019s gender, her claim is doomed at the third <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>stage. <em>See Lindahl v. Air France, </em>930 F.2d 1434, 1437 (9th Cir.1991) (\u201c[A Title VII] plaintiff cannot defeat summary judgment simply by making out a prima facie case.\u201d). Kastl\u2019s Title IX and Equal Protection claims fall with her Title VII claim. <em>See Oona R.-S.-by Kate S. v. McCaffrey, </em>143 F.3d 473, 477 (9th Cir.1998) (Title IX); <em>Sischo-Nownejad v. Merced Cmty. Coll. </em>Dist., 934 F.2d 1104, 1112-13 (9th Cir. 1991) (Equal Protection Clause). MCCCD was entitled to summary judgment on Kastl\u2019s constitutional privacy and expression claims also due to insufficient evidence. <em>See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). Kastl\u2019s other challenges to the district court\u2019s decision also fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b521-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b521-15\">. We note that the parties do not appear to have considered any type of accommodation that would have permitted Kastl to use a restroom other than those dedicated to men. After all, Kastl identified and presented full-time as female, and she argued to MCCCD that the men\u2019s restroom was not only inappropriate for but also potentially dangerous to her.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
