Flores-Cruz argues that the government conceded that Honduran street children form a \u201cparticular social group,\u201d that this issue was not properly before the BIA, and that he was not given an opportunity to address this issue. He also argues that the BIA erred in determining that Honduran street children do not form a \u201cparticular social group\u201d and that persecution and fear of persecution resulting from his membership in that group entitle him to asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-18\">The BIA first reversed the IJ\u2019s decision in a September 2003 order stating that \u201ceven if\u201d Honduran street children constitute a particular social group, Flores-Cruz is not entitled to asylum. <em>In re Carlos Flores-Cruz, </em>No. A95 281 982, Phoenix (Sept. 24, 2003). Flores-Cruz petitioned for review by the Ninth Circuit. The government moved to remand so that the BIA, <em>inter alia, </em>could \u201caddress\u201d more clearly the IJ\u2019s finding that \u201cthe particular social group of \u2018abandoned street children\u2019 are subject to a pattern and practice of persecution.\u201d Respondent\u2019s Motion for Remand and for Stay of the Briefing Schedule, No. 03-73885 (9th Cir. May 6, 2004). The Ninth Circuit granted the motion. <em>Flores-Cruz v. Ashcroft, </em>Order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Granting Remand, No. 03-73885 (9th Cir. Nov.l, 2004). On remand, the BIA issued the order now on appeal. <em>In re Carlos Flores-Cruz, </em>No. A95 281 982, Phoenix (Aug. 2, 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">The government\u2019s motion to remand so that the BIA could \u201caddress\u201d the IJ\u2019s finding did not amount to a concession that Honduran street children form a particular social group. Our order stated only that the motion to remand to the BIA \u201cfor further consideration is granted.\u201d This broad language did not exclude any issue from reconsideration, and therefore the question of whether Honduran street children form a \u201cparticular social group\u201d was properly before the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Flores-Cruz argued that Honduran street children form a \u201cparticular social group\u201d in its initial brief before the BIA and, on remand, did not seek leave to file supplemental briefing on this issue. As part of its <em>de novo </em>review, this court received briefs and heard oral argument on this issue. Flores-Cruz\u2019s argument that he was not given an opportunity to address this issue fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">We recently held that \u201cyoung men in El Salvador resisting gang violence\u201d lacked the \u201cparticularity\u201d and \u201csocial visibility\u201d necessary to form a \u201cparticular social group\u201d under \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). <em>Santos-Lemus v. Mukasey, </em>542 F.3d 738, 745-46 (9th Cir.2008); <em>see also Ramos-Lopez v. Holder, </em>563 F.3d 855, 862 (9th Cir.2009) (holding that young Honduran men who resist gang recruitment do not constitute a particular social group). This decision was premised in part on two BIA decisions. In <em>Matter of S-E-G, </em>24 I <em>&amp; </em>N Dec. 579 (BIA 2008), the BIA concluded that \u201cEl Salvadoran youths who resisted gang recruitment\u201d did not constitute a \u201cparticular social group.\u201d Similarly, in <em>Matter of E-A-G, </em>24 I <em>&amp; </em>N Dec. 591 (BIA 2007)<footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the BIA held that \u201cyoung persons who are perceived to be affiliated with gangs\u201d and \u201cpersons resistant to gang membership\u201d do not constitute \u201cparticular social groups\u201d in Honduras.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">Applying these precedents, we hold that the BIA properly held that Honduran street children do not form a \u201cparticular social group\u201d under \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). Because they age out of the group and plausibly could relocate out of the cities where they are targeted, street children lack a \u201c \u2018common, immutable characteristic ... that members of the group either cannot change, or should not be required to change because it is fundamental to their individual identities or consciences.\u2019 \u201d <em>Matter of S-E-G, </em>24 I &amp; N Dec. at 583 (quoting <em>Matter of Acosta, </em>19 I &amp; N Dec. 211, 233 (BIA 1985)). While \u201cHonduran street children\u201d may have greater particularity than the young men who resisted gang violence in <em>Santos-Lemus, </em>they are nevertheless \u201ctoo loosely defined\u201d to meet the particularity requirement. 542 F.3d at 745.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-12\">Because we conclude that Honduran street children do not form a \u201cparticular social group,\u201d Flores-Cruz cannot seek asylum under \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) based on persecution or fear of persecution resulting from his membership in that group.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-13\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b541-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and except as provided by 9th Cir.
