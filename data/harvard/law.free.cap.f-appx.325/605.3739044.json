We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Kumar v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 931, 933 (9th Cir.2000), and we grant in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-16\">Substantial evidence does not support the agency\u2019s denial of asylum based on a finding that changed country conditions in Kenya rebutted the presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. The IJ did not provide an individualized analysis of how changed country conditions in Kenya will affect Munga\u2019s well-founded fear. <em>See Hanna v. Keisler, </em>506 F.3d 933, 938 (9th Cir.2007); <em>see also Mousa v. Mukasey, </em>530 F.3d 1025, 1030 (9th Cir.2008). In particular, the IJ did not consider Munga\u2019s statements that some of the same KANU members who persecuted him continue to be in power.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-17\">Further, substantial evidence does not support the agency\u2019s denial of withholding of removal. <em>See Baballah v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1067, 1079 (9th Cir.2004) (establishing past persecution raises a presumption of eligibility for withholding of removal).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-18\">Finally, substantial evidence does not support the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief, because it failed to consider all of the evidence in the record in assessing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>whether it is more likely than not Munga will be tortured if removed to Kenya. <em>See Nuru v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 1207, 1217-18 (9th Cir.2005) (evidence of past torture should be considered in evaluating the likelihood of future torture); <em>see also Ka-malthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279, 1282-84 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">We therefore remand to the agency for further proceedings to determine, after an individualized determination of changed country conditions, whether Munga is eligible for asylum, withholding of removal and CAT. <em>See Hanna, </em>506 F.3d at 938; <em>see also INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Munga\u2019s remaining contentions fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Judge Pregerson requests that pro bono counsel be appointed upon remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED in part and DENIED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b634-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
