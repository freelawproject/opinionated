LUCERO, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b737-25\">Sammy Lee Pendleton, proceeding pro se, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>his <em>Bivens </em>action. <em>See Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). Pendleton\u2019s complaint alleges that employees of the United States Penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas, used his name and Social Security number to steal $45 million from the United States Treasury. He further alleges that penitentiary employees tortured him, locked onto his brain with radar, and raped and murdered a staff member who warned Pendleton about the use of his Social Security number.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">The district court dismissed the complaint pursuant to its screening function under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, concluding that Pendleton\u2019s allegations were frivolous and \u201cdelusional.\u201d For substantially the same reasons given by the district court, we AFFIRM. We construe Pendleton\u2019s \u201cEvidence in Remedy/Brief in Pleading\u201d as a motion to file a supplemental appendix and DENY the motion because the submitted evidence has no bearing on our determination. All other pending motions are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b737-6\"> The case is unanimously ordered submitted without oral argument pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
