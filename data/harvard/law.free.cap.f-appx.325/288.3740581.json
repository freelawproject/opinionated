Page appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing with prejudice Page\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000) complaint alleging deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs and excessive force. His claims were referred to a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) (2006). The magistrate judge found Page\u2019s claims to be without merit, and recommended the district court deny relief. Page filed objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s findings with regard to Page\u2019s excessive force claim, but failed to object to the magistrate judge\u2019s deliberate indifference findings. The district court overruled Page\u2019s objections and dismissed with prejudice Page\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-15\">The timely filing of objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation is necessary to preserve appellate review of the substance of that recommendation when the parties have been warned that failure to object will waive appellate review. <em>See Wright v. Collins, </em>766 F.2d 841, 845-46 (4th Cir.1985). Accordingly, we find that Page has waived appellate review of the claim of deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. We affirm the judgment of the district court as to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-17\">Concerning the remainder of Page\u2019s appeal, we have reviewed the record, and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Page v. Reynolds, </em>No. 9:07-cv-03060-HFF, 2008 WL 4427324 (D.S.C. Sept. 29, 2008). We deny Page\u2019s motions to depose a witness and for summary disposition. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-18\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
