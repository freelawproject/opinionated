EBEL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b702-27\">Colorado state prisoner Ronald Hutchinson (\u201cHutchinson\u201d) appeals, pro se, from the district court\u2019s order dismissing his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>amended application for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The district court concluded that the application was barred by the one-year limitation period imposed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d). Thus, the district court did not reach the merits of Hutchinson\u2019s \u00a7 2254 application, which asserts that his August 22, 2005, sentences in Colorado cases 02CR1131 and 03CR2432 violated <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">We granted Hutchinson a certificate of appealability, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c), on the issue of whether his habeas application challenging the sentences imposed upon resentencing was timely under AEDPA, and requested briefing from the State of Colorado on this issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In its brief, Colorado argued that Hutchinson\u2019s application was not timely under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). (Resp\u2019t Br. at 4-14.) However, the State conceded that the application <em>was </em>timely under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D), because the claims in the application did not arise until Hutchinson\u2019s August 22, 2005, resentencing became final, on October 7, 2005. The State therefore requested that we \u201cvacate the order of dismissal and remand for consideration of the merits of Petitioner\u2019s claims.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">We agree with the State\u2019s concession under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D). Therefore, we need not decide whether Hutchinson\u2019s application for habeas relief was also timely under subsection (d)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">The district court\u2019s order dismissing the application as untimely is REVERSED, and the case is REMANDED to the district court for a consideration of the merits of Hutchinson\u2019s habeas claims challenging his sentences of August 22, 2005. Hutchinson\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in forma pau-peris </em>on this appeal is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b702-28\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to grant the parties\u2019 request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(f) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b703-21\">. We GRANT Hutchinson\u2019s motion to allow late filing of his Reply to the State's Answer Brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
