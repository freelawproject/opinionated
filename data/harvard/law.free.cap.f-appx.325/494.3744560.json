Although Martinez approved the judgment entered by the district court, the record reflects that she intended to pursue her appeal rights. Therefore, there was no waiver of appeal. <em>See U.A. Local 342 Apprenticeship &amp; Training Trust v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox, Construction Co., </em>396 F.3d 1056, 1058 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-16\">2. Martinez failed to raise a material issue of fact regarding her employment by the Los Angeles Community College District, rather than the County of Los Angeles (County), during the time relevant to her case. <em>See Hardage v. CBS Broadcasting Inc., </em>427 F.3d 1177, 1183 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201cThere is no issue for trial unless there is sufficient evidence favoring the nonmoving party for a jury to return a verdict for that party. If the evidence is merely colorable, or is not significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted.\u201d) (citation and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-17\">3. Because Martinez was not employed by the County, summary judgment was properly awarded to the defendants, as her claims were all predicated on an employment relationship. <em>See Jones v. County of Los Angeles, </em>99 Cal.App.4th 1039, 1045, 121 Cal.Rptr.2d 621 (2002); <em>see also Blair v. City of Pomona, </em>223 F.3d 1074, 1079 (9th Cir.2000), <em>as amended </em>(\u201cTo establish \u00a7 1983 liability on the part of the [County] under <em>Monell v. Dept. of Social Services, </em>436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978),\u201d a plaintiff must show that she was deprived of a constitutional right \u201cby an <em>adverse employment action </em>... \u201d) (emphasis added) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b523-14\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
