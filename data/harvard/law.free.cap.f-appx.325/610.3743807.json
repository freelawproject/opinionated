Petitioner claims derivative citizenship through his father.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(5). <em>Minasyan v. Gonzales, </em>401 F.3d 1069, 1074 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-19\">The derivative citizenship statute in effect on March 3,1967, when petitioner was born, determines his nationality and citizenship. <em>Chau v. INS, </em>247 F.3d 1026, 1028 n. 3 (9th Cir.2001); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(a)(7) (1967). We previously found that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether petitioner\u2019s father was physically present in the United States for a period totaling ten years, with five of those years after age fourteen. We transferred this action to the district court for a de novo hearing and decision regarding nationality and held the petition for review in abeyance pending the district court\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(5)(B); <em>Chau, </em>247 F.3d at 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-21\">After conducting a de novo evidentiary hearing, the district court held that petitioner had not established that his father was physically present in the United States for the requisite number of years. The parties agree that the district court\u2019s decision resolves the only issue before this court and establishes that petitioner is not entitled to derivative citizenship.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-22\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b639-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b639-24\">.
