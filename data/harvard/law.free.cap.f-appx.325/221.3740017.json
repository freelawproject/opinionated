The district court\u2019s order was entered on September 2, 2008, 2008 WL 4133853. Saunders\u2019 notice of appeal was filed on January 26, 2009.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In his notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>of appeal, Saunders states that he did not receive notice of the district court\u2019s order until January 26, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Where the United States is a party to a civil action, the parties are accorded sixty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)); see <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 2366, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Saunders\u2019 notice of appeal is clearly untimely. However, under Rule 4(a)(6), the district court may reopen the time to file an appeal if: (1) the moving party did not receive notice of the entry of the order within twenty-one days after entry; (2) the motion is filed within 180 days of entry of the judgment or order or within seven days of receiving notice from the court, whichever is earlier; and (3) no party would be prejudiced. We accordingly remand to the district court to determine whether Saunders is entitled under Rule 4(a)(6) to the reopening of the appeal period. The record, as supplemented, will then be returned to this court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">\n<em>REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b249-7\"> For the purpose of this appeal, we assume that the date appearing on the notice of appeal is the earliest date it could have been properly delivered to prison officials for mailing to the court. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(c)(1); <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
