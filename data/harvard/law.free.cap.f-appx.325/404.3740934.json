Carter argues on appeal that the government failed to comply with the statutory requirements that must be met before the enhanced mandatory minimum may apply. For the following reasons we conclude that the district court did not plainly err in sentencing Carter according to the enhanced mandatory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-23\">Carter was indicted on four counts and ultimately pleaded guilty to two of them: possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and being a felon in possession of a firearm, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). After the plea hearing but before sentencing, Carter absconded. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Fourteen months later the police captured him, and he was sentenced on January 16, 2008. At the sentencing hearing, the district court determined that the applicable advisory guideline range was between 210 and 262 months, based on a total offense level of 34 and a criminal history category of IV. A violation of \u00a7 841(a)(1) carries a mandatory minimum of 120 months, unless the offender has a prior drug conviction, in which case the mandatory minimum doubles to 240 months. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). The presentence report listed a 1999 conviction in Ohio state court for possession of cocaine, and therefore Carter\u2019s drug charge carried a \u201cmandatory minimum sentence of 240 months, which would be the advisory guideline sentence in this matter.\u201d The court agreed that the 240 month mandatory minimum applied, and Carter did not object. The court sentenced him to 240 months on both counts, to run concurrently, followed by ten years of supervised release. Carter now appeals his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The basis for this appeal is the fact that the enhanced 240 month mandatory minimum sentence does not automatically apply to a defendant just because he has a prior drug conviction; the government must first put the defendant on notice that it plans to seek such an enhancement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-7\">No person who stands convicted of an offense under [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841] shall be sentenced to increased punishment by reason of one or more prior convictions, unless before trial, or before entry of a plea of guilty, the United States attorney files an information with the court (and serves a copy of such information on the person or counsel for the person) stating in writing the previous convictions to be relied upon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a)(1). \u201cThe requirements delineated in \u00a7 851 are mandatory, and a district court cannot enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence based on a prior conviction unless the government satisfies the requirements.\u201d <em>United States v. Odeneal, </em>517 F.3d 406, 415 (6th Cir.2008). Carter argues that the government failed to file the requisite \u00a7 851 information, and so the enhanced 240-month mandatory minimum should not apply to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">The sufficiency of an \u00a7 851 information is a question of law that we ordinarily review <em>de novo, Odeneal, </em>517 F.3d at 415, but because Carter failed to object, we review his sentence for plain error. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>512 F.3d 285, 288 (6th Cir.2008). \u201cA forfeited \u2018plain error\u2019 may be corrected by the appellate court only if it \u2018affects substantial rights\u2019 and \u2018seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">Although the requirements of \u00a7 851 are mandatory, \u201cit is also well-settled precedent in this Circuit and its sister circuits that section 851 \u201cwas designed to satisfy the requirements of due process and provide the defendant with reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard regarding the possibility of an enhanced sentence for recidivism.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Pritchett, </em>496 F.3d 537, 548 (6th Cir.2007) (citing <em>United States v. King, </em>127 F.3d 483, 489 (6th Cir.1997)). Our \u00a7 851 analyses uniformly strive to \u201cavoid elevating form over substance,\u201d <em>King, </em>127 F.3d at 489, so the resolution of this claim turns on the practical consideration of whether Carter was provided with adequate notice that the government intended to rely on his prior drug conviction to enhance his sentence, and an opportunity to be heard regarding the same. In our view, he was.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">The government concedes that it did not file a separate information, but argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>it effectively satisfied \u00a7 851\u2019s notice requirements through various portions of the plea agreement and plea hearing. Paragraph 2(A) of the plea agreement provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQrY\">For the reason that Mr. Carter has a final, felony drug conviction in his history, the maximum statutory penalties to which Mr. Carter will be exposed by virtue of his plea of guilty to Count Five is imprisonment for twenty years to life ... and at least ten years supervised release [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATi\">(alteration in original). Paragraph 7 again references the enhanced penalty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-4\">7. \u00a7 851 Information</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-5\">A. The United States alleges that Mr. Carter was convicted of Possession of cocaine, a third degree felony under Ohio Revised Code 2925(11) in the Court of Common Pleas for Summit County, Ohio. The defendant was represented by counsel and plead [sic] guilty to this offense on February 2, 1999, in case number CR 1998 11 2972. He was sentenced in an order of the Court of Common Pleas on March 2,1999.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">B. The defendant agrees that he was convicted as alleged in paragraph 7.A. above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">Furthermore, during the plea hearing the district court reviewed the plea agreement in detail with Carter, confirming that he understood \u201cthat the maximum possible statutory penalty for [the \u00a7 841(a)(1) drug charge] is imprisonment of 20 years to life.\u201d The court also brought to Carter\u2019s attention paragraphs 7(A) &amp; (B) of the plea agreement, reprinted above, and Carter acknowledged that he had, in fact, been convicted of the crime discussed therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">In light of (1) the repeated emphasis in the plea agreement and plea hearing on a sentence of twenty years to life; (2) the statement in paragraph 2(A) of the plea agreement that he was receiving this twenty year sentence \u201c[f]or the reason that\u201d he had a prior drug conviction, (3) the paragraph in the plea agreement entitled \u201c \u00a7 851 Information,\u201d (4) the unequivocal reference in that same paragraph to Carter\u2019s prior drug conviction, and (5) Carter\u2019s opportunity to dispute that conviction during the plea hearing, we hold that it was not plain error for the district court to determine that the requirements of \u00a7 851 were satisfied, and sentence Carter accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
