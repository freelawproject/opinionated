He argued that his convictions violated the Double Jeopardy Clause because they subjected him to multiple punishments based on the same evidence and course of conduct, that the verdicts were inconsistent, and that he is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>actually innocent of the crimes of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Because Purnell challenged errors that occurred at or before sentencing, his claim could not be asserted in a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877 (5th Cir.2000). Moreover, Purnell has not met his burden of showing that he is entitled to proceed under \u00a7 2241 via the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 solely because his first \u00a7 2255 motion was dismissed as untimely. <em>See Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2000). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Purnell\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b338-15\"> Pursuant to Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
