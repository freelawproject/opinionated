He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>also seeks review from the BIA\u2019s order denying relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1208.16, 1208.18. The BIA based its decision entirely upon the oral opinion and order of an immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d). Because we conclude based on the whole record that the IJ\u2019s determinations were based upon (1) correct applications of the law, and (2) substantial evidence, we deny the petition. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (upholding on review BIA\u2019s dismissal of petitioner\u2019s request for asylum and for withholding of deportation, because his evidence was not \u201cso compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">First, the petitioner failed to establish that his problems were on account of a protected ground, or because he belonged to a protected group. He failed in this respect to show cognizable past persecution. The record is devoid of any evidence that either Wu or his family in China have ever been harassed, or that the Chinese government has any interest in him.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">As to whether petitioner established a well-founded fear of future persecution based upon a protected ground, here, too, his evidence was unconvincing\u2014 to quote the IJ, his evidence was \u201cweak\u201d and not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Accordingly, the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s conclusion that petitioner failed to establish his status as a \u201crefugee\u201d is well supported by the evidence. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">Second, and for the same reasons, petitioner failed to demonstrate \u201ca clear probability\u201d that he will be persecuted on account of a protected ground in the country to which he will be removed. <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 413, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984). Thus, he is not eligible for mandatory withholding of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">Third, protection under CAT requires a showing that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that an applicant will be tortured in the country of removal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2). Although the reason for asserted torture need not arise in connection with a protected ground, the potential torture must be inflicted by or at the instigation of or with consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.18(a)(1), (a)(6). Inasmuch as petitioner\u2019s evidence in support of his CAT claim is the same as his evidence related to asylum and withholding is one and the same, it, too, does not demonstrate that he is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d to be tortured in China.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">It may be that he might be prosecuted for crimes, but the record evidence does not show that such proceedings would amount to torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-12\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b545-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
