On appeal, Garcia argues that his sentence is unreasonable because the court improperly used Garcia\u2019s alienage as a factor and failed to properly weigh the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Specifically, Garcia argues that several factors in this case warranted a substantial downward variance to the statutory minimum sentence of 120 months, including: (1) Garcia\u2019s difficult childhood, (2) the fact that Garcia will be deported for this conviction, (3) a sentence at the level set by the career offender guideline will not promote respect for the law, (4) his prior punishments were minor in comparison to his punishment for this offense, and (5) his criminal history is overstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">We review the sentence imposed by a district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 765, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). First, we must ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). If the district court\u2019s sentencing decision is proeedurally sound, we then review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>A sentence may be substantively unreasonable if it \u201cdoes not achieve the purposes of sentencing stated in \u00a7 3553(a),\u201d if it is based on an impermissible factor, or if \u201cthe district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191-1192 (11th Cir.2008) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-14\">Pursuant to \u00a7 3553(a), the sentencing court shall impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to (1) reflect the seriousness of the offense, (2) promote respect for the law, (3) provide just punishment for the offense, (4) deter criminal conduct, (5) protect the public from future crimes of the defendant, and (6) provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The sentencing court must also consider the following factors in determining a particular sentence: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the kinds of sentences available; (3) the guidelines range; (4) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (5) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>disparities; and (6) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">The appellant has the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). While a sentence within the guideline range is not <em>per se </em>reasonable, this Court ordinarily expects such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">We conclude from the record that Garcia\u2019s 262-month sentence is reasonable because the district court did not consider an impermissible factor, properly weighed the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a), and sentenced Garcia at the low end of the guideline range. Accordingly, we affirm Garcia\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
