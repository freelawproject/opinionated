He argues that the district court erred in imposing a four-level increase pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(7)(B) based upon its finding that Gomez had inflicted \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d on detained alien Rafael Sandoval-Trujillo (Sandoval).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-14\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), sentences are reviewed for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519-20 (5th Cir.2005). Pursuant to <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), when challenged on appeal, this court must determine whether the sentence imposed is procedurally sound, including whether the calculation of the advisory guidelines range is correct, and whether the sentence imposed is substantively reasonable. Review is for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 597. Gomez challenges only the determination that his victim suffered \u201cserious bodily injury,\u201d adding four levels to his base offense level for sentencing guidelines purposes, rather than a mere \u201cbodily injury,\u201d which would add only two levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-15\">\u201cNeither <em>Gall, Rita v. United States, </em>[551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007),] nor <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>[552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007),] purport to alter [this court\u2019s] review of the district court\u2019s construction of the Guidelines or findings of fact.\u201d <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutier-rez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008) (footnotes omitted). Accordingly, \u201c[a] district court\u2019s interpretation or application of the Sentencing Guidelines is reviewed de novo, and its factual findings ... are reviewed for clear error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The severity of a victim\u2019s injury is a question of fact and is reviewed for clear error. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>19 F.3d 166, 171 (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Cir.1994). \u201cA factual finding is not clearly erroneous if it is plausible in light of the record read as a whole.\u201d <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Section 2L1.1 provides for a two-level increase when any person sustains \u201cbodily injury,\u201d and a four-level increase when any person sustains \u201cserious bodily injury,\u201d during the smuggling, transporting, or harboring of an illegal alien. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(7)(A) and (B). For purposes of the Guidelines, bodily injury means \u201cany significant injury; e.g., an injury that is painful and obvious, or is of a type for which medical attention ordinarily would be sought.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1, comment. (n.l(B)). Serious bodily injury means \u201cinjury involving extreme physical pain <em>or </em>the protracted impairment of a function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty; <em>or </em>requiring medical intervention such as surgery, hospitalization, or physical rehabilitation.\u201d \u00a7 1B1.1, comment. (n.l(L)) (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">According to the presentence report (PSR), Gomez told Sandoval to disrobe and ordered that he be tied up. Gomez and other conspirators hit and kicked Sandoval. One of the conspirators hit Sandoval on his body and head with a wooden closet rod. The rod broke in half when Sandoval was hit with it on his shin. Sandoval was then placed in a closet and a conspirator pointed a firearm at Sandoval\u2019s head and threatened him. Roughly 10 minutes later, another conspirator opened the closet door and began to punch and kick Sandoval. The conspirator\u2019s foot made a hole in the closet wall. One of the kicks landed on the right side of Sandoval\u2019s face, near his jaw. His jaw was apparently displaced or broken. Sandoval was unable to eat for four days following the beating and continued to suffer from earaches at the time that the PSR was written. Sandoval was left tied up and nude in the closet overnight. The district court was entitled to rely on these facts. <em>See United States v. Caldwell, </em>448 F.3d 287, 291 n. 1 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">In light of the injuries described above, we cannot say that the district court\u2019s finding that Sandoval suffered serious bodily injury is not \u201cplausible in light of the record read as a whole.\u201d <em>Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 203; <em>see Davis, </em>19 F.3d at 168-69, 171 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b344-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
