Although Monzon-Ortega suffered some economic detriment because of the guerillas\u2019 extortion scheme, \u201cmere economic disadvantage alone does not rise to the level of persecution.\u201d <em>Gormley v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 1172, 1178 (9th Cir.2004); <em>see also Baballah v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1067, 1075-76 (9th Cir.2004); <em>Kovac v. INS, </em>407 F.2d 102, 107 (9th Cir.1969). Monzon-Ortega was not physically harmed and was able, despite the guerillas, to earn a living.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-17\">Likewise, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Mejia-Monzon did not establish past persecution. Threats alone, to be a basis for asylum, must be \u201cso menacing as to cause significant actual \u2018suffering or harm.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lim v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 929, 936 (9th Cir.2000). Guerrillas attempted to recruit MejiaMonzon two times and during one of those efforts, some guerillas called him \u201ccowardly\u201d and threatened to kidnap him at some point in the future. These threats were not menacing enough to establish past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-18\">Because neither Monzon-Ortega nor Mejia-Monzon established past persecution, they must demonstrate a \u201csubjectively genuine\u201d and \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d well-founded fear of future persecution \u201cby a showing of \u2018a good reason to fear future persecution\u2019 based on \u2018credible, direct, and specific evidence in the record of facts....\u2019\u201d <em>Zhao v. Mukasey, </em>540 F.3d 1027, 1029 (9th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Ladha v. INS, </em>215 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir.2000)). Monzon-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Ortega and Mejia-Monzon\u2019s testimony-satisfied the subjective component of this determination. <em>Garcia-Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 1066, 1077 (9th Cir.2004). Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that MonzonOrtega failed to establish an \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d fear of persecution because of the 1995 peace treaty. Likewise, there is no specific evidence that the guerillas will seek out Mejia-Monzon based on his refusal to join them in 1995, especially now that the civil war fought by the guerillas is over. Monzon-Ortega\u2019s and Mejia-Monzon\u2019s failure to meet the more lenient requirements for asylum forecloses withholding of removal from Guatemala. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003). Similarly, they have failed to establish a clear probability that they will be tortured if they return to Guatemala. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b575-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
