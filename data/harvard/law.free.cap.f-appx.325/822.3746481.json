We granted a certificate of appealability on the following issue only: \u201cWhether the district court erred in denying appellant\u2019s claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to fully advise Scott of potential sentences during plea negotiations, where counsel and appellant\u2019s allegations conflicted, and no evidentiary hearing was held.\u201d Scott argues his attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to advise him fully during plea negotiations as to the possibilities for avoiding a mandatory life sentence pursuant to a 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 enhancement, thus denying him the opportunity to make a knowing and voluntary decision as to whether to plead guilty. He further contends the district court was required to hold an evidentiary hearing because his attorney\u2019s affidavit directly contradicted his allegations and the evi-dentiary hearing would have given Scott the opportunity to prove those allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>In a \u00a7 2255 proceeding, we review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its legal conclusions <em>de novo. Devine v. United States, </em>520 F.3d 1286, 1287 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cA claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is a mixed question of law and fact that we review <em>de novo.\u201d Id. </em>Denial of an evidentiary hearing is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Aron v. United States, </em>291 F.3d 708, 714 n. 5 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">In <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), the Supreme Court set out a two-part inquiry for ineffective assistance of counsel claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-5\">First, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u201ccounsel\u201d guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 2064. A habeas petitioner claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must succeed on both prongs of the <em>Strickland </em>test. <em>Butcher v. United States, </em>368 F.3d 1290, 1293 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">The <em>Strickland </em>test applies to challenges of guilty pleas, as well as to convictions by jury. <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 106 S.Ct. 366, 370, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985). In this context, the first prong of <em>Strickland </em>requires the defendant to show his plea was not voluntary because he received advice from counsel that was not within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases. <em>See id. </em>at 369-70. The second prong \u201cfocuses on whether counsel\u2019s constitutionally ineffective performance affected the outcome of the plea process,\u201d meaning the defendant must show \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors,\u201d he would have entered a different plea. <em>Id. </em>at 370 (stating the test in the context of an accepted guilty plea); <em>see also Diaz v. United States, </em>930 F.2d 832, 835 (11th Cir.1991) (applying the test to a rejected plea agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-10\">The district court \u201cshall\u201d hold an eviden-tiary hearing on a habeas petition \u201c[ujnless the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(b). \u201c[I]f the petitioner \u2018alleges facts that, if true, would entitle him to relief, then the district court should order an evidentiary hearing and rule on the merits of his claim.\u2019 \u201d <em>Aron, </em>291 F.3d at 714-15 (quoting <em>Holmes v. United States, </em>876 F.2d 1545, 1552 (11th Cir.1989)). Yet the \u201cdistrict court is not required to hold an evi-dentiary hearing where the petitioner\u2019s allegations are affirmatively contradicted by the record, or the claims are patently frivolous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 715. Thus, the petitioner needs to allege \u201creasonably specific, non-conclusory facts that, if true, would entitle him to relief. If the allegations are not affirmatively contradicted by the record and the claims are not patently frivolous,\u201d the requirement of an evidentiary hearing is triggered and the petitioner must offer proof at that hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 715 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-11\">Scott\u2019s brief in support of his \u00a7 2255 motion alleges only that his counsel failed to advise him that he supposedly could have avoided a life sentence by entering a guilty plea without a plea agreement before the Government had an opportunity to file an \u00a7 851 information.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>Scott\u2019s argument assumes a non-negotiated plea would have prevented the Government from requesting the \u00a7 851 enhancement, but Scott provides no support for this proposition. Instead, he only notes, \u201cit is common practice to negotiate that a sentencing enhancement not be filed where the defendant agrees to enter a guilty plea.\u201d Scott\u2019s brief in support of his \u00a7 2255 motion, however, does not allege the Government was amenable to such a negotiation in the absence of a cooperation agreement. Nor does it allege any other \u201creasonably specific, non-eonclusory facts\u201d to indicate his counsel gave him constitutionally ineffective advice. <em>Aron, </em>291 F.3d at 715 n. 6. The district court, thus, did not abuse its discretion in finding Scott was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing, and it did not err in concluding Scott\u2019s motion failed the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">The district court also did not err in finding Scott had failed to satisfy the second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>inquiry. Scott attempts to demonstrate prejudice by suggesting he would have given a guilty plea greater consideration if his counsel had advised him differently and by stating he could have received a lower sentence if he had pled guilty without a plea agreement. In <em>Diaz, </em>we concluded a petitioner had failed to establish prejudice when he argued a guilty plea would have resulted in a lower sentence and offered \u201cafter the fact testimony concerning his desire to plead.\u201d 930 F.2d at 835. In this case, Scott only goes so far as to say he should have been able to take the lower sentence into account when deciding whether to plead guilty. Considered in conjunction with his counsel\u2019s affidavit, which indicated Scott strongly advocated his innocence and was not amenable to pleading otherwise, Scott\u2019s argument does not establish a reasonable probability he would actually have pled differently but for his counsel\u2019s alleged advice. <em>See id. </em>at 834-35. Thus, Scott\u2019s argument is insufficient to make the required showing for <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>second prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-11\">In sum, Scott has failed to show that he was entitled to relief or that the district court abused its discretion in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing. Accordingly, we uphold the district court\u2019s denial of Scott\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b853-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b852-8\">.
