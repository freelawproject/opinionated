(Way Cool) under the Fair Labor Standards Act (\u201cFLSA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(b) and Florida law. The district court.granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on September 25, 2007, and entered a final judgment pursuant to that order on October 28, 2007. On November 19, 2007, the defendants moved the court to impose sanctions against Murray, pursuant to Fla. Stat. \u00a7 448.08, and against her counsel, Cathleen Scott, P.A. and Cathleen Scott (collectively \u201cScott\u201d), pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In an order entered on April 23, 2008, the court denied the motion as it applied to Murray, but granted the motion as it applied to her counsel and ordered counsel to pay the defendants $23,375 in attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Scott now appeals the court\u2019s imposition of the \u00a7 1927 sanctions; the defendants cross-appeal the court\u2019s denial of sanctions against Murray. We consider first Scott\u2019s appeal, then the defendants\u2019 cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-13\">Scotts argues that the court abused its discretion in imposing sanctions under \u00a7 1927 without holding an evidentiary hearing. In the district court, Scott did not object to the court\u2019s failure to hold an evidentiary hearing; rather, she raises the issue for the first time on appeal. We do not consider on appeal issues not raised in the district court. <em>See e.g., BUC Int\u2019l Corp. v. Int\u2019l Yacht Council Ltd., </em>489 F.3d 1129, 1140 (11th Cir.2007). The issue before us, then, is whether the district court abused its discretion in holding Scott amenable to sanction under \u00a7 1927. <em>Schwartz v. Millon Air, Inc., </em>341 F.3d 1220 (11th Cir.2003). We find no abuse of discretion. The record fully supports the reasons the court articulated in its April 23, 2008 order as the bases for the action it took, and therefore affirm its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-14\">We likewise find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s decision denying sanctions against Murray. Under \u00a7 448.08, \u201c[t]he court may award to the prevailing party in an action for unpaid wages costs of the action and a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 448.08. \u201cSection 448.08 is clear and unambiguous on its face: there must be \u2018an action <em>for back wages\u2019 </em>to implicate the statutory entitle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>ment.\u201d <em>Dade County v. Pena, </em>664 So.2d 959 (Fla.1995) (citation omitted). Unpaid commissions are considered wages under \u00a7 448.08. <em>Gulf Solar, Inc. v. Westfall, </em>447 So.2d 363, 367 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">\u201c[B]y virtue of [a] summary judgment [order] entered adverse to [an employee] on his claim for unpaid wages or salary, [the employer] is [the] prevailing party under [Fla. Stat. \u00a7 448.08], and is, therefore, entitled to attorney\u2019s fees\u201d. <em>Sentinel Enters., Inc. v. Stankiewicz, </em>545 So.2d 288, 289 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1989). However, \u201c[Fla. Stat. \u00a7 ] 448.08 attorney\u2019s fees do not apply to [claims brought as] independent contractors.\u201d <em>Goodwin v. Blu Murray Ins. Agency, Inc., </em>939 So.2d 1098, 1102-03 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2006); <em>see also Caldwell-Davis Constr. Corp. v. Hoover, </em>461 So.2d 973, 973 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1984) (holding that Fla. Stat. \u00a7 448.08 only applies to actions brought by an \u201cemployee\u201d to recover \u201cunpaid wages\u201d). As the district court properly found, Murray was an independent contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b902-10\">. Section 1927 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-11\">Any attorney or other person admitted to conduct cases in any court of the United States or any Territory thereof who so multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously may be required by the court to satisfy personally the excess costs, expenses, and attorneys\u2019 fees reasonably incurred because of such conduct.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b902-15\">.
