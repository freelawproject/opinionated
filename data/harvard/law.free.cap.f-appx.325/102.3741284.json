Corbin pled not guilty to both counts. The case proceeded to trial, and on May 9, 2007, a jury acquitted Corbin on Count One and convicted him on Count Two.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-14\">During the course of the trial, Corbin testified in his own defense and acknowledged, <em>inter alia, </em>(i) that during a November 11, 2006, phone conversation with his ex-girlfriend, who is also the mother of his son, Corbin threatened to kill her and her family; and (ii) that during a November 18, 2006, phone conversation with the same ex-girlfriend, he referred to \u201cstolen bank money\u201d he obtained when he had previously \u201crobbed the banks.\u201d Appellant\u2019s App. (App.) 190-192, 364. With respect to the threat to kill his ex-girlfriend and her family, Corbin testified that he never intended to follow through; rather, he claimed that the death threat was an overly emotional reaction to the former couple\u2019s ongoing dispute regarding the care, custody, and visitation of their son. With respect to the bank robbery references, Corbin testified that he had never robbed any banks; rather, he claimed that he used the word \u201cbank\u201d as slang for a narcotics \u201cstash house\u201d and that he had robbed such stash houses on multiple previous occasions. <em>Id. </em>at 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-15\">Following the jury\u2019s guilty verdict on Count Two, a presentence investigation report (PSR) was prepared. The PSR calculated Corbin\u2019s total offense level for the count of conviction as 12 and his criminal history category as I, resulting in an advisory Guidelines range of 10 to 16 months.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On January 8, 2008, Corbin appeared for sentencing, at which point the government urged the District Court to impose a variant sentence above the advisory Guidelines range. Specifically, the government argued that a variant sentence closer to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>60-month statutory maximum was justified by a proper weighing of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors because, <em>inter alia, </em>(i) \u201cthe venom, the hatred, [and] the animosity\u201d of the threatening communication in this case warranted increased punishment; and (ii) the District Court should consider the acquitted conduct charged in Count One, which the government argued had been proven by a preponderance of the evidence, in evaluating Corbin\u2019s history and personal characteristics. <em>Id. </em>at 309.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Corbin objected to the government\u2019s request, both on the basis that the government had not provided prior notice of its intention to seek a variant sentence and on the basis that proper weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors did not justify a variant sentence in this case. Corbin, by counsel, argued that the District Court should consider various mitigating factors, including Corbin\u2019s mental health problems and physical abuse he suffered as a child. After hearing from both parties, the District Court observed that the advisory Guidelines range appeared \u201cinadequate for punishment for this defendant\u201d and that it was necessary to \u201cconsider how close to the [five-year] maximum this sentence should be.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 311-12. In light of those views, the District Court continued the sentencing and afforded both parties an opportunity to submit written memo-randa on the questions presented by the government\u2019s request for a variant sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The parties complied, and approximately five weeks later, on February 13, 2008, Corbin reappeared for sentencing. The government again urged imposition of a variant sentence above the advisory Guidelines range and near the five-year statutory maximum, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>(i) that the seriousness of this particular offense\u2014 a death threat\u2014justified increased punishment; (ii) that the acquitted conduct charged in Count One, which was proven by a preponderance of the evidence at trial, warranted a longer term of incarceration; and (iii) that Corbin\u2019s history and characteristics\u2014including his claim when testifying in his own defense that he had robbed drug stash houses on multiple occasions\u2014suggested that an increased term of imprisonment was necessary to protect the public. Corbin responded, by counsel, arguing that a variant sentence was not justified, <em>inter alia, </em>because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-8\">(i) consideration of acquitted conduct would violate his Sixth Amendment jury trial rights;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-9\">(ii) the convicted offense conduct was a result of \u201cextreme frustration based on the fact that [the ex-girlfriend] was unwilling to let Mr. Corbin see their child\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-10\">(iii) Corbin never intended to carry out the threat;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-11\">(iv) Corbin turned himself in to authorities upon learning of the warrant issued for his arrest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-12\">(v) Corbin was depressed in November 2006 as a result of his mother\u2019s March 2006 passing; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-13\">(vi) Corbin suffered both from childhood physical \u2022 abuse and from severe emotional problems.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 328. In addition, during the course of allocution, Corbin discussed that during his incarceration pending trial and sentencing, he had sought out counseling, been put on psychotropic medications, and received treatment for his emotional and mental problems. The District Court questioned Corbin -with respect to whether he provided financial support to his son, and Corbin acknowledged that although he occasionally provided some support, his ex-girlfriend was his son\u2019s primary provider.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-15\">Following allocution, the District Court imposed a 50-month term of incarceration. In discussing the basis for the sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>imposed, the District Court first observed that \u00a7 3553 requires a sentence that, looking to the seriousness of the offense conduct, both promotes respect for the law and provides just punishment for the offense. In that respect, the District Court cited the \u201cintensity\u201d and \u201cserious\u201d nature of Corbin\u2019s threat to kill his ex-girlfriend and her family as warranting increased punishment. <em>Id. </em>at 336. In addition, the District Court rejected Corbin\u2019s proffered justification for his actions\u2014that he was emotionally distraught over not seeing his son\u2014because the District Court found the explanation was belied both by Corbin\u2019s decisions \u201cnot to work[ ] [and] not to take responsibility as a father\u201d and by Corbin\u2019s apparent \u201cfeel[ing] that he shouldn\u2019t have to go to the trouble of coming to visit his son.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 337. The District Court also emphasized that the sentence imposed must both \u201cafford adequate deterren[ce]\u201d and \u201cprotect the public from further crimes of this defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In that regard, the District Court noted an \u201coverall impression\u201d of Corbin that was \u201cnegative[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 336, 337. The District Court based this observation primarily on Corbin\u2019s \u201clack of character\u201d and \u201clack of maturity\u201d that became evident during his trial testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 337. Although the District Court noted both the need to avoid \u201cunwarranted sentence disparities among ... defendants with similar records\u201d and the reality that Corbin did \u201cnot have a criminal history that would prompt the Court to punish him as a repeat offender,\u201d the District Court found that Cor-bin\u2019s testimony demonstrated a \u201cproclivity to violence\u201d that warranted a longer term of incarceration. <em>Id. </em>at 338. Specifically, the District Court found that Corbin\u2019s willingness during his trial testimony to claim \u201cin a very relaxed way\u201d that he had committed prior criminal acts justified an increased term of imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>With respect to the acquitted conduct charged in Count One, the District Court observed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-5\">Now, the acquitted conduct, the bank robbery in New Jersey for which the jury did not find proof beyond a reasonable doubt, certainly there was proof by a preponderance of the evidence.... But I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s necessary to rely upon that in imposing a higher than [Guideline sentence in this case because [Corbin] revealed such a lack of maturity, a lack of self-control, a lack of personal values when he testified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 337-38. Finally, the District Court observed that Corbin was \u201cin need of correctional treatment\u201d and that \u201cit would be helpful, clearly, for [Corbin] to have the benefit of the kind of counseling and corrective treatment that he could receive\u201d during any period of incarceration. <em>Id. </em>at 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Corbin filed his timely notice of appeal the next day, and four days later, the District Court filed a written explanation of reasons for the variant sentence imposed. The District Court essentially reiterated the bases elucidated at the sentencing hearing, including, <em>inter alia, </em>(i) Corbin\u2019s \u201cviolent volatile personality\u201d and \u201clack of personal values\u201d; (ii) the \u201chypocritical\u201d nature of Corbin\u2019s explanation for his actions, which the District Court found to be part of \u201ca struggle for power or a self-image struggle rather than a display of fatherly love or frustration\u201d; and (iii) Corbin\u2019s \u201cunwillingness to take responsibility for his actions[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6. The written explanation confirmed that the District Court imposed the variant sentence \u201cwithout relying upon\u201d the acquitted conduct charged in Count One, and the District Court again observed that Corbin \u201cwould benefit from anger management counseling and parental responsibility counseling\u201d while incarcerated. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>ii.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">We exercise appellate jurisdiction over Corbin\u2019s claims of sentencing error under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). Our standard of review differs based on whether the alleged sentencing error was raised below. If so, we review for abuse of discretion; if not, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Lloyd, </em>469 F.3d 319, 320 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Where we review for abuse of discretion, \u201cour role is two-fold.\u201d <em>United States v. Wise, </em>515 F.3d 207, 217 (3d Cir.2008). First, we must \u201censure that the district court committed no significant procedural error\u201d in imposing sentence. <em>Id. </em>Second, \u201c[i]f we determine that the district court has committed no significant procedural error, we then review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 218. With respect to the first inquiry, a district court commits significant procedural error by, <em>inter alia,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence\u2014including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-8\"><em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), <em>quoted in Wise, </em>515 F.3d at 217. Of course, \u201cwe do not defer to a district court when the asserted procedural error is purely legal,\u201d and. \u201ca district court will be held to have abused its discretion if its decision was based on ... an erroneous legal conclusion.\u201d <em>Wise, </em>515 F.3d at 217 (citing <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 100, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996)). With respect to the second inquiry\u2014review of a sentence\u2019s substantive reasonableness\u2014we review for abuse of discretion \u201cregardless of whether [the sentence] falls within the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 218 (citing <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597). Accordingly, \u201c[a]s long as a sentence falls within the broad range of possible sentences that can be considered reasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we must affirm.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">Where we review for plain error, we have described the analysis as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5m_\">There must be an error that is plain and that affects substantial rights. The deviation from a legal rule is error, and an error is plain if it is clear or obvious. In most cases, an error affects substantial rights if it is prejudicial, <em>ie., </em>affected the outcome of the district court proceedings .... We will exercise our discretion and vacate the sentence if the plain error affecting substantial rights also seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-11\"><em>United States v. Evans, </em>155 F.3d 245, 251 (3d Cir.1998) (internal quotations and citations omitted), <em>quoted in United States v. Voelker, </em>489 F.3d 139, 153-54 (3d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-12\">With these principles in mind, we turn to Corbin\u2019s allegations of sentencing error.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-14\">Corbin\u2019s first argument, distilled to its essence, is that the District Court committed significant procedural error by imposing sentence based on Corbin\u2019s personal values, character, maturity level, and attitude towards personal relationships\u2014factors that Corbin argues are irrelevant under \u00a7 3553(a). We disagree. Specifically, we see no distinction between \u00a7 3553(a)(l)\u2019s specific mandate that district courts consider the \u201chistory and characteristics of the defendant\u201d and the District Court\u2019s evaluation in this case of Corbin\u2019s values, character, maturity level, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>and attitude towards personal relationships. Indeed, it is clear that the District Court\u2019s findings with respect to Corbin\u2019s history and personal characteristics were relevant to the determination that a variant sentence was necessary to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to afford adequate deterrence, and to protect the public. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)-(C). Specifically, the District Court relied upon an assessment of Corbin\u2019s credibility in rejecting his \u201chypocritical\u201d attempt to mitigate the seriousness of his offense conduct by arguing that he made the threats out of frustration and love for his son. App. 6. The Distinct Court also relied on observations about Corbin\u2019s values, character, and maturity level in finding that his \u201cproclivity to violence\u201d justified an increased sentence for both deterrence and incapacitation purposes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, because the District Court\u2019s consideration of Corbin\u2019s values, character, maturity level, and attitude towards personal relationships was consistent with \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s mandates, we find no procedural error\u2014let alone a significant procedural error\u2014in this regard.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">We find Corbin\u2019s second argument\u2014that the District Court committed significant procedural error by imposing a longer term of incarceration based on Cor-bin\u2019s need for mental health treatment\u2014to be equally without merit. To be sure, Corbin correctly cites our holding in <em>United States v. Manzella, </em>475 F.3d 152, 162 (3d Cir.2007), that district courts are prohibited from \u201ceffecting ... rehabilitative goals ... either in sentencing a defendant to a term of imprisonment or, if a term of imprisonment is otherwise to be imposed, in determining the length of that term.\u201d Yet, our review of the record makes it pellucidly clear that the District Court did not do so here. Rather, the District Court merely observed that during any term of incarceration, Corbin would benefit from mental health treatment and counseling. <em>See United States v. Watson, </em>482 F.3d 269, 275 (3d Cir.2007) (observing that the \u201cmere fact that a [district] court may take into account or mention correction or rehabilitation along with other factors in arriving at or explaining its [overall] <em>sentence\u201d </em>does not demonstrate that the district court imposed a term of <em>incarceration, </em>or determined the length of that term, for rehabilitative purposes (emphasis in original)). Moreover, both Corbin and his counsel <em>raised </em>his need for mental health treatment at sentencing as a <em>mitigating </em>factor, and the District Court\u2019s observation that Corbin could receive such treatment while incarcerated was not a procedural error\u2014let alone a significant procedural error\u2014in imposing sentence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>V.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Next, we find it unnecessary to address Corbin\u2019s third argument\u2014that sentencing Corbin based on the acquitted conduct charged in Count One constituted significant procedural error because it violated his Sixth Amendment jury trial rights\u2014 because we find that the District Court did not impose the variant sentence based, on that conduct. Indeed, the District Court stated at sentencing that it was not necessary to rely on that conduct, and the District Court\u2019s written statement of reasons plainly confirmed that the acquitted conduct was not the basis for the variant sentence imposed. Accordingly, we need not address the parties\u2019 arguments with respect to the appropriateness of considering acquitted conduct at sentencing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Corbin\u2019s final argument is that even absent a finding that the District Court committed significant procedural error, we should nonetheless reverse the 50-month variant sentence imposed here on the basis that it was substantively unreasonable. We disagree. Importantly, we are mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Gall </em>that in reviewing variant sentences for substantive reasonableness under the appropriate abuse-of-discretion standard, we must \u201cgive due deference to [a] district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d 128 S.Ct. at 597. This is sensible, as \u201c \u2018the sentencing judge has access to, and greater familiarity with, the individual case and the individual defendant.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597-98 (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2469, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)). Indeed, in determining whether a variance is justified by \u201cthe totality of the circumstances,\u201d it is clear that \u201c \u2018[district courts have an institutional advantage over appellate courts[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597, 598 (quoting <em>Koon, </em>518 U.S. at 98, 116 S.Ct. 2035). Accordingly, \u201c[t]he fact that [an] appellate court might reasonably ... conclude[ ] that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">With these principles in mind, we find that the District Court imposed a substantively reasonable sentence when it found that a variant sentence of 50 months was sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to reflect the seriousness of Corbin\u2019s death threat, to provide just punishment for that threat, to afford adequate deterrence, and to protect the public. Indeed, we find it difficult to imagine a more serious threatening communication than the one Corbin made\u2014to murder his ex-girlfriend and her family\u2014and it is understandable that the District Court found a variant sentence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>be just punishment for that threat. Moreover, in light of the District Court\u2019s superi- or institutional position from which to assess the import of Corbin\u2019s trial testimony, we see no reason to disagree with the finding that Corbin\u2019s apparent proclivity to violence, immaturity, lack of values, and poor attitude towards personal relationships justified a variant sentence to afford adequate deterrence and to protect the public from further crimes by Corbin. Accordingly, we find that the 50-month variant sentence imposed here, reviewed for abuse of discretion, was substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b132-12\">. Although the indictment also charged a co-defendant on Count One, that defendant was acquitted at trial, and his involvement in the trial is immaterial to this sentencing appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b132-13\">. The record reflects some dispute at sentencing regarding whether Corbin should have received a two-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Corbin did not ultimately receive that reduction, and he has not challenged that ruling on appeal. Accordingly, we need not address the issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b136-6\">. Not surprisingly, Corbin cites no authority, nor have we found any, supporting his argument that the District Court's consideration of his history and personal characteristics was inappropriate. This is sensible, as Corbin's argument, if accepted, would lead to an unwarranted, restrictive interpretation of Congress\u2019s broad mandate in \u00a7 3553(a)(1) that a district court consider a defendant's personal history and characteristics in tailoring a sentence that furthers the goals enumerated by \u00a7 3553(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b136-7\">. Although the parties devote substantial effort to the appropriate standard of review for this argument, we need not resolve the parties\u2019 dispute in this regard, as we find that the District Court committed no error\u2014plain or otherwise\u2014in considering Corbin's values, character, maturity level, and attitude towards personal relationships in imposing sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b136-11\">. Again, although the parties devote substantial effort to the appropriate standard of review, we need not resolve the parties\u2019 dispute in that regard, as we find that the District Court did not rely on Corbin\u2019s need for mental health treatment in imposing a term of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>incarceration or in fixing the length of that term.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b137-9\">. It is worth noting that it appears a district court may, in fact, base a sentence on acquitted conduct provided that conduct has been proven by a preponderance of the evidence and the sentence imposed is within the statutory range for the convicted offense. <em>See, e.g., United States v.
