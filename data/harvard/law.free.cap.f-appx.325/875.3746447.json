Avila\u2019s motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Guidelines. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-21\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-22\">The district court did not err. Amendment 706 did not have the effect of lowering Avila\u2019s sentencing range. Avila was held responsible for more than eleven grams of cocaine base and was ineligible for a sentence reduction. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368-69 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). Avila argues that the district court had discretion to reduce his sentence below the amended range under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), but <em>Booker </em>cannot be used as an independent basis to reduce a sentence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number><em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1191-93 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam). We affirm the denial of Avila\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
