The Honorable Greg Kays, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b497-12\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b497-13\">Manuel Murueta-Espinosa challenges his 24-month prison sentence imposed by the district court after he pleaded guilty to one count of being an illegal alien who returned to the United States without proper consent following deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(1). On appeal, Murueta-Espinosa argues that the district court erred in classifying his prior conviction under Iowa Code \u00a7 714.7, \u201cOperating Vehicle Without Owner\u2019s Consent,\u201d as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-15\">On appeal, we review the sentence to ensure that the district court did not commit a significant procedural error such as misealeulating the Guidelines range. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We review a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Mashek, </em>406 F.3d 1012, 1017 (8th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-19\">In <em>United States v. Lindquist, </em>we expressly held that a prior Iowa conviction for operating a vehicle without the owner\u2019s consent constituted a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2K2.1(a). 421 F.3d 751, 753-55 (8th Cir.2005). Subsequently, the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Be-gay v. United States, </em>holding that to be considered a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act, the crime must be similar in kind to the example crimes listed in the statute. \u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 1583, 1585-86, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008). In <em>United States v. Williams, </em>we held that, in light of <em>Begay, </em>the Missouri offense of auto theft without consent should no longer be considered a crime of violence under \u00a7 2K2.1. 537 F.3d 969, 975-76 (8th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-22\">Here, Iowa\u2019s statute for operating a vehicle without the owner\u2019s consent is analogous to Missouri\u2019s auto theft without consent statute. <em>Compare </em>Iowa Code \u00a7 714.7 (\u201cAny person who shall take possession or control of any ... vehicle ... without the consent of the owner of such, but without the intent to permanently deprive the owner thereof ....\u201d) <em>with </em>Mo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 570.030 (\u201cA person commits the crime of stealing if he or she appropriates property ... of another with the purpose to deprive him or her thereof ... without his or her consent....\u201d). Iowa\u2019s statute and the Missouri statute discussed in <em>Williams </em>are sufficiently similar such that the decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>in <em>Williams </em>controls this ease. Therefore, we hold that the Iowa offense of operating a vehicle without the owner\u2019s consent is no longer a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of\u00a7 2L1.2.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Accordingly, we vacate Murueta-Espi-nosa\u2019s sentence and remand for resentenc-ing in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b498-18\">. The distinction between \"crime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 2K2.1 and under \u00a7 2L1.2 is immaterial for purposes of this decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
