We affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the facts and procedural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>history of this case, we will not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">The district court correctly dismissed claims eight and eleven of Rasmussen\u2019s petition for habeas corpus because Rasmussen did not fairly present them to the Washington Court of Appeals and they are now procedurally barred. <em>See Casey v. Moore, </em>386 F.3d 896, 920-21 (9th Cir.2004). Rasmussen\u2019s personal restraint petition in the Washington Court of Appeals did not place the state courts on notice that he was raising claim eight as a federal constitutional claim. <em>See Shumway v. Payne, </em>223 F.3d 982, 987 (9th Cir.2000) (a \u201cnaked reference to due process\u201d is insufficient to fairly present a federal constitutional claim to state courts) (internal quotation marks omitted). Rasmussen\u2019s concession that he failed to present claim eleven as a federal constitutional claim in the Washington Court of Appeals is dispositive as to that allegation. <em>See Casey, </em>386 F.3d at 918 (\u201cBecause we conclude that Casey raised his federal constitutional claims for the first and only time to the state\u2019s highest court on discretionary review, he did not fairly present them.\u201d). We find no cause for this failure. <em>See Hughes v. Idaho State Bd. of Corrections, </em>800 F.2d 905, 909 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">We grant Rasmussen\u2019s motion to broaden the certificate of appealability to include his claim that the jury saw him in shackles in violation of his due process rights. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 338, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003) (reciting standard for grant of a certificate of appealability). Although we grant the motion for an expanded certificate of ap-pealability, we deny the claim on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">Clearly established federal law holds that a defendant may be shackled in view of the jury \u201conly in the presence of a special need.\u201d <em>See Deck v. Missouri, </em>544 U.S. 622, 626, 125 S.Ct. 2007, 161 L.Ed.2d 953 (2005). Washington has not argued that Rasmussen\u2019s shackling was justified by any special need. We therefore assume that it would have been constitutional error for jurors to have seen Rasmussen\u2019s shackles.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">We conclude, however, that there is insufficient evidence in the record to warrant an evidentiary hearing on whether any juror saw Rasmussen\u2019s restraints. When considering a \u00a7 2255 petition, the district court shall hold an evidentiary hearing \u201c[ujnless the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>see United States v. Leonti, </em>326 F.3d 1111, 1116 (9th Cir.2003). However, \u201c \u2018[mjerely conclusory statements in a \u00a7 2255 motion are not enough to require a hearing.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>988 F.2d 941, 945 (9th Cir.1993) (quoting <em>United States v. Hearst, </em>638 F.2d 1190, 1194 (9th Cir.1980)). Besides his own conclusory allegations, Rasmussen\u2019s only evidence that jurors may have seen his restraints is an affidavit from his trial counsel stating that boxes were placed \u201con the floor in front of defense counsel\u2019s table in order to shield the defendant\u2019s shackles from view by the jury,\u201d and that \u201cit is unclear how successful this was.\u201d This statement is insufficient to warrant an evidentiary hearing. <em>See Gonzalez v. Knowles, </em>515 F.3d 1006, 1014 (9th Cir.2008) (a petitioner is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on claims \u201cgrounded in speculation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b529-24\">.
