R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b593-17\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-18\">Devonne Michael Lee appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his pre-sentencing motion to withdraw his guilty plea to conspiracy to distribute more than fifty grams of cocaine base and to possession of a firearm in furtherance of drug trafficking, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), respectively. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-23\">The district court correctly concluded that Lee failed to demonstrate a fair and just reason for requesting withdrawal of his guilty plea. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(d)(2)(B); <em>United States v. Ortega-Ascanio, </em>376 F.3d 879, 883 (9th Cir.2004). Lee\u2019s reliance on <em>United States v. Davis, </em>428 F.3d 802 (9th Cir.2005), is misplaced. Although we held in <em>Davis </em>that \u201ca defense counsel\u2019s erroneous advice may warrant withdrawing a plea even if the defendant does not prove that he would not have pleaded guilty but for the erroneous advice,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 807, this does not imply that any erroneous advice from counsel automatically constitutes a \u201cfair and just\u201d reason for withdrawal under Rule 11(d)(2)(B). Indeed, <em>Davis </em>does not overrule the well-established principle that an \u201cerroneous prediction by a defense attorney concerning sentencing does not entitle a defendant to challenge his guilty plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>909 F.2d 1346, 1348 (9th Cir.1990); <em>see also, e.g., Shah v. United States, </em>878 F.2d 1156, 1162 (9th Cir.1989). <em>Davis </em>merely held that \u201ca defendant may demonstrate a fair and just reason for plea withdrawal by showing that his counsel\u2019s gross mischaracterization plausibly <em>could </em>have motivated his decision to plead guilty.\u201d 428 F.3d at 808. Because the district court found that Lee failed to demonstrate even an \u201cerroneous prediction\u201d by his counsel, let alone a \u201cgross mischaracterization,\u201d <em>Davis </em>affords Lee no ground for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-24\">Moreover, the district court did not deny Lee\u2019s motion out of an unduly narrow view of its discretion, but on the basis of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>findings that \u201cLee\u2019s guilty plea was knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made;\u201d that \u201cLee was well aware of the mandatory minimum sentences involved in pleading guilty;\u201d and that the actions of Lee\u2019s counsel \u201cfell within the range of professional competence expected of attorneys in criminal cases.\u201d Because the district court did not misconstrue its authority, misstate applicable law, or rely on clearly erroneous findings of fact in reaching these conclusions, we find no abuse of discretion in its denial of Lee\u2019s motion. <em>See Davis, </em>428 F.3d at 805; <em>United States v. Nostratis, </em>321 F.3d 1206, 1208 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b593-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
