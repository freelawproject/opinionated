Caldwell was sentenced as a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 to 151 months of imprisonment. Caldwell appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a reduction of sentence based on Amendment 706 that modified the sentencing ranges applicable to crack cocaine offenses. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual, </em>Supp. to Appendix C, Amendment 706, p. 226-31 (Nov. 1, 2007) (amending U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">This court reviews for an abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 29 (5th Cir.1994); <em>see United States v. Drath, </em>89 F.3d 216, 218 (5th Cir.1996). A reduction in Caldwell\u2019s base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1 pursuant to Amendment 706 would not affect his guidelines range of imprisonment because the guidelines range was calculated under \u00a7 4B1.1. Because Caldwell\u2019s guidelines range of imprisonment was not derived from the quantity of crack cocaine involved in the offense, Caldwell was not sentenced based on a sentencing range that was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2). Accordingly, under the plain language of \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a sentence reduction was not authorized and not consistent with the applicable policy statement. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a), p.s. To the extent that Caldwell argues that the district court had the discretion to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the argument is unavailing because <em>Booker </em>was not \u201cbased on a retroactive amendment to the Guidelines.\u201d <em>See Shaw, </em>30 F.3d at 29. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Caldwell\u2019s motion for a reduction of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b412-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
