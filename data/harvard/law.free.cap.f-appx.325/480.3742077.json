We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-26\">Athough the district court did not make a mechanical recitation of the section 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and did not provide an expansive explanation of the sentence imposed, <em>see United States v. Larison, </em>432 F.3d 921, 923 (8th Cir.2006) (\u201cA district court need not mechanically list every \u00a7 3353(a) consideration when sentencing defendant upon revocation of supervised release.\u201d), the proceedings were procedurally adequate, see <em>United States v. Petreikis, </em>551 F.3d 822, 824 (8th Cir.2009) (acknowledging that revocation sentence must be procedurally sound). The district court was well aware of Krai\u2019s violations of his supervised release conditions which led to an earlier revocation sentence of six months confinement. After his release from that revocation sentence, Krai continued to refuse to abide by the supervised release conditions. At the second revocation hearing which resulted in the sentence being appealed here, the court provided Krai several opportunities to agree to abide by the supervised release conditions and not face additional incarceration, and Krai rejected those opportunities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) (factor to be considered includes \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3583(e) (permitting imposition of revocation sentence after consideration of certain \u00a7 3553(a) factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">We further conclude that Krai\u2019s 12-month sentence was not substantively unreasonable. Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b508-9\">. The Honorable James M.
