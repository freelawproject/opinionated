Hooks challenges the manner in which the district court modified his sentence, contending that it violated \u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u2019s requirement to \u201cconsider[] the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable.\u201d We have jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(1), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\"><em>United States v. Lowe, </em>136 F.3d 1231, 1233 (9th Cir.1998), does not bar review. Hooks is not challenging the district court\u2019s exercise of discretionary power to lower a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c). Rather, he is seeking remand by arguing that the court failed to comply fully with \u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u2019s procedures. Thus, jurisdiction is proper under \u00a7 3742(a)(1). See <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>365 F.3d 796, 798 &amp; n. 1 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The district court complied with \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The court is not required to \u201cmechanically ... list every consideration of \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Aguilar-Ayala, </em>120 F.3d 176, 179 (9th Cir.1997) (quotation marks omitted). The court had before it (1) an amended Presentence Report discussing factors such as Hooks\u2019s prison disciplinary record, health, and family situation; (2) exhibits and written argument from Hooks\u2019s appointed counsel regarding some \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including disparities in crack cocaine ratios; and (3) the benefit of first-hand knowledge from the extensive prior sentencing proceedings. Similar to what it did with the original sentence, the court chose the high-end of the revised Guideline range, thereby exercising discretion and reducing Hooks\u2019s sentence by fifty-two months. Given this record, we are \u201csatisfied that the district court\u2019s decision rests on pertinent considerations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As this court stated in <em>United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-9\">adequate explanation in some cases may ... be inferred from the PSR or the record as a whole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-10\">The district court need not tick off each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to show that it has considered them. We assume that district judges know the law and understand their obligation to consider all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, not just the Guidelines.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 992.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b590-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
