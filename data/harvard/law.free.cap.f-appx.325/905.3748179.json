Hernandez (\u201cHernandez\u201d) appeals from a final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cMSPB\u201d or \u201cBoard\u201d).' The Board denied Hernandez\u2019s petition for enforcement of a settlement agreement with the Department of Defense (\u201cagency\u201d), rejecting Hernandez\u2019s claims that the agreement had been breached. Because we hold that the agency breached the settlement agreement, we <em>reverse and remand.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b933-24\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b933-25\">Hernandez worked for the Defense Logistics Agency .as a Material Handling Equipment Operator in San Antonio, Texas. In February 2006, Hernandez was informed that he would be separated from the agency pursuant to a reduction-in-force (\u201cRIF\u201d) action, effective June 30, 2006. After his separation, Hernandez was not placed in the agency\u2019s Priority Placement Program (\u201cPPP\u201d), a program that matches participants with agency job opportunities. Hernandez appealed his separation to the MSPB, and in February 2007 Hernandez and the agency entered into a settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-26\">The settlement agreement focused on Hernandez\u2019s enrollment in the agency\u2019s PPP. The settlement agreement stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>that Hernandez would be \u201cre-eonsidered for placement in the PPP for a period of one year beginning 7 calendar days after the last signature on this Agreement.\u201d Pet\u2019r App. 57. The last signature date on the agreement was February 17, 2007. Pet\u2019r App. 58. Seven days thereafter would be February 24, 2007. For convenience we refer to this date as the effective date of the agreement. The agency subsequently enrolled Hernandez in the PPP only from February 20, 2007, to July 2, 2007, a period of about four and one-half months, representing approximately the period between the effective date of the settlement agreement and the one-year anniversary of Hernandez\u2019s separation.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">One June 28, 2007, Hernandez filed a petition for enforcement of the settlement agreement, asserting that the agency had not, as required, enrolled him in the PPP for a period of one year after the effective date of the agreement. The agency provided an affidavit from an agency human resources specialist stating that Hernandez \u201creceived all appropriate consideration for job placement for 12 months following his separation on June 30, 2006,\u201d and that enrollment in the PPP beyond the twelvemonth period following separation on June 30, 2006, \u201cwas not possible.\u201d Pet\u2019r App. 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">The administrative judge denied Hernandez\u2019s petition for enforcement, finding that the agreement did not require Hernandez\u2019s enrollment for the one-year period after the effective date of the agreement, and finding that the agency had complied with the settlement agreement by \u201creviewing] relevant vacancies during the period from June 30, 2006, to February 20, 2007, to determine whether the appellant missed consideration for any of those vacancies,\u201d and then by registering Hernandez in the PPP from February 20, 2007, to July 2, 2007. <em>Hernandez v. Dep\u2019t of Defense, </em>No. DA-3443-06-0531-C-1, at 5 (M.S.P.B. Sept. 11, 2007). On April 11, 2008, the Board denied Hernandez\u2019s petition for review of the administrative judge\u2019s decision, and the initial decision became the final decision of the Board. <em>Hernandez v. Dep\u2019t of Defense, </em>108 M.S.P.R. 604 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">Hernandez timely petitioned our court for review, and we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b934-9\">The Board\u2019s decision must be affirmed unless it is found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation; or unsupported by substantial evidence. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c); <em>Lary v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>472 F.3d 1363, 1366-67 (Fed.Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-10\">A settlement agreement is a contract, <em>Tiburzi v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>269 F.3d 1346, 1351 (Fed.Cir.2001), and we review the Board\u2019s construction of a settlement agreement without deference, <em>Fomby-Denson v. Dep\u2019t of the Army, </em>247 F.3d 1366, 1371 (Fed.Cir.2001). Whether a breach of a contract is material is a mixed question of law and fact, but \u201c[wjhere, as here, the facts are undisputed, the determination of whether there has been material non-compliance with the terms of a contract ... necessarily reduces to a question of law.\u201d <em>Lary, </em>472 F.3d at 1367 (quoting <em>Gilbert v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>334 F.3d 1065, 1072 (Fed. Cir.2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-11\">The sole issue is the right of Hernandez to an additional seven and one-half months in the PPP under the settlement agreement. The settlement agreement provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-12\">The appellant will be re-considered for placement in the PPP for a period of one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>year beginning 7 calendar days after the last signature on this Agreement. One year is the regulatorily-prescribed term of enrollment per Para. SC1800.S.7 of DOD Instruction 1400.25-M.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">Pet\u2019r App. 57. The regulation cited in this provision states that \u201c[eligible employees ... are mandatory program registrants during the RIF notice period and for one year from separation.\u201d Department of Defense Civilian Personnel Manual, DoD 1400.25-M, subchapter 1800.8.7 (Dec. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">The agency concedes that as part of the settlement agreement, the agency could provide enrollment in the PPP for a period beyond the initial twelve months following Hernandez\u2019s separation. <em>See </em>Oral Arg. 25:50-26:32, <em>available at </em>http:// oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/mp3/2008-3270.mp3. (\u201cThe [agency] instruction is not an absolute limitation ... generally a displaced employee is going to be eligible for enrollment for one year from separation and there are exceptions\u2014there are procedures in there for exceptions to the policy.\u201d). In other words, the agency concedes that the affidavit statement that enrollment in the PPP for the one-year period following the effective date of the agreement \u201cwas not possible\u201d was inaccurate. The agency\u2019s affidavit also does not make harmless any error in the timing of Hernandez\u2019s PPP enrollment, because the affidavit stated that no suitable jobs were available during the period between Hernandez\u2019s separation and the signing of the settlement agreement, and did not address the availability of PPP jobs during the one-year period after the effective date of the agreement (though it did state that Hernandez was registered in the PPP for four and one-half months of that period).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">The question is whether the settlement agreement required Hernandez\u2019s enrollment for one year after the effective date of the settlement agreement. The agency contends that it agreed only that it would \u201creconsider\u201d Hernandez\u2019s enrollment in the PPP, in the sense that if the government decided not to include Hernandez in the PPP at all, Hernandez would have no right to PPP enrollment under the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">The word \u201creconsider\u201d in the settlement agreement is ambiguous. To \u201creconsider\u201d is \u201cto think over, discuss, or debate (as a plan, decision) especially] with a view to changing or reversing.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1897 (Merriam-Webster 2002); <em>see also Webster\u2019s Unabridged Dictionary </em>1612 (Random House 2d ed. 1998) (defining \u201creconsider\u201d as \u201cto consider again, esp[ecially] with a \u25a0view to change of decision or action\u201d). In the judicial context, reconsideration frequently means action that changes a result. Thus to \u201creconsider\u201d a result could well mean either that the result would be reviewed, or that the result would be changed. The most natural meaning of \u201creconsider\u201d here is that Hernandez\u2019s enrollment in the PPP would be changed so that he would be enrolled for twelve months following the effective date of the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-10\">Construction of contracts follows the \u201cgeneral rule of contract interpretation that terms of a contract should not be interpreted so as to render them ineffective or superfluous.\u201d <em>Abraham v. Rockwell Int\u2019l Corp., </em>326 F.3d 1242, 1254 (Fed. Cir.2003); <em>see also Pac. Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. United States, </em>536 F.3d 1282, 1288 (Fed. Cir.2008); <em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts </em>\u00a7 203(a) (1981) (\u201c[A]n interpretation which gives a reasonable, lawful, and effective meaning to all the terms is preferred to an interpretation which leaves a part unreasonable, unlawful, or of no effect.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>It is plain from the face of the agreement that in exchange for dismissing his appeal, the agency agreed to allow Hernandez to be enrolled in the PPP for a one-year period after the effective date of the agreement. As part of the settlement agreement, the agency agreed (a) that it would remove a reprimand from Hernandez\u2019s record, (b) that \u201c[bjeeause of the removal of the Decision of Reprimand, the appellant is now eligible to be re-considered for registration\u201d in the PPP under the agency\u2019s regulations, and (c) that Hernandez would be \u201cre-considered for placement in the PPP for a period of one year beginning 7 calendar days after the last signature on this Agreement.\u201d Pet\u2019r App. 57. Hernandez received no other consideration under the agreement. Construing the settlement agreement as giving the agency the option not to enroll Hernandez in the PPP would come close to rendering the settlement agreement illusory.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Such a construction is disfavored. <em>See </em>5 Margaret N. Kniffin, <em>Corbin on Contracts </em>\u00a7 24.22 at 234-35 (rev. ed. 1998) (\u201cWhen the words of the contract indicate that a party has promised to perform, such words should not be interpreted so as to make the promise illusory, even if the context may show an intent to leave performance subject to the party\u2019s broad discretion.\u201d (footnote omitted)). We thus construe the settlement agreement as requiring the agency to enroll Hernandez in the PPP program for twelve months after the effective date of the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">Because the agency enrolled Hernandez in the PPP for only four and one-half months and not twelve months after the settlement agreement, we hold that the agency breached the settlement agreement. On remand, the MSPB should consider an appropriate remedy for this breach. Accordingly, we <em>reverse and remand.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b936-8\">No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b936-5\">. <em>See Torncello v.
