The district court denied the motion, finding that Sepulveda was sentenced as a career offender under U.S. Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 4B1.1, and thus, any reduction would not be consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-15\">On appeal, Sepulveda argues that the district court had discretion to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582 because he had received a downward departure based on over-representation. Relying on <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009), Sepulveda asserts that, although defendants sentenced as career offenders generally are not eligible for Amendment 706 reductions, those defendants who receive downward departures remain eligible for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-18\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision not to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). The district court may reduce the sentence of a \u201cdefendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission,\u201d provided that \u201csuch a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In <em>Moore, </em>we held that, if the defendant was sentenced as a career offender under U.S. Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 4B1.1, and the range was not affected by U.S. Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2D1.1, then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>the sentence is not \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered.\u201d 541 F.3d at 1327. We noted that the base offense levels under U.S. Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2D1.1 played no role in the calculation of the career offender range for that defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 1327. As such, even though Amendment 706 was retroactive, the district court was not authorized to reduce the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">Similar to the defendants in <em>Moore, </em>the district court sentenced Sepulveda by application of the career offender guideline in U.S. Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 4B1.1, leaving untouched his offense level. Sepulve-da\u2019s downward departure only affected his criminal history category and did not affect his status as a career offender for purposes of calculating his Guidelines range. Thus, Sepulveda was not sentenced under the otherwise applicable base offense level of 32 in U.S. Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2D1.1, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that he was ineligible for relief under Amendment 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">In the alternative, Sepulveda argues that <em>Moore </em>was wrongly decided because it results in a mandatory application of the guidelines, which violates the principles established in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). However, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) allows district courts to reduce a sentence only when a defendant \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). As such, <em>Booker </em>does not apply here. See <em>Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1220 (providing that <em>\u201cBooker </em>is a Supreme Court decision, not a retroactively applicable guideline amendment by the Sentencing Commission. Therefore, <em>Booker </em>is inapplicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions.\u201d); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (same). Thus, Sepulveda\u2019s argument is precluded by our precedent. Moreover, decisions of prior panels are binding on subsequent panels, and can be overturned only by intervening Supreme Court authority or this Court sitting en banc. <em>See Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981); <em>United States v. Hogan, </em>986 F.2d 1364, 1369 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">We conclude that the district court correctly ruled that it lacked authority to reduce Sepulveda\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
