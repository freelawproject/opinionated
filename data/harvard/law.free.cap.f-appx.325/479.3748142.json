Upon careful de novo review, <em>see Johnson v. Blaukat, </em>453 F.3d 1108, 1112 (8th Cir.2006) (standard of review), we conclude that summary judgment was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-22\">We agree with the district court that Schmidt failed to establish a prima facie case because she failed to make a sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>showing that she was \u201cdisabled\u201d within the meaning of the ADA: while her knee injury impacted her ability to walk, it did not \u201csubstantially limit\u201d that major life activity. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(1) (defining disability); <em>Gretillat v. Care </em>Initiatives, 481 F.3d 649, 653 (8th Cir.2007) (major life activities include walking, but difficulty walking long distances is not disability under ADA); <em>Nuzum v. Ozark Auto. Distribs., Inc., </em>432 F.3d 839, 846-48 (8th Cir.2005) (\u201csubstantially limited\u201d means limited considerably or to large degree; to assess substantiality of limitation, nature, severity, duration, and impact must be examined); <em>Schuhardt v. Washington Univ., </em>390 F.3d 563, 566 (8th Cir.2004) (defendant is entitled to summary judgment if plaintiff failed to make sufficient showing on essential element of her case); <em>Wood v. Crown Redi-Mix, Inc., </em>339 F.3d 682, 684 (8th Cir.2003) (prima facie case under ADA).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Even if Schmidt had established an ADA-qualifying disability, she failed to create a trialworthy issue as to whether she could have performed the essential functions of her position. <em>See Alexander v. Northland Inn, </em>321 F.3d 723, 727 (8th Cir.2003) (ADA plaintiff has burden to prove he can perform essential functions of job with reasonable accommodation); <em>Dropinski v. Douglas County, </em>298 F.3d 704, 709-10 (8th Cir.2002) (job restructuring is possible accommodation under ADA, but employer need not reallocate or eliminate essential functions of job); <em>see also Lee v. Spellings, </em>447 F.3d 1087, 1088-89 (8th Cir.2006) (court may affirm on any basis supported by record).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b507-6\">.
