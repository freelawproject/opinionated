We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Kaur v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 876, 884 (9th Cir.2004), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The record does not compel the conclusion that changed or extraordinary circumstances excused the untimely filing of Joso\u2019s asylum application. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(4), (5); <em>Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 656-58 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam). Accordingly, Joso\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-15\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination because the inconsistency between Joso\u2019s testimony and the medical report concerning the injuries he suffered in May of 1998 and the inconsistency between Joso\u2019s testimony and the police report concerning the date of the attack on his shop go to the heart of his claim. <em>See Goel v. Gonzales, </em>490 F.3d 735, 739 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (inconsistencies between testimony and documentary evidence support an adverse credibility finding where inconsistencies go to the heart of the claim). Accordingly, Joso\u2019s withholding of removal claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-16\">Joso does not raise any substantive arguments in his opening brief regarding the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (\u201cIssues raised in a brief that are not supported by argument are deemed abandoned.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b544-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
