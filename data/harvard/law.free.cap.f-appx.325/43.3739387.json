R.Civ.P. 8(a). \u201cSpecific facts are not necessary,\u201d but the statement must \u201cgive the defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\u201d <em>Erickson v. Pardus, </em>551 U.S. 89, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 2200, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007) (internal quotation marks and edits omitted); <em>see also Boykin v. KeyCorp, </em>521 F.3d 202, 214 (2d Cir.2008). We review a district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to comply with Rule 8(a) for abuse of discretion. <em>See Boykin v. KeyCorp, </em>521 F.3d at 212. In doing so, however, we are mindful that <em>pro se </em>complaints are \u201cto be liberally construed, and ... held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d <em>Erickson v. Pardus, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2200 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see also Boykin v. KeyCorp, </em>521 F.3d at 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-15\">Applying these principles to this case, we identify no error in the challenged dismissal. Taylor\u2019s amended complaint, which is \u201cbereft of dates, names, and any meaningful description of what actually occurred,\u201d <em>Taylor v. Norton, </em>No. 05 Civ. 524, Order at 2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 16, 2007), fails to give defendant \u201cfair notice\u201d of the grounds upon which Taylor\u2019s sexual harassment and discrimination claims rest. <em>Erickson v. Pardus, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2200. Significantly, the amended complaint\u2019s failure to provide such notice followed a district court order that, in dismissing Taylor\u2019s original complaint, carefully explained its deficiencies and provided Taylor with an opportunity to cure the defects. Further, the order advised Taylor that failure to do so would result in dismissal. <em>See Taylor v. Norton, </em>No. 05 Civ. 524, Order at 4-5 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 14, 2005). Taylor\u2019s amended complaint is not materially different from the original complaint and, thus, it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to dismiss the amended complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-16\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the order of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
