Harris based his motion on Amendment 706 to the sentencing guidelines, which reduced the base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine offenses. He contends that the district court erred by not recognizing that he was sentenced based on an \u201cimproperly determined drug amount\u201d during his original sentencing proceeding, in violation of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Harris argues that the court on resentencing treated the guidelines as mandatory in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He also asserts that, although his criminal history category was increased from III to VI under the career-offender provision of the guidelines, the court erred when it determined he was sentenced as a career offender. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-12\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment where a defendant was sentenced based on a sentencing range that subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Where a defendant\u2019s guideline range remains unchanged by Amendment 706 because his offense involved 4.5 kilograms or more of crack cocaine, a district court is not authorized to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Jones, </em>548 F.3d at 1369.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-13\">We have noted that when the district court is evaluating whether to modify a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000). We have also held that \u201c <em>\u2018Booker </em>is inapplicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1193 (11th Cir.2009) (citing <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-14\">During his original sentencing proceeding the court determined that Harris was responsible for over 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. Thus Amendment 706 did not reduce his applicable guideline range, and the district court lacked the authority to modify his sentence. Because \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings are not <em>de novo </em>resentencings, Harris\u2019 arguments about improper drug-amount determinations made during his original sentencing proceeding also fail. <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781. Nor can Harris support his \u00a7 3582(e)(2) motion with a <em>Booker </em>argument because, as we have noted, <em>Booker </em>\u201cdoes not address motions to reduce a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>Melvin, </em>556 F.3d at 1192-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Finally, Harris\u2019 argument that he was not sentenced as a career offender is factually incorrect. Although the court\u2019s application of \u00a7 4B1.1 did not increase Harris\u2019 base offense level because it was already at 40, it did raise his criminal history category from III to VI. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). The district court did not err when it determined that Harris had been sentenced as a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
