On appeal, McKeever argues that the district court abused its discretion by basing its decision on the same reasons it used at sentencing, by fading to consider other relevant factors, and by failing to consider the crack-cocaine disparity under <em>Kim-brough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-27\">We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion and its conclusions regarding the scope of its legal authority <em>de novo. United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number><em>James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 &amp; n. 1 (11th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 759 n. 3 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a guideline range that has been lowered subsequently by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The district court must make two determinations before deciding whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2): (1) it \u201cmust substitute the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range and determine what sentence it would have imposed\u201d; and (2) it \u201cmust consider the factors listed in [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) and determine whether or not to reduce the defendant\u2019s original sentence.\u201d <em>Vautier, </em>144 F.3d at 760.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying McKeever\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because the court properly followed the two-step process outlined in <em>Vautier, </em>144 F.3d at 760-63. First, the district court correctly calculated the amended guideline range of 87 to 108 months, given an amended offense level of 27 and a criminal history category of III. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G., Sentencing Table. Next, as the record shows, the district court considered the relevant sentencing factors\u2014including McKeever\u2019s personal history and characteristics and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities-in finding that a reduction was not warranted. In light of this record, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying McKeever\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, and contrary to McKeever\u2019s assertions, \u201c[t]he district court [was] not required to articulate specifically the applicability, if any, of each factor.\u201d <em>Vautier, </em>144 F.3d at 762.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">Moreover, under our controlling case law, the district court did not err in concluding that it lacked authority to apply <em>Kimbrough </em>to his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009) (holding that <em>Kimbrough </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Feb. 10, 2009) (No. 08-8664). Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b870-6\">. Accordingly, McKeever's motion to appoint counsel for oral argument is DENIED as MOOT.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
