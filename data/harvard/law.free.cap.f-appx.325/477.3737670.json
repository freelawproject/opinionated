Starling\u2019s plea agreement contained the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-10\">15. <em>Waiver of Appellate and Post-Conviction Rights.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-11\">b. The defendant expressly waives his right to appeal his sentence, directly or collaterally, on any ground except a sentence imposed in excess of the statutory maximum or an illegal sentence, that is, sentencing error more serious than a misapplication of the Sentencing Guidelines, an abuse of discretion, or the imposition of an unreasonable sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEE\">At Starling\u2019s change of plea hearing, the magistrate judge<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ensured that Starling understood his right to appeal and that he was knowingly and voluntarily waiving this right as a part of the plea agreement. After reviewing the proceedings before the magistrate judge de novo, the district court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> accepted Starling\u2019s plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-15\">At sentencing, the district court reviewed the recommended advisory sentencing guidelines range calculation in Starling\u2019s Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d). The PSR recommended a base offense level of 32 under \u00a7 2G2.1(a), a two-level increase under \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(l)(B) (the victim was under sixteen years of age), a two-level increase under \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(2)(A) (the offense involved \u201cthe commission of a sexual act or sexual contact\u201d), a two-level increase under \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(5) (the victim was in the defendant\u2019s \u201ccustody, care, or supervisory control\u201d), a two-level increase under \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l) (the victim was a \u201cvulnerable victim\u201d), and a three-level decrease under \u00a7 3El.l(a)-(b) (the defendant clearly demonstrated acceptance of responsibility and assisted authorities in the prosecution of his own misconduct). Starling\u2019s total offense level of 37, combined with his criminal history category of IV and the statutory maximum sentence of 360 months, resulted in an advisory guidelines range of 292 to 360 months. Starling objected to the guideline enhancements under \u00a7\u00a7 2G2.1(b)(2)(A), 2G2.1(b)(5) and 3Al.l(b)(l). The district court overruled Starling\u2019s objections, adopted the PSR\u2019s advisory guidelines range, and sentenced Starling to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-16\">Starling appeals his sentence, asserting three procedural errors. First, he argues that the district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(2)(A) amounts to unlawful double counting because 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a) already includes \u201csexual contact\u201d as an element. Second, he argues that the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>trict court should not have applied a two-level increase under \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l) because the victim was not vulnerable. Third, he argues that the district court should not have applied a two-level increase under \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(5) because the victim was not under his care, custody or control. After Starling filed his opening brief, the Government filed a responsive brief addressing the merits of the three alleged procedural errors and then filed a motion to dismiss Starling\u2019s appeal because the alleged errors fell within the scope of his plea agreement\u2019s appeal waiver. Starling responded to the motion to dismiss by asserting that his alleged errors constituted an illegal sentence, thereby falling outside the scope of the waiver, and that his waiver was not knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">After reviewing the proceedings before the magistrate judge and the district court and the three sentencing errors alleged by Starling in this appeal, we conclude the Government has established \u201c(1) that the appeal is within the scope of the waiver, (2) that the defendant entered into the waiver knowingly and voluntarily, and (3) that dismissing the appeal based on the defendant\u2019s waiver would not result in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>See United States v. Aronja-Inda, </em>422 F.3d 734, 737 (8th Cir.2005). None of the procedural errors alleged by Starling constitute \u201csentencing error more serious than a misapplication of the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d The proceedings before the magistrate judge show that Starling knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal. Finally, Starling has not asserted, and we have not independently identified, any way in which enforcing the waiver would result in a miscarriage of justice. Accordingly, we grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss Starling\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b506-12\">. The Honorable James C.
