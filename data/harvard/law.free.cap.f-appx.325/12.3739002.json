United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 748, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970); and (2) he received ineffective assistance of counsel during his plea and sentencing proceedings in state court in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, <em>see Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-22\">In May 2001, following a jury trial in state court at which petitioner was convicted of sodomy in the first degree. In March 2003, the Appellate Division, Second Department, vacated the conviction on the grounds that the trial court had improperly denied petitioner the right to represent himself. <em>See People v. Forney, </em>303 A.D.2d 763, 763, 757 N.Y.S.2d 455 (2d Dep\u2019t 2003). On July 24, 2003, petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>pleaded guilty to one count of attempted sodomy in the first degree in exchange for a promised sentence of four years\u2019 imprisonment\u2014effectively, time served\u2014and a five-year period of post-release supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">At a sentencing hearing on August 7, 2003, after the court reviewed the terms of post-release supervision, petitioner\u2019s counsel moved to withdraw his plea on two grounds: (1) petitioner was \u201cunclear about the[] conditions of post-release supervision,\u201d and (2) petitioner \u201c[wa]s not guilty.\u201d J.A. 50 (Tr. of Proceedings, Aug. 7.2003, 15:12-17). Addressing the court directly, petitioner himself explained that he was concerned about two post-release requirements: (1) having to maintain employment (\u201cI like to have [the] freedom to do what I want to do. For me to be forced to maintain employment, this is something I\u2019m going to violate immediately. I don\u2019t work.\u201d); and (2) a curfew (\u201cI\u2019m twenty-five years old. I got to go by a curfew?\u201d). J.A. 52 (Tr. of Proceedings, Aug. 7, 2003, 17:9-12, 17-18). The trial court denied petitioner\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea, and the Appellate Division, Second Department, unanimously affirmed. <em>See People v. Forney, </em>17 A.D.3d 481, 481, 792 N.Y.S.2d 335 (2d Dep\u2019t 2005) (\u201cThe plea minutes indicate that the defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily entered his plea of guilty.\u201d). The New York State Court of Appeals denied petitioner\u2019s application for leave to appeal. <em>See People v. Forney, </em>5 N.Y.3d 762, 762, 801 N.Y.S.2d 256, 834 N.E.2d 1266 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Petitioner initiated habeas corpus proceedings in January 2006. In an unpublished Memorandum and Order entered August 1, 2007, the District Court denied relief, principally on ground that a court is not obliged to inform a defendant prior to a guilty plea of the conditions of post-release supervision that might be imposed on him. The District Court concluded that any other defects in the plea were harmless. Nevertheless, the District Court granted a certificate of appealability on September 14,2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">We review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a writ of habeas corpus <em>de novo </em>and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>See, e.g., Clark v. Perez, </em>510 F.3d 382, 389 (2d Cir.2008). Pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, a federal court may grant habeas corpus relief on a claim adjudicated on the merits in state court only if the adjudication was (1) \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States;\u201d or (2) \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">Upon review of the record before us, we cannot say that the state court\u2019s adjudication was contrary to clearly established Federal law or involved an unreasonable determination of the facts. We agree with the Appellate Division\u2019s conclusion that petitioner \u201cknowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily entered his plea of guilty.\u201d <em>For-ney, </em>17 A.D.3d at 481, 792 N.Y.S.2d 335; <em>accord Brady, </em>397 U.S. at 748, 90 S.Ct. 1463 (holding that guilty pleas \u201cnot only must be voluntary but must be knowing, intelligent acts done with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">We have considered petitioner\u2019s remaining arguments, including his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, <em>see Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
