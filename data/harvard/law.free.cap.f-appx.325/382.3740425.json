He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a reduction of sentence. We review the denial of a \u00a7 3582 motion for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Ingram\u2019s argument that the district court should be able to exercise <em>Booker </em>discretion to resentence him rests on the false premise that \u00a7 3582 applies to his situation at all. \u201cSection 3582(c)(2) permits a district court to reduce a term of imprisonment when it is based upon <em>a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by an amendment to the Guidelines, </em>if such a reduction is consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This statute clearly is inapplicable to Ingram, whose sentencing range has not subsequently been lowered by Guidelines amendment. Amendment 706 reduced the base offense levels set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) applicable to most crack cocaine offenses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But a reduction in Ingram\u2019s base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1 pursuant to Amendment 706 would not affect his guidelines range because the range was calculated under \u00a7 4B1.1, the career offender guideline. Because Ingram\u2019s guidelines range was not derived from the quantity of crack cocaine involved in the offense, he was not sentenced based on a sentencing range that was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Ingram\u2019s motion for a reduction of sentence. Its judgment is AFFIRMED, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the Government\u2019s motion for an extension of time is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b411-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
