We conclude that Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines had no impact on Nelson\u2019s statutory mandatory minimum sentence. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">Nelson pled guilty in 2001 to possession \u25a0with intent to distribute at least 50 grams of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A). He received the statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months (ten years) of imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-18\">In 2007, Nelson filed a <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce his sentence under Amendment 706. At a hearing on his motion, Nelson, through counsel, argued that the district court erroneously assessed a second criminal history point for his prior conviction for possession of marijuana. Without that point, Nelson maintained that he would have qualified for safety-valve relief under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 and the sentencing court would not have been bound by the statutory mandatory minimum sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court denied the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. First, the court found no basis for adjusting his criminal history category, even if the court were to reevaluate it. \u201c[Sjecond and more compelling,\u201d the court concluded that it could not reassess Nelson\u2019s criminal history category in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding and that Nelson was not entitled to relief from his minimum mandatory sentence. Rl-60 at 1-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-19\">On appeal, Nelson reiterates his argument that he should have qualified for safety-valve relief. He therefore asserts that he was entitled to a sentence reduction because Amendment 706 lowered his base offense level. Nelson further suggests that we should consider the racial disparity between sentences for crack violations and powder cocaine violations acknowledged in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-20\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b843-21\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for abuse of discretion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>and its legal interpretations <em>de novo. See United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1338-39 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). Section 3582(c)(2) permits a district court to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence that was based on a sentencing range which was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). For example, defendants convicted of crack cocaine offenses who were sentenced according to their base offense levels in \u00a7 2D1.1 are eligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 706. <em>See Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1339. However, Amendment 706 has no effect on a sentence that was based on something other than \u00a7 2D1.1, such as a statutory mandatory minimum, \u201csince the amendment would not lower his applicable guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, because a sentencing adjustment under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not constitute a <em>de novo </em>resentencing, the district court must leave intact all original sentencing determinations except for the amended guideline range. <em>See United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">We find no abuse of discretion in the denial of Nelson\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. It is undisputed that Nelson\u2019s ten-year sentence was based on the statutory mandatory minimum, not his base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1. As such, his sentence does \u201cnot fall within the scope of Amendment 706.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1342. Nor could the district court disturb the prior sentencing determinations concerning Nelson\u2019s criminal history points and his eligibility for safety-valve relief. <em>See Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1220. Finally, as <em>Kimbrough </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, we do not consider Nelson\u2019s racial disparity arguments. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1193 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Feb. 10, 2009) (No. 08-8664) (concluding that <em>Kimbrough </em>only addressed the crack/powder disparity with respect to original sentencing proceedings, not \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings). Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b843-12\">.
