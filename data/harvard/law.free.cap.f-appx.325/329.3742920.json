DuVall\u2019s claims emerge from his efforts to bring about the prosecution of his adversaries from a separate civil case that has been dismissed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the instant case, the claims are that various government entities and individuals stymied DuVall by refusing to accept mail from him or to pursue criminal charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">We review dismissals under Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) de novo. However, DuVall provides no meaningful arguments based in fact or in law for any of his alleged points of error, nor has he filed a reply brief in response to the briefs of his opponents. Our review of the judgment of the district court reveals no error. DuVall\u2019s factual offerings are deficient to state a claim as to any of the defendants-appellants, many of whom rightfully claim further immunities that would stand in the way of DuVall\u2019s suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">Finally, DuVall offers no ground in fact or in law for overturning the imposition of sanctions, and therefore these too must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-13\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b358-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b358-19\">. <em>See DuVall v. Lowe's Companies, Inc., </em>No. 07-cv-690 (W.D.Tex.
