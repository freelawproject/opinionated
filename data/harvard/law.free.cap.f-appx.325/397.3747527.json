The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, which concluded that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and that Henderson failed to state a claim. The district court dismissed Henderson\u2019s claim with prejudice. On appeal, Henderson does not contend that the district court\u2019s legal conclusions were incorrect. <em>See Brinkmann v. Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Instead, Henderson argues that both the district court judge and the magistrate judge were biased against him in violation of his due process rights and alleges that the district court judge met secretly with Schuenemeyer outside of Henderson\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-22\">Henderson presents no evidence indicating bias on the part of either judge or suggesting that the district court judge had any interaction with Schuenemeyer. Therefore, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b425-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
