The case centers on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>administrative law judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) determination that Hegel does not have a severe mental limitation that limits his ability to work. The parties are familiar with the facts, which we repeat here only to the extent necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">\u201cAlthough the contrary opinion of a non-examining medical expert does not alone constitute a specific, legitimate reason for rejecting a treating or examining physician\u2019s opinion, it may constitute substantial evidence when it is consistent with other independent evidence in the record.\u201d <em>To-napetyan v. Halter, </em>242 F.3d 1144, 1149 (9th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Magallanes v. Bowen, </em>881 F.2d 747, 752 (9th Cir.1989)); <em>see also Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 831 n. 8 (9th Cir.1995) (noting reasons justifying rejection of an examining physician\u2019s opinion need not support rejection of treating physician\u2019s opinion). \u201cThe ALJ is responsible for determining credibility, resolving conflicts in medical testimony, and for resolving ambiguities.\u201d <em>Andrews v. Shalala, </em>53 F.3d 1035, 1039 (9th Cir.1995) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Here, examining psychologist Dr. John Arnold suggested that Hegel was somewhat limited in his ability to work, despite finding that Hegel exaggerated reports of psychopathology. Dr. Joyce Everhart diagnosed Hegel with malingering, noted that Hegel \u201cappears to be functioning within normal limits,\u201d and observed that Hegel did not appear to be giving his best effort on mental tests, yet concluded, in a check-the-box statement, that Hegel had moderate limitations. Non-examining expert Dr. J.M. Toews testified that none of Hegel\u2019s conditions created limitations as severe as those put forth by Drs. Arnold and Everhart.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s exclusion of the examining physicians\u2019 opinions. In addition to contrary findings by the non-examining medical expert, the ALJ\u2019s decision was based on inconsistencies in the medical opinions, reports of malingering and invalid test results, and the ALJ\u2019s finding that Hegel was not credible. Moreover, the examining physicians\u2019 \u201cchecked box\u201d limitations were not supported by objective findings. <em>See Batson v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>359 F.3d 1190, 1195 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201c[A]n ALJ may discredit treating physicians\u2019 opinions that are conclusory, brief, and unsupported by the record as a whole, or by objective medical findings ... \u201d) (internal citations omitted). These reasons constitute specific, legitimate reasons to support the ALJ\u2019s findings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">Hegel also argues that the ALJ erred by finding that Hegel\u2019s personality disorder does not constitute a severe impairment because personality disorders constitute a severe impairment by definition. This argument has no merit. \u201cThe evaluation of whether an impairment(s) is \u2018severe\u2019 ... requires an assessment of the functionally limiting effects of an impairments) on an individual\u2019s ability to do basic work activities.\u201d SSR 96-3p.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b608-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b609-7\">. Hegel also argues that the ALJ improperly rejected the opinion of a treating physician, Dr. Ashley. Hegel\u2019s memorandum of authorities filed in the district court, however, only presents arguments regarding Drs. Arnold and Everhart. His argument regarding Dr. Ashley is raised for the first time on appeal, and we do not address it here. <em>See Bolker v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>760 F.2d 1039, 1042 (9th Cir.1985) (\u201cAs a general rule, we will not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
