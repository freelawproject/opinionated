After a thorough review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-26\">In 2006, Robinson pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine. Robinson qualified as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>resulting guidelines range was 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment. Upon a motion by the government, the district court departed downward based on Robinson\u2019s substantial assistance. Robinson was sentenced to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">In 2008, Robinson filed a \u00a7 3582 motion based on Amendment 706, which lowered the base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine sentences. The court denied the motion because Robinson qualified as a career offender and thus was not eligible for a reduction. On appeal, Robinson argues that the district court erred by failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Robinson also contends that it is unclear whether the district court knew it had the authority under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), to apply a non-mandatory sentence despite his career offender status and in light of the continued crack/powder cocaine sentencing disparity. Further Robinson argues that our recent precedent holding that a career offender was ineligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief was wrongly decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">In an appeal of the denial of a motion to reduce sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582, we review <em>\u201cde novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). We also review <em>\u201cde novo </em>questions of statutory interpretation.\u201d <em>United States v. Maupin, </em>520 F.3d 1304, 1306 (11th Cir.2008). We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the sentencing guidelines, for abuse of discretion. <em>White, </em>305 F.3d at 1267.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">Amendment 706, which reduced by two levels the offense levels in crack cocaine cases calculated pursuant to \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), became effective November 1, 2007. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706 (2007). The Amendment was made retroactive as of March 3, 2008, by incorporation into \u00a7 lB1.10(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court has discretion to reduce the term of imprisonment of an already incarcerated defendant if that defendant \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(e)(2). In such a case, the court may reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence, after considering applicable \u00a7 3553(a) factors, \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">The Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statement on retroactive reduction of sentences, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-11\">In a ease in which a defendant is serving a term of imprisonment, and the guideline range applicable to that defendant has subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines Manual listed in subsection (c) below, the court may reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment as provided by 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2). As required by 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2), any such reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment shall be consistent with this policy statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-12\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). A reduction in the term of imprisonment is not consistent with the Guidelines policy statement, and therefore not authorized by \u00a7 3582(c)(2), if the amendment either is not applicable to the defendant or the amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>Robinson\u2019s argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s ruling in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327-28 (11th Cir.2008), ce<em>rt. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009) (holding that, if the defendant was sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 and the guideline range was not affected by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, then the sentence is not \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered.\u201d). As this court explained, because the base offense levels under \u00a7 2D1.1 played no role in the calculation of the career offender range, the district court was not authorized to reduce the sentence even though Amendment 706 was retroactive. <em>Id. </em>at 1327,1330. This court further held that this result was the same even when a defendant received a downward departure for his substantial assistance under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, stating that there was \u201cno basis for concluding that the reduction of [the defendant\u2019s] base offense level lowered the sentencing range relied upon by the district court in determining his sentence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">Moreover, <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), do not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings and, therefore, do not override the limitations placed on the district court\u2019s discretion found in the applicable policy statements for such proceedings. <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93, 1193-94 (11th Cir.2009), ce<em>rt. petition filed, </em>No. 08-8664 (Feb. 10, 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-11\">Because Robinson qualified as a career offender, Amendment 706 did not lower his guidelines range and he was not entitled to resentencing under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). As such, the district court did not have authority to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Additionally, the district court was not permitted to consider the advisory nature of the guidelines under <em>Booker </em>or the powder/crack cocaine disparity discussed in <em>Kimbrough. </em>Finally, to the extent that Robinson argues our precedent is wrongly decided, we are bound by those cases until overruled by the Supreme Court or this court sitting <em>en banc. United States v. Steele, </em>147 F.3d 1316, 1317-18 (11th Cir.1998). Accordingly, we AFFIRM.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b896-25\">.
