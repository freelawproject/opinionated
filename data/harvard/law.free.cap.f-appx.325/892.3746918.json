On appeal, Eldira argues that he was eligible for a sentence reduction because, even though he was sentenced a career offender, the controlling precedent, <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number><em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009), was wrongly decided. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">A district court may not modify a term of imprisonment unless a defendant was sentenced based on a sentencing range that has \u201csubsequently been lowered\u201d by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B), (c)(2). Amendment 706, which has been made retroactive, amends the Drug Quantity Table in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) \u201cto provide a two-level reduction in base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1325. However, if a defendant is a career offender, his base offense level is determined under the career offender guideline in \u00a7 4Bl.l(b), and not the drug quantity guideline in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). 541 F.3d at 1327-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-8\">For this reason, we held in <em>Moore </em>that Amendment 706 has no effect on the applicable guideline range for defendants who are sentenced under the career offender guideline. <em>Id. </em>at 1330. Moreover, we have held that <em>Booker </em>does not, by itself, permit a district court to impose a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.2008). We are bound to follow our prior binding precedent \u201cunless and until it is overruled by this [C]ourt <em>en banc </em>or by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-9\">Eldira\u2019s argument that <em>Moore </em>was wrongly decided is meritless because <em>Moore </em>has not been overruled by either this Court sitting <em>en banc </em>or the Supreme Court, and, therefore, we remain bound by the <em>Moore </em>decision. <em>See Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d at 1236. In addition, because Eldira is ineligible for a \u00a7 3582 sentence reduction, <em>Booker </em>cannot be applied, on its own, to permit such a reduction to take place. <em>See Jones, </em>548 F.3d at 1369. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
