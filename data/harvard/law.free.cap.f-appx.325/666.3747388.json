ANDERSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b694-21\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this proceeding. <em>See </em>Fed. RApp. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-22\">Donald Gee, an inmate at the Wyoming State Penitentiary, proceeding pro se, seeks a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to appeal the dismissal of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The petition did not specify whether it sought habeas relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 or 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It did cite the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651, which is not applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>here. Aso without reference to a particular habeas statute, the district court dismissed the petition on the ground that it addressed only the conditions of Mr. Gee\u2019s confinement. Those conditions include his placement in long-term administrative segregation, a regression in his classification from \u201cAD SEG IV to AD SEG III,\u201d and a finding of guilty with respect to a disciplinary charge filed against him on July 7, 2008. For the reasons stated below, w\u00e9 agree with the district court that Mr. Gee\u2019s complaints relate solely to the circumstances of his confinement and that a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, whether pursuant to \u00a7 2254 or \u00a7 2241, is an improper vehicle for redress of those claims. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of ap-pealability and dismiss the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">According to Mr. Gee, he has now served approximately twenty-eight years in prison for an aggravated robbery conviction. Documents which he submitted indicate that he will complete his minimum sentence on November 18, 2021, and that he has a parole board date sometime in the second quarter of 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">Mr. Gee has been before the Tenth Circuit on more than twenty occasions, either on appeals or attempts to appeal. Among those proceedings, in 1996, Mr. Gee brought a civil action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 contending that certain officers at the Wyoming State Penitentiary violated his rights to substantive and procedural due process, equal protection, and freedom from cruel and unusual punishment, by arbitrarily and capriciously placing him in administrative segregation \u201cin an effort to break his spirit.\u201d <em>Duffy. v. Uphoff </em>No. 96-8017, 108 F.3d 341 (10th Cir. Feb.27, 1997) (unpublished). That action was dismissed by the district court as frivolous, and the dismissal was affirmed by this court. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">In 1998, we dismissed as frivolous a combined appeal in two other civil rights actions filed by Mr. Gee, this time contesting, among other things, a lack of access to a law library. <em>Gee v. Shillinger, </em>Nos. 96-8124, 97-8033, 134 F.3d 382 (10th Cir. Jan.27, 1998) (unpublished). In our opinion in that appeal, we imposed filing restrictions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-10\">We direct the clerk of this court not to accept any further appeals of judgments in civil actions or proceedings or any extraordinary writs in noncriminal matters, other than habeas, from Gee unless he pays the filing fees established by our rules.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-11\"><em>Gee, </em>134 F.3d at 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-12\">Perhaps in response to those restrictions, Mr. Gee denominated his proceeding in this case as one seeking a writ of habeas corpus, notwithstanding the general similarity of the allegations in the present case to those raised in appeal Nos. 96-8017, 96-8124 and 97-803 referred to above, and other complaints of alleged civil rights violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-13\">In any event, Mr. Gee\u2019s petition in this case alleges that since March 16, 2005, he has been placed (apparently for non-punitive reasons) in administrative segregation at the Wyoming State Penitentiary \u201cpending investigation into possible sleepwalking disorder, and until housing issues [are] resolved.\u201d Pet. \u00b6 8. In addition, Mr. Gee asserts that he has been arbitrarily regressed from administrative segregation level IV to administrative segregation level III, resulting in a loss of privileges. Finally, the petition alleges that disciplinary charges were unfairly filed against him in July 2008 in retaliation for his complaints about a new system for awarding privileges and about his assignment to level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>III. He claims he was denied due process in the disciplinary proceedings because he was not allowed to call witnesses or to submit documentary evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Mr. Gee\u2019s petition describes the root of his classification problems and assignment to a single-occupancy cell in administrative segregation, to be a sleep disorder which makes it impossible for him to control his behavior during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Mr. Gee allegedly walks in his sleep and, when asleep, trashes his cell and does injury to himself. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17-20. Arguably, this disorder renders him incapable of sharing a cell with another inmate, so he insists on a single-occupancy cell. The petition further asserts that single-occupancy cells have not been made available to Mr. Gee in the general population because no such cells are available due to overcrowding.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The relief sought by the petition includes: referral to an outside sleep disorder specialist for a determination as to whether or not Gee\u2019s sleep walking requires single-cell occupancy in the general population, and for treatment; assignment to one of the two cells in the general population unit that are designated for single-cell occupancy (although allegedly not available due to the size of the prison population); expungement of the disciplinary guilty finding of August 1, 2008; an order protecting Mr. Gee from racism, discrimination and retaliation; and, a writ of habeas corpus releasing Mr. Gee from custody allegedly approximating \u201cSupermax\u201d confinement, and transferring him to the general prison population. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 VH(d)(j).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">The petition does not contain any allegation with respect to earned or good time credits; nor does it seek any relief with respect to such credits or anything else relating to the duration of his sentence. Rather, as indicated above, Mr. Gee\u2019s complaints are limited to his classification within the prison, including privilege levels and assignment to administrative segregation, the imposition of discipline in August 2008, and alleged racism and retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-11\">In order for this court to grant a COA, Mr. Gee must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Where, as here, the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief is based on procedural grounds, he must demonstrate \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). A court need not pass on the constitutional issues raised by Mr. Gee if he cannot make a threshold showing that \u201cjurists of reason could conclude that the District Court\u2019s dismissal on procedural grounds was debatable or incorrect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 485, 120 S.Ct. 1595.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">In reviewing Mr. Gee\u2019s pleadings, we must accord them the special solicitude applicable to pleadings filed by prisoners proceeding pro se. <em>See, Erickson v. Par-dus, </em>551 U.S. 89, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 2200, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007); <em>Van Deelen v. Johnson, </em>497 F.3d 1151, 1153 n. 1 (10th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-13\">A proceeding seeking a writ of habeas corpus is subject to a predicate state court exhaustion requirement, and to the one-year limitations period prescribed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). As to the former, Mr. Gee alleges that there is no state procedural mechanism which allows Wyoming courts to review the type of Wyo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>ming Department of Corrections actions involved here. Pet. \u00b6\u00b6 28-30. Thus, exhaustion is impossible. As to the latter, we note that the one-year statute of limitations forecloses any review of Mr. Gee\u2019s assignment to administrative segregation in 2005, as set out in the petition. But, the petition renews these arguments with respect to actions taken in 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">As the district court observed, and as set out above, Mr. Gee\u2019s petition deals only with the conditions of his confinement: indefinite housing in administrative segregation versus special single-cell occupancy housing in the general population; regression to special status level III, restricting privileges with respect to property and activity; lack of treatment for an alleged sleep disorder; and, procedure and result relating to disciplinary proceedings commenced in July 2008. The petition does mention, in passing, race, equal protection, and retaliation, but the allegations are con-clusory, and, in any event, relate only to the circumstances just described. Nothing in the petition relates directly to or questions the fact of Mr. Gee\u2019s conviction or the duration of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">The Supreme Court has explained the role of habeas and civil rights actions as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-8\">Federal law opens two main avenues to relief on complaints related to imprisonment: a petition for habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, and a complaint under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, Rev. Stat. \u00a7 1979, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Challenges to the validity of any confinement or to particulars affecting its duration are the province of habeas corpus, <em>Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 500, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973); requests for relief turning on circumstances of confinement may be presented in a \u00a7 1983 action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-10\"><em>Muhammad v. Close, </em>540 U.S. 749, 750, 124 S.Ct. 1303, 158 L.Ed.2d 32 (2004); <em>see also Hill v. McDonough, </em>547 U.S. 573, 579, 126 S.Ct. 2096, 165 L.Ed.2d 44 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-11\">Mr. Gee contends that the office of a writ pursuant to \u00a7 2254 is broad enough to encompass petitions seeking a transfer from administrative segregation to the general prison population. In support, he cites a \u00a7 2254 case, in which a panel of the Seventh Circuit suggested that habeas (presumably \u00a7 2254) applies to petitions where the prisoner is \u201cseeking not earlier freedom, but transfer from a more to a less restrictive form of custody.\u201d <em>Graham v. Broglin, </em>922 F.2d 379, 381 (7th Cir.1991). The opinion offered the following as a generalization:.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-12\">If the prisoner is seeking what can fairly be described as a quantum change in the level of custody\u2014whether outright freedom, ... or the run of the prison in contrast to the approximation to solitary confinement that is disciplinary segregation\u2014then habeas corpus is his remedy. But if he is seeking a different program or location or environment, then he is challenging the conditions rather than the fact of his confinement and his remedy is under civil rights law, even if, as will usually be the case, the program or environment that he is challenging is more restrictive than the alternative that he seeks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-13\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b697-14\">Even giving that dicta some weight here, it is distinguishable from Mr. Gee\u2019s assignment to administrative segregation for the past three-plus years, since the petition itself establishes that the assignment was not disciplinary but a purely administrative response to Mr. Gee\u2019s \u201cmedical\u201d condition and single-cell occupancy needs. Regardless, the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>proposition stated in <em>Graham </em>has not gained any significant traction, and, following the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995), it has been questioned. In <em>Sylvester v. Hanks, </em>140 F.3d 713 (7th Cir.1998), another panel of the Seventh Circuit reviewed a \u00a7 2254 case challenging an order transferring a prisoner to confinement in disciplinary segregation for three years. At the outset it expressed reservations about the propriety of using \u00a7 2254 as a vehicle to challenge the prisoner\u2019s changed custody status, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-4\">We confess to some doubt that this ease should proceed under \u00a7 2254. Sylvester does not seek earlier release from custody.... Instead, he contends that his custody should take one form (the prison\u2019s general population) rather than another (segregation). Section 2254 is the appropriate remedy only when the prisoner attacks the fact or duration of \u201ccustody.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 714 (citation and parenthetical omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">More directly to the point, the Tenth Circuit has not countenanced the use of \u00a7 2254 as a vehicle for challenging circumstances of confinement unrelated to the fact or duration of a prisoner\u2019s custody, and we hold that \u00a7 2254 is not available to Mr. Gee in the circumstances challenged in his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">The remaining question is whether \u00a7 2241 is available to Mr. Gee as a vehicle to seek a transfer from administrative segregation to the general prison population, as well as for other conditions of confinement relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-11\">This circuit has held that \u00a7 2241 most appropriately applies to government action that <em>inevitably </em>affects the <em>\u201cduration </em>of the petitioner\u2019s custody.\u201d <em>McIntosh v. U.S. Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>115 F.3d 809, 812 (10th Cir.1997) (emphasis added); <em>Boyce v. Ashcroft, </em>251 F.3d 911, 914 (10th Cir.2001) (\u201cPrisoners who raise constitutional challenges ... to administrative segregation ... or suspension of privileges ... must proceed under \u00a7 1983....\u201d). Since, as explained above, Mr. Gee\u2019s petition challenges only administrative decisions affecting his day-to-day circumstances and prison privileges, then, under the facts presented here, \u00a7 1983, not \u00a7 2241, is the statute under which he must proceed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-12\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-13\">Requiring claims like those here to be pm-sued in a civil rights action does not risk their dismissal under the rule of <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). In <em>Heck, </em>the Supreme Court ruled that where success in a prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action would implicitly question the validity of conviction or length of detention then a successful habeas action must precede it. <em>See Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997). Obviously, since we hold here that Mr. Gee\u2019s claims cannot proceed under \u00a7 2254 or \u00a7 2241, the rule in <em>Heck </em>would not apply.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-14\">Mr. Gee is neither expressly nor implicitly attacking his incarceration pursuant to his original judgment of conviction. And, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>he is not challenging the duration of his confinement. Accordingly, <em>Heck </em>would not apply to a subsequent civil rights action by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">We hold that Mr. Gee\u2019s claims cannot proceed under either \u00a7 2254 or \u00a7 2241. On the face of this petition, such a conclusion, and its concomitant and procedural dismissal, are not debatable by jurists of reason. Accordingly, Mr. Gee\u2019s application for a certificate of appealability is DENIED; his motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is DENIED; and, this proceeding is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b694-14\"> This order is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b694-23\">. A COA is required in proceedings under both \u00a7 2254 and \u00a7 2241. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A); <em>Montez v. McKinna, </em>208 F.3d 862, 869 (10th Cir.2000) (holding that \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A) requires a state prisoner to obtain a COA regardless of whether he is seeking relief under \u00a7 2254 or under \u00a7 2241).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b698-8\">.
