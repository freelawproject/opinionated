Henderson appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing his action summarily asserting that Defendants refused to help him in'obtaining the medical retirement benefits he was allegedly denied in 1981, and asking his former union to proceed on his written request for benefits. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Henderson v. Naland, </em>No. 1:08-cv-00535-LMB-TCB (E.D.Va. February 17, 2009). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
