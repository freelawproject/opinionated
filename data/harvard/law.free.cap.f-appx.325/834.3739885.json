He contends that, while others in the conspiracy negotiated the sale and transported the cocaine, he only provided a bank account for deposit of travel expenses and traveled with a fellow conspirator from Oklahoma to Florida to carry out the sale. He further argues that he was unaware of the full scope and structure of the enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-12\">As the determination of a defendant\u2019s role in a crime is highly factual, we review the district court\u2019s decision for clear error. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc); <em>see also United States v. Alston, </em>895 F.2d 1362, 1369 (11th Cir.1990) (\u201cThe requirement in Guidelines \u00a7 3B1.2 that a judge determine whether the defendant was \u00e1 \u2018minor\u2019 or \u2018minimal\u2019 participant is a factual determination and therefore subject to the clearly erroneous standard.\u201d). Guidelines \u00a7 3B1.2 provides that, with regard to a defendant\u2019s role in the offense and the offense level, \u201c[i]f the defendant was a minimal participant in any criminal activity, decrease by 4 levels,\u201d and \u201c[i]f the defendant was a minor participant in any criminal activity, decrease by 2 levels.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3B1.2. The district court here applied the latter rule, but Martinez contends that it should have applied the former. As to the minimal participant adjustment, the commentary to Guidelines \u00a7 3B1.2 explains that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWRo\">[i]t is intended to cover defendants who are plainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group. Under this provision, the defendant\u2019s lack of knowledge or understanding of the scope and structure of the enterprise and of the activities of others is indicative of a role as minimal participant. It is intended that the downward adjustment for a minimal participant will be used infrequently.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-15\">U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 4. The determination is \u201cheavily dependent upon the facts of the particular case\u201d and a court must weigh the totality of the circumstances and is not bound by the \u201cdefendant\u2019s bare assertion____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at n. 3(C). \u201cThe proponent of the downward adjustment ... always bears the burden of proving a mitigating role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-17\">We have set forth two principles to guide courts in making role determinations. First, the district court must measure the defendant\u2019s actual role against his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>relevant conduct, specifically the conduct for which the defendant is being held accountable at sentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 934. Second, if the record will allow it, the court may measure the defendant\u2019s conduct against the conduct of the other participants in the scheme. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">Upon review of the record and the arguments presented in the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. Given that Martinez agreed with the factual assertions in the PSI and with the Government at his plea hearing, specifically, that (1) he knew he was participating in the sale of cocaine, (2) he provided assistance in form of a bank account, and (3) he served as a travel companion to his coconspirator from Oklahoma to the site of the sale in Florida, sufficient evidence exists to show that Martinez participated in the scheme in a meaningful way and was aware of the scope and structure of the enterprise. Moreover, \u201c[t]he fact that a defendant\u2019s role may be less than that of other participants engaged in the relevant conduct may not be dispositive of role in the offense, since it is possible that none are minor or minimal participants.\u201d <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>175 F.3d at 944. Therefore, the district court did not commit clear error by denying him a four-level reduction for being a minimal participant. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
