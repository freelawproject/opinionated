TYMKOVICH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b686-23\">Jessie Ailsworth, Jr., a federal prisoner serving a 360-month sentence for crack cocaine trafficking and other crimes, brings this appeal challenging the district court\u2019s dismissal of his motion to reduce his sentence. He claims a recent amendment to the United States Sentencing Guidelines (USSG), which applies retroactively and lowers certain base offense levels associated with crack cocaine convictions, mandates he receive a reduced sentence. The district court dismissed his motion, finding Ailsworth\u2019s circumstances are not within the scope of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>amendment and that the court was therefore without jurisdiction to reconsider his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Having jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">The parties are familiar with the facts of this case, so we only briefly summarize the relevant background here. After being indicted on forty-five counts relating to possession and distribution of cocaine base or crack cocaine, food stamp fraud, and various firearm charges, Ailsworth was convicted by a jury on seven of the charges. The presentence report (PSR) attributed 12 kilograms of cocaine base to Ailsworth, resulting in an offense level of 38 under USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l). The district court, after adjusting the offense level upward by 4 levels because of Ailsworth\u2019s role as a leader of a drug trafficking conspiracy, followed the Guidelines and sentenced Ailsworth to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment. We affirmed Ailsworth\u2019s convictions and sentence on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Ailsworth, </em>138 F.3d 843 (10th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">Ailsworth then sought habeas relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, raising various procedural and constitutional challenges to his sentence. <em>United States v. Ailsworth, </em>206 F.Supp.2d 1148 (D.Kan.2002). The district court granted relief on one issue, reducing Ailsworth\u2019s term of supervised release to five years, but denied the remainder of his \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>United States v. Ailsworth, </em>No. 99-3324-SAC, 2002 WL 31314798 (D.Kan. Aug.18, 2002). We denied Ailsworth a certificate of appealability and dismissed his appeal. <em>United States v. Ailsworth, </em>No. 02-3396 (10th Cir. Apr. 14, 2004). We also subsequently denied him permission to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>United States v. Ailsworth, </em>No. 06-3001 (10th Cir. Jan. 31, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">At issue here is Ailsworth\u2019s July 2008 motion to reduce his sentence, filed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 706 to the Guidelines, which allows for the reduction of some sentences involving crack cocaine. The district court dismissed his motion, finding that although Amendment 706 applied retroactively and \u201craised the threshold amount of cocaine base from 1.5 kilograms to 4.5 kilograms for a base offense level of 38,\u201d Ailsworth was \u201caccountable for more than 4.5 kilograms, specifically 12 kilograms.\u201d R., Doc. 933 at 4-5. Because Ailsworth\u2019s base offense level and guideline range were unchanged even in light of Amendment 706, the district court determined it lacked jurisdiction to consider Ailsworth\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-11\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b687-12\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of a statute as well as the sentencing guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Shar-key, </em>543 F.3d 1236, 1238 (10th Cir.2008). However, a district court\u2019s decision to deny a reduction in sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b687-13\">This is not a direct appeal or \u00a7 2255 petition, so Ailsworth\u2019s motion depends entirely on \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Smartt, </em>129 F.3d 539, 540 (10th Cir.1997)). Section 3582(c)(2) provides that \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission ... the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent they are applicable, <em>if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number><em>Commission. \u201d Id. </em>at 1238-39 (quoting \u00a7 3582(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Amendment 706 modified the Drug Quantity Table contained in USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) downward two levels for crack cocaine and became effective November 1, 2007, and retroactive as of March 3, 2008. <em>See </em>USSG App. C, Amend. 706 (Reason for Amend.); USSG \u00a7 lB1.10(a) and (c), Amends. 712, 713 (making Amendment 706 retroactive); <em>see also United States v. Rhodes, </em>549 F.3d 833, 835 (10th Cir.2008), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Jan. 21, 2009) (No. 08-8318). But the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statement in USSG \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2) states that a reduction \u201cis not consistent with this policy statement and therefore is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) <em>if\u2014... [the reduction] does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2), (a)(2)(B) (emphasis added); <em>see also Sharkey, </em>543 F.3d at 1239.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Here, as the district court properly noted, Amendment 706 did not change Ails-worth\u2019s base offense level and therefore the Amendment\u2019s reduction \u201cd[id] not have the effect of lowering ... [Ailsworth\u2019s] applicable guideline range.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). The sentencing court determined Ailsworth\u2019s base offense level of 38 by finding he was responsible for possessing and distributing 12 kilograms of cocaine base\u2014still well above the new Amendment 706 threshold for a base offense level of 38. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l); \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. n. 10(D)(ii) (\u201cThe 2-level reduction provided in ... [Amendment 706] shall not apply in a case in which ... the offense involved 4.5 kg or more ... of cocaine base.\u201d). Therefore, the district court did not err when it concluded that it lacked jurisdiction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to consider Ailsworth\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction pursuant to Amendment 706. <em>See Sharkey, </em>543 F.3d at 1239; <em>United States v. Wanton, </em>525 F.3d 621, 622 (8th Cir.2008) (\u201c[T]he new amendment does not apply where more than 4.5 kilograms of [cocaine base] is involved.\u201d (citing USSG \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. n. 10(D)(ii))).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">Ailsworth argues the district court erred by treating USSG \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B) as a jurisdictional limit. He contends such an approach violates the Sixth Amendment \u201cby preserving one last mandatory guideline.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 3. Further, he claims such a jurisdictional rule violates separation of powers principles by \u201cinvesting ... [the Sentencing Commission] with the power to control the jurisdiction of federal courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4. Ailsworth, however, concedes that our precedent forecloses his arguments. <em>Id. </em>at 3 (citing <em>Rhodes, </em>549 F.3d 833; <em>Sharkey, </em>543 F.3d 1236). As he states, because \u201cthere is a circuit split on this issue,\u201d he \u201cfiles the instant appeal in order to preserve his ability to benefit 'from Supreme Court review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finding no merit to Ailsworth\u2019s arguments and for largely the same reasons as announced by the district court in its thorough opinion, we hold that Ailsworth is not entitled to any reduction in his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">Relying on the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Hicks, </em>472 F.3d 1167, 1171-72 (9th Cir.2007), Ailsworth mistakenly claims the district court violated the Sixth Amendment by treating USSG \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B) as mandatory. First, the district court did not treat the Guideline as mandatory. Rather, the court determined that its limited jurisdiction to reduce a sentence after a retroactive amendment to the Guidelines was controlled by statute, namely 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">Second, Ailsworth\u2019s argument is foreclosed by our prior decision in <em>Rhodes, </em>549 F.3d 833. Rejecting the Ninth Circuit\u2019s approach in <em>Hicks, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>The problem with the <em>Hicks </em>decision, in our view, is that it failed to consider that, as outlined above, sentence modification proceedings have a different statutory basis than original sentencing proceedings. As a result, the Ninth Circuit erroneously concluded that the remedial portion of the <em>Booker </em>decision, which rendered the guidelines effectively advisory for purposes of original sentencing proceedings, applied to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-5\"><em>Rhodes, </em>549 F.3d at 841.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We concluded that neither <em>Booker </em>nor Sixth Amendment concerns have any \u201cbearing on sentencing modification proceedings conducted under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 840. Because \u201c[w]e are bound by the precedent of prior panels absent en banc reconsideration or a superseding contrary decision by the Supreme Court,\u201d <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>518 F.3d 740, 752 n. 14 (10th Cir.2008), Ailsworth\u2019s Sixth Amendment contention fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Ailsworth also raises a separation of powers challenge to the district court\u2019s limited jurisdiction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). He argues, for the first time on appeal, that our approach in <em>Rhodes </em>\u201cinvests the Sentencing Commission, a mere agency, with the power to determine which cases the federal courts have jurisdiction to consider.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">We generally will not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal. <em>United States v. Mora, </em>293 F.3d 1213, 1218 (10th Cir.2002). But even if we consider the separation of powers issue, Ailsworth\u2019s argument fails. The Supreme Court noted in <em>Booker </em>that the Sentencing Commission \u201cis an independent agency that exercises policymaking authority delegated to it by Congress\u201d and the Commission\u2019s authority to promulgate the Guidelines does not violate separation of powers principles. 543 U.S. at 242-43, 125 S.Ct. 738. In particular, after excising certain provisions which had made the Guidelines mandatory, <em>Booker </em>determined that \u201c[t]he remainder of the [Sentencing] Act satisfies the Court\u2019s constitutional requirements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 259, 125 S.Ct. 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">Section 3582 is included in that constitutionally valid remainder. \u201c[N]either the Sixth Amendment nor <em>Booker </em>prevents Congress from incorporating a guideline provision as a means of defining and limiting a district court\u2019s authority to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c).\u201d <em>United States v. Starks, </em>551 F.3d 839, 842 (8th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Franklin, </em>321 Fed.Appx. 754, 758 (10th Cir.2009) (unpublished). Furthermore, in <em>United States v. Price, </em>we concluded that \u201ca district court is authorized to modify a defendant\u2019s sentence only in specified instances where Congress has expressly granted the court jurisdiction to do so.\u201d 438 F.3d 1005, 1007 (10th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The express terms of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) provide that \u201cthe court only has authority to modify a sentence when the range has been lowered <em>\u2018by the Sentencing </em>Commission.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1006-07 (quoting \u00a7 3582(c)(2)) (emphasis added); <em>see also United States v. Pedraza, </em>550 F.3d 1218, 1221 (10th Cir.2008), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Jan. 21, 2009) (No. 08-9494) (approving of the relationship between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Commission and the courts\u2019 jurisdiction and stating \u201celigibility for reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is \u2018inexorably tied\u2019 to Sentencing Commission policy statements.... We must therefore turn to the Commission\u2019s policy statements to determine the scope of the statutory grant of resentencing authority.\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">Section 1B1.10(a)(2)(B), promulgated by the Commission, both defines and limits a district court\u2019s authority to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). And, in this case, because of the cocaine quantity involved in Ailsworth\u2019s conviction, the district court was without power to reduce Ailsworth\u2019s prison term. Therefore, even if we were to address Ailsworth\u2019s separation of powers argument on appeal, it fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">For the foregoing reasons we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of Ailsworth\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b686-24\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b689-8\">. In <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Supreme Court held that the Guidelines were advisory by excising the mandatory provision in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b). <em>Rhodes, </em>549 F.3d at 839. Notably, however, the <em>Booker </em>decision had no effect on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Id. </em>at 840; <em>see also United States v.
