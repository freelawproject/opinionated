After a thorough review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-29\">Thomas pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute crack cocaine and was sentenced to 262 months\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>imprisonment. He subsequently filed a motion for a reduction in sentence, \u00a7 3582(c), based on Amendment 706 to the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced the base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine offenses. The district court granted the motion, reduced the offense level by 2 and determined the new guidelines range to be 210 to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court sentenced Thomas to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Thomas argues that the district court erred in its application of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) when it resentenced him without consideration of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and refused to sentence him below the minimum of the amended guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced based on a sentencing range that subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable policy statements, found in \u00a7 1B1.10, state that \u201cthe court shall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">Thomas\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by precedent. This court recently held that <em>Booker </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, and thus, the district court is bound by the limitations imposed by \u00a7 1B1.10 and does not have the authority to sentence below the amended guideline range. <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Feb. 10, 2009) (No. 08-8664); <em>see also United States v. Webb, </em>565 F.3d 789, 793-94 (11th Cir.2009). Accordingly, we affirm. \u2018</p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
