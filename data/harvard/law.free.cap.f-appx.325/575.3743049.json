Pacific Bell, </em>202 F.3d 1170, 1178 (9th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>2000). Here, Louis Chiaramonte (\u201cChiaramonte\u201d) presented no evidence that he was unaware of his injury, or that he acted with any diligence to investigate whether he had a claim under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act (\u201cFELA\u201d), 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51, <em>et seq. </em>Therefore he is not entitled to equitable tolling: \u201cThe absolute lack of any effort on his part to inquire about available options defeats his equitable tolling claim.\u201d <em>See Huseman v. Icicle Seafoods, Inc., </em>471 F.3d 1116, 1120 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Chiaramonte also argues that his employer, Santa Cruz Big Trees &amp; Pacific Railway Co. (\u201cSCBT\u201d), should be equitably estopped from asserting the statute of limitations against him because SCBT helped him to receive California workers\u2019 compensation but did not inform him of his potential FELA claim. The equitable estoppel analysis \u201cfocuses primarily on the actions taken by the defendant in preventing a plaintiff from filing suit.\u201d <em>Santa Maria, </em>202 F.3d at 1176. In order to assert equitable estoppel, the plaintiff must demonstrate both actual and reasonable reliance on the defendant\u2019s conduct or representations. <em>Id. </em>It was unreasonable for Chiaramonte to assume that SCBT\u2019s assistance with obtaining workers\u2019 compensation indicated that no federal remedies were available. <em>See Huseman, </em>471 F.3d at 1123-24 (finding same).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b603-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
