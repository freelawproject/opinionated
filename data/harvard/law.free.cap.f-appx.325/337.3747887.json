Virginia, </em>536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-18\">We are satisfied that this new claim is time-barred, so we deny petitioner\u2019s motion for a stay of execution and deny authorization to file a successive habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-20\">Johnson was convicted and sentenced to death for murdering LaTausha Curry. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed Johnson\u2019s conviction and sentence on January 30, 2002. <em>Johnson v. State, </em>68 S.W.3d 644 (Tex.Crim.App.2002). Johnson did not petition the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. Concurrent with his direct appeal, Johnson filed an application for habeas relief in the trial court on October 22, 2001. On August 14, 2003, the trial court entered an order adopting the State\u2019s proposed findings recommending that relief on Johnson\u2019s application be de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>nied. The Court of Criminal Appeals then adopted the trial judge\u2019s recommendation, and denied habeas relief on October 8, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Next, Johnson filed his habeas petition in federal district court. The lower court denied habeas relief and dismissed his petition with prejudice. Johnson timely appealed and the lower court denied his request for a COA. Johnson petitioned the United States Supreme Court for certiora-ri review on December 20, 2008. The court denied certiorari on March 9, 2009. <em>Johnson v. Quarterman, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1583, 173 L.Ed.2d 680 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">On April 28, 2009, Johnson filed a subsequent state habeas application with the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals raising, for the first time, an assertion that his execution would violate the prohibition against the execution of the mentally retarded as set forth in <em>Atkins, supra. </em>However, the Court of Criminal Appeals found that Johnson failed to make a prima facie case of mental retardation and otherwise failing to meet the requirements of Article 11.071 Sec. 5. <em>Ex parte Johnson, </em>56,947-02, 2009 WL 1165502 (Tex.Crim. App. April 29, 2009) (unpublished order). The instant motion for authorization to file a successive federal habeas petition followed on April 29, 2009. Petitioner is scheduled to be executed today, April 30, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">The facts of the petitioner\u2019s brutal sexual assault and murder of 25-year-old La-Tausha Curry on January 21, 1999 have been set forth in detail in our earlier opinion and the opinion of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. We will not repeat them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">Some of the relevant dates have been set forth above. We repeat these dates and others in the timeline set forth below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-11\">November 19, 1999: Johnson sentenced to death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-12\">October 22, 2001: Johnson files state petition for writ of habeas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-13\">January 30, 2002: Tex.

Johnson files the current motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-26\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-27\">Based on the above timeline, it is clear that petitioner\u2019s motion is barred by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>one-year limitation period of the Antiter-rorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-4\">(d)(1) A 1-year period of limitation shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court.

However, on June 20, 2002, when <em>Atkins </em>was decided, petitioner\u2019s state habeas application was pending and was not decided until October 8, 2003. This is relevant because the time is not counted toward the limitation period while a properly filed application for state post-conviction relief on the pertinent claim is pending. Johnson\u2019s limitation period therefore expired on October 8, 2004, one year after his state habeas application was denied by the state court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). Johnson\u2019s federal habeas petition does not toll the statute of limitations. <em>Duncan v. Walker, </em>533 U.S. 167, 181-82, 121 S.Ct. 2120, 150 L.Ed.2d 251 (2001). Consequently, any petition Johnson now files concerning <em>Atkins </em>would be more than four years past the October 8, 2004 expiration of his limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-13\">Moreover, this Court has never held that <em>Atkins </em>claims are somehow exempt from the limitations period. To the contrary, this Court has held that a successive federal petition based on mental retardation claims is subject to \u00a7 2244(d)\u2019s one-year statute of limitations, and equitable tolling is available only in \u201crare and extraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>In re Wilson, </em>442 F.3d 872, 877-78 (5th Cir.2006); <em>In re Lewis, </em>484 F.3d 793, 796 (5th Cir.2007). Although we noted that this Court recognized a limited exception to petitioners who were unrepresented by counsel and constrained by the Texas two-forum rule, <em>In re Wilson, </em>442 F.3d at 875-76 (citing <em>In re Hearn, </em>389 F.3d 122 (5th Cir.2004)), neither of these conditions apply to Johnson. First, Johnson has been represented by federal habeas counsel at every stage of his post-conviction proceedings and has had the same counsel since before his first federal writ was denied. Furthermore, the Texas two-forum rule was renounced by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on February 11, 2004, months before Johnson filed his federal habeas petition. <em>See Ex parte Soffar, </em>143 S.W.3d 804, 804 (Tex. Crim.App.2004) (modifying the two-forum rule to \u201cpermit consideration of a subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>quent state writ ... if the federal court with jurisdiction over a parallel writ enters an order staying its proceedings to allow the habeas applicant to pursue his unex-hausted claims in Texas state court\u201d). Thereafter, a petitioner was not required to abandon his original federal habeas claims to pursue an <em>Atkins </em>claim in state court. Even if we were to give Johnson one year from the date <em>Ex parte Soffar </em>was decided, or until February 11, 2005, his successive petition would still be untimely. Accordingly, Johnson failed to meet his statutory deadline, and his <em>Atkins </em>claim is time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Johnson is not entitled to equitable tolling. \u201cThe doctrine of equitable tolling is applied restrictively and, as we have held repeatedly, is entertained only in cases presenting \u2018rare and exceptional circumstances where it is necessary to preserve a plaintiffs claims when strict application of the statute of limitations would be inequitable.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Wilson, </em>442 F.3d at 875 (quoting <em>Fierro v. Cockrell, </em>294 F.3d 674, 682 (5th Cir.2002)). Here, Johnson has provided no reason for missing the deadline by years, much less a rare and exceptional one. As this Court has long stated, \u201c \u2018[ejquity is not intended for those who sleep on their rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Fisher v. Johnson, </em>174 F.3d 710, 715 (5th Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">For the above reasons we deny Johnson\u2019s Motion for Order Authorizing Filing and Consideration of Second Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. We also deny a stay of execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b366-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
