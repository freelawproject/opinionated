He appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate his sentences, claiming that he was denied Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel because of a conflict of interest involving his trial counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We granted his motion to a certificate of ap-pealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) as to the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-15\">(1) Whether the trial court conducted an adequate <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>517 F.2d 272 (5th Cir.1975)[, <em>abrogated in </em>part <em>by Flanagan v. United States, </em>465 U.S. 259, 263, 104 S.Ct. 1051, 1053, 79 L.Ed.2d 288 (1984) ], hearing to discern whether there as a conflict of interest resulting from trial counsel\u2019s possible participation in [MeCorkle\u2019s] criminal activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-16\">(2) Whether [McCorkle] waived his right to conflict-free counsel, in light of the fact that [he] may not have been informed at the hearing held pursuant to <em>Garcia </em>of the potential consequences of proceeding to trial with an attorney who may have been involved in [McCorkle\u2019s] criminal conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>(3) If [MeCorkle] did not waive his right to conflict-free counsel, whether trial counsel acted under a conflict of interest at trial based on his possible participation in [McCorkle\u2019s] criminal activity, and if so, whether the district court erred in finding that trial counsel was not ineffective at trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-5\">(4) Whether the trial court should have removed [McCorkle\u2019s] trial counsel on the basis that he may have participated in [McCorkle\u2019s] criminal activity, even if [MeCorkle] waived his right to conflict-free counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-6\">(5) Whether [McCorkle\u2019s] appellate counsels were ineffective for failing to argue that the <em>Garcia </em>hearing was insufficient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">Petitioner contends that the <em>Garcia </em>hearing the district court conducted was inadequate because the court failed clearly to identify the potential conflict of interest resulting from his trial counsel\u2019s possible participation in his criminal activities. Specifically, he contends that he did not know, and the trial court did not address the possibility, that trial counsel\u2019s role in establishing a Legal Trust Account (\u201cLTA\u201d) constituted criminal activity, thus creating a conflict of interest. He asserts that, because he was unaware of counsel\u2019s criminal activity, he did not know the legal ramifications of the conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">A defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel is denied when defense counsel has an actual conflict of interest that adversely affects the defendant. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>982 F.2d 474, 477 (11th Cir.1993). A defendant, however, may waive Ms\u2019right to conflict-free counsel. <em>See Garcia, </em>517 F.2d at 276. To be effective, a waiver of a constitutional right \u201cmust be an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.\u201d <em>Garcia, </em>517 F.2d at 276 (citing <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1023, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938)). To be valid, a waiver must be not only voluntary, but it also must be \u201cknowing, intelligent acts done with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences.\u201d <em>Garcia, </em>517 F.2d at 276 (citing <em>Brady v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 748, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 1469, 25 L.Ed.2d 747, 756 (1970)). The trial court must evaluate each potential conflict of interest that is apparent to the court. <em>Garcia, </em>517 F.2d at 277. In a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate proceeding, the burden of proof rests upon the movant to establish that he did not competently and intelligently waive his constitutional right. <em>See Johnson, </em>304 U.S. at 468-69, 58 S.Ct. at 1025.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-11\">A defendant may waive his right to conflict-free counsel \u201cby choosing to proceed to trial with an attorney who has an adverse conflict of interest.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>982 F.2d at 477. A waiver of the right to conflict-free counsel \u201cdisposes of the need to evaluate the actual or potential ineffectiveness of counsel caused by the alleged conflicts of interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe determination of whether there has been an intelligent waiver of right to counsel must depend, in each case, upon the particular facts and circumstances surrounding the case, including the background, experience, and conduct of the [defendant].\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). A proper waiver \u201cmust be established by clear, unequivocal, and unambiguous language.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). In order for a waiver to be valid the record must show \u201cthat [1] the defendant was aware of the conflict of interest; [2] realized the conflict could affect the defense; and [3] knew of the right to obtain other counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While the court should seek to elicit a narrative response from the defendant, \u201c[mjere assent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>in response to a series of questions from the bench may in some circumstances constitute an adequate waiver.\u201d <em>Garcia, </em>517 F.2d at 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">Here, the district court conducted an adequate <em>Garcia </em>hearing because it: (1) explained petitioner\u2019s right to conflict-free counsel; (2) elicited testimony concerning the facts and circumstance of the case; (3) discussed the rule prohibiting counsel from assisting in fraudulent conduct; (4) explained the dangers of counsel having a conflict of interest with a client; and (5) explained petitioner\u2019s right to obtain or talk with other counsel. Moreover, because the court conducted an adequate <em>Garcia </em>hearing, petitioner knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to conflict-free counsel as: (1) he was aware of the possible conflict of interest; (2) the court explained that a conflict could affect his defense; and (3) he knew of his right to obtain conflict-free counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">With regard to the third issue, petitioner first argues that counsel\u2019s representation was a <em>per se </em>violation of the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance because counsel participated in petitioner\u2019s criminal activities. This argument fails because this circuit does not recognize a <em>per se </em>violation of the right to effective assistance of counsel. <em>See Pegg v. United States, </em>253 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir.2001) (declining to apply the Second Circuit\u2019s <em>per se </em>analysis, but instead using the actual conflict with an adverse effect analysis). Petitioner\u2019s second argument is that counsel had an actual conflict of interest based on counsel\u2019s desire to secure payment from the LTA, which kept him from effectively representing petitioner\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">Where an ineffective assistance claim is based on a conflict of interest, \u201ca defendant must show first, that his attorney had an actual conflict of interest, and second, that the conflict adversely affected counsel\u2019s performance.\u201d <em>Pegg, </em>253 F.3d at 1277 (emphasis omitted); <em>see also Mickens v. Taylor, </em>535 U.S. 162, 172 n. 5, 122 S.Ct. 1237, 1244 n. 5, 152 L.Ed.2d 291 (2002) (\u201cAn \u2018actual conflict,\u2019 for Sixth Amendment purposes, is a conflict of interest that adversely affects counsel\u2019s performance.\u201d). \u201cAn \u2018actual conflict\u2019 of interest occurs when a lawyer has \u2018inconsistent interests.\u2019\u201d <em>Freund v. Butterworth, </em>165 F.3d 839, 859 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en </em>banc) (citation omitted). The conflict cannot be merely possible, speculative, or hypothetical. <em>Reynolds v. Chapman, </em>253 F.3d 1337, 1342 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">To distinguish between actual and possible conflicts of interest, we \u201cwill not find an actual conflict of interest unless [the defendant] can point to specific instances in the record to suggest an actual conflict or impairment of [his] interests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1343. The defendant \u201cmust make a factual showing of inconsistent interests and must demonstrate that the. attorney made a choice between possible alternative causes of action, such as eliciting (or failing to elicit) evidence helpful to one client but harmful to [himself]. If he did not make such a choice, the conflict remain(s) hypothetical.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted) (omission in original). \u201cTo prove adverse effect, a defendant needs to demonstrate: (a) that the defense attorney could have pursued a plausible alternative strategy, (b) that this alternative strategy was reasonable, and (c) that the alternative strategy was not followed because it conflicted with the attorney\u2019s external loyalties.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b836-10\">Here, petitioner\u2019s attorney did not have an actual conflict of interest that adversely effected his representation of his client. Thus, petitioner was not denied effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Petitioner argues that, because the district court knew that counsel was involved in forfeiture proceedings involving the LTA, it was fully aware of counsel\u2019s potential involvement in his criminal activities and should have disqualified him. While \u201ca criminal defendant has a presumptive right to counsel of choice, and courts should hesitate to disqualify defense counsel, ... that right is not absolute.\u201d <em>United States v. Ross, </em>33 F.3d 1507, 1522-23 (11th Cir.1994) (citation omitted). In determining whether to disqualify counsel, the district court must balance \u201c(1) the right to be represented by counsel of choice and (2) the right to a defense conducted by an attorney who is free of conflicts of interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1523 (citing <em>Wheat v. United States, 486 </em>U.S. 153, 162-63, 108 S.Ct. 1692, 1698-99, 100 L.Ed.2d 140 (1988)). Although a defendant may waive his right to conflict-free counsel, a district pourt does not have to accept waiver of that right. <em>Ross, </em>33 F.3d at 1524.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">Because the district court conducted an adequate <em>Garcia </em>hearing and was unaware that petitioner\u2019s counsel may have participated in petitioner\u2019s criminal activity, it did not err by accepting petitioner\u2019s waiver of the right to conflict-free counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">Petitioner\u2019s final argument is that, because he has a valid Sixth Amendment claim based on the district court\u2019s failure to explore his attorney\u2019s involvement in petitioner\u2019s criminal activity, which resulted in a conflict of interest, the lawyers who represented him in appealing his convictions and sentences were ineffective by failing to raise the conflict issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">\u201cAn ineffective assistance of counsel claim is properly raised in a collateral attack on the conviction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>United States v. Butler, </em>41 F.3d 1435, 1437 n. 1 (11th Cir.1995). Ineffective assistance of counsel claims need not be raised on direct appeal, as the Supreme Court has held that \u201can ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim may be brought in a collateral proceeding under \u00a7 2255, whether or not the petitioner could have raised the claim on direct appeal.\u201d <em>Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 1694, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-11\">Petitioner suffered no prejudice through appellate counsel\u2019s failure to challenge his <em>Garcia </em>hearing on direct appeal because an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim may be brought in a collateral proceeding under \u00a7 2255, regardless of whether it was raised on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-12\">We have carefully reviewed the issues cited in the COA and have found no error in the district court\u2019s treatment thereof. The court\u2019s order denying \u00a7 2255 relief is, therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b837-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b834-9\">. This case is before this court for the third time. <em>See United States v. Venske, </em>296 F.3d 1284 (11th Cir.2002) (affirming petitioner's convictions and remanding the case for resentencing); <em>United States v. McCorkle, </em>321 F.3d 1292 (11th Cir.2003) (dealing with the forfeiture of funds); and <em>United States v.
