Moore, 541 F.3d 1323 </em>(11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied sub nom. McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), is inapplicable and he is entitled to \u00a7 3582 relief. To the contrary, Ferguson was sentenced as a career offender pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.1, instead of based on the drug quantity in \u00a7 2D1.1. The applicable base offense level under \u00a7 4B1.1 applied because it was greater than the \u00a7 2D1.1 base offense level. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) (stating that the base offense level in \u00a7 4B1.1 applies as long as it is higher than the \u201coffense level otherwise applicable,\u201d such as the levels under \u00a7 2D1.1). Because Ferguson was sentenced based on the career offender guideline section, the base offense levels under \u00a7 2D1.1 \u201cplayed no role in the calculation of [the guideline] range[ ],\u201d and the lowering of the \u00a7 2D1.1 levels did not lower his guideline range, the <em>Moore </em>decision applies. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A) (stating that a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not authorized where \u201cthe amendment ... is applicable to the defendant but the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-13\">Ferguson also contends that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), rendered the Guidelines advisory in the \u00a7 3582 context. That argument is precluded by our decision in <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190 (11th Cir.2009). Ferguson asks that we hold his case in abeyance pending the resolution of the petition for hearing <em>en banc </em>in <em>United States v. Argro, </em>No. 08-14591. We decline to do so because the filing of a petition for hearing <em>en banc </em>has no effect on the precedential effect of any of our decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
