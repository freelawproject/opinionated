We have jurisdiction pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e), and we grant the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-17\">We may overturn the Board\u2019s findings of fact only when they are not supported by substantial evidence in the record, or if the Board has not correctly applied the law. <em>Cal. Pac. Med. Ctr. v. N.L.R.B., </em>87 F.3d 304, 307 (9th Cir.1996). We defer to the Board\u2019s interpretation of the National Labor Relations Act (the \u201cAct\u201d) where that interpretation is \u201creasonably defensible.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b606-18\">The Board is entitled to summary enforcement of its finding that JLL violated Section 8(a)(1) of the Act. JLL failed to answer the Board\u2019s complaint so the Board properly deemed the complaint allegations to be true. <em>See N.L.R.B. v. Continental Hagen Corp., </em>932 F.2d 828, 831 (9th Cir.1991). Once admitted, those allegations demonstrated violations of Section 8(a)(1). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number><em>See N.L.R.B. v. Davis, </em>642 F.2d 350, 353 (9th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Similarly, the Board is entitled to summary enforcement of its findings that Smoke House violated Section 8(a)(1) of the Act by telling job applicants that the restaurant would operate as a nonunion enterprise. <em>See Advanced Stretchforming Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>323 NLRB 529, 530-31 (1997), <em>enf'd in rel. part, N.L.R.B. v. Advanced Stretchforming Int\u2019l Inc., </em>233 F.3d 1176, 1181 (9th Cir.2000). Smoke House failed to challenge these Board findings, so it has waived its right to contest them. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A); <em>Sparks Nugget, Inc. v. N.L.R.B., </em>968 F.2d 991, 998 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Next, substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that Smoke House became a successor to JLL and its conclusion that Smoke House was jointly and severally liable for remedying JLL\u2019s unlawful conduct because Smoke House was previously aware of conduct that the Board ultimately found unlawful. Smoke House did not claim lack of knowledge before the Board so we do not have jurisdiction to review that argument. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e); <em>Woelke &amp; Romero Framing v. N.L.R.B., </em>456 U.S. 645, 665-66, 102 S.Ct. 2071, 72 L.Ed.2d 398 (1982). Moreover, Smoke House was not entitled to rely on the decertification petition because its unlawful conduct caused the employees to seek disassociation with the union. <em>See N.L.R.B. v. B.C. Hawk Chevrolet, Inc., </em>582 F.2d 491, 495 (9th Cir.1978). Smoke House therefore violated Section 8(a)(5) by refusing to recognize the union. We also find reasonable the Board\u2019s conclusion that <em>Steinbach v. Hubbard, </em>51 F.3d 843 (9th Cir.1995) does not warrant limiting Smoke House\u2019s successor liability based on equitable grounds. <em>Steinbach </em>arose under a different statute, the Fair Labor Standards Act, and, as set forth in the Board\u2019s order, had materially distinguishable facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">We lack jurisdiction to review Smoke House\u2019s challenges to certain remedies ordered by the Board. <em>See N.L.R.B. v. Sambo\u2019s Restaurant, Inc., </em>641 F.2d 794, 795-96 (9th Cir.1981) (applying jurisdictional bar to issue of remedies). As the government points out, however, we note that following the Board\u2019s decision in this case, it has established a compliance proceeding action to determine the ultimate amount of Smoke House\u2019s financial liability under the \u201cmake-whole\u201d order, and to align \u201cmake-whole\u201d orders with Ninth Circuit law. <em>See Planned Building Services, Inc., </em>347 NLRB No. 64, 2006 WL 2206975 at *8-9 &amp; n. 23 (2006) (citing <em>Advanced Stretchforming, </em>233 F.3d at 1181-83; <em>Kall-mann v. N.L.R.B., </em>640 F.2d 1094, 1102-03 (9th Cir.1981)). In that proceeding, Smoke House may present its arguments regarding whether the expired collective bargaining agreement\u2019s provisions regarding medical benefits had already been changed by JLL, whether Smoke House would have agreed to the terms of the previous collective bargaining agreement, and when it would have reached an agreement on new terms with the union or reached a bargaining impasse.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that Smoke House violated the Act by refusing to hire certain JLL employees because they had engaged in picketing. The Board\u2019s interpretation of Section 8(b)(4)(B) of the Act, concluding that the purchase negotiations here did not constitute \u201cdoing business,\u201d is reasonable. <em>See Cal. Pac. Med. Ctr., </em>87 F.3d at 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">Application for enforcement GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b606-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
