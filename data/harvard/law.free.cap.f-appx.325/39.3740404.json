We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the scope of the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of Mascoe\u2019s motion to reopen his removal proceedings for abuse of discretion. <em>Jie Chen v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 76, 77 (2d Cir.2006). An abuse of discretion may be found where the BIA acts in an arbitrary or capricious manner, i.e., where its decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, lacks any reasoning, or contains only summary or conelusory statements. <em>Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233-34 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-11\">Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (the \u201cINA\u201d), an alien who receives proper written notice of his removal hearing but fails to appear, and is found to be removable at that hearing, shall be ordered removed in absentia. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(A). Once the in absentia removal order is entered, the alien may move to reopen the proceedings and rescind the order on grounds that he \u201cdid not receive notice\u201d of the hearing as required by statute. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii). In reviewing such a motion, the BIA applies a rebuttable presumption of receipt where the Notice To Appear (\u201cNTA\u201d) is properly addressed and mailed in accordance with regular office procedures. <em>Silva-Carvalho Lopes v. Gonzales (Lopes I), </em>468 F.3d 81, 85 (2d Cir.2006); <em>see also Silva-Carvalho Lopes v. Mukasey (Lopes II), </em>517 F.3d 156, 160 (2d Cir.2008). With respect to the evidence the BIA should consider upon ruling on such a motion, we have held that \u201can affidavit of non-receipt [by the alien] might be insufficient by itself to rebut the presumption [of receipt], [but that] it does raise a factual issue that the BIA must resolve by taking account of <em>all </em>relevant evidence^] .... including circumstantial evidence, offered to rebut that presumption.\u201d <em>Lopes I, </em>468 F.3d at 85-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-12\">We conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Mascoe\u2019s appeal from the IJ\u2019s decision denying Mascoe\u2019s motion to reopen his removal proceedings. The IJ found that the presumption of receipt attached to the NTA based on the following evidence: the NTA was mailed to Mascoe\u2019s attention at Sing Sing; a hearing notice letter was served upon Mascoe personally by a Sing Sing correctional officer on the morning of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>hearing; and in accordance with the facility\u2019s standard procedures, that correctional officer signed and filed a memorandum that morning stating that Mascoe had received notice of his hearing but had refused to sign an acknowledgment of the notice. The IJ weighed Mascoe\u2019s affidavit stating that he had not received the NTA against the officer\u2019s sworn declaration stating that he had followed Sing Sing\u2019s standard procedures in notifying Mascoe of his hearing the morning of June 24, 2002, and that Mascoe had refused to sign the memorandum indicating his receipt of the notice. After doing so, the IJ concluded that Mascoe had not rebutted the presumption of receipt of the NTA and that his in absentia order of removal should not be rescinded. Consequently, the BIA was well within its discretion in dismissing Mascoe\u2019s appeal from this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">In addition, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding that the NTA provided Mascoe with adequate notice of the charges against him and that the IJ permissibly added a somewhat different charge to the NTA. By amending the original NTA to include a charge of removability under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) on grounds of \u201cattempt ... to commit\u201d murder, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(U)\u2014the actual crime of which Mascoe had been convicted\u2014the IJ did not violate the notice regulations of the INA. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.30. The original NTA, which specified charges of murder and a crime of violence as provided in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A) &amp; (F), provided Mascoe with adequate notice that, as a result of his involvement in a homicide, he had been convicted of a removable offense. The new notice conveyed exactly that information, only more precisely.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Finally, we agree with the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Mascoe waived his right to testify at the November 16, 2007 hearing before the IJ. During the hearing, Mas-coe\u2019s counsel stated that his \u201cclient\u2019s principal] testimony is similar to what he would put in the affidavit ... [w]hich is that he never received the notice,\u201d and \u201cI guess I\u2019m prepared to close the record.\u201d Mascoe was bound by his counsel\u2019s tactical decision not to submit additional evidence. <em>See Matter of Gawaran, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 938, 942 (B.I.A.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">We have reviewed Mascoe\u2019s remaining contentions and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">The judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
