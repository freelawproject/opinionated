Amoroso Construction Company, Inc. (\u201cAmoroso\u201d) appeals from the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to Executive Risk Indemnity Inc. (\u201cExecutive Risk\u201d) in its suit seeking coverage under a Directors &amp; Officers insurance policy (\u201cD&amp;O Policy\u201d). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Reviewing de novo, <em>United Nat. Ins. Co. v. Spectrum Worldwide, Inc., </em>555 F.3d 772, 776 (9th Cir.2009), we reverse in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-17\">The district court erred by ruling that Amoroso was not entitled to coverage under the D&amp;O Policy for claims stemming from Paul Mason\u2019s alleged misrepresentations because he acted in his individual capacity, and not on behalf of the insured organization. California law provides that employees may be said to act within the scope of their employment, even when their actions are not authorized by their employer, so long as their actions are not so \u201cunusual or startling that it would seem unfair to include the loss resulting from it among other costs of the employer\u2019s business.\u201d <em>Farmers Ins. Group v. County of Santa Clara, </em>11 Cal.4th 992, 1003, 47 Cal. Rptr.2d 478, 906 P.2d 440 (1995) (internal citation omitted). Based on the record before us, we cannot conclude that Mason\u2019s acts were so \u201cunusual or startling\u201d that they should be classified as actions taken in his individual capacity. Under Insuring Clause 1(C) of the D&amp;O Policy, Mason\u2019s alleged misrepresentations qualify as a wrongful act committed by the insured organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-18\">Though Mason\u2019s alleged misrepresentations fall within the scope of Insuring Clause 1(C), we must consider whether the D&amp;O Policy\u2019s exclusion of coverage for claims arising from a contract or agreement applies. Under California law, \u201c[wjhereas coverage clauses are interpreted broadly to afford the greatest possible protection to the insured, exclusionary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>clauses are construed narrowly against the insurer.\u201d <em>Continental Cas. Co. v. City of Richmond, </em>763 F.2d 1076, 1079 (9th Cir.1985). \u201cExceptions to the performance of the basic underlying contract obligation must be clearly stated to apprise the insured of the effect of those exceptions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Considering this standard, the construction contract between Mauna Kea Properties, Inc. (\u201cMauna Kea Properties\u201d) and DAP cannot form the basis for a complete exclusion of coverage under Exclusion 111(C)(2), which excludes claims \u201carising from\u201d liability \u201cunder any written or oral contract or agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">In the litigation brought by Mauna Kea Properties (\u201cMauna Kea litigation\u201d), Mau-na Kea Properties alleged that Amoroso made negligent or intentional misrepresentations that induced Mauna Kea Properties to contract <em>with DAR. </em>This theory of liability in the Mauna Kea litigation depends on the fact that Amoroso was not a party to the construction contract and, therefore, did not have liability under the contract (when Mauna Kea allegedly thought that Amoroso would). To that extent, Amoroso\u2019s liability is not liability under a contract or agreement, and Executive Risk may not rely on Exclusion 111(C)(2) to deny coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">There remains a triable issue of fact, however, about whether the correspondence between Mason and Mauna Kea Properties concerning the potential assignment of the construction contract created a separate contract or agreement under which any potential liability on the part of Amoroso would be excluded from coverage. On remand, the district court should consider whether, under California law, the letter correspondence amounted to a contract or agreement by Amoroso to, in effect, guarantee DAP\u2019s performance of the construction contract. If it did, Executive Risk permissibly denied coverage pursuant to Exclusion 111(C)(2) to the extent that Amoroso\u2019s liability arose under the letter correspondence.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Where there is a genuine issue of liability, the insurer, as a matter of law, could not have acted in bad faith in denying coverage. <em>See Lunsford v. Am. Guar. &amp; Liab. Ins. Co., </em>18 F.3d 653, 656 (9th Cir.1994). The district court, therefore, did not err in granting summary judgment to Executive Risk on Amoroso\u2019s claim of bad faith due to Executive Risk\u2019s denial of coverage. We leave it to the district court to determine in the first instance whether Amoroso has stated a claim of bad faith based on a breach of the duty to defend, and, if so, whether Amoroso should prevail on such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">Amoroso\u2019s arguments that the district court committed procedural error are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">REVERSED IN PART, AFFIRMED IN PART, AND REMANDED. Costs on appeal are awarded to Amoroso.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b577-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
