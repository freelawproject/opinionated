The district court\u2019s plea colloquy confirms that Aceves-Lopez knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to appeal. Accordingly, we enforce the appeal waiver. <em>See United States v. Bibler, </em>495 F.3d 621, 624 (9th Cir.2007). In addition, we reject Aceves-Lopez\u2019s contention that the appellate waiver was not valid because he received an illegal, or unlawful, sentence where the \u201csentence was authorized by the judgment of conviction, and did not impose on [the defendant] a sentence in excess of the statutory penalty.\u201d <em>United States v. Vences, </em>169 F.3d 611, 613 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b553-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
