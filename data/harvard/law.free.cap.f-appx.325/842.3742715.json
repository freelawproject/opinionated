When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b871-18\">Here, because the BIA relied upon the reasons identified in the IJ\u2019s order, we review both decisions. Because the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s order, however, we review only the reasons for denial given in the BIA\u2019s order. As such, we will not consider the Petitioners\u2019 contention that the IJ erred by finding that he did not suffer past persecution and did not have a well-founded fear of future persecution. Rather, we will only review the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility finding and its denial of relief under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-19\">Second, the Petitioners argue that it is more likely than not that they will be tortured upon return to Haiti and that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding was not supported by substantial evidence because any inconsistencies between Mr. Smith\u2019s testimony, the asylum application, and Mrs. Smith\u2019s asylum application were minor, as the husband offered specific, plausible, and detailed testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-20\">We review the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s factual determinations under the substantial evidence test, and we will affirm if those decisions are \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Mejia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>498 F.3d 1253, 1256 (11th Cir.2007) (citation omitted). Under the substantial evidence test, we can reverse a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>finding of fact by the BIA \u201conly when the record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Adefe-mi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc). Like any finding of fact, a credibility determination may not be overturned unless the record compels it. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">If credible, an alien\u2019s testimony alone may be sufficient to sustain his burden of proof in establishing his eligibility for relief from removal. <em>Id. </em>\u201cConversely, an adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1231 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (\u201cAn IJ\u2019s denial of asylum relief ... can be supported solely by an adverse credibility determination, especially if the alien fails to produce corroborating evidence.\u201d). \u201cIf the IJ explicitly determines that the alien lacks credibility, the IJ must offer specific, cogent reasons for the finding.\u201d <em>Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1231. \u201cThe burden then shifts to the alien to show that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision was not supported by \u2018specific, cogent reasons\u2019 or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii), as amended by the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 302, \u00a7 101(a) (2005), the IJ may find an alien incredible based on the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d and may deny a claim based on inconsistencies, inaccuracies, and falsehoods contained in the evidence, without regard to whether they go to the \u201cheart\u201d of the claim. \u201cIndications of rehable testimony include consistency on direct examination, consistency with the written application, and the absence of embellishments.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-9\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. The record does not compel overturning the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s credibility determinations because they were supported by the totality of the circumstances, including (1) Mr. Smith\u2019s failure to file for asylum until he was detained for having a fraudulent stamp in his passport notwithstanding the fact that he knew of the asylum process before that time; (2) inconsistencies between Mr. Smith\u2019s asylum application and his testimony;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (3) the Petitioners failure to provide any documentation corroborating their claims. For example, the Petitioners failed to include documentation regarding Mr. Smith\u2019s work in Haiti or Mr. Smith\u2019s need for medical attention following the incident in July 2001 when L\u00e1-valas party supporters allegedly attacked him, which forms the basis of their application. <em>See Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cThe weaker an applicant\u2019s testimony ... the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\u201d). Because the Petitioners have faded to meet their burden of showing that the adverse credibility determination was not supported by substantial evidence, that determination is sufficient to sustain the denial of asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-10\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b872-6\">. For example, Mr. Smith's asylum application and his testimony contained different dates with regard to when he worked at the Presbyterian and Baptist Missions and when he lived at his Thomassin 25 address.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
