Lopez maintained that he was asserting \u201ca Federal Alien Tort action authorized by 42 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 1983 to redress the deprivation, under color of International Treaty, of rights se<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>cured by Article 36 of the VCCR and Laws of the United States,\u201d and that the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1343, and 1350. Lopez alleged that on the day of his arrest, January 17, 2001, his arresting officers refused his request to contact the Colombian consulate, in violation of his right to such notification under the VCCR. Lopez further alleged that his attorneys and the district attorneys were aware of this violation but failed to do anything about it. Lopez sought a declaration that his VCCR rights had been violated, an injunction ordering the defendants to inform non-citizens of their right to consular notification, and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">The district court <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed Lopez\u2019s complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for failure to state a \u00a7 1983 claim, concluding that the VCCR did not provide Lopez with judicially enforceable rights. Lopez filed a motion for reconsideration, which the district court denied on the grounds that (1) even if Lopez did possess an individual right to consular notification under the VCCR, he could not show actual harm arising from the violation of that right; and (2) Lopez\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action was frivolous because it was filed after the two-year statute of limitations had run. Lopez appealed the court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 complaint and denial of his motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">We affirmed in part and vacated and remanded in part. We held that irrespec-five of whether the VCCR grants individual rights that are enforceable under \u00a7 1983, the district court was correct in holding that Lopez\u2019s claim would be time-barred. We went on to note, however, that neither the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>order dismissing Lopez\u2019s complaint nor its order denying his motion to reconsider had addressed whether the complaint stated a claim under \u00a7 1350 or whether \u00a7 1350\u2019s ten-year statute of limitations, which had not run, should have been applied. Accordingly, we remanded the case for consideration of whether Lopez\u2019s complaint stated a \u00a7 1350 claim, and, assuming that it did, whether that claim could survive \u00a7 1915A review.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-11\">On remand, the district court dismissed Lopez\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim under either \u00a7 1983 or \u00a7 1350, citing our recently published decision in <em>Gandara v. Bennett, </em>528 F.3d 823 (11th Cir.2008), in which we held that the VCCR does not contain rights or remedies individually enforceable through \u00a7 1983. On appeal, Lopez argues essentially that because the VCCR is self-executing and creates judicially enforceable rights, he may enforce those rights pursuant to the \u201cremedial structure\u201d of \u00a7 1350.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-12\">In <em>Gandara, </em>we held that Article 36 of the VCCR does not confer judicially enforceable individual rights and that violations of the VCCR are properly addressed by and between the states themselves. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>528 F.3d at 829. Our holding applies irrespective of whether an individual petitioner attempts to enforce Article 36 pursuant to \u00a7 1983 or \u00a7 1350. <em>See Gandara, </em>528 F.3d at 826 n. 1 (Rodgers, J., specially concurring) (noting that the petitioner had filed his claim under the VCCR pursuant to both \u00a7 1983 and \u00a7 1350). Lopez may not use \u00a7 1350 to create an individual cause of action under the VCCR where we have found there to be none. <em>See Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, </em>542 U.S. 692, 124 S.Ct. 2739, 159 L.Ed.2d 718 (2004) (dismissing alien\u2019s \u00a7 1350 action alleging he had been abducted in Mexico by U.S. agents in violation of the extradition treaty between the U.S. and Mexico and customary international law on the grounds that \u00a7 1350 is jurisdictional and authorizes suits based only on a limited number of offenses recognized at the time of its enactment or universally recognized today). Therefore, the district court did not err in dismissing Lopez\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1350.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b810-12\">.
