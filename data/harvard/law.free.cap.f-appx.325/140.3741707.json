We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-14\">Smith conspired with others to commit at least fifty-five home-invasion robberies as well as the armed robbery of a jewelry store. In committing the home invasions, Smith and his co-defendants cut telephone and home alarm wires, forcibly pushed in the front doors, and stole items that they later illegally sold. With respect to the jewelry store robbery, Smith gave a semiautomatic pistol to his co-defendant Williams and threatened to hurt Williams\u2019 mother, daughter, and girlfriend if he did not rob the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-17\">Smith pled guilty to conspiracy to commit robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a) and conspiracy to commit burglary in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. In the plea agreement, the parties stipulated that Smith\u2019s total offense level was twenty-nine and his criminal category was VI,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that a sentence \u201cwithin the Guidelines range that results from the agreed total Guidelines offense level of 29 (twenty-nine) is reasonable,\u201d and that the parties would not seek an upward or downward departure or adjustment. App. at 32. In addition, the plea agreement included an appellate waiver, providing that Smith \u201cvoluntarily waives, the right to file any appeal ... which challenges the sentence imposed ... if that sentence falls within or below the Guidelines range that results from the agreed total Guidelines offense level of 29.\u201d App. 32. Smith reserved his right to appeal the court\u2019s determination of his criminal history category, but \u201cif the sentencing court accepts a stipulation [herein], both parties waive the right to file an appeal ... claiming that the sentencing court erred in doing so.\u201d App. at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-18\">At the plea colloquy, the District Court questioned Smith about his stipulations in order to ensure that he understood their effect on his sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-19\">THE COURT: [The plea agreement] contains some agreements between you and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office about ... facts which go into calculating ... the guideline sentencing range ... [. F]or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>example, you have agreed ... that your total offense level in this case is a level 29.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-4\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">THE COURT: You\u2019ve also agreed ... that your criminal history category is a level six.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">App. at 50. In addition, the District Court addressed Smith\u2019s appellate waiver:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">THE COURT: [The plea agreement provides that, i]f I give you a sentence which is within the sentencing range for an offense level 29 or lower, you will not appeal the sentence or the conviction or make any other type of post-conviction attack or challenge on the sentence or conviction. Have you in fact agreed to do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-8\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-9\">THE COURT: Have you discussed it with [your attorney]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-10\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-11\">THE COURT: Have you been satisfied with his explanation of why he has recommended that you agree to it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-12\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-13\">App. at 52. The Court then correctly calculated the Guidelines range resulting from a offense level of twenty-nine and a criminal history category of VI to be 151 to 188 months incarceration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The District Court also addressed 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, concluding that a substantial sentence was warranted here due to the scale of the conspiracy, its numerous victims, the need for specific and general deterrence, and the danger that Smith posed to society as a result of his \u201clifetime of continued criminal activity.\u201d App. at 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-14\">Despite Smith\u2019s agreement to waive his right to appeal his sentence, he now argues that his sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-17\">\u201c\u2018Waivers of appeals, if entered knowingly and voluntarily, are valid, unless they work a miscarriage of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Gwinnett, </em>483 F.3d 200, 205 (3d Cir.2007) (quoting <em>United States v. Khat-tak, </em>273 F.3d 557, 563 (3d Cir.2001)). Smith does not argue that his plea was not knowing and voluntary. Moreover, the record shows that Smith discussed the plea agreement and its ramifications with both his attorney and the District Court, and nothing in the record otherwise impugns the validity of the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-18\">In addition, there is no question that Smith\u2019s appeal falls within the scope of the waiver provision, <em>see United States v. Jackson, </em>523 F.3d 234, 244 (3d Cir.2008), because Smith waived the right to \u201cfile any appeal ... which challenges the sentence imposed by the sentencing court if that sentence falls within or below the Guidelines range that results from the agreed total Guidelines offense level of 29.\u201d App. at 32. Even though Smith reserved the right to appeal the District Court\u2019s determination of his criminal history category, the waiver also provided that he could not appeal any issue upon which the Court accepted a stipulation between the parties. Because the Court accepted the parties\u2019 stipulation that Smith had a criminal history category of VI, he is precluded from challenging that determination on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-19\">Finally, Smith\u2019s case does not present \u201can unusual circumstance where an error amounting to a miscarriage of justice may invalidate the waiver.\u201d <em>Khattak, </em>273 F.3d at 562 (citing <em>United States v. Teeter, </em>257 F.3d 14, 25 (1st Cir.2001)). Smith challenges only the reasonableness of his sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>tence. \u201c[I]n light of <em>Gall\u2019s [Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)] deferential abuse-of-discretion standard for reviewing sentencing appeals, it will be a rare and unusual situation when claims of an unreasonable sentence, standing alone, will be sufficient to invalidate a waiver because of a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>523 F.3d at 244. This case clearly does not present any such \u201cunusual situation.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Because Smith\u2019s appeal is barred by the appellate waiver provision of his plea agreement, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment of conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b169-15\">. Smith\u2019s prior criminal record included five felony convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b170-15\">. Smith's sentence was calculated pursuant to the May 1, 2007, edition of the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b171-18\">. The District Court rejected Smith\u2019s request for a waiver because of the conditions in the Passaic County Jail. Even if that objection were to survive the waiver, we would not disagree with the District Court's disposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
