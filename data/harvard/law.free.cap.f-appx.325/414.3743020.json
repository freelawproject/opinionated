We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-13\">Anderson and Kama pled guilty to conspiring to possess with intent to distribute 1,300 pills of MDMA, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846. The district court calculated their base-offense levels based on the total weight of the pills, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2D1.1, Note B. That calculation ultimately yielded a Guidelines range of 57-71 months for Anderson and 63-78 months for Kama. The district court thereafter sentenced Anderson to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment, and Kama to 48 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-15\">Shaba pled guilty to involvement in a separate conspiracy, which arose from his sale of 3,100 MDMA pills. The total weight of the pills was unknown, so the district court calculated Shaba\u2019s base-offense level based on the \u201ctypical weight\u201d for each pill under \u00a7 2D1.1, Note 11. The district court then sentenced him to 51 months\u2019 imprisonment, which was within his Guidelines range of 51-63 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-16\">These consolidated appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-18\">We review a district court\u2019s factual findings in sentencing a defendant for clear error, <em>United States v. Hazelwood, </em>398 F.3d 792, 795 (6th Cir.2005), and its application and interpretation of the Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Cousins, </em>469 F.3d 572, 575 (6th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-19\">Defendants contend that, in calculating their base-offense level, the district court should have considered only the weight of the \u201cpure\u201d MDMA itself, rather than the weight of the entire pill. This argument is plainly foreclosed by precedent. \u201cThis court has repeatedly rejected the argument that only the \u2018pure\u2019 weight of a controlled substance should be used as the basis for calculating a defendant\u2019s base offense level instead of the weight of the entire pill.\u201d <em>United States v. Jeross, </em>521 F.3d 562, 577 (6th Cir.2008). To the contrary, \u201ca defendant\u2019s base-offense level is to be determined by the <em>entire </em>weight of the pill containing the controlled substance, and not by the weight of the actual controlled substance alone (i.e., the weight of the pure MDA, MDMA, or meth con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>tained in the pill).\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">The district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
