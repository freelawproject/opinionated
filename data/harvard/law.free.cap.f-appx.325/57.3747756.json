Because Brown\u2019s appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-11\">Brown, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>initiated a civil rights action against the City of Pittsburgh. Brown apparently suffered multiple serious injuries as a result of an accident that took place in 1977. Although his allegations are unclear, Brown appears to argue that the City, Brown\u2019s former employer, violated Brown\u2019s civil rights by interfering with Brown\u2019s ability to recover the full amount of workers\u2019 compensation benefits to which he believes he is entitled as a result of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-14\">The District Court referred the matter to a Magistrate Judge, who granted Brown permission to proceed <em>in forma pauperis. </em>The Magistrate Judge also filed a Report and Recommendation recommending that Brown\u2019s complaint be dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). The Magistrate Judge stated that she was unable to identify any basis for federal jurisdiction. She concluded that, to the extent Brown was attempting to contest the state court judgment concerning his workers\u2019 compensation benefits, the District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the complaint under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-15\">Brown objected to the Report and Recommendation. On September 15, 2008, after conducting a <em>de novo </em>review, the District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation and dismissed the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). Brown filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-16\">We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s dismissal under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). <em>See Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000). Upon review, we conclude that the District Court properly dismissed Brown\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-17\">Brown alleges that the City of Pittsburgh has been \u201clobbying\u201d and \u201ccollaborating\u201d with various individuals since 1977, and asserts that he therefore is receiving less than what he believes to be the appropriate amount of workers\u2019 compensation benefits. To the extent that Brown is attempting to argue that the state courts wrongly decided his workers\u2019 compensation claim, we agree with the Magistrate Judge\u2019s conclusion that Brown\u2019s claims are barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine divests federal courts of jurisdiction where a federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>action \u201cwould be the equivalent of an appellate review\u201d of a state court judgment. <em>FOCUS v. Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas, </em>75 F.3d 834, 840 (3d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">However, the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine applies only where \u201cthe losing party in state court filed suit in federal court after the state proceedings ended, complaining of an injury caused by the state-court judgment and seeking review and rejection of that judgment.\u201d <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 291, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005). It is not clear to us whether Brown\u2019s claims are limited to the issues addressed by the state court in his workers\u2019 compensation action. For example, Brown also alleges that the City has \u201cblocked\u201d him from receiving medical care and \u201crescind[ed]\u201d his \u201ctrue medical records.\u201d To the extent he attempts to raise independent federal claims against the City for injuries separate from those related to the workers\u2019 compensation decision, we conclude that <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>does not apply. However, as to those allegations, Brown has failed to state a claim entitling him to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">To proceed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, \u201ca plaintiff must allege the violation of a right secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States, and must show that the alleged deprivation was committed by a person acting under color of state law.\u201d <em>West v. Atkins, </em>487 U.S. 42, 48, 108 S.Ct. 2250, 101 L.Ed.2d 40 (1988). Even construing Brown\u2019s <em>pro se </em>complaint liberally, <em>Alston v. Parker, </em>363 F.3d 229, 234 (3d Cir.2004), Brown\u2019s allegations are inadequate to state a \u00a7 1983 claim against the City. Although Brown cites to the First and Fourteenth Amendments, Brown fails to set forth any facts supporting a constitutional deprivation. His vague allegations do not provide \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1974, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-12\">Brown failed to state a claim on which relief may be granted, and the District Court properly dismissed his complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Brown\u2019s appeal does not present a substantial question. We will therefore summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b86-12\">. The doctrine takes its name from two United States Supreme Court cases: <em>Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923) and <em>D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b87-7\">. In addition, it appears that Brown\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims, which are largely based upon events taking place in the 1970s and 1980s, are barred by the applicable two-year statute of limitations. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5524; <em>Wilson v. Garcia, </em>471 U.S. 261, 266-267, 105 S.Ct. 1938, 85 L.Ed.2d 254 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
