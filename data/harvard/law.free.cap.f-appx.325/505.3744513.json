Govind, a California state prisoner, appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s judgment following a jury trial in his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action alleging that prison guards violated his civil rights. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim and its grant of summary judgment. <em>Arpin v. Santa Clara Valley Transp. Agency, </em>261 F.3d 912, 919, 923 (9th Cir.2001). We review for an abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to amend the complaint, <em>Ward v. Circus Circus Casinos, Inc., </em>473 F.3d 994, 1000 (9th Cir.2007), and the denial of a preliminary injunction, <em>Harris v. Board of Supervisors, L.A. County, </em>366 F.3d 754, 760 (9th Cir.2004). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-16\">We affirm for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s partial summary judgment order, entered July 21, 2006 in favor of defendant Sims, and partial dismissal order, entered August 2, 2006 in favor of defendant Adams.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-17\">Further, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Govind\u2019s motion to file a Second Amended Complaint because Govind had already been given the opportunity to cure the defects in his pleadings and had failed to do so. <em>See DCD Programs Ltd. v. Leighton, </em>833 F.2d 183, 186 n. 3 (9th Cir.1987) (\u201ca district court\u2019s discretion over amendments is especially broad where the court has already given a plaintiff one or more opportunities to amend his complaint\u201d) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-18\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Govind\u2019s motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>a preliminary injunction because the district court did not have personal jurisdiction over the parties who allegedly subjected Govind to the threat of irreparable harm. <em>See Price v. City of Stockton, </em>390 F.3d 1105, 1117 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cA federal court may issue an injunction if it has personal jurisdiction over the parties and subject matter jurisdiction over the claim; it may not attempt to determine the rights of persons not before the court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Because Govind did not include a trial transcript in the record on appeal as required by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 10(b)(2), or explain his failure to do so, we do not consider his claims of error during the trial. <em>See </em>9th Cir. R. 10-3.1 (d) <em>&amp; </em>(e); <em>Portland Feminist Women\u2019s Health Ctr. v. Advocates for Life, Inc., </em>877 F.2d 787, 789 (9th Cir.1989) (\u201cWhen an appellant fails to supply a transcript of a district court proceeding, we may ... refuse to consider the appellant\u2019s argument.\u201d); <em>see also Syncom Capital Corp. v. Wade, </em>924 F.2d 167, 169 (9th Cir.1991) (dismissing appeal of pro se appellant who did not provide trial transcript).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Govind\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Govind\u2019s motion requesting that his \u201ccomplaints\u201d be granted is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b534-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
