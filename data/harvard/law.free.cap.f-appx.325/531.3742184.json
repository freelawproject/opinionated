We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reinstate an asylum application, <em>see Mendez-Gutierrez v. Ashcroft, </em>340 F.3d 865, 869 (9th Cir.2003), and we review de novo claims of due process violations in immigration proceedings, <em>see Sanchez-Cruz v. INS, </em>255 F.3d 775, 779 (9th Cir.2001). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-17\">The agency did not abuse its discretion in denying Lugina\u2019s motion to reinstate her previously withdrawn asylum application because she failed to establish prima facie eligibility for the underlying relief sought. <em>See Mendez-Gutierrez, </em>340 F.3d at 869-70. Further, Lugina\u2019s due process rights were not violated by the IJ\u2019s failure to provide an interpreter at her master calendar hearing because it is clear from the record that she knowingly and intelligently withdrew her asylum application, and she admitted that she \u201cchanged [her] mind\u201d afterward. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (petitioner must show error and prejudice to prevail on a due process challenge); <em>see also Khan v. Ashcroft, </em>374 F.3d 825, 829-30 (9th Cir.2004) (record established that petitioner\u2019s due process rights were not violated by lack of translation at master calendar hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-18\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b560-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
