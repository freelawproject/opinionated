After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment if the defendant was sentenced based on a sentencing range that subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Wilburn\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is based on Amendment 599, which \u201cwas promulgated in order to prevent \u2018double counting\u2019 for firearms use in any <em>one criminal event.\u201d United States v. Pringle, </em>350 F.3d 1172, 1180 (11th Cir.2003). Pursuant to Amendment 599, a defendant who was convicted of a \u00a7 924(c) firearm offense and an underlying offense, such as carjacking, shall not receive a guidelines enhancement for discharge of the firearm when determining the sentence for the underlying offense. U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 599 (2003) (codified as amended at U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4 cmt. n. 4); <em>see also Pringle, </em>350 F.3d at 1179. Amendment 599 may be applied retroactively upon a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Here, the district court did not err in denying Wilburn\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because Amendment 599 had no effect on Wilburn\u2019s sentencing range. At sentencing, Wilburn received a seven-level enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(A), for discharging a firearm during his Count 1 carjacking offense. He did not receive a similar enhancement for his Count 3 carjacking offense, which was the underlying offense for his Count 4 \u00a7 924(c) firearm offense. Thus, there was no \u201cdouble-counting\u201d prohibited by Amendment 599, and Wilburn\u2019s sentencing range remains unchanged. <em>See Pringle, </em>350 F.3d at 1180 (\u201cAmendment 599 allows for weapons enhancements for all robberies except for the one robbery that served as the basis for Pringle\u2019s \u00a7 924(c) conviction.\u201d). Because Wilburn was not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction, the district court had no need to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors or the policy statements in the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998) (explaining that the district court considers the \u00a7 3553(a) factors only after the district court has determined that the defendant is eligible for a reduction because an amendment has lowered the guidelines range).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-9\">Finally, Wilburn\u2019s argument regarding the applicability of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), is foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009) (concluding that <em>Booker </em>does not \u201cprohibit the limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement by the Sentencing Commission\u201d), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Feb. 10, 2009) (No. 08-8664).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b790-7\">. \"We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v.
