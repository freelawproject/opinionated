Upon de novo review, <em>see Ramlet v. E.F. Johnson Co., </em>507 F.3d 1149, 1152 (8th Cir.2007), we hold that summary judgment was appropriate because Richardson did not offer evidence from which a jury could find that the officers acted with a discriminatory purpose, <em>see Johnson v. Crooks, </em>326 F.3d 995, 999-1000 (8th Cir.2003) (Equal Protection Clause is constitutional basis for objecting to intentionally discriminatory application of laws; district court erred in not dismissing equal protection claim where plaintiffs failed to offer evidence that officer did not stop non-African Americans under similar circumstances, or offer direct evidence of racial animus other than personal opinion); <em>see also Brockinton v. City of Sherwood, Ark., </em>503 F.3d 667, 674 (8th Cir.2007) (for municipal liability to attach, individual liability must first be found on underlying substantive claim); <em>Johnson v. Outboard Marine Corp., </em>172 F.3d 531, 535 (8th Cir.1999) (this court may affirm on any basis supported by record).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. <em>See </em>8th Cir.
