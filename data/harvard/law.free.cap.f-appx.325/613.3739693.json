Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reconsider. <em>Morales Apolinar v. Muka-sey, </em>514 F.3d 893, 895 (9th Cir.2008). We dismiss in part, deny in part, and grant in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">To the extent Ghazaryan challenges the BIA\u2019s earlier order denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture, we lack jurisdiction because this petition is not timely as to that decision. <em>See Ma v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 553, 558 n. 6 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion when it declined to revisit Ghazaryan\u2019s claim that family members of people he arrested mistreated him. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">However, the BIA abused its discretion by not addressing Ghazaryan\u2019s contention that police officers detained and mistreated him for his opposition to police corruption. <em>See Karapetyan v. Mukasey, </em>543 F.3d 1118, 1132-33 (9th Cir.2008). Accordingly, we grant the petition for review and remand to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this disposition. <em>See Minasyan v. Mukasey, </em>553 F.3d 1224, 1229 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part; GRANTED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"AGU\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
