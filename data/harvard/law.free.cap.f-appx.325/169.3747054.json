Mack, Jr., appeals the district court\u2019s order accepting the recommendation of the magistrate judge and dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2006) complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b) (2006). We have reviewed the record and find that this appeal is frivolous. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Mack v. Osteen, </em>No. 1:08-cv-00776-NCT-RAE (M.D.N.C. Jan. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>30, 2009). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
