On appeal, Cunningham argues that the district court erred because: (1) it had the authority necessary to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2); and (2) it failed to analyze the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as required by our precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-15\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the sentencing guidelines, for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1338 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (quoting <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003)). \u201cHowever, where the issue presented involves a legal interpretation, our review is <em>de novo.\u201d Id. </em>at 1338-39 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-16\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). However, we have held that when a defendant is subject to a statutory mandatory minimum that replaces his guideline range, that defendant is ineligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 706. <em>Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1342 (\u201cBecause Williams was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum that replaced his original sentencing guideline range, he was not sentenced according to the base offense level in \u00a7 2D1.1, even taking into account the \u00a7 5K1.1 downward departure. He thus would not fall within the scope of Amendment 706.\u201d). In Williams, we pointed out that this ineligibility is not rectified by a downward departure below the statutory minimum when that departure is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>made pursuant to a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for substantial assistance. <em>Id. </em>at 1341.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error. Because Cunningham was subject to a mandatory minimum term of life imprisonment pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), Amendment 706 did not change his guideline range, even though he ultimately received a \u00a7 5K1.1 downward departure. <em>See id. </em>at 1340-42. Therefore, Cunningham was ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction, and we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
