For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-26\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-27\">A jury convicted Moxam of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of crack cocaine and possession with intent to distribute 5 grams or more of crack cocaine, in violation of \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(l)(A)(iii) and (B)(iii). Moxam\u2019s guideline imprisonment range was 292 to 365 months, and he was sentenced to 328 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>On April 29, 2008, the district court <em>sua sponte </em>reduced Moxam\u2019s guideline imprisonment range to 235 to 293 months and his sentence to 264 months\u2019 imprisonment, pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 706. On May 22, 2008, Moxam filed a <em>pro se </em>motion to reduce sentence, pursuant to Amendment 706. Moxam asserted that the district court should exercise its discretion under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), and reduce his sentence to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment \u201cat most.\u201d On May 30, 2008, the district court denied the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion as moot. On June 16, 2008, Moxam filed a motion for reconsideration, which the district court denied on June 20, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">We <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed the notice of appeal (\u201cNOA\u201d) to the extent it concerned the denial of the motion for reconsideration, on the ground that the motion for reconsideration was not timely filed and, therefore, not separately appealable. We also noted that the NOA was untimely to the extent it concerned the May 30, 2008 denial of Moxam\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, but remanded to the district court for a determination of whether the delayed filing was a result of good cause of excusable neglect. The district court found that Moxam had shown good cause and granted an extension of time for his untimely NOA. Accordingly, our review is limited to the district court\u2019s denial of Moxam\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>\u201cthe district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the [Guidelines].\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), ce<em>rt. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009). Pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce an already-incarcerated defendant\u2019s sentence (1) if the sentence was determined using a guideline imprisonment range that subsequent retroactive amendments to the Guidelines have reduced, (2) if the district court has considered the applicable factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and (3) the reduction would be consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission, which are contained in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). The district court may consider a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction \u201cupon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-11\">In determining whether, and to what extent, a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is warranted, the district court must engage in a two-part analysis. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). First, the district court must substitute the amended base offense level for the originally applied base offense level and determine what sentence it would have imposed had the amended base offense level been in effect at the time of the original sentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 780-81. Second, the district court must decide whether, in its discretion, it will elect to impose the newly calculated sentence or retain the original sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 781. In making this determination, the district court: (1) shall consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors; (2) shall consider the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the community posed by the reduction; and (3) may consider the post-sentencing conduct of the defendant. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 1(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-13\">In a recent decision, we held that, once the district court has determined the defendant\u2019s amended guideline imprisonment range and that a reduction is warranted, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>may not rely on <em>Booker </em>and impose a sentence below that guideline imprisonment range. <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190 (11th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Feb. 10, 2009) (No. 08-8664). We noted that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A) instructs that \u201cthe court shall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment ... to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guidelines range determined under [\u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l) ]\u201d and we held that <em>Booker </em>did not prohibit this limitation on the district court\u2019s discretion in re-senteneing the defendant under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Id. </em>at 1192, 1192-93, 1193\u201494.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">The district court erred in denying Mox-am\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion as moot. Although Moxam was requesting a sentence reduction under Amendment 706, and the district court already had granted such a reduction, Moxam\u2019s <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion challenged the extent of the district court\u2019s reduction and, liberally construed, requested a sentence below the guideline imprisonment range, by indicating that the sentence should be reduced to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment \u201cat most\u201d and citing <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough. </em>Thus, Moxam\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion presented an argument that the district court had yet to address. The district court\u2019s error, however, was harmless, because Moxam\u2019s arguments in his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion did not merit any relief. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a) (\u201cAny error, defect, irregularity, or variance that does not affect substantial rights must be disregarded.\u201d). Moxam\u2019s argument that the district court should have treated his amended guideline imprisonment range as advisory and further reduced his sentence is without merit, as we have held that <em>Booker </em>is inapplicable at re-sentencing under \u00a7 3582(e)(2). <em>See Melvin, </em>556 F.3d at 1192, 1192-93.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">Moxam also argues on appeal that the district court failed to give him notice of its intent to <em>sua sponte </em>reduce his sentence, and an opportunity to present argument on the matter, and failed to consider his post-sentencing rehabilitative conduct and the continued disparity between cocaine and crack cocaine sentencing. The former argument is without merit, as \u00a7 3582 does not include a notice provision. <em>See generally </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582. Likewise, the latter argument is without merit, as the applicable policy statement leaves consideration of post-sentencing conduct to the discretion of the district court and makes no mention of the need to consider the alleged continued disparity between cocaine and crack cocaine sentencing. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 1(B)). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b816-6\">. On appeal, Moxam urges us to consider our recent holdings in the unpublished opinions of <em>United States v. Williams, </em>308 Fed.Appx. 317 (11th Cir.2009), and <em>United States v. Deg-lace, </em>309 Fed.Appx. 288 (11th Cir.2008). Neither <em>Williams, </em>in which we held, before <em>Melvin </em>was issued, that any error by the district court in treating the amended guideline imprisonment range as mandatory was harmless, nor <em>Deglace, </em>in which we remanded the case to the district court because it failed to adequately explain its application of the above-described two-part analysis, do not alter our conclusion that the district court did not err regarding Moxam. <em>See Williams, </em>308 Fed.Appx. at 318-19; <em>Deglace, </em>309 Fed.Appx. at 289.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
