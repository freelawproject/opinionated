He now appeals his sentence, contending that it is substantively unreasonable because the district court did not appropriately weigh the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, giving too much weight to his criminal history and not enough to the underlying offense and his personal characteristics. He also contends that the court made a \u201cmechanistic application\u201d of the Sentencing Guidelines, rather than taking into account the particular circumstances of his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-16\">The substantive reasonableness of a sentence is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Appellant \u201cbears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record [before the sentencing court] and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). Though sentences within the Guidelines sentence range are not entitled to a presumption of reasonableness, the Guidelines are considered to be \u201ccentral to the sentencing process\u201d and the imposition of a sentence within the Guidelines sentence range would ordinarily be expected to be reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 787, 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-19\">It is clear from the record that the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u2014both favorable and unfavorable from appellant\u2019s point of view\u2014in fashioning appellant\u2019s sentence. It is not this court\u2019s role to substitute its judgment for the district court\u2019s. <em>See United States v. Ame-deo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court ... we will not substitute our own judgement in weighing the relevant factors.\u201d) (citations omitted). Finally, appellant\u2019s contention that the court used a \u201cmechanistic application\u201d of the Guidelines has no support in the record. The court specifically considered the possibility that appellant\u2019s criminal history category of VI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>might overrepresent his actual past behavior and potential for recidivism, but rejected it.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">Appellant\u2019s sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"aup-dedup-1\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
