After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-19\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify an already incarcerated defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment if the defendant\u2019s sentence was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). However, \u201c[wjhere a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). A reduction is not authorized if the amendment does not lower a defendant\u2019s applicable guidelines range <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>\u201cbecause of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision) U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n.l(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">The district court did not err in concluding that Johnson was ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction. Johnson\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced the base offense levels in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) applicable to crack cocaine offenses. At sentencing, Johnson\u2019s offense level was based on the career offender offense level in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(c)(2)(A), not the offense level for his crack cocaine offenses found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)\u2019s drug quantity tables.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although the sentencing court departed downward three levels, Johnson\u2019s sentencing range was not affected by Amendment 706. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-30 (concluding that Amendment 706 has no effect on the sentencing range of a defendant sentenced as a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 even when the defendant received a \u00a7 5K1.1 downward departure and that the defendant thus is not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">Johnson\u2019s argument that he is eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction based on <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), is foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009) (concluding that <em>\u201cBooker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>do not prohibit the limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement by the Sentencing Commission\u201d), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Feb. 10, 2009) (No. 08-8664); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.2008) (concluding that <em>Booker </em>does not provide a basis on which to grant a \u00a7 3583(c)(2) motion), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1657, 173 L.Ed.2d 1025 (2009). To the extent Johnson argues that the district court at his original sentencing should have calculated his offense level using U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, this argument is outside the scope of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (limiting proceedings to eases where retroactive amendment affects the applicable sentencing range); <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000) (explaining that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings do not constitute a <em>de novo </em>resentencing).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b840-12\">. \"We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b841-8\">. Because Johnson qualified as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a), and his multiple counts of conviction included an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) firearms offense, his applicable guidelines range was the greater of that called for by either U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.1 (c)(2)(A) or \u00a7 4B 1.1 (c)(2)(B). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(c)(2). Because the range calculated pursuant to \u00a7 4B 1.1(c)(2)(A) was the greater of the two, that range applied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
