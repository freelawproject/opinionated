Facing a six-count indictment, Littles agreed to plead guilty to one count of possessing a firearm after a felony conviction, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>\u00a7 922(g)(1). In exchange for that plea and a written waiver of appeal, the government dismissed the other charges. Littles already had a string of convictions that qualified him as an armed career criminal, and the district court sentenced him to 180 months, the statutory minimum. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Littles filed a notice of appeal, but his appointed counsel now seeks to withdraw because he cannot discern a nonfrivolous basis for appeal. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Littles opposes counsel\u2019s submission. <em>See </em>Cir. R. 51(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Littles wants to challenge his prison sentence, but he does not seek to undermine his guilty plea. Counsel thus appropriately omits any discussion about the adequacy of the plea colloquy, <em>see </em>Fed. R.CrimP. 11(b), or the voluntariness of the guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Knox, </em>287 F.3d 667, 670-71 (7th Cir.2002). And since the appeal waiver in the plea agreement stands or falls with the guilty plea, <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>481 F.3d 475, 483 (7th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Hare, </em>269 F.3d 859, 860-61 (7th Cir.2001), any appellate issue concerning Little\u2019s sentence would be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Accordingly, we GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to -withdraw and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
