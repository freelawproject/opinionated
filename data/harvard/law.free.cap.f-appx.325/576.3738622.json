[AR 38-40] In his motion, Cabrera argued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>that he is eligible for asylum due to past persecution based on his sexual orientation, which he was previously unable to present because of the overwhelming nature of the childhood sexual abuse he experienced in Mexico and his chronic Post-traumatic Stress Disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) entirely failed to address Cabrera\u2019s claim. The decision cited an inapplicable section of the federal regulations\u20148 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003(e)(3)(ii), which only applies to untimely motions to reopen\u2014and asserted that Cabrera had not demonstrated \u201cthat the conditions in (his] native Mexico have changed so that he now has a well-founded fear of persecution on account of a protected ground\u201d\u2014despite the fact that Cabrera\u2019s motion did not allege, and was not based on, changed country conditions. [AR 2]</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The Ninth Circuit has \u201clong held that the BIA abuses its discretion when it fails to provide a reasoned explanation for its actions.\u201d <em>Movsisian v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 1095, 1098 (9th Cir.2005). Because the BIA failed to provide a reasoned explanation for its actions or to indicate with specificity that it heard and considered Cabrera\u2019s claims, we conclude that it abused its discretion. Therefore we reverse the BIA\u2019s decision and remand for a full consideration of the merits of Cabrera\u2019s motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">GRANTED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b604-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
