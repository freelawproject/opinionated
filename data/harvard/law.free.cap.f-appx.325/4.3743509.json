R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C. Cir. Rule 34\u00ae. It is</p>\n<p id=\"b32-17\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s order filed March 6, 2009, 2009 WL 587932, be affirmed. The district court did not err in dismissing the complaint without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, as appellant\u2019s nonspecific allegation of discrimination in her complaint and brief on appeal, without more, is insufficient to state a federal question. <em>See, e.g., </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 &amp; 1332; <em>Bilal v. Kaplan, </em>904 F.2d 14, 15 (8th Cir.1990) (per curiam) (\u201c[Fjederal court jurisdiction must affirmatively appear clearly and distinctly. The mere suggestion of a federal question is not sufficient to establish the jurisdiction of federal courts.\u201d); <em>see also White v. Benjamin, </em>175 F.3d 1022 (7th Cir.1998) (affirming dismissal of case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, noting unspecified \u201cdiscrimination\u201d is \u201cnot a talisman that opens courthouse doors\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-19\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en bane. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C. Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
