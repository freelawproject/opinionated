We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1015 (9th Cir.2003), and we deny in part and grant in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-23\">The record does not compel the conclusion that changed or extraordinary circumstances excused Effendi\u2019s untimely filed asylum application. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.4(a)(4), (5); <em>Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 649-50 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam). Accordingly, we deny the petition as to the asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-24\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Effendi is not entitled to CAT relief because Effendi did not present evidence demonstrating a clear probability that he would be tortured by, or with the acquiescence of, public officials or persons acting in an official capacity if he returns to Indonesia. <em>See Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1067-68 (9th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-25\">The BIA erred in holding that disfavored group analysis was inapplicable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>Effendi\u2019s withholding of removal claim, so we remand for reconsideration of this claim. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>587 U.S. 12, 16-18, 128 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam); <em>Wakkary, </em>558 F.3d at 1067.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; GRANTED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b656-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
