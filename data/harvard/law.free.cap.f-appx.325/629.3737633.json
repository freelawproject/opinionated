R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b657-21\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-22\">Mohammed Edy Safil, a native and citizen of Indonesia, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 order dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s decision denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2004), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-23\">The record does not compel the conclusion that Safil has established extraordinary circumstances that excuse the untimely filing of his asylum application. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4(a)(5); <em>see also Husyev v. Mukasey, </em>528 F.3d 1172, 1181-82 (9th Cir.2008). Accordingly, his asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-24\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination because the discrepancy between Safil\u2019s testimony and his psychologist\u2019s evaluation regarding whether he had been exiled to a small village and abused daily, is a material inconsistency that goes to the heart of his claim. <em>See Pal v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 935, 940 (9th Cir.2000); <em>Li, </em>378 F.3d at 962 (adverse credibility determination is supported where at least one of the identified grounds is supported by substantial evidence and goes to the heart of the claim). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>In the absence of credible testimony, Safil has failed to establish that he is eligible for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Because Safil\u2019s CAT claim is based on the testimony the agency found not credible, and he points to no other evidence to show it is more likely than not he would be tortured if returned to Indonesia, his CAT claim fails. <em>See id. </em>at 1156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b657-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
