The district court denied the motion because Collins\u2019s base offense level was determined using the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, rather that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. Collins argues that (1) his career offender status did not preclude him from receiving a reduction; (2) the district court should have re-sentenced him under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); and (3) the district court erred in calculating his career offender guideline imprisonment range. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may reduce the sentence \u201cof a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Amendment 706, which was made retroactive by Amendment 713, reduced the offense levels in \u00a7 2D 1.1 for crack cocaine offenses by two levels. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amends. 706, 713 (2008). Any sentence reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The applicable policy statements provide that \u201ca reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2) and is not consistent with this policy statement if ... [a retroactive amendment] is applicable to the defendant but the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">The district court did not err in denying Collins\u2019s motion. <em>See James, </em>548 F.3d at 984. First, Collins was sentenced as a career offender, and \u00a7 2D 1.1 played no ultimate role in his sentence. Thus, Amendment 706 did not effect the guideline imprisonment range used to sentence Collins, and he was not eligible for a reduction. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009) (\u201cWhere a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-11\">Also, regarding Collins\u2019s <em>Booker </em>arguments, <em>Booker </em>does not provide an independent basis for the district court to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence or give the district court authority to grant a reduction beyond the two levels authorized by Amendment 706. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1657, 173 L.Ed.2d 1025 (2009) (holding that, where a defendant is not eligible for sentence reduction under the Amendment, <em>Booker </em>does not provide an independent basis for relief); <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Feb. 10, 2009) (No. 08-8664) (holding that <em>Booker </em>and its progeny \u201cdo not prohibit the limitations on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>a judge\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement by the Sentencing Commission\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Furthermore, to the extent that Collins argues that his career offender guideline imprisonment range was calculated using the wrong base offense level, a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is not the proper venue to pursue such a sentence-calculation challenge. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780-81 (11th Cir.2000) (holding that, in substituting the amended base offense level for the originally applied base offense level, the district court must leave intact all other guideline application decisions made during the original sentencing); <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2007) (holding that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings do not constitute a full, or <em>de novo, </em>re-sentencing of the defendant). Accordingly, because Collins has made no argument that merits relief, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"APhE\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b818-5\">. Upon Collins's appeal from the district court's denial of his motion, we ordered Collins's appeal stayed pending resolution of <em>United States v. Moore. </em>After deciding <em>Moore, </em>we directed the parties to advise whether any issues remained unresolved. Based on the parties' responses, we ordered that the matter be briefed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
