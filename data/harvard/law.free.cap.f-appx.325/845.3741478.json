Phillips contends that Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines operates to reduce his base offense level because he was not sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of life imprisonment. We disagree and AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b874-15\">In 1999, a jury convicted Phillips of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (Count One), and distribution of cocaine and possession with intent to distribute cocaine, both in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (Counts Two and Three). <em>See </em>Exh. Folder 1 at 12, 30. Phillips originally was sentenced to a term of life imprisonment, the mandatory minimum sentence pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1)(B), based on the government\u2019s enhancement information, filed in accordance with 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, which listed Phillips\u2019s three prior felony drug convictions. <em>See </em>Exh. Folder 1 at 22, 44. Although the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) noted that Phillips\u2019s guideline sentence was calculated using U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 instead of U.S.S.G \u00a7 4B1.1 (the career offender guideline), it also made clear that Phillips was nonetheless subject to the statutory mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-16\">Phillips subsequently filed a motion to reopen his sentence based on a state court judgment modifying one of the convictions listed in the \u00a7 851 enhancement information. Rl-122. We ultimately denied Phillips\u2019s motion to proceed on appeal <em>in for-ma pauperis </em>(\u201cIFP\u201d) and noted that the corrected state conviction did not affect his sentence, which, we stated, \u201cwas determined pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).\u201d Rl-136. On appeal, Phillips argues that the state court modification of one of his prior convictions nullified the government\u2019s notice of enhancement and that our reference to \u00a7 2D1.1 in our order denying his motion to proceed on appeal IFP now precludes us from finding that he was sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable policy statements, found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, prohibit a reduction where an \u201camendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision <em>(e.g., </em>a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)). Moreover, a sentencing adjustment under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not constitute a <em>de novo </em>resentencing, and <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000). Finally, we have held that where a defendant was sentenced to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence, he is precluded from receiving a sentence reduction pursuant to Amendment 706 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1341-42 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">In this case, we conclude that Phillips was sentenced to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment. The reference to \u00a7 2D1.1 in our previous order was intended to highlight the fact that Phillips\u2019s guideline sentence was calculated pursuant to \u00a7 2D1.1, subject to \u00a7 841(a)(1)(B), as opposed to the career offender guideline provision. This observation in no way modified Phillips\u2019s sentence or suggested that he was sentenced to anything other than the statutory mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment. As such, Amendment 706 does not have the effect of lowering his applicable guideline range. <em>See Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1341.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">Phillips appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a reduced sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Because he was sentenced to a statutory mandatory minimum term of life imprisonment, Amendment 706 does not lower his applicable guideline range. Consequently, Phillips is not eligible for a reduced sentence. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
