Singh\u2019s own testimony established that the Indian authorities detained and questioned him as part of an investigation into the location of a militant\u2019s cache of weapons. <em>See Dinu v. Ashcroft, </em>372 F.3d 1041, 1043-44 (9th Cir.2004) (presumption of persecution for political opinion \u201carises only where there appears to be no other logical reason for the persecution at issue\u201d). Although the tactics allegedly employed by the Indian police were reprehensible, they \u201cwere nevertheless directed at the legitimate goal\u201d of locating an illegal cache of weapons. <em>See id. </em>at 1044. As the record fails to compel a contrary finding, we are bound to uphold the BIA\u2019s determination. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-21\">Because Singh failed to satisfy the lower standard of proof for asylum, it necessarily follows that he failed to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Fisher v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 955, 960-61 (9th Cir.1996) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-22\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b596-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b596-25\">. We lack jurisdiction over Singh's CAT claim because he failed to present it to the Board. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677-78 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
