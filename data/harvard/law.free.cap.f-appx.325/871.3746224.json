Allen, who was sentenced as career offender, based his motion on Amendment 706 to the sentencing guidelines, which reduced the base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine offenses. Allen contends that the district court should have realized when it evaluated his eligibility for a sentence reduction that his original sentence exceeded the statutory maximum permissible for the charged offense both because the indictment failed to allege a specific drug amount and because the government failed to file a notice of enhancement pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851. He argues that the district court should have lowered his sentence for this reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-22\">Because \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings are not <em>de novo </em>resentencings, Allen\u2019s arguments about alleged flaws in his original sentencing determinations do not permit a sentence reduction. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000). Nor is Allen eligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 706. His sentence was based on the career-offender provisions in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 instead of the drug quantity table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, so Amendment 706 did not have the effect of lowering his guideline range. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009). Thus the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>court properly denied Allen\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
