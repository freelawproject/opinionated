Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence. <em>Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir.2009). We deny in part, dismiss in part, and grant in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">The agency denied Pantouw\u2019s asylum claim as time-barred. Pantouw does not challenge this finding in his opening brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Pantouw failed to show it was more likely than not that he would be tortured in Indonesia. <em>See id. </em>at 1068. Therefore, we deny Pan-touw\u2019s CAT claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-11\">We lack jurisdiction to address Pan-touw\u2019s contention that he established a pattern or practice of persecution against Christian Indonesians because he failed to exhaust this claim before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004). Thus, we dismiss Pantouw\u2019s pattern or practice contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-14\">However, because the BIA erred by refusing to consider the evidence regarding whether Pantouw belonged to a disfavored group in assessing withholding of removal, we grant the petition for review in part and remand to the BIA for reconsideration of this claim. <em>See Wakkary, </em>558 F.3d at 1066-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-15\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part; GRANTED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b643-12\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>ed by 9 th Cir.
