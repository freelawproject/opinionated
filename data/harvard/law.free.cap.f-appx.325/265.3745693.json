Anderson pled guilty pursuant to a plea agreement to manufacturing 100 or more marijuana plants, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(B) (2006), and was sentenced to a five-year probationary sentence. The Government appealed, asserting that although Anderson met the requirements for application of the safety-valve under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) (2006) and, accordingly, the district court was justified in sentencing him below the five-year statutory mandatory minimum, the district court lacked authority to impose a probationary sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3561(a)(1) (2006). We hold that the district court was prohibited from sentencing Anderson to a probationary sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Section 841(b)(1)(B) carries a maximum penalty of forty years in prison and is classified as a Class B felony. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(2) (2006) (classifying an offense with a twenty-five year or more maximum penalty as a Class B felony). Under the plain language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3561(a)(1), an individual convicted of a Class B felony may not be sentenced to a term of probation. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3561(a)(1) (2006) (\u201cA defendant who has been found guilty of an offense may be sentenced to a term of probation unless ... the offense is a Class A or Class B felony and the defendant is an individual.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Moreover, \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) explicitly states that \u201c[njotwithstanding any other provision of law,\u201d a district court shall not place on probation any person sentenced under that subparagraph. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). Accordingly, even though the district court was justified in sentencing Anderson below the statutory five-year mandatory minimum based on his safety-valve qualification, \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)\u2019s proscription against probation acted as a floor to any possible sentence. <em>See United States v. Dickerson, </em>381 F.3d 251, 258-60 (3d Cir.2004) (holding that probationary sentences are barred where a defendant is convicted of a Class B felony notwithstanding eligibility for the safety valve); <em>United States v. Green, </em>105 F.3d 1321, 1323-24 (9th Cir.1997) (\u201cWe therefore hold that the safety valve permits the court to disregard the mandatory 10-year term of imprisonment contained in \u00a7 841, but that probation is prohibited as a sentencing option under the remaining provisions of \u00a7 841 and by the Guidelines themselves\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Despite the foregoing, Anderson asserts that \u00a7 3553(f) trumps the statutory prohibition on probationary sentences under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). In support of this argument, Anderson relies on this court\u2019s holding in <em>United States v. Daiagi, </em>892 F.2d 31 (4th Cir.1989). In <em>Daiagi, </em>this court held that a probationary sentence for a Class B felony (i.e., a 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 conviction) is authorized upon the Government\u2019s substantial assistance motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) (2006). <em>Id. </em>at 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\"><em>Daiagi </em>is distinguishable because the court limited its holding to situations where the Government has made a substantial assistance motion. <em>Daiagi, </em>892 F.2d at 33. Because the Government did not make a substantial assistance motion in this case but actually opposed the imposition of a probationary sentence, <em>Daiagi\u2019s </em>narrow exception to \u00a7 3561(a)(1) is inapplicable. Moreover, because the version of \u00a7 846 at issue in <em>Daiagi </em>did not explicitly incorporate \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)\u2019s penalties as its own, there was no additional proscription against probation for such an offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm Anderson\u2019s conviction but vacate and remand the matter for resentencing consistent with this opinion. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
