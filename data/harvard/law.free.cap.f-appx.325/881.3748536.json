The district court denied Carthan\u2019s motion, finding that he was ineligible for a reduction because he was sentenced as a career offender, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. On appeal, Carthan argues that the district court erred in finding that he was ineligible for a reduction because the court initially sentenced him based on an erroneous career-offender offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-19\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The applicable policy statements, found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, state that a reduction is not authorized if the amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-20\">Upon careful review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. To the extent that Carthan challenges his career-offender offense level, such a challenge cannot prevail. \u201cThis Circuit has been very clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>in holding that a sentencing adjustment undertaken pursuant to Section 3582(c)(2) does not constitute a de novo resentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000). Rather, in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) resentencing, <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, because Carthan was sentenced based on the career-offender offense level, the district court correctly found that he was not eligible for a sentence reduction. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009) (holding that the district court does not have the authority to reduce the sentence of a defendant who was sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
