Rainey argues that his mandatory minimum sentence should be set aside because no drug quantity was ever alleged or proven to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt, in violation of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Consequently, Rainey contends that Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines lowered his base offense level and he is entitled to a sentence reduction. We reject these arguments and AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b808-14\">A jury convicted Rainey in 1993 of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841. Based on Rainey\u2019s prior conviction for a felony drug offense, he was subject to a twenty-year minimum mandatory sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). At the sentencing hearing, Rainey did not dispute the applicability of the statutory minimum mandatory sentence. He only requested that the court sentence him to the low end of his guideline range\u2014twenty years of imprisonment. The district court acquiesced and imposed concurrent sentences of twenty years (240 months of imprisonment) as to each count.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-15\">In February 2008, the district court, acting on its own motion pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), appointed counsel for Rainey to determine the effect of Amendment 706 on Rainey\u2019s sentence. Amendment 706 permits a sentence reduction \u201cif that sentence was based on the \u00a7 2D 1.1 offense level for crack cocaine offenses.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1339 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). After evaluating responses from Rainey, the government, and the probation office, the district court determined that Rainey was not eligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 706. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-16\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b808-17\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for abuse of discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>tion, and its legal interpretations <em>de novo. See Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1338-39. A district court may modify a defendant\u2019s sentence that was based on a sentencing range which was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable policy statements expressly prohibit a reduction where an \u201camendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision <em>(e.g., </em>a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)) (2008). Accordingly, Amendment 706 has no effect on a sentence that was based on a statutory mandatory minimum, rather than on a base offense level in \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>See Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1342. Furthermore, because a sentencing adjustment under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not constitute a <em>de novo </em>resentencing, the district court must leave intact all original sentencing determinations except for the amended guideline range. <em>See United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Here, Rainey\u2019s sentence was based on the statutory mandatory minimum of twenty years of imprisonment, which applied because of his previous felony drug conviction. The district court was not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to revisit that sentencing determination. <em>See id. </em>Because Rainey\u2019s sentence was not based on an offense level under \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), it did \u201cnot fall within the scope of Amendment 706.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1342 (concluding that Williams was not entitled to a sentence reduction under Amendment 706 because he was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum that replaced his original sentencing guideline range under \u00a7 2D1.1). Accordingly, the district court did not err in concluding that Rainey was ineligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 706. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">Furthermore, a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is not the proper forum for Rainey\u2019s argument that his mandatory minimum sentence violated <em>Apprendi. </em>The plain language of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) only permits modifications to a sentence based on guideline amendments by the Sentencing Commission, not Supreme Court decisions. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1220 (concluding that <em>\u201cBooker </em>is inapplicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions\u201d because <em>\u201cBooker </em>is a Supreme Court decision, not a retroactively applicable guideline amendment by the Sentencing Commission\u201d). As a result, <em>Apprendi </em>cannot be used as a basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">The district court correctly determined that Amendment 706 did not alter Rainey\u2019s sentence because he was sentenced according to the statutory mandatory minimum. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
