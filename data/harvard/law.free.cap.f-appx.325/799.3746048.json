In 2007 and 2008, Hood, proceeding pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c), moved the district court (in three motions) to reduce his sentences in accordance with Amendments 599 and 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). The district court denied his motions on September 30, 2008. In a single order, the court concluded that sentence reductions were not authorized because Hood had been sentenced to statutory minimum terms of imprisonment. Hood now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-12\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment based on a sentence range that has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable policy statements, found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, state that a sentence reduction is not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if \u201can amendment ... does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline [sentence] range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). The commentary elaborates that a reduction is not authorized if the amendment does not lower the defendant\u2019s applicable sentence range \u201cbecause of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision <em>(e.g., </em>a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-13\">\u201cAmendment 599 was enacted to clarify under what circumstances a weapons enhancement may be applied to an underlying offense when the defendant has also received an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) conviction, which provides separate punishment for the use or possession of a firearm in a violent crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Pringle, </em>350 F.3d 1172, 1176 (11th Cir.2003); <em>see </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 599. Amendment 706 affects the base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-14\">We find no error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that Hood was ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction pursuant to either Amendment 599 or 706 because his sentence was based on the statutory minimum term of imprisonment, not an otherwise applicable range that had been lowered by those amendments. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>\u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1339-42 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that the district court did not have the authority to grant Williams a reduction because Amendment 706 had no effect on his statutory minimum term of imprisonment, which had become his guideline range, even when he received a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1). Furthermore, Hood\u2019s argument that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough </em>apply in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>where we held that neither <em>Booker </em>nor <em>Kimbrough, </em>\u201cprohibit[s] the limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Feb. 10, 2009) (No. 08-8664).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Based on the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
