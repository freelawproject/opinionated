The district court denied the motion because Burney was held responsible for 442 kilograms of crack cocaine, such that Amendment 706 did not affect his guideline imprisonment range. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may reduce the sentence \u201cof a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable policy statements provide that \u201ca reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2) and is not consistent with this policy statement if ... [a retroactive amendment] is applicable to the defendant but the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-11\">The district court properly denied the motion. <em>See James, </em>548 F.3d at 984. First, Burney\u2019s guideline imprisonment range was not lowered as a result of Amendment 706, given that he was held accountable for more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine and Amendment 706 only lowered the base offense levels for quantities of crack cocaine less than 4.5 kilograms. <em>See id. </em>at 986 (holding that the defendant was not entitled to a reduction in sentence because he had been held accountable for more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, and Amendment 706 did not lower his guideline range). Also, to the extent that Burney argues that the district court could have relied on <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), to reduce his sentence or otherwise should have applied <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough, </em>his sentence is without merit because those cases do not apply to \u00a7 3582 proceedings. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009) (holding that neither <em>Booker </em>nor <em>Kimbrough </em>render a guideline range advisory in the context of a \u00a7 3582 proceeding), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Feb. 10, 2009) (No. 08-8664); <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220-21 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that <em>Booker </em>did not provide a jurisdictional basis for \u00a7 3582 relief because it was not a sentencing amendment). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
