Our jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo whether a particular conviction constitutes an aggravated felony, <em>Randhawa v. Ashcroft, </em>298 F.3d 1148, 1151 (9th Cir.2002), and we review for substantial evidence the factual determinations underlying a denial of CAT relief, <em>Lemus-Galvan v. Mukasey, </em>518 F.3d 1081, 1084 (9th Cir.2008). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The agency did not err in finding Zavala Perla removable as an aggravated felon under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) because his conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1708 categorically constitutes a theft offense and Zavala Perla was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of at least one year for his crime. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G); <em>Randhawa, </em>298 F.3d at 1153-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">A reasonable factfinder would not be compelled to reverse the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Zavala Perla has not shown that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if returned to El Salvador. <em>See Lemus-Galvan, </em>518 F.3d at 1084.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">We need not reach Zavala Perla\u2019s remaining contentions because he does not challenge the agency\u2019s determination that he is ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal due to his criminal convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b566-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
