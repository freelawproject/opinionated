We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for abuse of discretion, <em>Perez v. Mukasey, </em>516 F.3d 770, 773 (9th Cir.2008), we grant the petition for review and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-25\">As a preliminary matter, we reject the respondent\u2019s contention that Li has waived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>challenge to the denial of his motion to reopen. <em>See Alcaraz v. INS, </em>384 F.3d 1150, 1161 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201c[W]e may review an issue ... if the failure to raise the issue properly did not prejudice the defense of the opposing party.\u201d) (quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The BIA abused its discretion by failing to specifically address Li\u2019s allegation that he did not receive notice of the BIA\u2019s August 3, 2005 order. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>494 F.3d 1170, 1172-73 (9th Cir.2007) (presumption of proper mailing may be overcome by evidence of non-receipt by petitioner or counsel). We remand for the BIA to address Li\u2019s allegation of non-receipt in the first instance and determine whether it is sufficient to overcome the presumption of mailing. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b564-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
