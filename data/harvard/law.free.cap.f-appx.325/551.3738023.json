The parties are familiar with the facts of this case, which we repeat here only to the extent necessary to explain our decision. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1826 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We apply contract principles to the interpretation of a proffer agreement and review de novo alleged violations of a proffer agreement. <em>United States v. Chiu, </em>109 F.3d 624, 625 (9th Cir.1997). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-15\">The proffer agreement (\u201cthe Agreement\u201d) between Janan and the U.S. Attorney is not ambiguous. The Agreement explicitly states that the government is precluded from directly offering Janan\u2019s statements against him only in its case-in-chief. We have held that similarly worded agreements confer only direct use immunity. <em>Id. </em>at 626. Janan\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Chiu </em>on the ground that Janan is a witness, rather than a defendant, is not persuasive. As in <em>Chiu, </em>the government here has not used Janan\u2019s statements against him in its case-in-chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-16\">We reject Janan\u2019s invitation to adopt an expansive definition of the term \u201ccase-in chief.\u201d In <em>Chiu, </em>we held that a government\u2019s use of proffer statements to prepare a witness for trial did not constitute use during the case-in-chief. <em>Id. </em>The term \u201ccase-in-chief\u2019 refers only to \u201c[t]he evidence presented at trial by a party between the time the party calls the first witness and the time the party rests\u201d or \u201c[t]he part of a trial in which a party presents evidence to support the claim or defense.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>229 (8th ed.2004). We reject Janan\u2019s suggestion that the term \u201ccase-in-chief\u2019 encompasses preliminary proceedings in any action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No trial has yet taken place, and therefore no case-in-chief has yet been presented. '</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b580-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b580-13\">. Because the government has not violated the Agreement, we do not reach the question whether quashing the subpoena is an appropriate remedy for violation of a proffer agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
