Pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>suant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the court reduced his sentence to the minimum of his amended guidelines range but denied his request for a reduction below this range. For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">In 1999, Powell was convicted of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and cocaine base and sentenced to 235 months of imprisonment by the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida. Rl-1291 at 1. In February 2008, the district court <em>sua sponte </em>determined that Amendment 706 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines, which lowered the base offense level for a cocaine base offense by two, might be applicable to Powell\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rl-1245 at 1. The court subsequently determined that Amendments 706 and 711 reduced Powell\u2019s base offense level and thus reduced his sentence to 188 months, the minimum of his amended guidelines range. R 1-1291 at 4, R 1-1301 at 1. However, the court determined that it had no authority under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) to grant Powell\u2019s request for a further reduction. Rl-1303. Powell appealed this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">On appeal, Powell argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for a below-guidelines sentence reduction. He contends that Booker, along with <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), and <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), establishes that the guidelines are advisory in all eon-texts, including \u00a7 3582(c) proceedings, and that the district court therefore had the discretion to sentence him below the amended guidelines range. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its authority to modify a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c). <em>See United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-11\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits a district court to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence if that defendant \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o)\u201d and such a reduction is consistent with policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l) (Supp. May 1, 2008). The Commission\u2019s policy statements instruct a district court not to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(e)(2) \u201cto a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A). Section 3582(c)(2) would thus not permit the district court to reduce Powell\u2019s sentence below his amended guidelines range. Furthermore, we have rejected Powell\u2019s argument that <em>Booker </em>et al. trump these provisions and give a district court the authority to reduce a sentence below the amended guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam) (holding that <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>\u201cdo not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings\u201d and \u201cdo not prohibit the limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement by the Sentencing Commission\u201d). The district court thus had no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>authority to reduce Powell\u2019s sentence below the amended guidelines range and therefore did not err in refusing to grant such a reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Powell appeals the district court\u2019s order reducing his sentence to the minimum of his amended guidelines range but denying his request for a reduction below this range. The district court had no authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to grant such a further reduction, and Booker and its progeny did not give the court such discretion. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b795-9\">. The court appointed a federal public defender to represent him in seeking a reduction of his original sentence. <em>Id. </em>Around the same time, Powell filed a <em>pro se </em>motion to reduce his sentence based on \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 706, which the district court dismissed as moot.
