The Guidelines prescribed a sentence range of 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment, and, after making a downward departure from that range under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, the district court sentenced McCray on March 31, 2005, to prison term of 120 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">On July 14, 2008, McCray moved the district court pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) to reduce his sentence based on Amendment 706 to the Guidelines, which provides for the reduction of base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine. The district court denied his motion on the ground that because he was sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, Amendment 706 does not lower his base offense level. McCray now appeals the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">McCray concedes that our precedent forecloses his argument that the court should have reduced his sentence; he appeals simply to preserve the issue. His concession is well made since our precedent does foreclose his appeal. \u201cWhere a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009). Because McCray\u2019s sentencing range was calculated under the career offender provisions of \u00a7 4B1.1, rather than the drug quantity table in \u00a7 2D1.1, Amendment 706 does not have the effect of lowering McCray\u2019s sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
