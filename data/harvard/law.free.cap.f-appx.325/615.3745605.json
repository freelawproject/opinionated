We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We grant the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-11\">Without making an explicit adverse credibility determination, the IJ conflated what she may have intended to be an adverse credibility finding with her finding that Singh failed to meet his burden of proving persecution. The BIA compounded the error by adopting and affirming the IJ\u2019s non-existent credibility finding. In these circumstances, the BIA should have either addressed the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Singh failed to carry his burden of proof or remanded the case to the IJ for a credibility finding. <em>See Huang v. Mukasey, </em>520 F.3d 1006, 1008 (9th Cir.2008) (per cu-riam). Because the BIA did neither, we grant the petition for review as to Singh\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims and remand this case to the agency for further proceedings consistent with this disposition. <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>INS v. Ventu-ra, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam)).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-17\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b644-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
