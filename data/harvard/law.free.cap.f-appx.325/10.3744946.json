(\u201cTradin\u201d) appeals from a judgment and order of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Pauley, J.) denying its summary judgment motion and granting summary judgment to Defendant-Appellant Maryland Casualty Company (\u201cMaryland\u201d). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-11\">\u2018We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, drawing all factual inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Paneccasio v. Unisource Worldwide, Inc., </em>532 F.3d 101, 107 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-12\">Exclusions like the \u201cYour Product\u201d exclusion here are \u201cintended to exclude coverage for damage to the insured\u2019s product, but not for damage caused by the insured\u2019s product to persons or property other than the insured\u2019s own product.\u201d <em>Lowville Producer\u2019s Dairy Coop. v. Am. Motorists Ins. Co., </em>198 A.D.2d 851, 853, 604 N.Y.S.2d 421, 422 (4th Dep\u2019t 1993); <em>see also Hartog Rahal P\u2019ship v. Am. Motorists Ins. Co., </em>359 F.Supp.2d 331, 333 (S.D.N.Y.2005). As such, \u201c[t]he risk that [Tradin] would be required to make good on its warranty of quality was a contractual or commercial risk that [Maryland] did not intend to insure.\u201d <em>Lowville, </em>198 A.D.2d at 853, 604 N.Y.S.2d at 423. The policy provided by Maryland was \u201ca liability policy, not a performance bond.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because Tradin\u2019s claim was based on damage to Tradin\u2019s product\u2014a risk specifically excluded by the \u201cYour Product\u201d provision\u2014Maryland properly denied coverage of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-14\">\u201cExclusions in policies of insurance must be read seriatim, not cumulatively, and if any one exclusion applies there can be no coverage since no one exclusion can be regarded as inconsistent with another.\u201d <em>Zandri Constr. Co. v. Firemen\u2019s Ins. Co. of Newark, </em>81 A.D.2d 106, 109, 440 N.Y.S.2d 353, 356 (3d Dep\u2019t 1981) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-15\">Since the \u2018Your Product\u201d exclusion clearly applied to bar coverage of Tradin\u2019s claim, it is irrelevant whether the \u2018Your Work\u201d exclusion\u2014and/or its exception\u2014 also applied. Coverage was already barred, the \u201cYour Work\u201d exclusion did not create an affirmative grant of coverage, and there was no ambiguity as to the contractual language.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-16\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
