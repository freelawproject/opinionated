Robinson argues that he is eligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 706 and his sentence is unreasonable. Although the district court erred by ruling that it lacked jurisdiction to modify Robinson\u2019s sentence, the error was harmless because the district court ruled alternatively that Robinson\u2019s sentence should not be reduced. We affirm the denial of Robinson\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-21\">We review \u201cde novo a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). A district court may reduce a term of imprisonment when the guideline range is lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). When the district court recalculates the sentence under the amended guidelines, <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000). The district court must decide, in the light of the statutory sentencing factors, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), \u201cwhether, in its discretion, it will elect to impose the newly calculated sentence under the amended guidelines or retain the original sentence.\u201d <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781. We will not reverse based on an error that is harmless. <em>See United States v. Keene, </em>470 F.3d 1347, 1349 (11th Cir.2006). We review the reasonableness of the sentence imposed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-22\">The district court erred when it refused to modify Robinson\u2019s sentence based on its finding that he was responsible for more than 4.5 kilograms of cocaine base. At Robinson\u2019s original sentencing hearing, the district court found that Robinson\u2019s \u201coffense behavior involved in excess of five hundred grams of cocaine base.\u201d The district court cannot later revise that finding based on its recollection of the evidence. <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781; <em>United States v. Cothran, </em>106 F.3d 1560, 1562-63 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>We need not reverse the denial of Robinson\u2019s motion because we can say \u201c \u2018with fair assurance ... that the sentence was not substantially swayed by the error.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1292 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (quoting <em>United States v. Hornaday, </em>392 F.3d 1306, 1315-16 (11th Cir.2004)). The district court stated that even were it \u201cto find that [it] did have jurisdiction to reduce [Robinson\u2019s] offense or his sentence,\u201d the court \u201cwould let life remain as [Robinson\u2019s] sentence.\u201d The district court applied the new guideline range of 360 months to imprisonment for life, \u201cconsidered all of the factors in section 3553(a)(1) through 7,\u201d and explained that a sentence of life imprisonment was necessary to address Robinson\u2019s recidivism, \u201cseveral disciplinary problems while he\u2019s been incarcerated,\u201d and future dangerousness. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. Robinson\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">The order denying Robinson\u2019s motion to modify his sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
