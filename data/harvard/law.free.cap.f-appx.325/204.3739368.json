The district court initially sentenced Dobbs to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by five years of supervised release. Dobbs subsequently moved to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2006). The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>court granted the motion and resentenced Dobbs to the statutory mandatory minimum of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. Counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which he asserts there are no meritorious issues for appeal but questions whether the district court erred by not imposing a term less than the statutorily required minimum sentence. Although advised of his right to do so, Dobbs has not filed a pro se supplemental brief. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Possession of fifty or more grams of cocaine base with the intent to distribute carries a mandatory 120-month minimum sentence. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii) (2006). The district court did not have authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) (2006) to impose a sentence below the statutory minimum because the Government did not move for a downward departure to reflect substantial assistance with law enforcement. Likewise, Dobbs did not qualify for the safety valve provision, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) (2006). In sum, the district court was bound by the mandatory minimum sentence prescribed by \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii). <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>404 F.3d 850, 862 (4th Cir.2005) (\u201c[A] district court has <em>no </em>discretion to impose a sentence outside the statutory range established by Congress for the offense of conviction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the judgment. This court requires that counsel inform Dobbs, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Dobbs requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be Mvolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Dobbs.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
