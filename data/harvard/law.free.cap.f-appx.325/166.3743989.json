The conditional plea preserved Sims\u2019s right to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress. Sims was sentenced to seventy-five months\u2019 imprisonment. Sims\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), certifying that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but alleging that the district court erred in denying Sims\u2019s motion to suppress. Sims filed a pro se supplemental brief, reiterating the arguments raised in counsel\u2019s brief. The Government did not file a reply brief. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-25\">In reviewing the district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, and its legal determinations de novo. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number><em>United States v. Cain, </em>524 F.3d 477, 481 (4th Cir.2008). The facts are reviewed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below. <em>United States v. Jamison, </em>509 F.3d 623, 628 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">With these standards in mind, and having reviewed the transcript of the suppression hearing, we conclude the district court did not err in denying Sims\u2019s motion to suppress. <em>See United States v. Burton, </em>228 F.3d 524, 528 (4th Cir.2008) (finding that officers must have both reasonable suspicion of criminal activity as well as reason to believe suspect armed and dangerous in order to conduct constitutional frisk for weapons). In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform Sims, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Sims requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Sims. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
