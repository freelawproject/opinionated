R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b620-20\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-21\">Plaintiff George Thomas (\u201cThomas\u201d) brought this suit against Defendant U.S. Bank for its attempts to collect an uncol-lectible debt from Thomas and for two pulls of Thomas\u2019s credit report, claiming U.S. Bank\u2019s conduct violated Oregon statutes and the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (\u201cFCRA\u201d). Thomas appeals various rulings by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-22\">We affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on Thomas\u2019s claims under the Oregon Unlawful Debt Collection Practices Act (\u201cUDCPA\u201d). Thomas\u2019s claim under Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 646.639(2)(m) fails because he presented no evidence that U.S. Bank represented that Thomas\u2019s debt would be increased by fees or other charges. Thomas\u2019s claim under Or.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 646.639(2)(n) fails because he presented no evidence that the difference between his actual debt amount and the amount U.S. Bank attempted to collect was attributable to added interest or fees. Thomas\u2019s claim under Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 646.639(2)(k) fails because a litigation is not a \u201cright or remedy\u201d that was unavailable to U.S. Bank when it threatened to sue. <em>Porter v. Hill, </em>314 Or. 86, 838 P.2d 45, 49 (1992); <em>Pro Car Care, Inc. v. Johnson, </em>201 Or.App. 250, 118 P.3d 815, 818 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-23\">We also affirm the district court\u2019s grant of judgment as a matter of law to U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>Bank on Thomas\u2019s \u201cpermissible purposes\u201d FCRA claim under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(f). Thomas presented no evidence that U.S. Bank or Capital Management Services, Inc., had requested his credit report for any reason other than to attempt to collect on the debt, and requesting a credit report with the intent to collect on a debt is among the \u201cpermissible purposes\u201d listed in the FCRA. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(a)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the video testimony of Thomas\u2019s deceased expert witness. Nor did it abuse its discretion in awarding attorney\u2019s fees to U.S. Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b620-24\"> The Honorable J.
