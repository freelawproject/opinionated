The court denied her motion, concluding that since her offense level was determined under the career offender Guideline, she was ineligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 706. She now appeals contending that, although she qualified as a career offender at sentencing, the court departed downward based upon the finding that her criminal history category overstated her criminal record. Accordingly, she contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>she is eligible for sentence reduction under Amendment 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">A district court may reduce the sentence \u201cof a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable policy statements provide that \u201ca reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2) and is not consistent with this policy statement if\u2019 a retroactive amendment applies to the defendant but \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">Here, although, at sentencing, the district court departed downward in arriving at appellant\u2019s criminal history category, her offense level was calculated by application of the career offender provision. Thus, the sentence range upon which her sentences were based was not affected by Amendment 706, and she is ineligible for sentence reduction. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b922-15\">. The presentence report, and the district court, calculated appellant's base offense level at 32 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(4), and determined that she was a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Because the statutory maximum sentence life imprisonment, her offense level became 37. After reducing that level for her acceptance of responsibility and reducing her criminal history category to V, the court arrived as a sentence range of 235 to 293 months' imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
