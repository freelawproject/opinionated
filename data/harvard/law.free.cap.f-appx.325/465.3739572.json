Despite the fact his sentence is three months below the low end of the range recommended under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 7B1.4(a) (21-27 months based on the Grade B violation Cocke admitted to and his Criminal History Category of VI), Cocke argues the district court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> imposed an unreasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>We review the sentence imposed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v.

The record indicates the district court was aware of, and considered, the relevant sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) for determining an appropriate sentence for a violation of supervised release. The record also indicates the district court considered Cocke\u2019s arguments for imposing a lower sentence.
