The district court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> granted Jones a two level reduction and imposed a 120 month within the Guidelines sentence. Jones appeals the court\u2019s refusal to grant more than a two-level reduction in the offense level. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">In 1998 Kevin Jones plead guilty by agreement to an amended information charging him with possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, commonly known as \u201ccrack cocaine,\u201d and using or carrying a firearm in connection with a drug trafficking crime. In 1999 the district court,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> applying the mandatory sentencing guidelines in effect prior to <em>United States v. Booker</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>sentenced Jones to 162 months for distribution of crack cocaine to be served consecutively with a 60 month sentence for carrying a handgun in conjunction with a drug offense. The 162 month sentence was the maximum under the guideline range of 130 to 162 months resulting from an offense level of 27 and a criminal history category VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">On November 1, 2007, Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines went into effect lowering sentencing ranges for crack cocaine offenses by two offense levels. Amendment 713 subsequently made this change retroactive.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">On June 24, 2008, Jones filed a motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) seeking to reduce his sentence on the distribution charge based on the retroactive Guideline Amendment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The district court held a hearing on August 11, 2008, determined Jones was entitled to a sentence adjustment, and reduced his sentence on the distribution charge to 120 months, a sentence in the middle of his newly adjusted guideline range of 110 to 137 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Jones appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>557 F.3d 601, 613 (8th Cir.2009). We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision to reduce a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Wyatt, </em>115 F.3d 606, 609 (8th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">Section 3582(c)(2) provides that \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o), ... the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The applicable policy statement here is provided by section 1B1.10 of the Sentencing Guidelines, which states that proceedings under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) are not full resentencings and that a district court may not reduce a sentence to a term less than the minimum amended guideline range. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A) (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-12\">Jones argues that the district court improperly limited his sentence reduction to a two-level reduction in the offense level. He argues that the district court erred in not recognizing that <em>Booker </em>applies to re-sentencings under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), erred in treating the amended guideline range as the default range, and abused its discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>tion in not finding that the amended guideline range was still greater than necessary to serve the sentencing goals of \u00a7 3553(a). All of his arguments turn on whether <em>Booker </em>applies to his resentencing or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">We recently held in <em>United States v. Starks </em>that <em>Booker </em>does not apply to re-sentencings under \u00a7 3582(c). 551 F.3d 839, 840 (8th Cir.2009). In <em>Starks </em>we observed that \u201csentence reductions based on retroactive guideline amendments\u201d are sentence modification proceedings governed by \u00a7 3582(c), and that in enacting \u00a7 3582(c) Congress limited the authority of a district court to modify a sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 841-42. We further noted that this limitation does not raise the constitutional concerns at issue in <em>Booker, </em>and that <em>Booker </em>did not invalidate \u00a7 3582(c). <em>Id. </em>We concluded that a district court may not reduce a sentence below the amended guideline range, and that it was not error for a district court \u201cto refuse to consider a further reduction based on \u00a7 3553(a) or to hold an evidentiary hearing for that purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 843; <em>accord United States v. Dunphy, </em>551 F.3d 247 (4th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Rhodes, </em>549 F.3d 833 (10th Cir.2008); <em>but see United States v. Hicks, </em>472 F.3d 1167 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Consistent with <em>Starks, </em>we hold that the district court did not err in limiting Jones\u2019 sentence reduction to a two-level reduction in the offense level.
