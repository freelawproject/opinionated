We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">Hampton contends that his trial counsel was ineffective for improperly advising him on his sentencing exposure after trial, resulting in the rejection of a plea offer. Hampton has not demonstrated that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient because the record does not reflect that a plea offer was extended. We conclude that the state court\u2019s decision rejecting Hampton\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was not contrary to, and did not involve an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States, and that it was not based upon an unreasonable determination of the facts. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>see also Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-12\">We deny Hampton\u2019s motion to expand the certificate of appealability. <em>See </em>9th Cir. R. 22\u20141(e); <em>see also Hiivala v. Wood, </em>195 F.3d 1098, 1104 (9th Cir.1999) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b630-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
