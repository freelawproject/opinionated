Smith\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motiob was based on Amendment 591 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which requires the selection of the applicable guideline be based on the statute of conviction, rather than judicial findings of relevant conduct not made by the jury. Smith asserts the offense level for his arson conviction, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(i), was improperly based upon the guideline applicable to first-degree murder\u2019, in light of Amendment 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-20\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may reduce the sentence \u201cof a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission,\u201d provided that \u201csuch a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The applicable policy statements provide that a court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence, pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), where \u201cthe guideline range applicable to that defendant has subsequently been lowered as a result of\u2019 a covered amendment to the Guidelines. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-21\">Amendment 591 became effective on November 1, 2000, and Smith was sentenced on July 30, 2001. Therefore, although the Amendment was made retroac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>tive by incorporation into U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c), it does not constitute a subsequent amendment within \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement because it was already in effect at the time he was sentenced. <em>See United States v. Stossel, </em>348 F.3d 1320, 1322 n. 2 (11th Cir.2003) (stating that a <em>pro se </em>inmate\u2019s motion \u201ccould fit under \u00a7 3582(c) only if he was arguing his sentence should be modified based on a subsequent sentencing guideline amendment\u201d). Moreover, we previously rejected Smith\u2019s challenge to the calculation of his offense level by reference to the first-degree murder guideline in his direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>No. 01-14427, manuscript op. at 18-19, 61 Fed.Appx. 668 (11th Cir. Jan. 31, 2003). Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying the motion, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
