After the denial of his suppression motion, Norris entered a conditional guilty plea to being a felon in possession of ammunition, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). We affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">The district court\u2019s finding that Norris\u2019s car had a crack in the windshield, in violation of California Vehicle Code \u00a7 26710, is not clearly erroneous. Thus, we conclude that the officers had reasonable suspicion based on articulated facts that Norris was driving in violation of state law, justifying an investigatory traffic stop. <em>United States v. Hensley, </em>469 U.S. 221, 226, 105 S.Ct. 675, 83 L.Ed.2d 604 (1985); <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">Given that officers knew that Norris was on parole and under investigation for possessing stolen property, including guns, the officers were justified in placing Norris in handcuffs during the stop. <em>Alexander v. County of Los Angeles, </em>64 F.3d 1315, 1320 (9th Cir.1995) (\u201cIt is well settled that when an officer reasonably believes force is necessary to protect his own safety or the safety of the public, measures used to restrain individuals, such as stopping them at gunpoint and handcuffing them, are reasonable.\u201d). The officers\u2019 routine questioning of Norris during the stop was not improper, and after Norris\u2019s false statements to the officers, it was reasonable to ask additional questions based on information learned during the course of the stop. <em>United States v. Turvin, </em>517 F.3d 1097, 1102-04 (9th Cir.2008) (citation omitted); <em>United States v. Richards, </em>500 F.2d 1025, 1029 (9th Cir.1974) <em>(Terry </em>stop lasting more than an hour did not violate the Fourth Amendment; the scope of inquiry and extended detention was justified by the police officers\u2019 attempts to check the suspects\u2019 unsatisfactory and evasive answers to routine questions). Norris\u2019s initial detention during the traffic stop and subsequent transport to a nearby park was not an unlawful arrest, because it was temporary and lasted no longer than necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop. <em>United States v. Mendez, </em>476 F.3d 1077, 1080-81 (9th Cir.2007); <em>Florida v. Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491, 500, 504-05, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 75 L.Ed.2d 229 (1983) (identifying \u201csafety and security\u201d as reasons that would \u201cjustify moving a suspect from one location to another\u201d) (plurality opinion). However, considering the totality of the circumstances, his subsequent transport to his residence and continued detention in the patrol vehicle during the parole search of his house converted his detention into an arrest. Nonetheless, the arrest was lawful and supported by probable cause, because Norris (1) lied to the police officers about his prior arrests, (2) lied about his parole status, and (3) made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>statements evidencing that he had violated the terms and conditions of his parole by not previously informing his parole officer that he had changed his address. <em>See Sherman v. United States Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>502 F.3d 869, 873 (9th Cir.2007) (\u201cWar-rantless arrests of parole violators are also valid.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Given the terms of Norris\u2019s parole, the parole search of Norris\u2019s residence was reasonable. <em>See Samson v. California, </em>547 U.S. 843, 849-56, 126 S.Ct. 2193, 165 L.Ed.2d 250 (2006); Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 3067(a), (b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Officers also had probable cause to believe that Norris lived at the house they searched, because he was observed at the house, Norris initially \u2022 told officers he lived at the address, and residents of the house confirmed that Norris lived in the upstairs bedroom. <em>See United States v. Howard, </em>447 F.3d 1257, 1262 (9th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Motley v. Parks, </em>432 F.3d 1072, 1080 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc)). To effectively execute the parole search, officers acted reasonably, under the circumstances, in forcing open the locked door and closet in Norris\u2019s bedroom. Given the particular facts of this case, damage to the door jam and closet door was necessary and not so excessive as to violate Norris\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. <em>See United States v. Becker, </em>929 F.2d 442, 446 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Norris makes no argument that the federal law enforcement officers conducting the search of Norris\u2019s residence were acting outside of their jurisdictional authority. Additionally, the district court did not clearly err in finding that Riverside Police officers, participating as part of a multi-jurisdictional, multi-agency Parole and Corrections Team, were acting within their authority under a countywide mutual aid agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">The evidence seized during the lawful parole search of Norris\u2019s residence and Norris\u2019s subsequent admission at the police station (after his arrest and waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights), that he owned the ammunition found in his closet, do not require suppression. Such evidence was not the product of illegal governmental activity. <em>United States v. Pulliam, </em>405 F.3d 782, 786 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b551-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b552-6\">. Although law enforcement officers did not need reasonable suspicion to effect the parole search, <em>Samson, </em>547 U.S. at 857, 126 S.Ct. 2193, we conclude that the parole search in this case was not a suspicionless search.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
