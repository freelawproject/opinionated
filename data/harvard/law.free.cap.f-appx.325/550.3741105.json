Because the underlying state court decision was not \u201ccontrary to, or ... an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">The state court reasonably found that California Jury Instruction 2.15 did not create a \u201creasonable likelihood\u201d that the jury misunderstood the government\u2019s burden of proof. <em>Boyde v. California, </em>494 U.S. 370, 380, 110 S.Ct. 1190, 108 L.Ed.2d 316 (1990); <em>see generally Gibson v. Ortiz, </em>387 F.3d 812 (9th Cir.2004). Any ambiguity in the instruction was clarified by other instructions given to the jury. <em>See Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 72, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">Likewise, the state court reasonably determined that the application of California Jury Instruction 2.15 to Busby\u2019s assault charges did not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Under the particular facts of Busby\u2019s case, the state court reasonably determined that it was more likely than not that Busby\u2019s possession of the cellular phone resulted from his participation in the assaults. <em>See County Ct. of Ulster v. Allen, 442 </em>U.S. 140, 163, 165, 99 S.Ct. 2213, 60 L.Ed.2d 777 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b579-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
