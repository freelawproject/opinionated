Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings, <em>Santos-Lemus v. Mukasey, </em>542 F.3d 738, 742 (9th Cir.2008). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-15\">We dismiss the petition as to Gonzalez-Rodriguez\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims because the particular social group he asserts to the court is different from the social group he argued to the BIA, such that his claim is unexhausted, <em>see Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004), and Gonzalez-Rodriguez has waived any other challenge to the agency\u2019s nexus finding, <em>see Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-16\">We lack jurisdiction to review Gonzalez-Rodriguez\u2019s contention regarding ineffective assistance of counsel because he failed to raise that issue before the BIA. <em>See Ontiveros-Lopez v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1121, 1124 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring ineffective assistance of counsel claims to be presented first to the BIA).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-17\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Gonzalez-Rodriguez failed to show it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if he returns to El Salvador. <em>See Santos-Lemus, </em>542 F.3d at 747-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-18\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b637-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
