The district court denied the motion because Eugene\u2019s base offense level was determined using the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, rather than U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. Eugene argues that he nevertheless was eligible for a reduction because the district court rejected his career offender guideline imprisonment range and granted a downward variance. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-14\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may reduce the sentence \u201cof a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Amendment 706, which was made retroactive by Amendment 713, reduced the offense levels in \u00a7 2D1.1 for crack cocaine offenses by two levels. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amends. 706, 713 (2008). Any sentence reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The applicable policy statements provide that \u201ca reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2) and is not consistent with this policy statement if ... [a retroactive amendment] is applicable to the defendant but the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-15\">The district court did not err in denying Eugene\u2019s motion. <em>See James, </em>548 F.3d at 984. The record demonstrates that Eugene\u2019s base offense level initially was set at 28, pursuant to \u00a7 2D1.1, and criminal history category at VI. Because he qualified as a career offender, however, his base offense level was changed to 34, pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.1, and his criminal history category stayed at VI. Thus, his guideline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>imprisonment range was 262 to 327 months. At sentencing, the district court adopted the PSI calculations, but granted a downward variance and sentenced Eugene to 192 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court cited the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and particularly was influenced by Eugene\u2019s troubled childhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">Because Eugene\u2019s guideline imprisonment range was calculated using \u00a7 4B1.1 rather than \u00a7 2D1.1, Amendment 706\u2019s changes to \u00a7 2D1.1 did not affect his sentence. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United </em>States,-U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009) (\u201cWhere a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d). The district court\u2019s grant of a downward variance does not change this conclusion. There is no evidence that the district court rejected the career offender guideline imprisonment range or otherwise based its sentence on the guideline imprisonment range that used \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1329-30. Rather, the district court simply granted a variance, based on its consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and Eugene\u2019s troubled childhood, from the career offender guideline imprisonment range. Indeed, the sentence imposed was not even within the guideline imprisonment range that used \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(3), which would have been 140 to 165 months. Thus, Eugene was not eligible for a reduction, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
