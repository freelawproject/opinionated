We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2006), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-18\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on the discrepancies in Gevorgyan\u2019s account of his wife being hit by a car in his testimony and declaration and based on Gevorgyan\u2019s explanation for the discrepancy that created an additional inconsistency, i.e., that his wife was actually not hit by the car. <em>See Kaur v. Gonzales, </em>418 F.3d 1061, 1065 (9th Cir.2005). Accordingly, Gevorgyan\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-19\">Because Gevorgyan failed to satisfy the lower standard of proof for asylum, it necessarily follows that he failed to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye, </em>453 F.3d at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-20\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Gevorgyan failed to establish it is more likely than not he would be tortured if returned to Armenia. <em>See Arteaga v. Mukasey, </em>511 F.3d 940, 948-49 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-21\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b536-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
