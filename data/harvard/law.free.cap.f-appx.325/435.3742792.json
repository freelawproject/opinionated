A disciplinary infraction (soliciting a murder) led to the revocation of a year\u2019s good-time credits, a year in segregation, and a year\u2019s loss of yard privileges. According to the complaint Winger spent at least 9 consecutive months indoors. After he complained of panic attacks, he was allowed a single hour of outdoor exercise. The district court dismissed the complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, citing <em>Pearson v. Ramos, </em>237 F.3d 881 (7th Cir.2001), for the proposition that a year\u2019s denial of yard privileges does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>not violate the Constitution\u2019s eighth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\"><em>Pearson </em>reached its conclusion only after a trial, and the court thus was able to evaluate the effects of the limit on yard privileges in the context of the prison\u2019s justifications for the restrictions. We observed along the way that an unjustified, lengthy deprivation of opportunity for out-of-cell exercise \u201ccould reasonably be described as cruel and, by reference to the current norms of American prisons, unusual.\u201d 237 F.3d at 884. See also <em>Delaney v. DeTella, </em>256 F.3d 679, 684 (7th Cir.2001); <em>Antonelli v. Sheahan, </em>81 F.3d 1422, 1432 (7th Cir.1996). But Pearson\u2019s misconduct justified the restrictions, we concluded. Pearson repeatedly attacked guards, making it understandable that the prison wanted a form of punishment that reduced his opportunity for similarly aggressive behavior: \u201cTo confine in \u2018solitary\u2019 a prisoner who behaves like a wild beast whenever he is let out of his cell is the least cruel measure that occurs to us for dealing with such a person.\u201d 237 F.3d at 885.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Winger equates \u201clack of yard privileges\u201d with \u201clack of exercise.\u201d If that is so, then it is difficult to see how even nine months\u2019 deprivation could be deemed consistent with the eighth amendment. Dismissal under \u00a7 1915A was therefore inappropriate. Yet perhaps the prison offered Winger an opportunity for adequate indoor exercise, or perhaps there are good penological reasons for the sort of restrictions to which Winger was subjected. See <em>Turner v. Safley, </em>482 U.S. 78, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987). Once the defendants answer the complaint, and the parties have an opportunity to present evidence, these questions may come into focus. We do not hold that Winger is enti-tied to prevail, only that his complaint states the sort of claim that cannot be dismissed out of hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">Because further proceedings are necessary, the district court may wish to reconsider whether it would be appropriate to recruit counsel to assist Winger. See <em>Pruitt v. Mote, </em>503 F.3d 647 (7th Cir.2007) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings. In light of this disposition, neither the suit nor the appeal counts as a \u201cstrike\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
