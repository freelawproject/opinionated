We grant leave to proceed IFP<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-19\">Upon de novo review of the dismissal, <em>see Moore v. Sims, </em>200 F.3d 1170, 1171 (8th Cir.2000) (per curiam) (standard of review), we agree that any claims Housley asserted that challenged his conviction\u2014 explicitly or implicitly\u2014were properly dismissed, <em>see Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 489-90, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973) (state prisoner challenging conviction on federal constitutional grounds is limited to habeas corpus); <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994) (when state prisoner seeks damages in \u00a7 1983 suit, district court must consider whether judgment would necessarily imply invalidity of conviction and, if it would, must dismiss case if plaintiff cannot demonstrate that conviction has already been invalidated), but we modify the dismissal of any such claims for damages to be without prejudice, <em>see Schafer v. Moore, </em>46 F.3d 43, 45 (8th Cir.1995) (per curiam) (dismissal under <em>Heck </em>of claims for damages should be without prejudice so plaintiff can refile if he satisfies <em>Heck </em>requirements).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-20\">We also agree that any other claims Housley raised which arose out of events preceding his conviction were properly dismissed on statute-of-limitations grounds. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2520(e) (civil action may not be commenced later than 2 years after date upon which claimant first has reasonable opportunity to discover violation); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1986 (1-year statute of limitations); Ark.Code. Ann. \u00a7 16-56-105 (3-year personal-injury statute of limitations); <em>Roach v. Owen, </em>689 F.2d 146, 146-47 (8th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Cir.1982) (per curiam) (state\u2019s general statute of limitations usually applies to civil rights suits; court properly applied Arkansas\u2019s 3-year statute of limitations to plaintiffs 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985 claim); <em>Miller v. Norris, 247 </em>F.3d 736, 739 (8th Cir.2001) (Arkansas 3-year personal injury statute of limitations applies to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action); <em>see also Myers v. Vogal, </em>960 F.2d 750, 751 (8th Cir.1992) (per curiam) (district court can dismiss IFP complaint under predecessor statute to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if it is apparent statute of limitations has run).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">We also affirm the dismissal of nousley\u2019s claims challenging his transfer and conditions of confinement, because Holley's allegations failed to state a claim on which relief may be granted. <em>See Helling v. McKinney, </em>509 U.S. 25, 35, 113 S.Ct. 2475, 125 L.Ed.2d 22 (1993) (prisoner states Eighth Amendment claim by alleging prison officials have, with deliberate indifference, exposed him to levels of ETS that pose unreasonable risk of serious damage to his future health); <em>Madewell v. Roberts, </em>909 F.2d 1203, 1207 (8th Cir.1990) (finding no protected liberty interest in particular prison classification status; stating elements of Eighth Amendment claim for compelled labor).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Finally, we find no reversible error by the district court in denying Housley\u2019s motion to amend his complaint to add allegations related to his parole status. <em>See Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal and Corr. Complex, 442 </em>U.S. 1, 9-11, 99 S.Ct. 2100, 60 L.Ed.2d 668 (1979) (statute that provides for possibility of parole does not create liberty interest protected by Due Process Clause); <em>Holloway v. Dobbs, </em>715 F.2d 390, 393 n. 3 (8th Cir.1983) (per cu-riam) (any error in district court denying plaintiff leave to amend complaint against defendant who had not served responsive pleading was harmless because amended complaint failed to state claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">In sum, the judgment is modified to reflect that, to the extent Housley has asserted Heck-barred claims for damages, they are dismissed without prejudice, and the judgment is affirmed as modified.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b503-16\">.
