Bivins, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>proceeding pro se, then filed on August 25, 2008, a motion for reconsideration of and a return of the filing fees paid to both the District Court and this Court in his original case. In his motion, he argued that the filing fee provisions of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d) did not apply to \u201chabeas corpus challenges to the parole procedures, such as the one petitioner filed\u201d in his original case. The District Court denied his motion on September 2, 2008, noting that this Court had held that Bivins\u2019 original complaint was, in fact, a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action, and not a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas corpus petition. Bivins then filed the instant appeal on October 3, 2008, and this Court granted his IFP motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">We have appellate jurisdiction over this appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and review it for possible dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). An appeal must be dismissed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if it has no arguable basis in law or fact. <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). Because we determine that the appeal is lacking in arguable legal merit, we will dismiss it under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The District Court is correct that this Court determined Bivins\u2019 original complaint was a \u00a7 1983 action. In our per curiam opinion, this Court stated: \u201cBivins argues that the District Court misconstrued his complaint and argues that the District Court \u2018sought to evade ... the real nature\u2019 of his cause of action by labeling it either a \u00a7 1983 or a \u00a7 2254 action. We disagree ... Here, the substance of Bivins\u2019 complaint indicates that the District Court properly construed it as filed pursuant to \u00a7 1983.\u201d Furthermore, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 makes clear that filing fees shall be assessed, and makes no provision for a refund of such fees. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b)(l)(\u201c[I]f a prisoner brings a civil action or files an appeal in forma pauperis, the prisoner shall be required to pay the full amount of a filing fee.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">As a result, we determine that Bivins\u2019 appeal is lacking in arguable legal merit, and will dismiss it pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
