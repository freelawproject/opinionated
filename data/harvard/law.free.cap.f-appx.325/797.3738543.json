We find no abuse of discretion and AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Anchico-Mosquera was sentenced in 1994 to life imprisonment for conspiring to possess crack cocaine with the intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and possessing crack cocaine with the intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Prior to trial, the government had filed an information and notice pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) and 851 advising that Anchico-Mosquera was subject to an enhanced mandatory sentence of life imprisonment because the amount of crack cocaine involved exceeded fifty grams and he had at least two prior felony drug convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">In March 2008, Anchico-Mosquera filed a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to modify his sentence based on Amendment 706. The district court concluded that Anchico-Mosquera was not eligible for a sentence reduction because Amendment 706 did not affect his mandatory minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">On appeal, Anchico-Mosquera argues his life sentence violated <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because no drug quantity was alleged in the indictment or proven to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. He also challenges his life sentence based on the government\u2019s allegedly defective \u00a7 851 notice of an enhanced penalty. Furthermore, Anchico-Mosquera maintains that the district court erroneously denied his \u00a7 3582(e)(2) motion without considering: (1) his rehabilitation efforts and other factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and (2) the racial disparity in the treatment of crack and powder cocaine offenses discussed in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">We review the denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for abuse of discretion and the district court\u2019s legal interpretations <em>de novo. See United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1338-39 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). Pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify a defendant\u2019s sentence that was based on a sentencing range that has been subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Amendment 706 is one such retroactive amendment that reduces the base offense levels in \u00a7 2D1.1 for certain crack cocaine offenses. <em>See, Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1339. A defendant is not eligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 706, however, if his sentence was based on something other than his base offense level in \u00a7 2D1.1, such as a statutory mandatory minimum. <em>See id. </em>Furthermore, because a sentencing adjustment under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not constitute a <em>de novo </em>resentencing, the district court must leave intact all original sentencing determinations except for the amended guideline range. <em>See United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-10\">It is undisputed that Anchico-Mosqu-era\u2019s life sentence was based on the statutory mandatory minimum term required under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), rather than his base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1. Amendment 706 thus did not lower his applicable guidelines range. Accordingly, the district court correctly denied his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion on this basis. <em>See Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1342 (concluding that Williams was not entitled to a sentence reduction under Amendment 706 because he was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum that replaced his original sentencing guideline range under \u00a7 2D1.1).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-11\">The remainder of Anchieo-Mosquera\u2019s contentions are without merit. First, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>district court correctly refused to reduce his sentence based on an alleged <em>Apprendi </em>violation. The plain language of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) only permits modifications to a sentence based on guideline amendments by the Sentencing Commission, not Supreme Court decisions. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1220 (concluding that <em>\u201cBooker </em>is inapplicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions\u201d because <em>\u201cBooker </em>is a Supreme Court decision, not a retroactively applicable guideline amendment by the Sentencing Commission\u201d). Second, Anchieo-Mosquera\u2019s \u201carguments regarding the deficiencies in his \u00a7 851 information are outside the scope of this proceeding, and we do not address them.\u201d <em>United States v. Fields, </em>300 Fed.Appx. 774, 777 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (unpublished); <em>see also United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.2000) (concluding that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u201cdoes not grant to the court jurisdiction to consider extraneous resentencing issues\u201d). Third, because Anchico-Mosquera was ineligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court had no need to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining whether to modify his sentence. Finally, we may not address the issue of racial disparity in crack cocaine sentences as <em>Kimbrough </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1193 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009) (concluding that <em>Kimbrough </em>only addressed the crack/powder disparity with respect to original sentencing proceedings as opposed to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">As Anchico-Mosquera\u2019s mandatory minimum sentence was not affected by Amendment 706, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
