According to the federal civil rights complaint Cosgrove subsequently filed in United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, he was locked in his cell when a fellow inmate commenced to beating one of the guards; the inmate handcuffed that guard behind his back, and dragged him around the day room by his arms. This inmate dropped his \u201chostage\u201d in front of Cosgrove\u2019s cell and that\u2019s where the inmate was standing when the \u201cC.E.R.T.\u201d team came running onto the cell block.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> C.E.R.T. Officer Cap-pachella opened fire on the inmate, missing him, but hitting Cosgrove in the shoulder and neck. Cosgrove alleged in his complaint that he had permanent damage to his left shoulder and he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of Officer Cappaehella\u2019s unconstitutional use of excessive force. He sought money damages in the amount of $3.5 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-13\">The Magistrate Judge filed a Report and Recommendation, in which she concluded that Cosgrove\u2019s <em>in forma pauperis </em>complaint should be dismissed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to exhaust administrative remedies as required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). The form civil complaint completed and filed by Cosgrove asked him to state whether there was a prisoner grievance procedure at the institution, and Cosgrove checked the \u201cYes\u201d box. He then answered in the negative subsequent questions concerning whether he had pursued those prison remedies, explaining that: \u201cThe grievance system wouldn\u2019t help or change the fact that I have permanent damage to my body.\u201d (Complaint, \u00b6 V(D)). In the alternative, the Magistrate Judge concluded that the complaint failed to state an Eighth Amendment claim because the allegations made clear that there was a justifiable need for the use of force in that a guard had been assaulted and taken hostage by a prisoner. <em>See Whitley v. Albers, </em>475 U.S. 312, 320-21, 106 S.Ct. 1078, 89 L.Ed.2d 251 (1986). <em>See also Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 7, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> More to the point, the Magistrate Judge concluded, the Eighth Amendment does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>not encompass an excessive force claim by a bystander who was inadvertently harmed. The harm to Cosgrove was inadvertent in that Officer Cappachella did not intend to shoot <em>him. </em>Finally, the Magistrate Judge rejected any attempt by Cos-grove to bring the claim under the Due Process clause, concluding that the claim, if valid at all, would have to be brought under the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Cosgrove filed Objections to the Report and Recommendation, in which he stated that he did not file a grievance at the county prison because he was in the hospital for a time, and, once released, he did not think filing a grievance would solve the problems of the permanent damage to his body and mental health. In an order entered on September 8, 2008, the District Court dismissed the complaint and adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation as the Opinion of the Court. Cosgrove appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Our Clerk advised Cosgrove that his appeal was subject to summary affirmance under Third Cir. LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6. He was invited to submit argument in writing, but he has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">We will summarily affirm under Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6, because it clearly appears that no substantial question is presented by this appeal. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. The <em>in forma pauperis </em>statute, under which Cosgrove was proceeding, provides that: \u201cthe court shall dismiss the case at any time if the court determines that ... the action or appeal ... fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). Congress has provided that: \u201cNo action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). A prisoner must exhaust administrative remedies pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a) prior to bringing suit. <em>See Booth v. Churner, </em>532 U.S. 731, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">\u201cEven when the prisoner seeks relief not available in grievance proceedings, notably money damages, exhaustion is a prerequisite to suit.\u201d <em>Porter v. Nussle, </em>534 U.S. 516, 524, 122 S.Ct. 983, 152 L.Ed.2d 12 (2002) (citing <em>Booth, </em>532 U.S. at 741, 121 S.Ct. 1819). Congress enacted this requirement to afford correctional officials the opportunity to address complaints internally and to take corrective action, and, for cases that ultimately wind up in court, the requirement allows for the development of an administrative record that should clarify the controversy. <em>Porter, </em>534 U.S. at 525, 122 S.Ct. 983. This \u201cexhaustion requirement applies to all inmate suits about prison life, whether they involve general circumstances or particular episodes, and whether they allege excessive force or some other wrong.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 532, 122 S.Ct. 983. Cosgrove stated in his complaint that the Cambria County Prison has a grievance system, and he admits that he voluntarily declined to make use of it. He did not allege in either his Complaint or Objections that he was prevented from using the grievance process, <em>cf. Brown v. Croak, </em>312 F.3d 109, 110 (3d Cir.2002) (assuming that prisoner with failure to protect claim is entitled to rely on instruction by prison officials to wait for outcome of internal security investigation before filing grievance), or that it was somehow not available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>Failure to comply with the requirement to first exhaust administrative remedies thus necessitated dismissal of Cosgrove\u2019s action without prejudice to the merits of his claim. Because we reach this conclusion, we do not reach the District Court\u2019s alternate determination that Cosgrove\u2019s Eighth Amendment, or, in the alternative, substantive due process, claim had no arguable legal merit. However, we doubt whether the Eighth Amendment claim would be subject to dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">We will summarily affirm the order of the District Court to the extent the complaint was dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b81-10\">. We assume \"C.E.R.T.\u201d is an emergency response team of some sort, although the Complaint does not specifically say so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b81-11\">. In assessing a prisoner\u2019s claim that excessive force was used in violation of the Eighth Amendment, courts are required to focus on \"whether force was applied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.\u201d <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 6-7, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992). Several factors must be considered in applying this test, including: (1) the need for the application of force; (2) the relationship between the need and the amount of force used; (3) the extent of injury inflicted; (4) the extent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>threat to the safety of staff and inmates, as reasonably perceived by responsible officials on the basis of the facts known to them; and (5) any efforts made to temper the severity of a forceful response. <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Kyler, 204 </em>F.3d 102, 106 (3d Cir.2000) (citing <em>Whitley v. Alb-ers, </em>475 U.S. 312, 321, 106 S.Ct. 1078, 89 L.Ed.2d 251 (1986)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b83-14\">. <em>Whitley, </em>475 U.S. 312, 106 S.Ct. 1078, involved a suit by an inmate who was shot during the quelling of a prison riot. He had not been active in the riot and had in fact tried to help. The Supreme Court observed that *\u2018[i]t is obduracy and wantonness, not inadvertence or error in good faith, that characterize the conduct prohibited by the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause.\" <em>Id. </em>at 319, 106 S.Ct. 1078. \"[D]eference extends to a prison security measure taken in response to an actual confrontation with riotous inmates ...,\u201d but \u2018\u2018[i]t does not insulate from review actions taken in bad faith and for no legitimate purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 322, 106 S.Ct. 1078. Therefore, the factors we identified in <em>Brooks, </em>204 F.3d at 106, would have to be considered.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
