(\u201cFicus Farm\u201d), a nursery located in Loxahatchee Florida, appeals from the district court\u2019s August 27, 2008, 2008 WL 4057741, order granting final summary judgment to United States Department of Agriculture-Risk Management Agency (\u201cRMA\u201d) et al. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>suit arose out of an insurer\u2019s decision not to indemnify Ficus Farm for part of its claimed nursery losses. Ficus Farm had claimed an insurance loss of palms, ferns, Jessamine and Veriegated Ginger plants due to excessive moisture following a series of storms in 2005. The RMA reviewed the insurer\u2019s decision and upheld the insurer\u2019s partial denial of Ficus Farm\u2019s claim because the owner of Ficus Farm (1) had misrepresented material facts to the insurer; (2) had destroyed certain crops without the written permission of the insurer in violation of the policy; and (3) had failed to mitigate its losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">The district court upheld the agency determination, concluding that there was substantial evidence to support each of the agency\u2019s findings, and its conclusion. After thorough review, we affirm the final order of summary judgment based on the district court\u2019s well-reasoned and thorough opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
