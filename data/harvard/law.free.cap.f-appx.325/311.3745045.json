Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Braymiller began working for Lowe\u2019s in August 2002 as an assistant store manager at age 59. He was promoted to store manager of a store in San Antonio, Texas, in March 2004 by human resources director Terry Gillespie and district manager Steve Jordan. Medina, in his 40s, replaced Jordan as district manager in June 2005. Although Braymiller\u2019s performance reviews improved under Medina, Braymil-ler claimed that Medina began calling him \u201cyoung man,\u201d \u201cboy,\u201d and \u201cson\u201d in front of Braymiller\u2019s subordinates</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">In December 2005, Braymiller brought his wife to look at items for their new home and to take advantage of the 20 percent seasonal employee discount. Braymiller\u2019s wife picked out a dishwasher and an oven from the clearance isle. The dishwasher was priced at $716 and the oven was priced at $636. Braymiller spoke to the manager on duty and his subordinate, Scott Decker, about receiving an additional discount. Decker quoted $400 for each item, a 50 percent discount. Decker later testified that he would not have given this price to a customer and that he believed this was the price Bray-miller was expecting him to quote. Decker processed the transaction using his manager override for the discount.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Two days later, Braymiller asked administrative manager Chris Luke to refund Braymiller an additional 20 percent as part of the seasonal employee discount. To do this, Luke needed a manager override code. A transaction report, signed off by Braymiller the next day, showed that the transaction was completed under Braymil-ler\u2019s login and with his scan card and override code. This would mean that Braymiller was the customer, cashier, and manager for this purchase. It is a violation of Lowe\u2019s policy for an employee to use his own scan card to unlock the price on his personal transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">A store loss prevention manager looked into the purchase and discount a few days later and reported the incident to his superior. The district loss prevention manager opened an investigation and gave the report to the regional loss prevention manager, James Rodriguez. Braymiller attempted to alter the report, but after learning that he could not, Braymiller brought the situation to Medina\u2019s attention. In this conversation, Braymiller acknowledged that his scan card had been used but stated that he had either been in front of the register or in his office at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">Braymiller then asked Decker to prepare a statement about the incident. Braymiller admitted that he may have told Decker to keep the statement short and to write that Braymiller did not influence him. The statement from Decker asserted that the price quoted to Braymiller would have been given to a customer and that Braymiller did not pressure him. Later, in his deposition given under oath, Decker indicated neither statement was true.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-13\">Braymiller was told that he was under investigation. In response, he prepared a statement that said that he had been in his office when Luke processed the refund. Medina, Gillespie, and Rodriguez viewed a closed circuit video of the transactions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Based on the evidence in the video, Medina believed that Braymiller had not been truthful. During his deposition, Braymil-ler admitted he was present when the refund was processed but claimed this was an honest error of recollection. Both Braymiller and Decker were brought in to discuss the situation with Medina, Gillespie, and regional vice president Don Stall-ings. After the interview, these men decided to terminate Braymiller. No one made age-related comments during the interviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Gillespie prepared the paperwork for Braymiller\u2019s termination, listing the reason for the termination as \u201cViolation of Lowe\u2019s Code of Ethics: personal conduct, to avoid transactions and situations in which your interests conflict or could be viewed as conflicting with those of Lowe\u2019s.\u201d Bray-miller was informed on January 20, 2006. Gillespie testified that he terminated Bray-miller because he used his position to obtain an improper discount, involved subordinates in the transaction, and showed poor judgment during the investigation. Medina testified that the basis for termination was that Braymiller rang up his own merchandise and that it was not a price available to customers. Medina also agreed with the termination because he felt that Braymiller had been dishonest about what happened during the refund transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Braymiller brought the current action based on diversity jurisdiction alleging age discrimination under the TCHRA. He appeals from the district court\u2019s adverse summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Cousin v. Small, </em>325 F.3d 627, 637 (5th Cir.2003). Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.\u201d <em>Hathaway v. Bazany, </em>507 F.3d 312, 319 (5th Cir.2007) (quoting Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">Braymiller\u2019s claims were brought solely under the TCHRA. The TCHRA requires Braymiller to demonstrate that \u201cage ... was a motivating factor for an employment practice, even if other factors also motivated the practice.\u201d Tex. Lab.Code \u00a7 21.125(a). Because one of TCHRA\u2019s purposes was to \u201cprovide for the execution of the policies of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its subsequent amendments,\u201d Tex. Lab.Code \u00a7 21.001(1), Texas courts have looked to \u201canalogous federal statutes and the cases interpreting them guide [their] reading of the TCHRA.\u201d <em>Quantum Chem. Corp. v. Toennies, </em>47 S.W.3d 473, 476 (Tex.2001). The resulting analysis has been indistinguishable from the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting framework, as modified in light of <em>Desert Palace. See id. </em>at 476-477.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">A prima facie claim for age discrimination requires proof that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-12\">(1) he was discharged; (2) he was qualified for the position; (3) he was within the protected class at the time of discharge; and (4) he was either i) replaced by someone outside the protected class, ii) replaced by someone younger, or iii) otherwise discharged because of his age.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-13\"><em>Machinchick v. PB Power, Inc., </em>398 F.3d 345, 350 (5th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Rachid v. Jack in the Box, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 305, 309 (5th Cir.2004)). Once Braymiller establishes a prima facie case, the burden of production shifts to Lowe\u2019s to proffer a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its employment action. Both parties agreed below that Braymiller had established a prima facie case and that Lowe\u2019s provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>a non-discriminatory reason for his termination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Braymiller then had the burden to produce evidence \u201ctending to show that the reason offered by the defendant is pretext for discrimination.\u201d <em>Machinchick, </em>398 F.3d at 350. The Texas Supreme Court has held that \u201cthe discrimination need only be \u2018a motivating factor\u2019 in the adverse employment decision to establish liability\u201d in TCHRA unlawful employment practice claims. <em>Pineda v. UPS, </em>360 F.3d 483, 488 (5th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Quantum Chem. Corp. v. Toennies, </em>47 S.W.3d 473, 476 (Tex.2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The district court found that Braymiller did not provide sufficient evidence to rebut Lowe\u2019s articulated reasons for termination. Because Braymiller also provided no evidence that Medina treated him differently than others outside the protected class or that Medina\u2019s \u201cstray remarks\u201d were in any way related to his discharge, the district court granted Lowe\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">On appeal, Braymiller argues that Lowe\u2019s justifications are inconsistent and baseless. Braymiller points to two allegedly different justifications stated in his termination paperwork: Lowe\u2019s stated that Braymiller was fired for \u201cviolation of company policy\u201d in one document and \u201ccode of ethics\u201d in a different document. Braymiller also contends that Lowe\u2019s briefing on summary judgment in the district court shifted between its first brief, which centered around the refund transaction as the cause of his being fired, and its reply brief, which centered around his conduct during the investigation. Finally, Braymiller argues that the district court erred by requiring him to provide evidence of age animus in addition to his strong prima facie case and the evidence of pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">These arguments are unconvincing. The justification from Lowe\u2019s employees has always concerned the same events. The supposed inconsistencies to which Braymiller refers are at best a change in emphasis regarding which violation of company policy they believed was more important in the final decision to discharge him. Varying explanations are not necessarily inconsistent. The motivating factor here was Braymiller\u2019s purchase of two items at a heavily discounted price and his actions during the resulting investigation. At no point has Braymiller produced evidence that would tend to show that these events were a pretext for age-related discrimination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">Braymiller is also unable to cite analogous case law. Braymiller relies heavily on <em>Taylor v. County Bancshares, Inc,, </em>325 F.Supp.2d 755 (E.D.Tex.2004). In <em>Taylor, </em>the court found that an employer\u2019s termination justifications were self-contradictory. One decision maker testified that the plaintiffs department had been eliminated because it was unprofitable. A second decision maker testified that this was not the reason he had eliminated the department. We have no directly contradictory statements here. Instead, Gillespie and Medina agreed that Braymiller\u2019s termination stemmed from these events; they differed only in emphasis as to which policy violation was more important.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Braymiller argues that Lowe\u2019s explanation is subjective and does not qualify as a nondiscriminatory reason. <em>See Patrick v. Ridge, </em>394 F.3d 311, 316 (5th Cir.2004). Lowe\u2019s asserts that Braymiller\u2019s improper purchase and conduct during the resulting investigation showed a lack of ethics. Braymiller criticizes this as a \u201ccontent-less and non-specific statement, such as the candidate is not \u2018sufficiently suited\u2019 for the position [that] is not specific enough to meet defendant employer\u2019s burden.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 317. On the contrary, Lowe\u2019s conclusion stems from specific misconduct and violations of the ethics code.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Braymiller provides several record citations in an attempt to prove that Lowe\u2019s was incorrect about whether his actions violated company policy concerning available discounts. This court, however, does not try \u201cthe validity of good faith beliefs as to an employee\u2019s competence.\u201d <em>Little v. Republic Refining Co., </em>924 F.2d 93, 97 (5th Cir.1991). Further, this court \u201ccannot protect older employees from erroneous or even arbitrary personnel decisions, but only from decisions which are unlawfully motivated.\u201d <em>Bienkowski v. Am. Airlines Inc., </em>851 F.2d 1503, 1508 (5th Cir.1988). Thus, as the district court noted, even if factual disputes surrounding the amount of the discounts are resolved in appellant\u2019s favor, and in the unlikely event that Lowe\u2019s management erred in concluding that Braymiller\u2019s conduct violated company ethics standards, no evidence supports a conclusion that these management mistakes were pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Because there is no evidence that Lowe\u2019s proffered explanations were pre-textual, and offered in an effort to obscure an age-motivated decision, the judgment of the district court granting summary judgment to Lowe\u2019s is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b339-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b342-8\">. Braymiller argues that he \u201cdid nothing of the sort,\u201d but \"merely stated what Lowe's had <em>claimed </em>to be such a reason.\u201d Because Bray-miller does not argue that this reason in and of itself was discriminatory, we assume that Braymiller has acknowledged that this articulated reason was not discriminatory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b342-13\">. We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that Medina's stray remarks referring to subordinates (often in Spanish) as \u201cboy\u201d or \u201cson\u201d are not probative of age discriminatory animus here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
