The district court denied Glass\u2019s petition based on its finding that his claim was procedurally defaulted and that his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel did not establish cause and prejudice to overcome the default. The district court granted a certificate of appealability as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-25\">On appeal, Glass argues that he satisfied the cause-and-prejudice test to overcome the procedural default because he received ineffective assistance of counsel when his counsel failed to raise his claim on appeal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>Specifically, he argues that he was prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s performance because the state\u2019s introduction of the testimony that he requested an attorney negatively impacted his character and credibility, the sole basis of his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">\u201cWhen examining a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition, we review questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact <em>de novo, </em>and findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>Porter v. Attorney General, </em>552 F.8d 1260, 1267 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Under the doctrine of procedural default, \u201c[fjederal courts are barred from reaching the merits of a state prisoner\u2019s federal habeas claim where the petitioner has failed to comply with an independent and adequate state procedural rule.\u201d <em>Siebert v. Allen, </em>455 F.3d 1269, 1271 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cA petitioner may obtain federal review of a procedurally defaulted claim if he can show both cause for the default and actual prejudice resulting from the default.\u201d <em>Jones v. Campbell, </em>436 F.3d 1285, 1304 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">\u201cCause exists if there was some objective factor external to the defense that impeded counsel\u2019s efforts to comply with the State\u2019s procedural rule.\u201d <em>Mize v. Hall, </em>532 F.3d 1184, 1190 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation and alteration omitted), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Jan. 23, 2009) (No. OS-8359). To establish prejudice, a petitioner \u201cmust shoulder the burden of showing, not merely that the errors at his trial created a <em>possibility </em>of prejudice, but that they worked to his <em>actual </em>and substantial disadvantage, infecting his entire trial with error of constitutional dimensions.\u201d <em>United States v. Frady, </em>456 U.S. 152, 170, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 1596, 71 L.Ed.2d 816, (1982) (\u00a7 2255 case); <em>see also Murray v. Carrier, 477 </em>U.S. 478, 494, 106 S.Ct. 2639, 2648, 91 L.Ed.2d 397 (1986) (describing the <em>Frady </em>standard by stating, \u201c[s]uch a showing of pervasive actual prejudice can hardly be thought to constitute anything other than a showing that the prisoner was denied \u2018fundamental fairness\u2019 at trial.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">\u201cA petitioner can establish cause by showing that a procedural default was caused by constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel under <em>Strickland v. Washington.\u201d Payne v. Allen, </em>539 F.3d 1297, 1314 (11th Cir.) (quotation omitted), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Dec. 15, 2008) (No. 08-8823). In <em>Strickland, </em>the Supreme Court set out a two-part inquiry for ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). To obtain relief under <em>Strickland, </em>a petitioner must show that (1) his counsel\u2019s performance was constitutionally deficient, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced him. <em>See id. </em>A habeas petitioner must satisfy both prongs of the <em>Strickland </em>test. <em>Butcher v. United States, </em>368 F.3d 1290, 1293 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">In <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201cuse for impeachment purposes of petitioners\u2019 silence, at the time of arrest and after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings, violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d 426 U.S. 610, 619, 96 S.Ct.- 2240, 2245, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976). In <em>Wainwright v. Greenfield, </em>474 U.S. 284, 295, 106 S.Ct. 634, 640-41, 88 L.Ed.2d 623 (1986), \u201c[t]he Court later extended this protection to <em>post-Miranda </em>invocations of the right to counsel.\u201d <em>Fugate v. Head, </em>261 F.3d 1206, 1222 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cIf the prosecution violated the <em>Greenfield </em>standard, then we must determine whether that error had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1222-23 (quotation omitted). This is the harmless-error standard applicable to <em>Doyle </em>and <em>Greenfield </em>violations. <em>See id.; Hill v. Turpin, </em>135 F.3d 1411, 1416-17 (11th Cir.1998) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>(applying this \u201charmless error standard\u201d in the context of a <em>Doyle </em>violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">Because we conclude from the record that the evidence of Glass\u2019s guilt was overwhelming, any error the state made at trial in eliciting that he had invoked his right to counsel was harmless. Therefore, Glass failed to establish prejudice under the cause-and-prejudice test for us to review his procedurally defaulted claim. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment denying habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
