On appeal, Murell argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his \u00a7 8582(c)(2) motion because it failed to adequately consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and based its decision on his criminal history as a teenager and young adult. Murell further argues that the district court incorrectly characterized his previous criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment \u201cin the case of a defendant who [was] sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">In considering a defendant\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court must engage in a two-part analysis: first, the court must recalculate the sentence under the amended guidelines; second, the court must decide whether, in its discretion, it will choose to impose a new sentence or retain the original sentence. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780-81 (11th Cir.2000). The second part of the analysis \u201cshould be made in light of the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">In the instant case, the district court recalculated the guideline range under the amended guidelines. Furthermore, the record demonstrates that in denying Mu-rell\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, specifically, the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant, and the need to protect the public. On this record, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Murell\u2019s motion. Accordingly, we affirm the order denying Murell\u2019s motion for reduction of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
