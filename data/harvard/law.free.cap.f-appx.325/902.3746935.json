California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Our independent review of the entire record reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is correct. Because independent examination of the entire record reveals no issues of arguable merit, counsel\u2019s motion to -withdraw is GRANTED, and the district court\u2019s denial of relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
