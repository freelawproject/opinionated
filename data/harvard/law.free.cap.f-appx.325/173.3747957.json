Barnes\u2019 attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), concluding that there were no meritorious issues for appeal but questioning the length of the supervised release term. Although informed of his right to do so, Barnes has not filed a pro se supplemental brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-22\">When a court revokes supervised release and imposes a term of imprisonment, it may also reimpose a term of supervised release. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(h) (2006). \u201cThe length of such a term of supervised release shall not exceed the term of supervised release authorized by statute for the offense that resulted in the original term of supervised release, less any term of imprisonment that was imposed upon revocation of supervised release.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, when the district court revoked Barnes\u2019 supervised release and imposed an active prison term of eight months, it had the authority to impose up to fifty-two months of supervised release (sixty month statutory maximum based upon Barnes\u2019 underlying convictions minus eight months). <em>See United States v. Maxwell, </em>285 F.3d 336, 342 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-23\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record in this case and found no meritorious issues for review. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the Unit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>ed States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
