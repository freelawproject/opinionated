He moves this court for the appointment of counsel and to have his case remanded for a jury trial before a different judge in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-19\">The district court is directed to dismiss a complaint filed by a prisoner if the complaint is frivolous or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1915A(b)(l). Because Bridgewater\u2019s claims were dismissed pursuant to Section 1915A, this court\u2019s review is <em>de novo. Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005). A complaint is frivolous \u201cif it lacks an arguable basis in fact or law.\u201d <em>Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-20\">This appeal involves Bridgewater\u2019s claims that prison officials were deliberately indifferent to his claims that his life was endangered following a fight with a gang-affiliated fellow inmate, and that this deliberate indifference resulted in physical harm to him. Contrary to Bridgewater\u2019s assertions that prison officials totally ignored the danger to his life, prison officials moved Bridgewater to a new housing pod <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>where the inmate with whom Bridgewater fought was not housed. There is no evidence in the record that the prison officials who changed Bridgewater\u2019s housing assignment actually inferred from the facts stated by Bridgewater that Bridgewater faced a substantial risk of harm from other gang members as a result of the fight. Absent evidence of such an inference and in light of prison officials\u2019 attempt to protect Bridgewater by changing his housing assignment, Bridgewater\u2019s deliberate indifference claims were correctly dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 882-34, 837, 844, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994); <em>Hare v. City of Corinth, </em>74 F.3d 633, 649 (5th Cir.1996) (en banc); <em>Oliver v. Collins, </em>914 F.2d 56, 60 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">The dismissal of Bridgewater\u2019s complaint is affirmed, and his outstanding motions are denied. For purposes of the three-strikes provision of Section 1915(g), the district court\u2019s dismissal under Section 1915A counts as a strike. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir. 1996). Accordingly, Bridgewater is warned that if he accumulates three strikes he may not thereafter proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">AFFIRMED; ALL OUTSTANDING MOTIONS DENIED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b389-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
