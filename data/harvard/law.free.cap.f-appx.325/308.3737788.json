Carter argues that the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence because it failed to consider the impact of his age for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He also contends that the sentence is unreasonable because in denying the Government\u2019s motion for a downward departure based on substantial assistance, the court failed to accord substantial weight to the Government\u2019s evaluation of his assistance and the court failed to take into account the nature and circumstances of the offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, p.s.; \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Pursuant to <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), this court\u2019s review of the substantive reasonableness of a sentence ordinarily is for an abuse of discretion. As Carter essentially concedes, however, his arguments challenging the reasonableness of his sentence, raised for the first time on appeal, are reviewable only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). This court has no jurisdiction to review a refusal to depart downward unless the refusal was based on the district court\u2019s mistaken conclusion that it lacked the authority to depart, a circumstance not present here. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>457 F.3d 416, 424 (5th Cir.2006). We retain jurisdiction to review \u201cwhether the district court\u2019s imposition of a guideline sentence instead of a non-guideline sentence was reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d 371, 375 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 163, 169 L.Ed.2d 112 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">When the district court imposes a sentence within a properly calculated' guidelines range and gives proper weight to the Guidelines and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, this court gives \u201cgreat deference to that sentence and will infer that the judge has considered all the factors for a fair sentence set forth in the Guidelines in light of the sentencing considerations set out in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008). \u201cA discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-13\">In imposing the within-guidelines sentence, the district court stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and expressly considered Carter\u2019s cooperation with the Government. Although Carter argues that the district court failed to consider that offenders at his age of 44 years have a low risk of recidivism, 12.7 per cent, he has not shown that the statistics he relies upon accurately reflect whether he posed a risk of recidivism, particularly in light of his extensive criminal history. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>553 F.3d 380, 397 (5th Cir.2008). Moreover, the results of the study he cites reveal that while the total recidivism rate for offenders aged 41 to 50 was 12.7 per cent, the recidivism rate for that age range for offenders in criminal history category VI, Carter\u2019s criminal his<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>tory category, was 41.3 percent.

Carter has not overcome the presumption that his within-guidelines sentence is reasonable, see <em>Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 554, or shown that the district court abused its discretion under <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596-97. Carter has shown no error, plain or otherwise. <em>See Peltier, </em>505 F.3d at 391-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b336-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
