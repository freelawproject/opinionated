Wright Construction Company (Wright) appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of its action against the Laborer\u2019s International Union of North America, Local Union No. 169 (Union). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-24\">Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we do not supply them here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>except as necessary to explain our decision. We review a district court\u2019s legal conclusion that Plaintiffs repudiation of the agreement was not valid de novo. <em>Laborers Health and Welfare for Northern California v. Westlake Development, </em>53 F.3d 979 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The National Labor Relations Board held in <em>John Deklewa &amp; Sons, </em>282 NLRB 1375 (1987), <em>enf. </em>843 F.2d 770 (3d Cir.1988), that an employer cannot repudiate a Section 8(f) prehire agreement midterm. Wright does not fit into the limited \u201csingle employee exception\u201d to this rule, as interpreted by the Ninth Circuit, because Wright has conceded that it employed two laborers contemporaneously during the term of the contract. <em>Laborers Health </em>holds that in order to fit into the limited single employee exception, the employer must be \u201ca \u2018one-employee employer\u2019 during the relevant time period.\u2019 \u201d <em>Laborers Health, </em>53 F.3d at 982. The district court did not err in determining that Wright\u2019s repudiation was not valid, and dismissing the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b582-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b582-15\">. The Union asserts in its brief that we should also review the trial court\u2019s order denying confirmation and vacating the arbitration award. The Union failed to appeal this order; it also failed to appeal or cross-appeal from the final judgment which was entered in this case. An appellee who fails to file a cross-appeal cannot attack a judgment with a view towards enlarging its own rights. <em>Turpen v.
