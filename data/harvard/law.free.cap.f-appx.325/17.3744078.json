Mar. 11, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-15\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). Here, we find that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Chipilo\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-16\">A motion to reopen must be filed within ninety days after the date on which a final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). However, the time limitation will not apply to a motion to reopen proceedings to apply for asylum \u201cbased on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-17\">Here, it is undisputed that Chipilo\u2019s November 2007 motion to reopen was not filed within ninety days of the BIA\u2019s September 2003 final order of removal. The BIA found that Chipilo had not provided evidence that Baptists in Belarus face a greater threat than at the time of his hearing. Although Chipilo argues that the 2005 amendment to the Belarus Criminal Code represents a change in circumstances, he fails to explain how this affects the situation of Baptists in particular. Because Chipilo does not indicate anything in the record that demonstrates a change in country conditions that is material to his claim of religious persecution, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion to reopen on that basis. <em>See Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>To the extent that Chipilo argues that his proceedings should be reopened to consider his claim of a well-founded fear of persecution on account of the Belarusian government\u2019s awareness of his application for asylum in the United States, the BIA found that: (1) he had not provided a new application or statement articulating his new claim; (2) the U.S. Embassy did not disclose information sufficient to give rise to a reasonable inference that he had applied for asylum; and (3) his evidence could have been produced during his hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">We find that the BIA properly relied on Chipilo\u2019s failure to provide \u201ca new application or his own personal statement articulating this new risk of persecution\u201d as one of the grounds on which to base its denial of his motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). Moreover, even if Chipilo had demonstrated that the consular investigation regarding the authenticity of his \u201cpsychiatric certificate\u201d violated 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.6, he failed to establish that the investigation gave rise to a reasonable inference that he had applied for asylum. <em>See Zhen Nan Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>459 F.3d 255, 264-65 (2d Cir.2006). Consequently, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Chipilo\u2019s motion to reopen based on his fear of persecution under the 2005 amendment to the Belarus Criminal Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Although the BIA\u2019s finding that the evidence provided in support of this claim could have been produced at the time of the hearing is erroneous, considering the date of the 2005 amendment, we decline to remand as we can \u201cconfidently predict\u201d that the BIA would reach the same decision absent the error that was made. <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 339 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
