We dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">We generally review only the BIA\u2019s decision except to the extent that the immigration judge\u2019s (IJ) decision influences the BIA. <em>Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 593 (5th Cir.2007). We lack jurisdiction to review the denial of Escamilla\u2019s requests for relief because he is removable for having committed criminal offenses involving moral turpitude. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), 1252(a)(2)(C); <em>Danso v. Gonzales, </em>489 F.3d 709, 712 (5th Cir.2007). Moreover, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, we are statutorily barred from reviewing the BIA\u2019s purely discretionary denial of cancellation of removal. <em>Sung v. Keisler, </em>505 F.3d 372, 377 (5th Cir.2007); <em>Rueda v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 831, 831 (5th Cir.2004). To the extent that Escamilla challenges the disere-tionary denial of his requests for relief, we dismiss his petition for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-14\">In addition, because Escamilla conceded to his removability under \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) and (a)(6)(E)\u00ae, we need not consider his argument that the Government did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that he was also removable pursuant to \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)\u00ae. <em>See Flores-Garza v. INS, </em>328 F.3d 797, 802-03 (5th Cir.2003). Escamilla\u2019s attempt to confer jurisdiction in this court by claiming that the IJ committed legal error and violated his due process rights by \u201cfailing to appropriately exercise discretion and follow the controlling case law\u201d is unavailing. Our review of the record reveals that both the IJ and the BIA undertook a comprehensive and reasoned analysis of Escamilla\u2019s case and also appropriately weighed both the positive and negative equities before exercising the discretion to deny relief. We reject Escamilla\u2019s attempt to recast what amounts to a disagreement with the weighing and consideration of the relevant factors by the IJ and the BIA as either a constitutional or legal issue. <em>See Hadwani v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 798, 801 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Assaad v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 471, 475-76 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-15\">DISMISSED FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b419-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
