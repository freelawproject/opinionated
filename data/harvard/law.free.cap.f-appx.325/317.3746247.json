The district court\u2019s ruling relied upon its time-bar dismissal of Koumjian\u2019s prior federal habeas petition filed in 2005. The appeal from that dismissal, however, remains pending in this court. <em>See Koum-jian v. Quarterman, </em>No. 06-51492. Accordingly, Koumjian has shown \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Woollard v. United States, </em>416 F.2d 50, 51 (5th Cir.1968). Koumjian\u2019s motion for a COA is GRANTED, the judgment of the district court is VACATED, and this case is REMANDED for proceedings consistent with this ruling. Koumjian\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b346-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
