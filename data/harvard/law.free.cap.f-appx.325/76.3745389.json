One count charged Santos-Almonte with conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B), and the other count charged him with attempted possession with the intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B). The District Court, after concluding that Santos-Almonte had a criminal history category of I and a total offense level of 23, determined that his guidelines range was 46 to 57 months. The offense level took into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>account a 3-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b) and a 2-level downward adjustment by reason of Santos-Almonte\u2019s minor participant role pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). Santos-Almonte, however, sought both a variance and a departure from the guideline range, but the District Court, in determinations that Santos-Almonte does not challenge on this appeal, rejected these requests and imposed concurrent 46-month custodial sentences to be followed by concurrent four-year terms of supervised release on each of the two counts. On this appeal Santos-Almonte challenges the District Court\u2019s refusal to decrease his offense level by 4 levels under U.S.S.G \u00a7 3B1.2(a) rather than 2 levels on the basis of his contention that his role in the offenses was that of a minimal rather than minor participant.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The District Court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231 and we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(1). The Government contends that we review the District Court\u2019s determination that Santos-Almonte was a minor as opposed to a minimal participant on a clear error standard as the Court predicated its determination on a factual basis. <em>See United States v. Carr, 25 </em>F.3d 1194, 1207 (3d Cir.1994). On the other hand, Santos-Almonte contends that his \u201crole in the offense involves both a legal interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines and factual determinations,\u201d appellant\u2019s br. at 13, and that \u201ca mixed standard of review is employed,\u201d <em>id., </em>meaning plenary review of the legal component and clear error review of the factual component of the review. <em>See United States v. Isaza-Zapata, </em>148 F.3d 236, 237 (3d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Regardless of which standard of review is applicable, we will affirm. We agree with the Government\u2019s description of the case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-7\">Defendant was not simply a one-time drug courier without any appreciation for the scope of the overall drug conspiracy. Rather, over a ten-month period, defendant helped facilitate cocaine deliveries in FedEx packages to particular addresses in Southern Delaware. He also transported large quantities of cocaine on multiple occasions, and he sent large amounts of United States currency via FedEx to his co-conspirator\u2019s drug source in Laredo, Texas.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">Appellee\u2019s br. at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">In these circumstances Santos-Al-monte\u2019s role in the offenses, whether viewed from a factual or legal perspective, cannot be regarded as minimal even though other persons may have played a larger role in the conspiracy. Indeed, it appears that the District Court\u2019s treatment of Santos-Almonte\u2019s role as minor was, if anything, generous to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">The judgment of conviction and sentences entered November 20, 2007, will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
