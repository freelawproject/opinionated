An immigration judge has authority over applications for relief under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1240.1(a)(l)(ii), 1245.2(a)(1). An 1-130 visa does not automatically establish the bona fides of a marriage in the context of removal proceedings. <em>See Agyeman v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 871, 879 (9th Cir.2002) (\u2018While an [approved] I 130 establishes <em>eligibility </em>for status, the Attorney General\u2014or in the context of deportation proceedings, the IJ\u2014must still decide to accord the status.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-11\">\u201cThis court retains jurisdiction over petitions for review that raise colorable constitutional claims or questions of law.\u201d <em>Bazua-Cota v. Gonzales, </em>466 F.3d 747, 748 (9th Cir.2006) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D)). In the absence of constitutional claims or questions of law, however, the immigration judge\u2019s decision to deny petitioner\u2019s application for adjustment of status is a discretionary determination that is unreviewable. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Bazua-Cota, </em>466 F.3d at 748-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b600-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
