Middlebrooks, a federal prisoner convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 5 kilograms or more of a substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine and 50 grams or more of a substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine base (\u201ccrack cocaine\u201d), in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(A)(ii), and (b)(l)(A)(iii), proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>reduction of his sentence, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The district court reduced Middlebrooks\u2019s sentence to the low end of his amended guideline range based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced the offense levels associated with certain crack cocaine offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-16\">On appeal, Middlebrooks generally argues that the district court erred by not reducing his sentence below the low end of his amended guideline range based on the advisory nature of the guidelines. Middle-brooks also argues that the government\u2019s attempt to limit a reduction to only two levels contravenes \u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u2019s mandate that a court consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors in a resentencing proceeding.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b876-17\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the sentencing guidelines, for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003). However, in the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) context, we review <em>\u201cde novo </em>the district court\u2019s determination of the scope of its authority to reduce a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582.\u201d <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1191 (11th Cir.) (per curiam), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. Feb. 10, 2009) (No. 08-8664).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-18\">In <em>Melvin, </em>we addressed a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendment 706 and held that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>125 S.Ct. 788, <em>160 </em>L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) \u201cdo not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings\u201d and that \u201ca district court is bound by the limitations on its discretion imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statements by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 556 F.3d at 1190. Specifically, we held that the district court was bound by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A)\u2019s limitation on the court\u2019s discretion to impose a sentence below the low end of the defendant\u2019s amended guideline range. <em>Id. </em>at 1192-94.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Because the district court did not have the authority to sentence Middlebrooks below the low end of his amended guideline range, the court committed no error in resentencing him. Accordingly, we discern no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b876-13\">. Middlebrooks moved for appointment of counsel when he filed his brief, arguing that the case was too complex for him to address without assistance of counsel. Middlebrooks' brief, however, adequately addressed his arguments. His motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-14\">In response to Middlebrooks's appeal, the government moved for summary affirmance or, if the motion was denied, for its motion be treated as its brief. Although we may summarily affirm in some circumstances, <em>see Groendyke Transp., Inc. v. Davis, </em>406 F.2d 1158, 1162 (5th Cir.1969), we do not do so in this case. The government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is DENIED and its motion for its motion to be treated as its brief is GRANTED.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b877-16\">. This limitation on the imposition of a sentence below the low end of the defendant's amended guideline range also moots Middle-brooks\u2019 argument concerning the government's attempts to limit the reduction in his sentence to only two levels.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
