The Wootens allege that because of their interracial relationship,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> their co-workers and supervisors harassed them, disciplined them, denied them positions for which they were qualified, and ultimately terminated their employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">The Wootens brought their claim in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. The court granted summary judgment to FedEx on some claims and sent the rest to trial. A jury found for FedEx on all counts. The Wootens timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">Katie Wooten began working at FedEx as a part-time courier in May 1984 in Garland, Texas. After becoming a full-time courier, she successfully applied to transfer to the Dallas Fort Worth Ramp Transit Station in March 1999, working as a part-time ramp transport driver and then in a part-time night heavyweight freight delivery position. Ronnie began working for FedEx in October 1993 and had a similar trajectory, moving from part-time courier to full-time ramp transport driver and finally to part-time night heavyweight freight delivery. He worked at the same station as Katie.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-14\">Katie and Ronnie began dating in May 2000, and married in June 2001.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They allege that before and after they married, co-workers subjected them to frequent teasing, comments, and insults related to their relationship, including some related to their interracial status.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-15\">From about the time they started dating, and intensifying after their marriage, their work situation deteriorated. They clashed with their co-workers and supervisors more and more often, until the situation came to a head in 2003, with several conflicts with co-workers, attendant meetings with managers, and formal grievance and disciplinary processes. Their status as an interracial couple came up several times in the course of these dealings with co-workers and managers\u2014although, as we will discuss, it was not a prominent component of the tensions, the meetings, the complaints, or the other formal and informal contacts between the Wootens and FedEx.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-16\">On December 16, 2003, FedEx fired Ronnie for receiving his third disciplinary \u201cperformance reminder\u201d for a delivery failure, but after Ronnie complained of failure to abide disciplinary procedural rules, senior management reduced the discipline to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>five-day suspension without pay. Nine weeks later, FedEx fired both of them for falsifying records and driving outside of their delivery area.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Katie and Ronnie each filed an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaint on March 5, 2004, alleging that they were discharged because of their interracial relationship in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Ronnie\u2019s complaint included allegations of harassment and discrimination dating from September 2001. The EEOC issued a right-to-sue letter and this suit followed. The Wootens allege violations of Title VII, the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, and the common law tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">By order of January 7, 2007, 2007 WL 63609, Judge Sidney A. Fitzwater of the United States District Court, in a careful, sixty-six page Memorandum opinion, dismissed the TCHRA claims, Katie and Ronnie\u2019s hostile work environment claims, their Title VII failure to promote claims, Katie\u2019s retaliation claims under Title VII, Ronnie\u2019s discipline/suspension claim under Title VII and \u00a7 1981, and some of their retaliation claims. The court allowed Katie\u2019s 2002 failure to promote claim under \u00a7 1981, both Wootens\u2019 discriminatory termination claims, and some retaliation claims of both. On January 31, 2007 WL 273648, the court dismissed from the remaining claims the claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The remaining claims went to trial. A jury returned a verdict in FedEx\u2019s favor, and the district court entered judgment for FedEx.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">The Wootens appeal the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on their hostile work environment claims, Ronnie\u2019s discriminatory discipline claim, and Ronnie\u2019s retaliatory termination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-13\">Summary judgment is appropriate if \u201cthe pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On evaluating a motion for summary judgment, \u201c[w]e resolve doubts in favor of the nonmoving party and make all reasonable inferences in favor of that party.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cNo genuine issue of material facts exists if the summary-judgment evidence is such that no reasonable juror could find in favor of the nonmovant.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We review grants of summary judgment de novo, because the issue is one of legal sufficiency.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-14\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b327-15\">Ronnie Wooten claims he raised an issue of material fact as to a separate discriminatory punishment claim, for his termination of December 2003, which was subsequently reduced to a week suspension with partial back pay. The district court granted summary judgment on this claim insofar as it was separate from Ronnie\u2019s later discriminatory termination claim, characterizing it as \u201cessentially a compo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>nent of the termination claim....\u201d For essentially the reasons it stated, we hold that the district court rightly judged that the latter termination, which the court allowed to go forward, was the crux of the claim, and that the Wootens otherwise failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact sufficient to allow a separate suspension claim to go forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">To establish a hostile work claim, plaintiffs must demonstrate (1) that they were the members of a protected group, (2) that they were the victim of uninvited harassment, (3) that the harassment affected a \u201cterm, condition, or privilege\u201d of their employment, and (4) that the employer knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take prompt remedial action.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cTo be actionable, the challenged conduct must create an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201c[Wlhether an environment is \u2018hostile\u2019 or \u2018abusive\u2019 can be determined only by looking at all the circumstances. These may include the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee\u2019s work performance.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">The test requires that plaintiffs prove that a reasonable juror could find that the abusive conduct was severe or pervasive. The district court appears to have rested its judgment on the fact that the Wootens failed to raise any genuine fact as to whether the conduct in question was \u201csevere or pervasive.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AEl\">Many of the allegations that the Woo-tens claim should have survived summary judgment involve the behavior of their coworker Tony Garrett, an African-American man who served as freight coordinator at the station (an hourly-paid, non-managerial post<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>). The allegations involve fre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>quent inappropriate comments by Garrett and other individuals in the office,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> as well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>as by oppressive actions of Garrett regarding work assignments.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Garrett\u2019s comments involve race: \u201cjungle fever,\u201d a phrase made famous by the Spike Lee movie of that name,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> is a reference to interracial romantic attraction.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> And in context, especially when Ronnie reports that he asked Garrett to stop, a reasonable juror could see it as more than mere teasing; it can be understood to express a core of virulent and longstanding disapproval of interracial romantic relationships. The butt of such \u201cjokes\u201d would be understandably sensitive, and could reasonably interpret the remarks as hostile, even intimidating. But deposition testimony suggest that the comments by Garrett tapered off or ceased after the Wootens\u2019 marriage, before any complaints about possible interracial discrimination to management. Thus, even if the district court was wrong and the comments could amount to \u201csevere or pervasive\u201d abusive workplace conduct, Ronnie\u2019s failure to put management on notice contemporaneously would doom this part of the Wootens\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-16\">As far as the allegedly oppressive work assignments, construing the deposition testimony in the Wootens\u2019 favor, the actions themselves were largely or entirely race-neutral. The Wootens\u2019 complaints as to these actions similarly offer only brief glimpses of allegations of possible prejudice against their interracial relationship,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>and any inference of racial animus appears to be entirely subjective, not supported by any comments or actions.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">We stand in an uncomfortable but familiar place for courts adjudicating discrimi-. nation claims, faced with inappropriate, offensive remarks not legally sufficient to sustain a claim. The difficulty of evaluating discrimination claims at the summary judgment stage is well known and derives from obvious sources, namely the importance of \u201che said / she said\u201d credibility determinations. We remain keenly aware that \u201c[wjhether ... allegations are too vague to ultimately carry the day is a credibility determination, or requires weighing the evidence, both of which are more appropriately done by the trier of fact.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> That said, there must on the full record of the case at hand be a genuine issue of fact for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The Wootens offer evidence of workplace incidents, conflicts, and complaints, the vast majority of which do not directly or under any reasonable inference involve racial animus. The connection between Garrett\u2019s and other co-workers\u2019 race-based comments, and the more serious workplace actions such as unfavorable shifts and so on, is weak to non-existent. There is thin evidence that possible racial discrimination was complained about, amidst many other complaints, and well after the brunt, and perhaps after all, of the racial comments and innuendo had abated.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">We would not lay down a rule that verbal comments could never lead to inferences of racial motivation; nor do we hold that frequent racial comments, even meant in jest, cannot support a finding of hostile work environment; nor, finally, do we intend to establish a new baseline for what sort of comments and conduct do not qualify as \u201csevere or pervasive.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Close analysis of the summary judgment evidence presented is required in these cases,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and such analysis, of a voluminous amount of evidence in this case, especially the time line of racial comments, adverse actions, and complaints, here leads us to our answer, inescapably.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-12\">As for the alleged hostile work environment created by Peyton, insofar as it must be separated from the claims regarding Garrett, this claim too must fail because of the utter lack of demonstration that race was involved in Peyton\u2019s animus. True, the harassment seems to have begun in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>temporal proximity to a complaint that the Wootens were the objects of racial discrimination, but close examination of the evidence in record, including the Wootens\u2019 own complaints about Peyton, fail to raise any genuine possibility that Peyton was herself motivated by racial animus. There is no evidence that any dislike or unfavorable treatment was racially motivated. However obnoxious her behavior may have been, no reasonable juror could find that it was tied to race.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The Wootens apparently seek review of the district court\u2019s summary judgment on Ronnie\u2019s retaliation claim relating to his December 2003 suspension, commuted to a two-day suspension. We are not persuaded that this claim is separate from the retaliation claim that was allowed to proceed. The Wootens offer no citation to any point where the district court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">The Wootens seek relief on numerous other grounds, including the prejudicial admission of irrelevant evidence, failure to render a judgment as a matter of law or order a new trial, and the failure to strike a racially biased venire member for cause. All of these grounds are preserved in some form in the record below and are reviewed for abuse of discretion. Appellants also claim their trial was tainted by perjury and subornation of perjury, leveling charges at witnesses and counsel for the appellees. All of these claims are merit-less.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b332-12\">The district court refused to strike venire member Paul for cause, forcing the Wootens to exercise a peremptory strike against Paul, leaving them unable to strike a possibly racially biased venire member, schoolteacher Morris.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-13\">The voir dire relevant to the challenge of Paul ran thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-14\">THE COURT: Hello, Mrs. Paul. You indicated that you had strong feelings about interracial marriage; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-15\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR PAUL: Well,\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-16\">THE COURT: Unless I confused you with Mrs. Ivie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-17\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR PAUL: I think you did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-19\">THE COURT: Do you know of any reason you can\u2019t be fair and impartial in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-20\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR PAUL: Well, no. I think I could be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-21\">THE COURT: All right. I think I confused you with Mrs. Ivie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-22\">Do you have any questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-23\">MS. LASTER:<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> I had the same note, ma\u2019am. Are you sure you didn\u2019t say you had strong feelings about interracial relationships? Because I wrote that down for you as well as Ms. Ivie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-24\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR [PAUL]:<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Well, I believe a robin should be with a Robin [sic], but there are a lot of people that are marrying interracially, and so I can\u2019t\u2014I can\u2019t live their life for them. I have to live mine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>MS. LASTER: Okay. So you do have feelings that interracial relationships are not right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-5\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR [PAUL]: It\u2019s just not for me, and my family. I\u2019ll just put it that way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">MS. LASTER: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR [PAUL]: But, you know, that\u2019s somebody else\u2019s prerogative, that\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t hold anything against 'em.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-8\">THE COURT: Would you have any difficulty in\u2014if I instruct you that the law prohibits discrimination based on interracial relationships, you have any problem applying that law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-9\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR [PAUL]: No. ... [Prospective juror exits.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-11\">THE COURT: Is there any challenge to the juror?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-12\">MS. LASTER: Yes, judge. She lied, for one thing. I heard it and you heard it, and my clients heard her say the first time she had strong feelings about interracial relationships, and gets up here and says she doesn\u2019t at first and finally admits it. I don\u2019t trust anything she said through the whole voir dire process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AbF\">THE COURT: I\u2019m not sure it was a lie. There are jurors who hear things or misunderstand things for a number of reasons, and I\u2019ll overrule the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVS\">Paul\u2019s striking statement of her conviction that \u201ca robin should be with a Robin [sic]\u201d\u2014a quasi-proverbial statement insinuating that interracial marriage is somehow unnatural, contrary to the order of things\u2014obviously has bearing on the Woo-tens\u2019 case, given the centrality of their interracial relationship to their claims. Despite this, in light of Paul\u2019s affirmation that she could be impartial and keep her personal preferences to herself, the court refused to strike her for cause. It was then the Wootens\u2019 decision to spend a peremptory to strike Paul, leaving them unable to strike Morris, a schoolteacher, whose voir dire ran thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-15\">COURT: Is there anyone on the panel who has ever personally been accused of discrimination or retaliation, whether that accusation was right or wrong, had merit or no merit whatsoever?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-16\">All right. On the first row, Mrs. Morris.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-17\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR MORRIS: I\u2019m a school teacher. I\u2019m always prejudiced. Everything I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-18\">THE COURT: Okay. And now let me ask you, is there anything about that that you think would prevent you from being fair and impartial in this case? PROSPECTIVE JUROR MORRIS: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-19\">THE COURT: All right. Thank you. \u2018</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ajv\">Morris\u2019s comment suggests that she had been accused of prejudice or bias, but that she thought it in the normal course of her occupation to be accused of such things. There was no further investigation of why she might think this or how it might affect her judgment, and the record as it stands does not clearly establish that she should have been stricken for cause. The Woo-tens did not seek to challenge Morris for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-20\">The assertion that Morris might have been the object of a peremptory challenge is not probative here. The Supreme Court has directly held that a \u201cwasted\u201d peremptory does not taint a criminal trial,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and its reasoning a fortiori applies here. There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-21\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b333-22\">The Wootens claim the district court abused its discretion in not setting aside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>the jury verdict, because FedEx failed to rebut the Wootens\u2019 prima facie case of discrimination. There was ample evidence, both testimonial and documentary, that supported FedEx\u2019s position, including on the issue of whether \u201cdelivery area\u201d had sufficient meaning to support discipline against the Wootens. The Wootens had every opportunity to test this evidence at trial, and the jury was not unreasonable in finding that FedEx had rebutted the Wootens\u2019 allegations of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The Wooten\u2019s quibble with the allegedly erroneous admission of evidence and testimony that they claim was prejudicial to their case. The evidence includes conflicting testimony regarding FedEx\u2019s rationales for its decisions, an employment policy document on \u201cfalsification\u201d signed by Katie Wooten in November 1990, and damaging notes from co-workers about the Wootens included in a report that was part of FedEx\u2019s investigation of the Wootens.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The challenged evidence and testimony were relevant to the central issues tested at trial. While the introduction of some of the evidence was, no doubt, prejudicial to the Wootens, none of it was not unduly so. The Wootens had ample opportunity to attack each piece of evidence at trial, and no doubt their efforts affected the weight the jury assigned evidence in coming to its determination. FedEx\u2019s case was not nearly as troubled as the Wootens claim, and the central issues of this trial were carefully and thoroughly explored at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">The Wootens\u2019 allegations of perjury, subornation of perjury, and misconduct are tenuous at best. Most of these allegations are reviewed for plain error, because they were not raised in the court below. The ones that were are reviewed for abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">The standard of review is of no moment here, because the record below reflects no error. The Wootens\u2019 briefs include numerous bits of testimony and argumentation taken out of context. The court gave the Wootens ample opportunity to challenge and undermine misleading testimony, and it properly instructed the jury regarding the import to be given to the statements of counsel. We find no errors, perjurious statements, or instances of misconduct that call for reversal of the judgment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b326-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm.

While they argue it repeatedly, the Woo-tens do not successfully demonstrate that Garrett was in fact a supervisor; even after considerable discovery, they merely assert that he \"was given the authority by FedEx to assign the drivers\u2019 deliveries and make decisions regarding their workload.\u201d But the involvement of numerous other supervisors is clear throughout the record, as are the limits of Garrett\u2019s powers (for instance, Katie Wooten admitted in deposition that he had no power to discipline her or evaluate her performance).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-14\">On the other hand, FedEx construes language from <em>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, </em>524 U.S. 775, 803, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998) (\"to hire and fire and set work schedules\u201d) <em>(quoting </em>Estrich, <em>Sex at Work, </em>43 Stan.

Not all exer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>cise of authority leads to an inference of a supervisory relationship, particularly when close monitoring is close at hand from other direct supervisors and managers. Some interdependence and inequality in authority among employees in a corporate enterprise is inevitable: not all dependence amounts to a legally sufficient \"supervisor\u201d relationship. No doubt, Garrett\u2019s actions influenced the Wootens\u2019 daily work environment, and thus his actions are serious, but based on the evidence before us Garrett was a co-worker and not a supervisor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b329-6\">. At deposition, Ronnie testified concerning the racial overtones of some of the comments made (by some women who worked in the office and by Garrett) about his and Katie\u2019s relationship, before and after they began dating. The most favorable testimony for the Wootens is this (emphases added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">Q: After you started dating what people made comments to you about\u2014that referred to the fact that it was an inter-racial couple?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-8\">A: Well ... this was like <em>probably every other day with Tony Garrett. </em>And this is how my morning would basically get started probably every other day for probably\u2014 probably up to the time me and her got married ... in 2001.... You know. I\u2019d come in and, you know, they be in [the break room], Charlotte and sometimes Craig Harris will be in there. And Greg Arbet will be in there.... And I'll walk in there they\u2019ll go, \"Hey man, you know, here come Ronnie Wooten. Ronnie Wooten said he'll never date another black woman again.\u201d And that was just about\u2014I mean that was just about every other day. I would come in and\u2014and he would do that.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-9\">Q: Tony Garrett would say that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-10\">A: Oh, yeah. Just about every other day.... And Regina said, \"The only reason Ronnie would mess with a white woman is because they\u2019ll do\u2014them bitches will do anything you tell them to do.\" And I\u2019m sitting there going like, \u201cOh, whatever man.\u201d And like I said, me and Katie Wooten wasn't seeing each other then____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-11\">Q: So this was before you were seeing each other?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-12\">A: This is before. Yeah, this is before---And then after we\u2014you know, like Katie [testified], you know, they talk about the jungle fever. That\u2014you know, I\u2019d come in and Tony go, \u201cOh, here come Ronnie Wooten.\u201d And he'll sing the jungle fever song.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Atz\">Q: He\u2019d sing the song Jungle Fever?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-15\">A: Yeah. And he\u2019ll go back to the same statement, you know, \"Ronnie said he\u2019ll never date another black woman again.\u201d And then all of a sudden Regina got to the point where she got tired of Tony saying it, you know, \"I\u2019m tired of hearing it.\u201d And shit\u2014\u201ctake that shit somewhere else.\u201d And I don\u2019t know, I\u2014he still didn\u2019t get the picture, but I mean up to\u2014probably up to the time we got married he was\u2014that was his famous line when I\u2014when I come in____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-17\">Q: Okay. Were you pretty much known in the work place as a person that liked to kid around with his co-workers? ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-18\">A: Yeah. We played around a little bit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-19\">Q: Including Tony Garrett?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-20\">A: Me and Tony\u2014I've been knowing Tony since I was a DAL since 1993, so\u2014we used to play basketball together and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-21\">Q: So he was a person that you joked around with in the work place?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-22\">A: No, I wouldn't say that____ I joke around with everybody. It\u2019s not\u2014it's not a common practice that I do. Basically, when I come in I come to get my stuff\u2014get my pouch, go get my truck and I load it. But no, when I come in, no, I don't actively go out and say, \"Hey, let's\u2014let's joke around.\u201d ... What you\u2019re referring to when Tony would joke around like that, no, I didn't\u2014I used to tell Tony, \"Okay. That\u2019s enough.\u201d With the\u2014you know, all Ronnie say he won't date another black woman again. I didn\u2019t like hearing that. I didn\u2019t like it. And I told Tony, \u201cOkay, Tony, that\u2019s enough.\u201d ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-24\">Q: ... <em>Did you ever report what Tony Garrett, the kind of things that he said, to any manager before you were married to Katie Wooten?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-26\">\n<em>A: No....</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-27\">\n<em>Q: And did\u2014after you were married could you tell me about any comments or conduct that you think occurred as harassment because you were in an inter-racial marriage? A: I can\u2019t think of anything right now.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-28\">Katie Wooten testified, apparently also about Tony Garrett:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-30\">The main thing he said several times was jungle fever. \"Y\u2019all got that jungle fever going on.\u201d He would put\u2014swing that into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>sentences several times. More than several times ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-7\">Q: Well, how many?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-8\">A: Throughout a two-year period?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-9\">Q: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-10\">A: Probably heard it 10 or X1 times.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b330-11\">. Inter alia, Katie claimed that Garrett would assign her more deliveries, and more spread out deliveries, than her peers, that he would assign her physically demanding \u201clift gate\" deliveries from which female drivers were usually spared, and that on a number of occasions he affixed labels backwards on heavy delivery items, making each delivery more strenuous. Later, the Wootens claim, Garrett offered to, and did, begin giving them deliveries close to their home so they could go home for lunch: he then reported them to supervisors for their spending time at home while on the job. After the Wootens complained about his actions, Garrett allegedly physically and verbally confronted Ronnie in response to his and Katie\u2019s complaints.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b330-12\">.

The written complaints in evidence do not reflect concerns about inter-racial prejudice. There is some testimony about complaints relating to race.
