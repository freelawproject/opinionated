The defendant-appellee, who was not served in this matter, did not appear in district court, and has not filed a brief in this Court. We assume the familiarity of the parties and counsel with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case, the opinions below, and the issues raised on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-23\">We review a section 1915(e) dismissal <em>de novo. Giano v. Goord, </em>250 F.3d 146, 149-50 (2d Cir.2001). A <em>de novo </em>review of the record and relevant case law establishes that the district court properly dismissed Archer\u2019s amended complaint. In his amended complaint, Archer challenged the loss of his \u201cgood-time credits\u201d and sought monetary damages. The claim is barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994) (holding that a section 1983 action seeking money damages is not cognizable if a favorable decision would \u201cnecessarily imply the invalidity of [a] conviction or sentence,\u201d unless such conviction has previ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>ously been invalidated), and <em>Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997) (applying <em>Heck </em>to a suit challenging the procedural defects at a prison disciplinary proceeding at which an inmate\u2019s good-time credits were revoked).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">Archer\u2019s claim on appeal that he is only challenging the allegedly inadequate procedures that resulted in the revocation of his good-time credits, and not the revocation itself, fails. The Supreme Court, in <em>Edwards, </em>rejected the distinction between claiming an improper procedure and claiming an improper result, because \u201cit disregards the possibility, clearly envisioned by <em>Heck, </em>that the nature of the challenge to the procedures could be such as necessarily to imply the invalidity of the judgment.\u201d <em>Edwards, </em>520 U.S. at 645, 117 S.Ct, 1584. The Supreme Court concluded that because the principal procedural defect complained of by Edwards \u201cwould, if established, necessarily imply the invalidity of the deprivation of his good-time credits,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 646, 117 S.Ct. 1584, Edwards\u2019 suit was not cognizable under section 1983. <em>Id. </em>at 646-49, 117 S.Ct. 1584. In light of the fact that Archer\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s ruling is foreclosed by principles articulated by the Supreme Court, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
