We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We grant the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-15\">The agency determined that Liu\u2019s failure to submit his fingerprints was a sufficient reason to deny his application for relief. The agency, however, did not have the benefit of our intervening decision in <em>Cui v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 1289, 1292-95 (9th Cir.2008) (holding IJ\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s request for a continuance constituted an abuse of discretion where law governing fingerprint requirement was unclear and uncertain, and IJ did not warn petitioner that failure to submit new fingerprints in advance of merits hearing could result in pretermission of her claims); <em>see also Karapetyan v. Mukasey, </em>543 F.3d 1118, 1129-32 (9th Cir.2008) (reaching same result as in <em>Cui). </em>We therefore grant the petition for review and remand for the BIA to reconsider Liu\u2019s appeal. <em>See Cui, </em>538 F.3d at 1292-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-11\">In light of our disposition, we need not address Liu\u2019s due process contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b641-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
