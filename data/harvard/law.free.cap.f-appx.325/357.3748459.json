He argues that the within-guidelines sentence imposed by the district court was unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to fulfill the sentencing purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Relying on <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), he argues that the illegal reentry guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, is flawed because it is not empirically based.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">The district judge made clear at sentencing the reasons she was imposing a sentence at the top of the guidelines range, citing Parra\u2019s prior criminal history and his consistent disregard of the criminal and immigration laws of this country despite significant time spent in prison. The district court determined that a sentence of 63 months of imprisonment was \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d regardless of the Guidelines scoring. Given the district court\u2019s specific reasons for imposing a 63-month sentence, it cannot be said that the court failed to consider the factors of \u00a7 3553(a) or that Parra has shown that his sentence is unreasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b386-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
