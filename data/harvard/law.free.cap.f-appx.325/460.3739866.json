Because his appeal was pending when the Supreme Court decided <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), we remanded Brumfield\u2019s sentence to the district court for the limited purpose of permitting the sentencing judge to advise this court whether he was inclined to resen-tence Brumfield in light of <em>Kimbrough. </em>However, we instructed the sentencing judge to hold off telling the court whether he was inclined to resentence the defendant under <em>Kimbrough </em>until he decided whether to act favorably on a motion to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence under the new guidelines range, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-23\">Chief Judge Crabb, who is currently the only judge in the Western District of Wisconsin due to Judge' Shabaz\u2019s medical leave, appropriately responded in place of Judge Shabaz. <em>See United States v. Howe, </em>310 Fed.Appx. 43, 45 (7th Cir.2009) (unpublished order). Chief Judge Crabb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>announced that she intends to lower Brumfield\u2019s offense level to comport with the amended crack guidelines\u2014Brum-field\u2019s new guidelines range would be 151 to 188 months\u2014and also that she is inclined to impose a yet lower sentence, pursuant to <em>Kimbrough, </em>based on the remaining disparity between the crack and powder cocaine sentencing guidelines. Brumfield requests a remand for resen-tencing; the government has not responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that Brumfield\u2019s sentence is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
