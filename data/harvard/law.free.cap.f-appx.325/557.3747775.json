We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">1. \u2018We review de novo whether a defendant has waived his right to appeal by entering into a plea agreement and the validity of such a waiver.\u201d <em>United States v. Jeronimo, </em>398 F.3d 1149, 1153 (9th Cir.2005). We will enforce a defendant\u2019s appellate waiver when \u201c(1) the language of the waiver encompasses his right to appeal on the grounds raised, and (2) the waiver is knowingly and voluntarily made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the district court accurately found that no package deal existed. <em>See United States v. Caro, </em>997 F.2d 657, 660 (9th Cir.1993) (requiring district courts to make a \u201cmore careful examination of voluntariness\u201d during the Rule 11 colloquy \u201cwhen a plea bargain is conditioned on the cooperation of more than one defendant.\u201d). Accordingly, Anderson knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal, and we cannot review the district court\u2019s denial of Anderson\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">2. Anderson\u2019s valid appellate waiver does not preclude review of Anderson\u2019s claim that the prosecution breached the plea agreement. <em>United States v. Baramdyka, </em>95 F.3d 840, 843 (9th Cir.1996) (noting an exception for \u201cclaims involving a breach of the plea agreement\u201d). The government\u2019s act of re-indicting Anderson with the counts it had dismissed according to the plea agreement was not a remedy the agreement allowed for Anderson\u2019s breach. However, it does not require that Anderson\u2019s plea be set aside. The district court\u2019s remedy, requiring the plea to be set aside if the government decides to try Anderson on the remaining counts, was appropriate under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">3. Anderson\u2019s valid appellate waiver does not preclude review of the district court\u2019s restitution order. <em>See United States v. Gordon, </em>393 F.3d 1044, 1050 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cA restitution order which exceeds its authority under the [Mandatory Victims Restitution Act] is equivalent to an illegal sentence.... [Therefore, the waiver of appeal is inapplicable to [the restitution order].\u201d). The Mandatory Victims Restitution Act \u201cminimally requires that facts [supporting the amount victims lost] be established by a preponderance of the evidence, and the district court may utilize only evidence that possesses sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Waknine, </em>543 F.3d 546, 557 (9th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). The district court did not abuse its discretion in ordering Anderson to pay the restitution specified in its modified order. <em>See United States v. Peterson, </em>538 F.3d 1064, 1074 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b585-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
