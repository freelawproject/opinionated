Owens moved to reduce his sentence based on Amendments 433 and 599 to the Guidelines. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-29\">We review a denial of a motion to reduce a sentence under section 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number><em>Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">A district court may modify a sentence under section 3582(c)(2) for a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based upon a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. Amendment 433 became effective November 1, 1991. U.S.S.GApp. C, amend. 433. Amendment 599 became effective November 1, 2000. U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 599. Owens was sentenced in 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Owens\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence because Amendments 433 and 599 were in effect when he was originally sentenced. Owens\u2019s term of imprisonment was not based on a sentencing range that was later lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 433, 599; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). We affirm the denial of Owens\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
