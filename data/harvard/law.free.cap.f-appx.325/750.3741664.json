Crawford, a federal prisoner convicted of crack cocaine offenses, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a reduced sentence. After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify the term of imprisonment of an already incarcerated defendant if the defendant\u2019s sentence is \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). However, \u201c[w]here a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). Crawford\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which lowered most of the base offense levels in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) applicable to crack cocaine offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">The district court did not err in concluding that Crawford was ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction. At his original sentencing, Crawford\u2019s initial guidelines range, based on \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)\u2019s drug quantity table, was 210 to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment. However, Crawford was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of twenty years, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Accordingly, Crawford\u2019s guidelines range became 240 to 262 months. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(c) (providing that a sentence may be imposed \u201cat any point within the applicable guideline range\u201d so long as the sentence \u201cis not less than any statutorily required minimum sentence\u201d). The district court imposed the statutory mandatory minimum 240-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-14\">In short, Crawford\u2019s 240-month sentence was not based on the amount of crack cocaine attributed to him, but rather on the statutory mandatory minimum. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1339-40 (11th Cir.2008) (concluding that defendant sentenced to statutory mandatory minimum is not eligible for sentence reduction because Amendment 706 had no effect on the statutory mandatory minimum sentence). Thus, even though Amendment 706 lowered the base offense level for Crawford\u2019s crack cocaine offense, Crawford\u2019s sentencing range remained 240 months by virtue of the statutory mandatory minimum. Because Amendment 706 had no effect on Crawford\u2019s sentencing range, Crawford was not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-15\">Crawford\u2019s arguments regarding the applicability of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), are foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190 (11th Cir.2009) (concluding that <em>\u201cBooker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>do not prohibit the limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement by the Sentencing Commission\u201d). We do not address Crawford\u2019s remaining arguments regarding alleged deficiencies in his 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 information because they are outside the scope of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (limiting proceedings under statute to cases where a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>retroactive amendment affects the applicable sentencing range).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b779-8\">. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court's legal conclusions regarding its authority to modify a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v.
