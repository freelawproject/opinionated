On appeal, Allstate argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the Eysters when the trial court improperly interpreted the resident-relative exclusion in the automobile insurance policy as not prohibiting liability coverage to Keisha for her sister Kaley\u2019s injuries sustained during an accident in which Keisha was the vehicle operator. Additionally, Allstate argues that the trial court abused its discretion in overruling its motion to strike certain hearsay testimony and parol evidence offered by the Eysters in support of their motion for summary judgment. Based on the following, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-13\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>In February 2008, Allstate filed a complaint for declaratory judgment against the Eysters, stating that it had provided personal-liability automobile insurance coverage to the Eysters through an insurance policy issued to them on July 27, 2007; that Jon is the father of Keisha and Kaley; that Jon and Penny resided together in Marion, Ohio, and Keisha and Kaley also resided together at the same Marion, Ohio address as their parents, or at an address in Tucson, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>Arizona; that on July 27, 2007, in Arizona, Keisha negligently operated an automobile resulting in bodily injury to Kaley, who was a passenger in the vehicle; that Kaley sought recovery for her injuries from Keisha as a result of the accident; that Keisha demanded that Allstate indemnify her against Kaley\u2019s claim on the basis that such indemnification was required by the liability coverage under the Allstate policy; that the Allstate policy excludes liability coverage for \u201cbodily injury to any person related to an insured person by blood, marriage, or adoption and residing in that person\u2019s household\u201d; and that consequently, Allstate has no obligation to indemnify Keisha against the claims of Kaley. Attached to the complaint was the Allstate policy, which set forth the liability-coverage exclusion as stated in the complaint. Additionally, the \u201cnamed insured(s)\u201d under the policy were \u201cJon <em>&amp; </em>Penny Or Keisha Eyster,\u201d and at the beginning of the policy was a section providing that \u201cthe following definitions apply throughout the policy unless otherwise indicated\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-4\">5. \u201cInsured Auto\u201d means any auto or utility auto you own which is described on the Policy Declarations. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-5\">8. \u201cResident\u201d means a person who physically resides in your household with the intention to continue residence there. * * * Your unmarried dependent children while temporarily away from home will be considered residents if they intend to resume residing in your household.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-6\">11. \u2018You\u201d or \u201cYour\u201d means the policyholder named on the Policy Declarations and that policyholder\u2019s resident spouse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-7\">12. \u2018Your Insured Auto\u201d means an insured auto you own.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">Furthermore, the policy contained an \u201cAdditional Definition for Part 1,\u201d wherein the resident-relative liability exclusion was contained, stating that an \u201cinsured person\u201d means \u201c[wjhile operating your insured auto: a) you, b) any resident relative, c) and any other person operating it with your permission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">{\u00b6 3} In July 2009, both Allstate and the Eysters filed a joint stipulation of the parties, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-10\">(1) Defendants Jon and Penny Eyster have lived for the past sixteen years at 1937 Chapel Heights Road, Marion, Ohio 44302. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-11\">(2) Defendant Kaley Eyster and Keisha Eyster are daughters of Jon and Penny Eyster. Keisha Eyster is twenty-two years old. Kaley Eyster is twenty years old.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-12\">(3) Keisha Eyster lived with her parents until July 2005, shortly after her graduation from high school. She then moved in with a girlfriend in Columbus, Ohio following a dispute with her parents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>(4) In September 2005 Keisha moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to attend classes at Pennsylvania Culinary Institute. Keisha Eyster remained in Pitts-burg until September 2006, when she completed her classes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-5\">(5) In September 2006 Keisha Eyster moved to Arizona for a four-month externship with Marriott as an assistant baker. She successfully completed the externship, received her associate degree, and was hired by Marriott as a line cook at the same facility where she had worked as an extern.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-6\">(6) From December 2006 until June 2008 Keisha Eyster lived in an apartment at 1528 North Dodge Boulevard, Tuscon, AZ 85716. This is where she was living on July 27, 2007, the date of the accident at issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-7\">(7) Keisha was a little homesick in Arizona so she asked her sister Kaley Eyster to come stay with her. At that time, Kaley Eyster was living with her parents. Kaley Eyster traveled to Arizona in April 2007 and stayed with her sister until August 2007. On July 27, 2007, the date of the accident at issue, Kaley Eyster was staying in the apartment rented by Keisha Eyster.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-8\">(8) Shortly after Kaley Eyster arrived in Arizona, she got a job at Marriott as a cafeteria assistant. This did not require any culinary training such as Keisha Eyster had. * * * Kaley Eyster got the job in order to pay for her personal expenses in Arizona.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-9\">(9) Kaley Eyster continued working at the Marriott in Arizona from April 2007 until July 2007, shortly before she was scheduled to leave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-10\">(10) Kaley Eyster was originally scheduled to travel to Ohio on July 31, 2007 and she had purchased an airline ticket to fly to the airport in Columbus, OH on that date. The Eysters allege that on July 31, 2007, Kaley was in the hospital because of injuries received in the accident on July 27, 2007. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-11\">(11) Kaley Eyster purchased her airline ticket from Orbitz, a travel website. The email confirmation from Orbitz shows a credit card billing address of 1528 North Dodge Boulevard, Tuscon, Arizona 85716. This was the address on file with Kaley Eyster\u2019s bank at the time of the accident of July 27, 2007.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-12\">(12) Kaley Eyster had a checking account and a credit card with the same bank. In May 2007 she advised the bank of a change of address to 1528 North Dodge Boulevard, Tuscon, Arizona 85716. The bank statements had previously gone to the home of her parents in Marion, Ohio. Kaley Eyster says she changed her address because she did not want her father opening her mail. On July 27, 2007 Kaley Eyster was receiving her checking account statement and credit card statement at 1528 North Dodge Boulevard, Tuscon, Arizona 85716. This was the apartment Keisha Eyster was renting and where Kaley Eyster was staying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-13\">(13) Kaley Eyster alleges that she was suspended from OSU Marion for three quarters following the Winter 2007 quarter based on her deficient academic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>performances. She was eligible to return in January 2008 for the Winter 2008 quarter. Financial aid forms for the 2007-2008 academic year were due in March 2007. Kaley Eyster alleges that she had submitted the forms. She did resume her attendance at OSU Marion in the Winter 2008 quarter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-5\">(14) On July 27, 2007 Keisha Eyster was driving the 2002 Honda Civic listed on the Allstate policy issued to Jon and Penny Eyster. Keisha Eyster\u2019s sister, Kaley Eyster, was her passenger. Kaley Eyster claims that Keisha Eyster was negligent in her operation of the vehicle and that Kaley Eyster suffered bodily injury as the direct and proximate result of her sister\u2019s negligence. The accident occurred on a state route within the tribal lands owned by the Tohono O\u2019odham [sic] Nation in Arizona.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-6\">(15) The parties agree that on July 27, 2007, Kaley Eyster was working in Arizona, staying overnight in her sister\u2019s apartment in Arizona, and had been doing both for more than three months. The parties agree that the evidence indicates that Kaley Eyster intended to travel to Ohio thereafter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-7\">(16) The parties dispute whether Kaley Eyster was a \u201cresident\u201d of her sister\u2019s apartment while she was staying there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">{\u00b6 4} In September 2009, Allstate filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that no genuine issues of material fact existed on the matter of Keisha\u2019s liability coverage for Kaley\u2019s bodily injury claim because the insurance policy excluded liability coverage to a resident relative of an \u201cinsured person,\u201d and Kaley lived with Keisha and her parents, who were both \u201cinsured persons\u201d under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">{\u00b6 5} On October 2, 2009, the Eysters filed a response to Allstate\u2019s motion for summary judgment and their own motion for summary judgment, arguing that no genuine issue of material fact existed on Keisha\u2019s claim for liability coverage under the insurance policy, as the exception to liability coverage for a resident relative of an \u201cinsured person\u201d did not apply because Kaley was not a resident of Keisha\u2019s household and because the policy cannot be logically interpreted to include Jon and Penny as \u201cinsured personfs]\u201d under the policy exception, as the exception implies that the \u201cinsured person\u201d means the tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">{\u00b6 6} Additionally, the affidavits of Jon, Penny, Keisha, and Kaley Eyster were filed with the trial court. Kaley stated that she was a sophomore at Ohio State University, Marion campus; that she was living with her parents at 1947 Chapel Heights Road, Marion, Ohio; that she visited her sister Keisha in Arizona from April 2007 until August 2007; that she had no intention of staying in Arizona with Keisha and was planning on returning home at the end of the summer; that she was registered to vote in Marion, Ohio; that when she submitted financial aid information in March 2007 to continue her education at Ohio State University, she listed her address as that of her parents\u2019 residence; that when she went to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>Arizona, she did not have an official return date but discussed with her parents and boyfriend about returning at the end of July; that when she was in Arizona, she worked at Marriott and lived with Keisha; that she worked at Marriott until the day before the accident; that she purchased an airline ticket for July 31, 2007, to return to Ohio; that while in Arizona, she changed the address on her bank account to 1528 North Dodge Boulevard, Tuscon, Arizona, because she did not want her father to open her bank statements that were being sent to her parents\u2019 residence; that she did not pay for the groceries, utilities, or rent while she lived with Keisha; that she was injured in an auto accident in which Keisha was the driver on July 27, 2007; and that as a result of the accident, she was not able to return home on her scheduled flight.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">{\u00b6 7} Penny stated in her deposition that Kaley went to Arizona to visit Keisha in April 2007; that she planned on returning to Marion at the end of the summer; that her original return date was delayed due to injuries she sustained in an auto accident; and that Kaley returned in August 2007 and currently lived with her and Jon.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">{\u00b6 8} Jon stated in his deposition that he notified Allstate of Keisha\u2019s change of address when she moved to Pittsburgh and, later, Arizona; that Kaley went to visit Keisha in Arizona in April 2007; that Kaley worked while staying with Keisha; that while in Arizona, Kaley received her bank statements at Keisha\u2019s address; and that Kaley went to Arizona for an \u201cextended vacation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">{\u00b6 9} Keisha stated in her deposition that her address while residing in Arizona was on North Dodge Boulevard in Tucson; that while residing in Arizona, she worked as a cook for Marriott; that Kaley stayed with her in Arizona from April 2007 until August 2007; that she asked Kaley to come to Arizona because she was homesick, and Kaley planned to come only for the summer; that Kaley worked at Marriott with her while she was in Arizona to pay for her own expenses; that Kaley did not pay any of the rent or utilities at the residence, but paid for some of her food and gas for the car when she drove; that Kaley received her bank statement for her credit card at the Arizona address, but she received no other mail at the address; that Kaley stopped working at Marriott sometime between July 20 and 26, 2007; and that Kaley planned to return to Ohio on July 31, 2007, but was delayed because of the injuries she sustained in the automobile accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">{\u00b6 10} Moreover, the Eysters filed Kaley\u2019s affidavit, to which they attached her certificate of voter registration from Marion County, which indicated her status as a registered voter as of February 2007, with her address being that of her parents\u2019 residence at 1947 Chapel Heights Road, Marion, Ohio. Also attached was Kaley\u2019s Free Application for Federal Student Aid (\u201cFAFSA\u201d), completed in Spring 2007, for the 2007-2008 academic year, which also indicated that her address was that of her parents\u2019 residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>{\u00b6 11} On October 19, 2009, Allstate filed a motion to strike Kaley\u2019s certificate of voter registration and FAFSA form, arguing that the certificate of voter registration was inadmissible hearsay under Evid.R. 803(A) and that the FAFSA form was not a form she had completed, but a compilation of information from an institution, to which she was not competent to testify. Furthermore, Allstate argued that Jon\u2019s deposition testimony indicating that he had notified Allstate of Keisha\u2019s move from the family\u2019s Marion, Ohio residence should also be stricken, as it was inadmissible hearsay under Evid.R. 801(C) and in violation of the parol evidence rule because the insurance policy provided that each family member, including Keisha, resided at the Marion, Ohio residence. Finally, Allstate also argued that Keisha\u2019s deposition testimony that Kaley never intended to permanently stay with her in Arizona should be stricken, as she was not competent to testify regarding Kaley\u2019s intentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">{\u00b6 12} In December 2009, the trial court denied Allstate\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment to the Eysters, stating the following in its judgment entry.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-6\">(1) Kaley Eyster was a resident in the household of her parents, Jon and Penny Eyster at the time of the crash on July 27, 2007. Kaley was not a resident of her sister Keisha\u2019s household in Arizona at the time of the crash.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-7\">(2) The resident relative exclusion in the liability section of the Allstate policy does not preclude coverage for Defendant Kaley Eyster for the injuries and damages proximately caused by the negligence of Keisha Eyster in the July 27, 2007 motor vehicle crash, since Kaley was not a resident with Keisha in Arizona.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-8\">(3) The claimed exclusion does not preclude coverage if Kaley is a resident with her parents in Marion, Ohio since they were not the tortfeasor responsible for Kaley\u2019s injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-9\">(4) The term \u201cthat\u201d in the resident relative exclusion refers to Keisha Eyster\u2019s household in Arizona and is inapplicable to Jon and Penny Eyster\u2019s household in Marion, Ohio.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">{\u00b6 13} It is from this judgment that Allstate appeals, presenting the following assignments of error for our review.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-11\">\n<em>Assignment of Error No. I</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-12\">The trial court erred in failing to issue a declaratory judgment that the Allstate policy excluded liability insurance coverage for bodily injuries claimed by appellee Kaley Eyster.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>\n<em>Assignment of Error No. II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahc\">The trial court abused its discretion by overruling Allstate\u2019s motion to strike certain hearsay testimony and parol evidence offered by the appellees in support of their motion for summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">\n<em>Assignment of Error No. I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">{\u00b6 14} In its first assignment of error, Allstate argues that the trial court erred in faffing to grant its motion for summary judgment. Specifically, it contends that because the insurance policy excluded liability coverage for injuries sustained to a resident relative of an \u201cinsured person,\u201d it was not required to provide liability coverage for Kaley\u2019s injury claim against her sister Keisha, when Kaley was a resident relative of Keisha\u2019s and her parents\u2019 household and both were an \u201cinsured person\u201d under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">{\u00b6 15} An appellate court reviews a summary judgment order de novo. <em>Hillyer v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1999), 131 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 722 N.E.2d 108. Accordingly, a reviewing court will not reverse an otherwise correct judgment merely because the lower court used different or erroneous reasons as the basis for its determination. <em>Diamond Wine &amp; Spirits, Inc. v. Dayton Heidelberg Distrib. Co., </em>148 Ohio App.3d 596, 2002-Ohio-3932, 774 N.E.2d 775, citing <em>State ex rel. Cassels v. Dayton City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 217, 222, 631 N.E.2d 150. Summary judgment is appropriate when, looking at the evidence as a whole, (1) there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, (2) reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, and, therefore, (3) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Civ.R. 56(C); <em>Horton v. Harwick Chem. Corp. </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 679, 686-687, 653 N.E.2d 1196. If any doubts exist, the issue must be resolved in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>Murphy v. Reynoldsburg </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 356, 358-359, 604 N.E.2d 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">{\u00b6 16} The party moving for summary judgment has the initial burden of producing some evidence that demonstrates the lack of a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 293, 662 N.E.2d 264. In doing so, the moving party is not required to produce any affirmative evidence, but must identify those portions of the record that affirmatively support his argument. Id. at 292. The nonmoving party must then rebut with specific facts showing the existence of a genuine triable issue; he may not rest on the mere allegations or denials of his pleadings. Id.; Civ.R. 56(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-10\">{\u00b6 17} An insurance policy is a contract, and its interpretation is a matter of law for the court. <em>Sharonville v. Am. Emp. Ins. Co., </em>109 Ohio St.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>186, 2006-Ohio-2180, 846 N.E.2d 833, \u00b6 6. The coverage under an insurance policy is determined by construing the contract \u201cin conformity with the intention of the parties as gathered from the ordinary and commonly understood meaning of the language employed.\u201d <em>King v. Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 208, 211, 519 N.E.2d 1380. Contract terms are to be given their plain and ordinary meaning, <em>Dunson v. Home-Owners Ins. Co., </em>3d Dist. No. 5-09-37, 2010-Ohio-1928, 2010 WL 1740928, \u00b6 13, and \u201c[w]hen the contract is clear and unambiguous, the court \u2018may look no further than the four corners of the insurance policy to find the intent of the parties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fed. Ins. Co. v. Executive Coach Luxury Travel, Inc., </em>3d Dist. Nos. 1-09-17 and 1-09-18, 2009-Ohio-5910, 2009 WL 3720556, \u00b6 23, quoting <em>McDaniel v. Rollins, </em>3d Dist. No. 1-04-82, 2005-Ohio-3079, 2005 WL 1421754, \u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">{\u00b6 18} However, when a portion of an insurance contract is reasonably susceptible of more than one interpretation, it will be strictly construed against the insurer and in favor of the insured. <em>Niemeyer v. W. Res. Mut. Cas. Co., </em>3d Dist. No. 12-09-03, 2010-Ohio-1710, 2010 WL 1531371, \u00b6 9, citing <em>King, </em>35 Ohio St.3d 208, 519 N.E.2d 1380, at syllabus. Nevertheless, this rule of insurance-policy interpretation will not be applied in an unreasonable manner. <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\"> {\u00b6 19} Furthermore, when an insurance contract contains exceptions to coverage, there is a presumption that all coverage applies unless it is clearly excluded in the contract. <em>Bosserman Aviation Equip. v. U.S. Liab. Ins. Co., </em>183 Ohio App.3d 29, 2009-Ohio-2526, 915 N.E.2d 687, \u00b6 11, citing <em>Andersen v. Highland House Co. </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 547, 549, 757 N.E.2d 329. \u201cAccordingly, in order for an insurer to defeat coverage through a clause in the insurance contract, it must demonstrate that the clause in the policy is capable of the construction it seeks to give it, and that such construction is the only one that can be fairly placed upon the language.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">{\u00b6 20} The party seeking to recover under an insurance policy bears the burden of proof to demonstrate that the policy provides coverage for the particular loss. <em>Chicago Title Ins. Co. v. Huntington Natl. Bank </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 270, 273, 719 N.E.2d 955. However, \u201cwhen an insurer denies liability coverage based upon a policy exclusion, the insurer bears the burden of demonstrating the applicability of the exclusion.\u201d <em>Beaverdam Contracting, Inc. v. Erie Ins. Co., </em>3d Dist. No. 1-08-17, 2008-Ohio-4953, 2008 WL 4378153, \u00b6 19, citing <em>Continental Ins. Co. v. Louis Marx &amp; Co., Inc. </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 399, 18 O.O.3d 539, 415 N.E.2d 315, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">{\u00b6 21} Resident-relative liability exclusions have been found to be valid in Ohio as a means to prevent fraudulent intrafamilial lawsuits brought for the sole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>purpose of reaping a monetary windfall through an insurance policy. See <em>Dairyland Ins. Co. v. Finch </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 360, 513 N.E.2d 1324, overruled on other grounds, <em>State Farm Auto. Ins. Co. v. Alexander </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 397, 583 N.E.2d 309, syllabus; <em>Nussbaum v. Progressive Cas. Ins. Co. </em>(1988), 61 Ohio App.3d 1, 6, 572 N.E.2d 119; <em>Kelly v. Auto-Owners Ins. Co., </em>1st Dist. No. 050450, 2006-Ohio-3599, \u00b6 11. Furthermore, a resident of a household for purposes of an insurance policy has been defined as \u201cone who lives in the home of the named insured for a period of some duration or regularity, although not necessarily there permanently, but excluding] a temporary or transient visitor.\u201d <em>Farmers Ins. of Columbus, Inc. v. Taylor </em>(1987), 39 Ohio App.3d 68, 70, 528 N.E.2d 968. See also <em>Am. States Ins. Co. v. Guillermin </em>(1996), 108 Ohio App.3d 547, 553, 671 N.E.2d 317; <em>Nationwide Ins. Co. v. Alli, </em>178 Ohio App.3d 17, 2008-Ohio-4318, 896 N.E.2d 742, \u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">{\u00b6 22} In the case at bar, the insurance policy for Keisha, Jon, and Penny provided an exclusion for liability coverage for injuries sustained by any resident relative of an \u201cinsured person,\u201d and Allstate contends that whether Kaley was a resident of Keisha\u2019s or her parents\u2019 household does not have a bearing on whether the liability exclusion applies, as Keisha, Jon, and Penny were all \u201cinsured person[s]\u201d under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">{\u00b6 23} In viewing the evidence presented, we find that Kaley was not a resident of Keisha\u2019s household, but of her parents\u2019 household, as evidenced by her temporary stay in Arizona and intent to return to Ohio. The policy defines a resident as \u201ca person who physically resides in your household with the intention to continue residence there. * * * Your unmarried dependent children while temporarily away from home will be considered residents if they intend to resume residing in your household.\u201d Moreover, appellate courts have consistently found that a resident, for purposes of an insurance policy, excludes a temporary or transient visitor. See <em>Farmers Ins. of Columbus, Inc., </em>39 Ohio App.3d at 70, 528 N.E.2d 968; <em>Am. States Ins. Co., </em>108 Ohio App.3d at 553, 671 N.E.2d 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">{\u00b6 24} Here, testimony was presented by Kaley, Keisha, Jon, and Penny that Kaley intended to stay with Keisha only for the summer; that Kaley lived with her parents prior to her stay with Keisha; that her stay with Keisha was only temporary, from April until August; and that Kaley returned to Ohio to live with her parents and attend school after her recovery from the accident. Although evidence was presented that Kaley obtained employment while staying with Keisha, testimony was also presented that this employment was only for the summer, and that Kaley stopped working shortly before her planned return to Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>{\u00b6 25} However, although Kaley was a resident relative of her parents\u2019 household and not Keisha\u2019s household under the policy does not mean that the liability exclusion does not apply. Allstate contends that the policy language clearly includes both Jon and Penny Eyster as an \u201cinsured person\u201d under the liability exclusion, meaning that the exclusion would apply under these circumstances because Kaley was a resident relative of her parents\u2019 household. However, the Eysters argue that the liability exclusion applies only if Kaley was a resident relative of Keisha\u2019s household, as the term \u201cinsured person\u201d under the liability exclusion refers to the tortfeasor. This is so because the policy language uses the word \u201cthat\u201d to modify \u201cperson\u2019s household,\u201d with \u201cthat\u201d indicating the person understood from the situation, which must be the tortfeasor under a plain and ordinary interpretation of the policy. Further, because the policy names the insureds as Jon and Penny \u201cor\u201d Keisha, it thereby creates two separate groups for insurance purposes and refutes any argument that all three be treated as one \u201cinsured person\u201d under the policy. Furthermore, the Eysters argue that if we find the policy to be ambiguous on the issue of whether \u201cinsured person\u201d includes Keisha and Jon and Penny, we must interpret the policy against Allstate.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">{\u00b6 26} Here, the policy language provides liability exclusion for \u201cbodily injury to any person related to an insured person by blood, marriage, or adoption and residing in that person\u2019s household.\u201d The policy exclusion defines \u201cinsured person\u201d as \u201c[w]hile operating your insured auto: a) you, b) any resident relative, c) any other person operating it with your permission;\u201d \u201cinsured auto\u201d as \u201cany auto or utility auto you own which is described on the Policy Declarations;\u201d and, \u201cyou\u201d or \u201cyour\u201d as \u201cthe policyholder named on the Policy Declarations and that policyholder\u2019s resident spouse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">{\u00b6 27} After reviewing the resident-relative exclusion in pari materia with the rest of the policy, and interpreting the policy terms according to their plain and ordinary meaning and the definitions given, we find that the term \u201cinsured person\u201d under the exclusion refers to Keisha and Jon and Penny. The definition for \u201cinsured person\u201d includes \u201cyou\u201d while \u201coperating your insured auto.\u201d \u2018You\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d is defined in the policy as the policyholder as listed in the policy declaration, which would include Jon and Penny, and/or Keisha. Furthermore, Keisha was operating a vehicle listed in the policy declarations.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">{\u00b6 28} Moreover, the use of \u201cor\u201d in the policy cannot logically be construed to mean that Allstate meant that either Keisha or Jon and Penny could be an \u201cinsured person\u201d under the policy, and contrary to the Eysters\u2019 assertion, we also do not find that \u201cinsured person\u201d refers to the tortfeasor. There is no language indicating that the term should be interpreted in that manner, including no use of the word \u201ctortfeasor\u201d in the definition of \u201cinsured person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>{\u00b6 29} Furthermore, the Eysters\u2019 argument that the resident-relative exclusion refers to the tortfeasor is premised on the language in the definition of \u201cinsured person\u201d included in Part I of the policy, where the resident-relative exclusion is found. However, the \u201cinsured person\u201d definition is only an additional definition for Part I of the policy and must also be read in conjunction with the other definitions of \u201cYou\u201d or \u201cYour\u201d contained at the beginning of the policy, defined as \u201cthe policyholder named on the Policy Declarations and that policyholder\u2019s resident spouse.\u201d The Eysters, and ultimately the trial court, failed to consider that the additional definitions for Part I did not exclude other definitions contained within the policy and that an \u201cinsured person\u201d must be interpreted according to those other definitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">{\u00b6 30} Consequently, because the plain language of the policy excludes liability coverage for injuries sustained to a resident relative of an \u201cinsured person,\u201d because Jon and Penny were both an \u201cinsured person\u201d under the policy, and because Kaley was a resident relative of Jon and Penny\u2019s household, we find that the liability exclusion applies to exclude Kaley\u2019s injury claim against Keisha from liability coverage under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">{\u00b6 31} Accordingly, we sustain Allstate\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">\n<em>Assignment of Error No. II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">{\u00b6 32} In its second assignment of error, Allstate argues that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting certain hearsay testimony and parol evidence. Our disposition of Allstate\u2019s first assignment of error renders its second assignment of error moot, and we decline to address it. App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">{\u00b6 33} Having found error prejudicial to the appellant herein, in the particulars assigned and argued in its first assignment of error, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-10\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b682-11\">Willamowski, P.J., and Shaw, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
