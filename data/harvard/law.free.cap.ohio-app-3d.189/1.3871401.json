(\u201cMonreal\u201d) appeals from a judgment of the Lake County Court of Common Pleas granting a directed verdict in favor of Ohio Farmers Insurance Company (\u201cOhio Farmers\u201d). The case arose from disputes between Monreal and Olympic Building Company (\u201cOlympic\u201d) regarding the construction of a funeral home. Monreal filed a complaint against Ohio Farmers to recover under the performance bond that it issued for this construction project. The trial court found that Monreal\u2019s claim under the bond is time-barred. We agree and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">{\u00b6 2} <em>Substantive Facts and Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">{\u00b6 3} In 2002, Monreal contracted with Olympic to build a funeral home for Monreal in Eastlake, Ohio, for the amount of $1,450,000. From the beginning, various disputes arose between Olympic and Monreal concerning the progress, scope, quality, and cost of the construction. Some of the problems allegedly arose from deficiencies in the plans and specifications prepared by Monreal\u2019s architect.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">{\u00b6 4} Central to this case is a performance bond issued by Ohio Farmers. The contract between Monreal and Olympic required Olympic to obtain a performance bond for $350,000 naming Monreal as the primary obligee.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In July 2002, a performance bond was issued by Ohio Farmers as surety to insure Olympic\u2019s performance under the contract. A limitation-of-action clause in the bond states that \u201c[a]ny suit under this bond must be instituted before the expiration of two (2) years from the date which Contractor ceases work on the Contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">{\u00b6 5} By December 2002, Olympic had begun to submit various change-order requests to Monreal due to the alleged deficiencies in the plans. In February 2003, Monreal issued a \u201cpunch list,\u201d which was disputed by Olympic. By May 2003, Olympic\u2019s subcontractors were seeking assurances for payment from Mon-real.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-10\">{\u00b6 6} On July 23, 2003, Monreal notified Olympic of its decision to declare Olympic in default. After negotiations, Monreal rescinded its declaration of default. However, the problems continued, and in March 2004, Olympic stopped work on the funeral home. On March 26, 2004, Monreal notified Olympic of Monreal\u2019s termination of Olympic for cause effective April 5, 2004. It is undisputed that Olympic performed no work after April 5, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>{\u00b6 7} On April 9, 2004, Monreal notified Ohio Farmers that it was making a claim under the performance bond. In a letter dated June 29, 2004, Ohio Farmers rejected the claim. Ohio Farmers stated that its obligations under the bond had \u201cnot arisen\u201d for several reasons: (1) it believed Monreal\u2019s failure to pay Olympic for changes and to timely replace the architect constituted a breach of contract; (2) Olympic disputed the termination declared by Monreal and had offered to complete the undisputed contract items and also requested mediation, and, if necessary, arbitration of any dispute between Monreal and Olympic;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (3) Olympic claimed additional change orders and disputed many \u201cback charges\u201d claimed by Monreal; (4) the project had been substantially completed except for Monreal and Olympic\u2019s disagreement as to the appropriate remedies for the \u201cpunch list\u201d items; (5) Olympic was prepared to complete the undisputed scope of the project and objected to owner completion; and (6) Monreal did not have standing to bring a claim because Great Lakes Bank, the bank that financed the construction project, was the \u201cowner\u201d named in the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">{\u00b6 8} After citing these reasons for its rejection of the claim, Ohio Farmers stated: \u201cFor the above reasons, [Ohio Farmers] believes [Ohio Farmers\u2019] obligations under the bond have not arisen. In any case, given the disputes regarding the scope of completion, including the lack of definition of certain fixes, [Ohio Farmers] is unable to obtain bids for completion. Also, the Monreals and Olympic have agreed to arbitrate their disputes. It would not be appropriate for [Ohio Farmers] to act as an arbitrator by resolving on its own the scope of completion and the other disputes between the Monreals and Olympic. [Ohio Farmers] therefore intends to not complete the project. It appears, however, that the balance of the contract price as quantified by the CSL Consulting LLC is sufficient to cover the reasonable cost to complete the undisputed punch list items.\u201d Ohio Farmers ended the letter by stating that it continued \u201cto reserve any and all rights of the surety and the principal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">{\u00b6 9} After Monreal and Olympic failed to resolve their dispute through mediation, Olympic filed a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association on May 17, 2005, seeking $239,199 in damages. Olympic claimed that Monreal breached the contract and its warranty regarding the accuracy, completeness, and suitability of the construction plans and specifications. The arbitration, however, was considerably delayed by Olympic\u2019s noncompliance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>various orders by the arbitrator. Olympic and its president, Paul Globokar, failed to participate in discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">{\u00b6 10} On June 9, 2005, Monreal notified Ohio Farmers of the pending arbitration and \u201cinvited\u201d Ohio Farmers to participate in the arbitration. Ohio Farmers declined.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">{\u00b6 11} The arbitration process did not go well due to Olympic\u2019s lack of cooperation. An arbitration hearing was finally scheduled for April 4, 2006. Olympic did not appear at the hearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Based on the exhibits submitted by Monreal, the arbitrator found that Monreal owed Olympic a balance of $26,228<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but the amount of funds needed to complete the project was $255,152. Therefore, the arbitrator found Monreal entitled to $228,924.00 from Olympic. However, the arbitrator limited the award to only $75,000, the amount Monreal sought in its counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">{\u00b6 12} On April 27, 2006, Monreal notified Ohio Farmers of the arbitration award and requested compensation under the bond. On June 19, 2006, Ohio Farmers notified Monreal that it would not pay the claim. It cited the expiration of the two-year limitation period for suit under the bond, which contained no arbitration provision, and also noted a lack of notice to Ohio Farmers that the arbitration had proceeded on a default basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">{\u00b6 13} On June 29, 2006, Monreal filed the instant action against Ohio Farmers alleging three causes of action: breach of contract (count one), bad-faith breach of contract (count two), and declaratory judgment (count three).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Ohio Farmers raised the affirmative defense that the complaint was time-barred by the bond\u2019s \u2022two-year limitation-of-action clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">{\u00b6 14} In the lengthy and protracted litigation that ensued, the parties\u2019 attention focused on the June 29, 2004 letter from Ohio Farmers to Monreal. Monreal claimed that this letter constituted a waiver of the two-year time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>limitation and also that it had relied on the letter to its detriment. It also claimed that the limitation clause was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">{\u00b6 15} Monreal filed a motion for summary judgment, seeking a ruling that Ohio Farmers was obligated under the bond as a matter of law based upon the arbitration award. It also sought a ruling that Ohio Farmers\u2019 refusal to pay its claim constituted bad faith as a matter of law. Ohio Farmers also moved for summary judgment, based on the limitation-of-action clause in the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">{\u00b6 16} The trial court denied both motions. It determined that there were genuine issues of material fact to be resolved by the trier of fact regarding whether the limitation period was reasonable and whether Ohio Farmers had waived the time limitation through its statements and conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">{\u00b6 17} A jury trial was held on June 30, 2009. Monreal called as witnesses James Walker, bond counsel for Ohio Farmers, and William Monreal and Jane Monreal, owners of the Monreal Funeral Home.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Monreal attempted to show that Ohio Farmers had waived the limitation clause in the June 29, 2004 letter. At the conclusion of the plaintiffs case, Ohio Farmers moved for and was granted a directed verdict based on the two-year limitation provision in the bond. In its judgment entry, the court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cThe Letter contained the following statements: \u2018For the above reasons, [Ohio Farmers] believes that its obligation under [the Bond] have not arisen.\u2019 The Court, when reading such provision and construing it most strongly in favor of Monreal, does not believe that there was a clear, unequivocal and decisive act by Ohio Farmers, nor does the Letter express an intent to waive its right to enforce the limitation of action clause. The Court finds this finding to be particularly true when such statement is read in conjunction with the additional statement in the Letter: \u2018[Ohio Farmers] continues to reserve any and all rights of the surety and principal.\u2019 Ohio Farmers\u2019 statements in the Letter cannot be construed to suggest that Ohio Farmers intended to waive its rights under the Bond, particularly when the Letter so clearly states that Ohio Farmers is reserving any and all rights of the surety and principal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">{\u00b6 19} Monreal now appeals from the court\u2019s judgment directing a verdict in favor of Ohio Farmers, raising two assignments of error for our review:</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>{\u00b6 20} \u201c[1.] The trial court incorrectly denied Monreal\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment as Ohio Farmers\u2019 private contractual limitation clause is unreasonable as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c[2.] The trial court incorrectly granted a directed verdict against Monreal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">{\u00b6 22} Monreal\u2019s first assignment of error refers to the trial court\u2019s denial of its motion for summary judgment as to the issue of Ohio Farmers\u2019 liability based on the arbitration award and bad faith. A review of Monreal\u2019s notice of appeal reflects that Monreal appealed only the court\u2019s judgment granting Ohio Farmers\u2019 motion for directed verdict. App.R. 3(D) requires that a notice of appeal \u201cshall designate the judgment, order or part thereof appealed from.\u201d Therefore, we summarily overrule this assignment of error. In any event, the issue that Monreal raises under this assignment of error in its brief \u2014 whether the contractual time limitation is unreasonable as a matter of law \u2014 is also raised under the second assignment of error and will be addressed in our analysis of the second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cPursuant to Civ.R. 50(A)(4), \u2018[w]hen a motion for a directed verdict has been properly made, and the trial court, after construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion is directed, finds that upon any determinative issue reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion upon the evidence submitted and that conclusion is adverse to such party, the court shall sustain the motion and direct a verdict for the moving party as to that issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bliss v. Chandler, </em>11th Dist. No. 2006-G-2742, 2007-Ohio-6161, 2007 WL 4098784, \u00b6 46. \u201c \u2018Because a motion for a directed verdict presents a question of law, an appellate court must conduct a de novo review of the trial court\u2019s judgment.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">{\u00b6 24} In its second assignment of error, Monreal presents two issues for our review: whether the two-year contractual limitation was unreasonable as a matter of law and whether Ohio Farmers waived the time limitation. Because the validity of its argument that the time limitation was unreasonable hinges on our analysis of the waiver issue, we address the waiver issue first.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">{\u00b6 25} <em>Whether the Contractual Two-Year Limitation-of-Action Clause Was Waived</em></p>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">{\u00b6 26} Regarding the waiver of a contractual term, the long-established rule is that \u201c[i]t [is] up to the defendant to assume and carry the burden of proving the waiver by the greater weight of the evidence, but in so doing he [is] required to prove a clear, unequivocal, decisive act of the party against whom the waiver [is] asserted * * <em>White Co. v. Canton Transp. Co. </em>(1936), 131 Ohio St. 190, 198-199, 5 O.O. 548, 2 N.E.2d 501. See also <em>Automated Solutions Corp. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number><em>Paragon Data Sys., </em>167 Ohio App.3d 685, 2006-Ohio-3492, 856 N.E.2d 1008, \u00b6 28; <em>Cincinnati Gas &amp; Electric v. Land </em>(March 16, 1992), 12th Dist. No. CA91-06111, 1992 WL 50027.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">{\u00b6 27} It is undisputed that Monreal officially terminated Olympic effective April 5, 2004, after which date Olympic performed no work on the funeral home. Therefore, pursuant to the clear and unambiguous language of the bond, the two-year limitation period was triggered on that date. Monreal, however, argues that Ohio Farmers waived the time period, pointing to the June 29, 2004 letter as its sole evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">{\u00b6 28} Our reading of the June 29, 2004 letter results in the same conclusion as that of the trial court. Ohio Farmers cited many reasons for its rejection of the claim, including its belief that Monreal had breached the contract by failing to pay Olympic for change orders and to timely replace the architect; that Olympic had offered to complete the undisputed contract items and to arbitrate any dispute, if necessary; and that the \u201cowner\u201d named in the bond, Great Lakes Bank, was the party with standing to make a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">{\u00b6 29} Read in the context of the entire letter, Ohio Farmers\u2019 statement that its obligations under the bond \u201chave not arisen\u201d was nothing more than a rejection of the claim. Although the use of the negative form of the present perfect tense of the verb \u201carise\u201d may imply a possibility of a future occurrence, we, like the trial court, have difficulties construing the sentence \u201c[Ohio Farmers\u2019] obligations under the bond have not arisen\u201d as a clear, unequivocal, and decisive waiver of the contractual time limitation. The fact that Olympic and Monreal would be mediating and arbitrating their disputes is but one of the many reasons that Ohio Farmers denied Monreal\u2019s claim under the bond. Considered in the context of the entire letter, the phrase \u201chave not arisen\u201d and the passing reference to a potential resolution by mediation and/or arbitration do not rise to the level of a formal waiver of the limitation-of-action clause. Monreal\u2019s and/or its counsel\u2019s interpretation of the letter as a waiver is not reasonable, particularly in light of Ohio Farmers\u2019 express reservation of any and all rights of the surety and principal of the bond at the end of the letter. Monreal, represented by counsel throughout the instant bond dispute with Ohio Farmers, could have entered into an agreement with Ohio Farmers to waive or toll the time period pending arbitration, but the record fails to reveal any discussion whatsoever of the limitation period during the almost 24 months between April 29, 2004, the date of Ohio Farmers\u2019 rejection of Monreal\u2019s claim, and April 5, 2006, the date by which suit was to be brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">{\u00b6 30} Moreover, we recognize that in appropriate circumstances, a waiver may occur \u201cwhen the insurer, by its acts or declarations, evidences a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>recognition of liability under the policy, and the evidence reasonably shows that such expressed recognition of liability and offers of settlement have led the insured to delay in bringing an action on the insurance contract.\u201d <em>Hounshell v. Am. States Ins. Co. </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 427, 431, 21 O.O.3d 267, 424 N.E.2d 311. Here, however, Ohio Farmers steadfastly denied liability and never offered settlement, and therefore it cannot be said that it led Monreal to a delay in bringing suit under the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">{\u00b6 31} <em>Whether the Limitation Period </em>Was <em>Reasonable</em></p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">{\u00b6 32} Regarding the issue of the reasonableness of the contractual limitation-of-action clause, Monreal argues that a period of two years was unreasonable because the time period to bring Monreal\u2019s claim expired before it ever arose, pointing to the fact that the arbitration award did not occur until April 19, 2006, days after the time to bring suit had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">{\u00b6 33} Generally, the statute of limitations for a claim upon a written contract is 15 years. However, the parties to a contract may agree to limit the time for bringing an action to a period less than provided by relevant statute of limitations so long as that period is reasonable. <em>Kraly v. Vannewkirk </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 627, 632, 635 N.E.2d 357. A two-year limitation period in an insurance policy has been held to be reasonable. See <em>Miller v. Progressive Cas. Ins. Co. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 619, 624-625, 635 N.E.2d 317. In <em>R.E. Holland Excavating v. Bd. of Cty. Commrs. </em>(1999), 133 Ohio App.3d 837, 729 N.E.2d 1255, the court held that a 60-day limitation provided in a construction contract for filing suit to dispute the engineer\u2019s decision was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">{\u00b6 34} Monreal\u2019s assertion that \u201cthe time period to bring Monreal\u2019s claim expired before it ever arose\u201d is based on its contention that Ohio Farmers in its June 29, 2004 letter <em>required </em>Monreal to complete the arbitration process before filing a claim. This is a misrepresentation of the letter. Ohio Farmers, in denying the claim, made reference to Olympic\u2019s willingness to mediate and arbitrate its dispute with Monreal as called for by the construction contract. The reference merely reflects an <em>awareness </em>by Ohio Farmers of the possibility of a resolution of the parties\u2019 dispute by mediation and/or resolution. Nowhere in the letter did Ohio Farmers require arbitration as a condition precedent to filing suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">{\u00b6 35} The bond issued in this case is a performance bond, not a bond to insure Monreal against all damages under the construction contract. Under the terms of the bond, the claim arises when \u201cthe Contractor ceases work on the Contract,\u201d not when an arbitrator renders a decision on the dispute. The limitation-period clock began to run upon the contractor\u2019s cessation of work. Monreal\u2019s contention that the time period to bring its claims expired before it ever arose is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>{\u00b6 36} In the absence of a clear, unequivocal, and decisive act of waiver, the obligee of a performance bond is bound by the bond\u2019s limitation-of-action clause despite the contractual requirement for arbitration between the obligee and the principal of the bond. A mere awareness of the arbitration process by the bond issuer does not constitute a waiver of the limitation-of-action clause. As no clear waiver is evidenced under the circumstances of this case, the trial court properly granted directed verdict in favor of the bond issuer.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">{\u00b6 37} The judgment of the Lake County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b40-7\">Rice, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b40-8\">Grendell, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b33-11\">. Great Lakes Bank, the bank that financed the construction project, was named as the secondary obligee in the bond.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b34-6\">. Section 4.6.1 of the General Conditions part of the contract between Monreal and Olympic states, \"Any Claim arising out of or related to the Contract, except Claims relating to aesthetic effect * * * shall, after decision by the Architect or 30 days after submission of the Claim to the Architect, be subject to arbitration. Prior to arbitration, the parties shall endeavor to resolve disputes by mediation * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b35-10\">. The night before the arbitration, Paul Globokar, president of Olympic, informed the arbitrator by an e-mail that he had filed for bankruptcy and requested a continuance of the arbitration. The arbitrator was able to determine that the filing was for personal bankruptcy and decided that the hearing <em>would go </em>forward as scheduled without Olympic\u2019s participation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b35-11\">. This amount was derived from reducing the amount already paid directly to Olympic and/or on Olympic\u2019s behalf ($1,512,172) from the base contract price and adding approved change orders totaling $1,538,400.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b35-12\">. Ohio Farmers subsequently filed a third-party complaint against VIP Electric Company, a subcontractor that had agreed to indemnify Ohio Farmers, and its principals, Ellie and Kevin Vayo, as well as Olympic. VIP also filed a separate suit against Monreal, which was consolidated with the instant suit. VIP is not a party in the appeal before us, and the claims surrounding VIP are not at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b36-9\">. Ohio Farmers attempted to call Monreal\u2019s counsel, Tim McGarry and Michael Cicero, as witnesses, to show that Monreal did not rely on Ohio Farmers but instead relied on its own attorneys regarding the time to file suit. Ohio Farmers argued that these two attorneys were necessary and material witnesses, because they had communicated directly with Ohio Farmers regarding Monreal's claim under the bond and because they were responsible for failing to file the suit timely. Monreal moved the court to quash the subpoenas, claiming attorney-client privilege, and the court granted the motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b40-9\">Diane V.

The standard for granting a directed verdict is, \u201c[i]n essence,\u201d the same as the standard for granting summary judgment: \u201c \u2018whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Grau v. Kleinschmidt </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 84, 91, 31 OBR 250, 509 N.E.2d 399, quoting <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc. </em>(1986), 477 U.S. 242, 251-252, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202. Cf. Civ.R. 54(A)(4) (a motion for directed verdict shall be granted where \u201cthe trial court, after construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion is directed, finds that upon any determinative issue reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion upon the evidence submitted and that conclusion is adverse to such party\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-12\">{\u00b6 40} The issue of whether a limitation-of-action provision has been waived by the insurer is a factual issue to be decided by the jury. <em>Rak v. Safeco Ins. Co. of Am., </em>8th Dist. No. 84318, 2004-Ohio-6284, 2004 WL 2676740, at \u00b6 32; <em>Walls v. Kemper Ins. Cos., </em>10th Dist.

Family Ins. Co. v. Taylor, </em>5th Dist. No. CT2010-0014, 2010-Ohio-2756, 2010 WL 2414091, at \u00b6 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">{\u00b6 43} In the present case, there is no evidence that Ohio Farmers specifically denied liability under the bond. Monreal Funeral Home notified Ohio Farmers of its claim in April 2004. In June 2004, Ohio Farmers advised Monreal Funeral Home that it believed its \u201cobligations under the bond have not arisen\u201d and noted \u201ca number of disputes or issues relative to the referenced contract and bond.\u201d These included disagreements about the scope of the punch list and scope of completion and the principal\u2019s (Olympic Building Company\u2019s) willingness \u201cto complete undisputed contract items.\u201d Ohio Farmers stated that it believed \u201cOlympic [would] object to any owner completion as Olympic is prepared to complete the undisputed scope of completion.\u201d Moreover, \u201cgiven the disputes regarding the scope of completion, * * * [Ohio Farmers] is unable to obtain bids for completion.\u201d Finally, Ohio Farmers observed that \u201cthe Monreals and Olympic have agreed to arbitrate their disputes.\u201d Thus, \u201c[i]t would not be appropriate for [Ohio Farmers] to act as arbitrator by resolving on its own the scope of completion and the other disputes between the Monreals and Olympic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">{\u00b6 44} It is completely reasonable to construe this letter as notification that Monreal Funeral Home\u2019s claim was premature, rather than denied. Ohio Farmers did not wish to pay on a bond where the principal was willing to complete the work and where there were disputes regarding the work to be completed. Given these uncertainties, Ohio Farmers suggested that it was not even possible to obtain bids to finish the work. Finally, and sensibly, Ohio Farmers was reluctant to pay a claim that could not be determined until the arbitration process had determined the liabilities. It is difficult to imagine how Monreal Funeral Home could have brought suit against Ohio Farmers at this time when all the determinative issues, i.e., damages and liability, were currently the subject of arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">{\u00b6 45} The trial court and the majority misconstrue the law of waiver by imposing a heightened standard of proof on Monreal Funeral Home. As the basis for its decision, the majority agrees with the trial court that the June 2004 letter did not evince \u201ca clear, unequivocal and decisive waiver of the contractual time limitation.\u201d Simply stated, this is not the law of Ohio with respect to the waiver of contract limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>{\u00b6 46} The standard applied by the lower court and majority derives from the decision of <em>White Co. v. Canton Transp. Co. </em>(1936), 131 Ohio St. 190, 5 O.O. 548, 2 N.E.2d 501. Therein, the Ohio Supreme Court held: \u201cHe who affirms a waiver must prove it, and in so doing he must prove a clear, unequivocal, decisive act of the party against whom the waiver is asserted, showing such a purpose or acts amounting to an estoppel on his part.\u201d Id. at paragraph four of the syllabus. <em>White Co., </em>however, is readily distinguishable from the line of cases deriving from <em>Hounshell. </em>At issue in <em>White Co. </em>was the \u201cthe claim * * * that a party has waived the terms of a written contract and agreed to different terms by parole.\u201d Id. at 198. The \u201cwaiver\u201d at issue, \u201cin fact, if not in law, amount[ed] to a modification of the original contract.\u201d Moreover, the purported waiver occurred \u201cafter a breach of the original contract by, the party claiming the benefit of the waiver.\u201d Accordingly, the Supreme Court held that \u201cit [the purported waiver] should receive not only careful but serious consideration at the hands of the courts, as such an arrangement is diametrically opposed to sound business principles.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">{\u00b6 47} The sort of waiver at issue in <em>Hounshell, </em>as in the case before us, involves a limitation-of-action provision. Thus, there are different considerations that demand a lesser burden of proof. In <em>Hounshell, </em>the Supreme Court recognized that \u201c \u2018[b]y definition, contractual limitations are in derogation of the time period fixed by the legislature for bringing such actions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hounshell, </em>67 Ohio St.2d at 431, 21 O.O.3d 267, 424 N.E.2d 311. \u201cWhile courts are diligent to protect insurance companies from fraudulent claims and to enforce all regulations necessary to their protection, it must not be forgotten that the primary function of insurance is to insure. When claims are honestly made, care should be taken to prevent technical forfeitures such as would ensue from an unreasonable enforcement of a rule of procedure unrelated to the merits.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">{\u00b6 48} In <em>Hounshell, </em>the Supreme Court was asked to adopt a rule similar to that in <em>White Co., </em>i.e., \u201cthat the law of waiver, if applied, should only apply where it is found that the insurance company, by its overt acts, misled the insured into forbearing suit until after the limitation period had expired.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">{\u00b6 49} The Supreme Court rejected this standard as \u201ctoo narrow an interpretation of the law of waiver to be applied to this type of case.\u201d Id. Rather, the court held that a waiver \u201cin these types of cases\u201d may occur when the insurer, by its acts or declarations, has led the insured to delay bringing an action on the insurance contract in the reasonable expectation that the claim would be paid. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">{\u00b6 50} In the present case, Ohio Farmers advised Monreal Funeral Home that its obligations under the bond \u201chave not arisen\u201d based on various outstanding issues between Monreal and Olympic. There was no direct denial of the claim. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>The issue, then, is whether Ohio Farmers\u2019 actions, as evidenced by the June 2004 letter, reasonably induced Monreal Funeral Home to delay filing suit until after the limitations period had expired. That question is for the jury to decide. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
