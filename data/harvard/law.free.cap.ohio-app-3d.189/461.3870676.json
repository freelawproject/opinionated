For the following reasons, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b493-14\">{\u00b6 2} The magistrate\u2019s decision set forth the following statement of facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b493-15\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cOn February 24, 2008, Dayton Police Officers Spielman and Malson observed a vehicle in the area of West Third Street and James H. McGee. Upon running the plate of the vehicle, it was determined that the driver matched the physical description of the registered owner. The registered owner, Jason Byrd, was under a license suspension. Armed with this information, the officers conducted a traffic stop of the vehicle. Officer Spielman determined that the driver was, in fact, Jason Byrd. Byrd informed the officers that he had driving privileges. Byrd was placed in the back of the officer\u2019s cruiser. Byrd gave permission to the officers to locate his paperwork in the car evidencing his driving privileges. While in the car, Officer Malson smelled a strong odor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>marijuana. Officer Spielman did not smell this odor from outside of the vehicle while speaking to the driver. Officer Malson retrieved the paperwork and then looked into the center console of the vehicle, where he found several bags of marijuana. The total weight of the marijuana was approximately 186 grams. Byrd was charged with trafficking based upon the packaging of the marijuana and not on any other evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">{\u00b6 4} Upon Byrd\u2019s arrest, police seized his 2000 Bonneville and $231 in cash that was found on his person. Although Byrd was indicted on the charge of trafficking in marijuana, a felony, he entered a plea to and was convicted of attempted trafficking in marijuana, a first-degree misdemeanor, and was sentenced accordingly. On March 17, 2008, the Dayton Police Department filed a petition seeking the forfeiture of Byrd\u2019s car and cash. The magistrate denied the petition, and the Dayton Police Department filed objections. The trial court overruled the objections and adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision. The Dayton Police Department appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">{\u00b6 5} The Dayton Police Department\u2019s sole assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cThe trial court erred and abused its discretion in overruling petitioner-appellant\u2019s objections and adopting the magistrate\u2019s decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">{\u00b6 7} In its sole assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in denying its petition for the forfeiture of Byrd\u2019s car and cash. When reviewing a trial court\u2019s adoption of a magistrate\u2019s decision, we apply an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Fox, </em>182 Ohio App.3d 17, 2009-Ohio-1965, 911 N.E.2d 339, \u00b6 11. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s decision will be reversed only if the court\u2019s actions were unreasonable or arbitrary. Id., citing <em>Proctor v. Proctor </em>(1988), 48 Ohio App.3d 55, 60-61, 548 N.E.2d 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">{\u00b6 8} An underlying theme of appellant\u2019s assignment of error is that the trial court abused its discretion in finding that a written transcript was required to support appellant\u2019s objections; the appellant argues that because its objections were made to the magistrate\u2019s conclusions of law rather than to her findings of fact, a transcript of the hearing was not necessary. Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(b)(iii) requires that objections to a magistrate\u2019s factual findings must be supported by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>transcript, or by an affidavit if a transcript is not available. A CD-ROM of the proceedings does not fulfill the Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(b)(iii) requirement of a transcript. Instead, the objecting party must provide a <em>written </em>transcript, without which a trial court\u2019s review is necessarily limited to the magistrate\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>Leibold v. Hiddens, </em>Montgomery App. No. 21487, 2007-Ohio-2972, 2007 WL 1721347, \u00b6 16. See also <em>In re Estate of Stanford, </em>Montgomery App. No. 23249, 2010-Ohio-569, 2010 WL 597100, \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">{\u00b6 9} R.C. Chapter 2981 sets forth the procedures to be employed when the state or a political subdivision seeks forfeiture of a defendant\u2019s property. In this case, forfeiture of Byrd\u2019s cash could have been sought either as \u201cproceeds\u201d under R.C. 2981.02(A)(2) or as an \u201cinstrumentality\u201d pursuant to R.C. 2981.02(A)(3), while forfeiture of his car could have been sought as an \u201cinstrumentality\u201d pursuant to R.C. 2981.02(A)(3). The petition for forfeiture alleges that the vehicle and cash were \u201ceither contraband, proceeds, and/or an instrumentality</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\"> {\u00b6 10} R.C. 2981.02(A)(2) allows for the forfeiture of \u201c[p]roeeeds derived from or acquired through the commission of an offense.\u201d Generally, the term \u201cproceeds\u201d refers to the profit gained directly or indirectly from an offense. R.C. 2981.01(B)(11). The burden is on the state to show that the money has any connection to the underlying criminal offense. <em>State v. Ali </em>(1997), 119 Ohio App.3d 766, 770, 696 N.E.2d 285. The state \u201cmust demonstrate that it is more probable than not, from all the circumstances, that the defendant used [the money] in the commission of criminal offenses.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id. at 769. The same logic applies regarding sufficient proof that the money was proceeds of the criminal offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">{\u00b6 11} In this case, the magistrate concluded, and the trial court agreed, that \u201cthere is absolutely no evidence that the money seized from the Respondent, was proceeds as that term is defined in 2981.01(11).\u201d There is nothing inherently illegal about possessing cash. <em>State v. Roberts </em>(1995), 102 Ohio App.3d 514, 518, 657 N.E.2d 547. There is nothing in the record before us to contradict the conclusion that the cash was not the \u201cproceeds\u201d of criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">{\u00b6 12} Alternatively, property may be subject to forfeiture if it is \u201c[a]n instrumentality that is used or intended to be used in the commission or facilitation of any of the following offenses when the use or intended use, consistent with division (B) of this section, is sufficient to warrant forfeiture under this chapter:</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(a) A felony;</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(b) A misdemeanor, when forfeiture is specifically authorized * * *;</p>\n<p id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>{\u00b6 15} \u201c(c) An attempt to commit, complicity in committing, or conspiracy to commit an offense of the type described in divisions (A)(3)(a) and (b) of this section.\u201d R.C. 2981.02(A)(3). An \u201cinstrumentality\u201d is defined as \u201cproperty otherwise lawful to possess that is used in or intended to be used in an offense.\u201d R.C. 2981.01(B)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">{\u00b6 16} The magistrate began with an acknowledgment that Byrd\u2019s property <em>\u201cmay </em>be subject to forfeiture.\u201d (Emphasis sic.). Although the magistrate quoted all of R.C. 2981.02(A)(3), she confined her findings to subsections (a) and (b), and she did not specifically address subsection (c). Byrd was convicted of an attempt to commit a felony offense, which falls within R.C. 2981.02(A)(3)(c). To the extent that the trial court stated, \u201cThe Magistrate found that the currency and the vehicle could not be forfeited because the Respondent Jason Lee Byrd (\u2018Byrd\u2019) pled to and was convicted of a misdemeanor, rather than a felony charge,\u201d the trial court was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">{\u00b6 17} Byrd\u2019s property being potentially subject to forfeiture pursuant to R.C. 2981.02(A)(3)(c), the analysis next turns to the question of whether the property is an \u201cinstrumentality\u201d as contemplated by R.C. 2981.02(B). That section sets forth the relevant factors to be considered in determining \u201cwhether an alleged instrumentality was used in or was intended to be used in the commission or facilitation of an offense or an attempt * * * to commit an offense * * * in a manner sufficient to warrant its forfeiture.\u201d Those factors are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(1) Whether the offense could not have been committed or attempted but for the presence of the instrumentality;</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c(2) Whether the primary purpose in using the instrumentality was to commit or attempt to commit the offense;</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c(3) The extent to which the instrumentality furthered the commission of, or attempt to commit, the offense.\u201d R.C. 2981.02(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">{\u00b6 21} Neither the trial court nor the magistrate directly addressed whether either the car or the cash was an instrumentality. Just as the mere possession of cash is not unlawful, \u201c[tjhere is nothing even remotely criminal in possessing an automobile.\u201d <em>One 1958 Plymouth Sedan v. Pennsylvania </em>(1965), 380 U.S. 693, 699, 85 S.Ct. 1246, 14 L.Ed.2d 170. Rather, both the magistrate and the trial court proceeded to the next step, the proportionality review in accordance with R.C. 2981.09, although \u201cproceeds obtained from the offense are not subject to proportionality review under this section.\u201d R.C. 2981.09(B). \u201cProperty may not be forfeited as an instrumentality under this chapter to the extent that the amount or value of the property is disproportionate to the severity of the offense. The owner of the property shall have the burden of going forward with the evidence and the burden to prove by a preponderance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>evidence that the amount or value of the property subject to forfeiture is disproportionate to the severity of the offense.\u201d R.C. 2981.09(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">{\u00b6 22} In conducting a proportionality review, \u201cthe [trial] court shall consider all relevant factors including, but not limited to, the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c(l)The seriousness of the offense and its impact on the community, including the duration of the activity and the harm caused or intended by the person whose property is subject to forfeiture;</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c(2) The extent to which the person whose property is subject to forfeiture participated in the offense;</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c(3) Whether the offense was completed or attempted.\u201d R.C. 2981.09(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">{\u00b6 26} The magistrate did hold that the forfeiture was \u201cnot authorized by statute,\u201d and this was affirmed by the trial court. It is difficult for us to conclude whether this was a finding that misdemeanors <em>never </em>authorize a forfeiture (which would be in error) or that the facts before the magistrate did not authorize a forfeiture. When a party fails to file a transcript or an affidavit as to the evidence presented at the magistrate\u2019s hearing, the trial court, when ruling on the objections, is required to accept the magistrate\u2019s findings of fact and to review only the magistrate\u2019s conclusions of law based upon those factual findings. See, e.g., <em>Stewart v. Taylor, </em>Wayne App. No. 02CA0016, 2002-Ohio-6121, 2002 WL 315136181, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">{\u00b6 27} The magistrate is presumed to have considered \u201call relevant factors,\u201d including those specifically listed in the statute; she concluded, and the trial court agreed, that the forfeiture of Byrd\u2019s car was disproportionate to the offense for which he was convicted. Regarding the cash, the magistrate found, and the court agreed, that there was no evidence that it constituted \u201cproceeds.\u201d Concerning the vehicle, although neither the magistrate nor the judge explicitly determined that it was an \u201cinstrumentality,\u201d the magistrate did conclude, and the judge agreed, that forfeiture is disproportionate to the underlying crime (i.e., even if it had been an instrumentality). Without a transcript of the proceedings below, the trial court was obligated to accept the magistrate\u2019s conclusion that based on the facts before her, that forfeiture would be disproportionate to the severity of Byrd\u2019s crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">{\u00b6 28} Forfeitures are not favored either in law or in equity. <em>State v. Baumholtz </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 198, 202, 553 N.E.2d 635. Furthermore, \u201cbeing in derogation of private property rights, [any statutory forfeiture provisions] must be strictly construed.\u201d <em>State v. Bowshier </em>(Mar. 18, 1993), Clark App. No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>2937, 1993 WL 81813, citing <em>Ohio Dept. of Liquor Control v. Sons of Italy Lodge 0917 </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 532, 534, 605 N.E.2d 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">{\u00b6 29} Appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">{\u00b6 30} Having overruled the Dayton Police Department\u2019s sole assignment of error, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b498-9\">Donovan, P.J., and Grady, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b494-10\">.
