Sweeney, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">{\u00b6 1} Relators, Kathleen Dreamer, Rosie Grier, and Jacqueline Maiden, filed a complaint for a writ of mandamus against respondents, the Cuyahoga County prosecuting attorney and the Cuyahoga County Board of Commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-12\">{\u00b6 2} In 2004, Dreamer, Grier, and Maiden were employees of the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections (\u201cBOE\u201d). After the 2004 general election, the BOE was requested to perform a recount of votes in the presidential race. At the time of the recount, Maiden was the elections coordinator, Dreamer was the manager of the ballot department, and Grier was the assistant manager of the ballot department. According to the director of the BOE, Michael Yu, the BOE staff was advised by the prosecutor\u2019s office to conduct the recount using the same procedures they had used in past recounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-13\">{\u00b6 3} In December 2004, the BOE met to certify the results of the recount. During that meeting, information was disclosed suggesting that the BOE had not conducted the recount in accordance with Ohio law. In January 2005, the Green and Libertarian parties requested that respondent, the prosecuting attorney for Cuyahoga County, William Mason (\u201cthe prosecutor\u201d), to investigate. Because of his statutory obligation to represent the BOE, the prosecutor recused himself from any investigation of the 2004 recount. Ultimately, the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas appointed Erie County prosecuting attorney, Kevin Baxter, as special counsel in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-14\">{\u00b6 4} In August 2005, an assistant prosecuting attorney informed the BOE that subpoenas were being issued to the BOE staff. Director Vu of the BOE asked that the prosecutor request special counsel to provide legal assistance, at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>minimum, to explain the grand-jury process to those receiving subpoenas. The prosecutor did not provide any further legal counsel to the BOE or relators on any matter regarding the recount and did not apply for the appointment of independent counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">{\u00b6 5} Relators were indicted for election-law violations in 2005 and 2006. The propriety of these charges is not before this court in this mandamus action. Rather, it is the statutory right to legal representation under R.C. 309.09(A) and 305.14(A) that is involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">{\u00b6 6} After relators were indicted, they obtained them own independent counsel. Counsel for Dreamer repeatedly asked the BOE to ask respondents to apply to the court of common pleas to authorize respondent Cuyahoga County Board of Commissioners (\u201cthe commissioners\u201d) to employ him as legal counsel for relators. Maiden\u2019s counsel also requested that the BOE apply to the court to authorize the commissioners to pay Maiden\u2019s legal fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">{\u00b6 7} The BOE intended to seek the appointment of independent counsel for relators because it believed that the indictments were the direct result of the employees performing their official duties during the recount of the 2004 presidential election. Despite several requests by the BOE to the prosecutor and the commissioners, respondents did not apply to the court of common pleas for the appointment of independent counsel to represent relators. Respondents contend that because relators were indicted on criminal charges for violating Ohio election laws, the prosecutor could readily find that relators\u2019 conduct did not constitute a well-intended attempt to perform an official duty. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">{\u00b6 8} Relators have submitted affidavits attesting that BOE members, during two executive sessions, unanimously committed and agreed that the BOE would pay relators\u2019 legal fees and expenses if they were not convicted of any criminal conduct. It is also averred that an assistant county prosecutor informed BOE members that the county would pay the indicted employees\u2019 legal fees only if they were found not guilty. It is clear that relators have relied on these representations in obtaining independent legal counsel in the criminal proceedings without further pursuing the appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">{\u00b6 9} Relators filed this action in mandamus on September 18, 2009, requesting that this court order (1) respondents to make application to the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas for the retroactive appointment of independent counsel or, in the alternative, the court to appoint counsel for relators directly and (2) the commissioners to pay relators\u2019 legal expenses incurred by defending themselves against the criminal charges. Relators also request postjudgment interest, attorney fees and costs, and other appropriate relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>{\u00b6 10} Respondents filed a summary-judgment motion, arguing that for a variety of reasons, relators\u2019 writ of mandamus should be denied. After reviewing the facts of the case and the law, we deny respondents\u2019 summary-judgment motion and grant the relief requested in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">{\u00b6 11} In order for this court to issue a writ of mandamus, relators must establish that they have a clear legal right to the requested relief, respondents have a clear legal duty to perform the requested relief, and there is no adequate remedy at law. <em>State ex rel. Eshleman v. Fornshell, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 1, 2010-Ohio-1175, 925 N.E.2d 609, \u00b6 20. Moreover, mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that is to be exercised with caution and only when the right is clear. <em>State ex rel. Williams v. Brown </em>(1977), 52 Ohio St.2d 13, 15, 6 O.O.3d 79, 368 N.E.2d 838.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">{\u00b6 12} R.C. 309.09(A) confers upon the prosecuting attorney the following responsibilities: \u201cThe <em>prosecuting attorney shall be the legal adviser of </em>the board of county commissioners, board of elections, and all other <em>county officers </em>and boards * * *. The <em>prosecuting attorney shall </em>prosecute and <em>defend all suits and actions which any such officer or board directs or to which it is a party, </em>and no county officer may employ any other counsel or attorney at the expense of the county, except as provided in section 305.14 of the Revised Code.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 309.09(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">{\u00b6 13} R.C. 305.14(A), to which R.C. 309.09(A) refers, sets forth the procedure by which legal counsel other than the prosecuting attorney may be hired to advise or represent a county board or officer at the county\u2019s expense. The statute provides as follows: \u201cThe court of common pleas, <em>upon the application of the prosecuting attorney and the board of county commissioners, </em>may authorize the board to employ legal counsel to assist the prosecuting attorney, the board, or any other county officer in any matter of public business coming before such board or officer, and in the prosecution or defense of any action or proceeding in which such board or officer is a party or has an interest, in its official capacity.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 305.14(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">{\u00b6 14} It is undisputed in the instant case that respondents failed to apply for authorization of independent counsel for relators. We now turn to whether respondents\u2019 failure to make the application on relators\u2019 behalf entitles relators to relief in mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">{\u00b6 15} At the onset of this action, relators and respondents proceeded under the presumption that relators were county officers entitled to legal representation at the county\u2019s expense. At this court\u2019s request, the parties briefed the issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>whether relators were county officers in light of <em>State ex rel. Columbus Blank Book Mfg. Co. v. Ayres </em>(1943), 142 Ohio St. 216, 27 O.O. 176, 51 N.E.2d 636. After review, we distinguish <em>Ayres </em>and hold that under the plain language of R.C. 309.09(A) and 305.14(A), relators should have been considered county officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">{\u00b6 16} In <em>Ayres, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court considered the issue whether members of a county board of elections were answerable to the county auditor or the secretary of state regarding the payment procedure for \u201cpollbooks and tally sheets which were used in the [1941] general election.\u201d Id. at 217, 27 O.O. 176, 51 N.E.2d 636. Although the <em>Ayres </em>court determined that members of a county board of elections perform state, rather than county, functions, <em>Ayres </em>is distinguishable from the instant case for the following reasons: <em>Ayres </em>concerned board members, while this case concerns individuals who worked for the board, and <em>Ayres </em>was decided in 1943, ten years before R.C. 309.09 and 305.14 were enacted in 1953. Thus, the <em>Ayres </em>court did not consider these statutes in reaching its conclusion. See also <em>State v. Rousseau, </em>159 Ohio App.3d 34, 2004-Ohio-5949, 822 N.E.2d 847, \u00b6 20, quoting Ohio Ethics Commission, Advisory Opinion No. 93-004 (\u201c \u2018to espouse that the holding of <em>[Ayres\\ </em>stands for the proposition that members of a county board of elections are not county officers for all provisions of the Revised Code sweeps too broadly\u2019 \u201d [emphasis omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">{\u00b6 17} The first element that relators must establish in a mandamus action is that they have a right to relief. It is clear that relators are not entitled to representation by the prosecutor\u2019s office under R.C. 309.09, because of the conflict of interest inherent in concurrently defending a party and prosecuting that same party. Relators argue that they are entitled to representation under R.C. 305.14, which allows appointment of, and payment for, outside counsel under the following circumstances: \u201cThe court of common pleas, upon the application of the prosecuting attorney and the board of county commissioners, may authorize the board to employ legal counsel to assist * * * any other county officer * * * in the defense of any action or proceeding in which such * * * officer is a party or has an interest, in its official capacity.\u201d R.C. 305.14(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">{\u00b6 18} The term \u201ccounty officer\u201d is not defined in R.C. 305.14 or 309.09. \u201cUnless words are otherwise defined or a contrary intent is clearly expressed, we give words in a statute their plain and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Cincinnati Metro. Hous. Auth. v. Morgan, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 445, 2004-Ohio-6554, 820 N.E.2d 315, \u00b6 6. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th Ed.1999) 1113, defines \u201ccounty officer\u201d as follows: \u201cAn officer whose authority and jurisdiction are confined to the limits of the county served.\u201d In the public arena, an \u201cofficer\u201d is \u201ca person holding public office under a national, state, or local government, and authorized by that government to exercise some specific function.\u201d Id. See also <em>State ex rel. Attorney Gen. v. Brennan </em>(1892), 49 Ohio St. 33, 38-39, 29 N.E. 593 (holding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>when \u201ca person is clothed * * * with public functions to be exercised in the supposed interest of the people * * * and where such duties are wholly performed within the limits of a county, * * * the person lawfully filling such place is necessarily a county officer\u201d); <em>Leber v. Smith </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 548, 555, 639 N.E.2d 1159 (Douglas, J., concurring), quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed.1990) 351 (recognizing \u201ccounty officers\u201d as \u201c \u2018[t]hose whose general authority and jurisdiction are confined within the limits of the county in which they are appointed, who are appointed in and for a particular county, and whose duties apply only to that county, and through whom the county performs its usual political functions\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">{\u00b6 19} Under R.C. Title 35 and the authority of the Ohio secretary of state, the BOE was directed to conduct a recount of Cuyahoga County ballots in the 2004 presidential race at the request of the Green and Libertarian parties. The recount was conducted on December 16 and 17, 2004, before witnesses from each political party. On December 22, 2004, the BOE certified the results of the recount. Relators allege, and respondents do not dispute, the following facts regarding relators\u2019 roles during the recount of the 2004 presidential election.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">{\u00b6 20} Relators were appointed to their positions at the BOE pursuant to R.C. 3501.11(D). Relators\u2019 official job duties involved conducting local, state, and national elections solely within, and for the citizens of, Cuyahoga County. Relators were compensated solely from the Cuyahoga County budget.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">{\u00b6 21} Relator Maiden was the elections coordinator, which is the third highest ranking administrator at the BOE, behind the director and deputy director. Relator Maiden was present at all BOE meetings, and she was in charge of training the BOE staff for the election as well as the recount.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">{\u00b6 22} Dreamer was the ballot-department manager and relator Grier was the ballot-department assistant manager; Dreamer and Grier were the two individuals responsible for conducting the recount. They also helped train staff and conducted county elections.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">{\u00b6 23} Relators conducted the recount using procedures that were reviewed and approved by the prosecutor\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">{\u00b6 24} We find that relators were \u201ccounty officers\u201d for the purposes of R.C. 309.09 and 305.14. Relators were responsible for ensuring the accuracy of Cuyahoga County\u2019s role in a disputed national election. The performance of such an act is the sine qua non of the operation and continuing existence of a democratic government. Obviously, the members of the BOE require the assistance of many individuals in carrying out their mission and, in particular, to plan and administer the elections process. At all times, relators were authorized by the government to perform a specific function, namely, the recount. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>attempted to perform their official duties or responsibilities in good faith and in a well-intended manner, under close scrutiny, and in the presence of observers representing the public. This resulted in relators being named defendants, in their official capacity at the BOE, in actions alleging elections-law violations. Under R.C. 305.14(A), relators are entitled to representation to assist them in defending these actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">{\u00b6 25} Relators have established a clear legal right to relief in mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">{\u00b6 26} We turn our discussion to whether respondents have a clear legal duty to perform relators\u2019 requested relief, i.e., to make an application for the appointment of outside counsel and payment of attorney fees. Pursuant to R.C. 309.09(A) and 305.14(A), in order for a county officer to employ other counsel to represent her at the expense of the county, the prosecuting attorney and the board of county commissioners must apply to the court of common pleas. Further, R.C. 305.17 requires the board of county commissioners to \u201cfix the compensation of all persons appointed or employed under [R.C. 305.14], which with their reasonable expenses, shall be paid from the county treasury upon the allowance of the board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">{\u00b6 27} In this case, respondents did not file a joint application for the appointment of other counsel as set forth in R.C. 305.14(A). In light of respondents\u2019 failure to do so, relators were required to hire their own independent counsel. The record is clear that relators did not delay in asking the BOE several times to seek appointment of independent counsel. Relators and the BOE\u2019s requests, however, were unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">{\u00b6 28} A prosecuting attorney\u2019s duty in relation to county officers and boards is twofold under R.C. 309.09(A): first, the prosecutor \u201cshall be the legal advisor of * * * county officers and boards * * * in matters connected with their official duties\u201d; and second, the prosecutor \u201cshall prosecute and defend all suits and actions which any such officer or board directs or to which it is a party.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>also <em>State ex rel. Corrigan v. Seminatore </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 459, 465, 20 O.O.3d 388, 423 N.E.2d 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">{\u00b6 29} The Ohio Attorney General\u2019s Office has found that inherent in the prosecutor\u2019s duty to advise and represent is a basic determination that the officer or board member attempted to perform his or her official duties in good faith and a well-intended manner. 1990 Atty.Gen.Ops. No. 90-096. \u201cIt cannot be said, therefore, that there is ever found * * * a duty to defend as we normally understand that term. It would be more appropriate to say that the prosecuting attorney in such a case is under a duty to make a careful evaluation of such facts and circumstances and is then authorized to defend the officer concerned if such evaluation indicates that there is involved a well intentioned attempt to perform an official duty on the part of the defendant.\u201d 1954 Ohio Atty.Gen.Ops. No. 4567 at 574. Therefore, under R.C. 309.09, representation of a county officer is at the prosecutor\u2019s discretion, insomuch as the prosecutor must make the good-faith, well-intended determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">{\u00b6 30} R.C. 309.09 also prevents anyone but the prosecutor from representing a county officer except as provided in R.C. 305.14; therefore, other counsel ordinarily should not be appointed unless a proper application has been filed pursuant to R.C. 305.14. <em>Seminatore, </em>66 Ohio St.2d at 462-463, 20 O.O.3d 388, 423 N.E.2d 105; <em>State ex rel. Stamps v. Automatic Data Processing Bd. of Montgomery Cty. </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 164,167, 538 N.E.2d 105. \u201cApplication by the prosecuting attorney ordinarily is necessary because the counsel being appointed will fulfill a duty otherwise imposed by law upon the prosecuting attorney. Application by the board of county commissioners is necessary because it is that board which not only must fix the compensation to be paid for the person so appointed but also must provide the necessary funds for that purpose.\u201d <em>Seminatore </em>at 463, 20 O.O.3d 388, 423 N.E.2d 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">{\u00b6 31} However, courts have carved out an exception to the rule mandating a proper application under R.C. 305.14 before authorization of outside counsel. When the prosecuting attorney has a conflict of interest and fails to apply for the appointment of outside counsel when there is a duty to defend, \u201cthis joint application is not a prerequisite to a trial court\u2019s authorization of outside counsel.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Trumbull Cty. Bd. of Elections v. Trumbull Cty. Bd. of Commrs., </em>Trumbull App. No. 2009 TR 85, 2010-Ohio-2281, 2010 WL 2026075, at \u00b6 21. In <em>Seminatore, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court held that the prosecutor\u2019s or board of commissioners\u2019 failure to make this application when a conflict of interest exists constitutes an abuse of discretion, and mandamus is an appropriate remedy to compel action. <em>Seminatore </em>at 463-464, 20 O.O.3d 388, 423 N.E.2d 105. In such circumstances, the joint application may be ordered, or a court of common pleas may directly appoint legal counsel to represent the county officer. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number><em>State ex rel. Jefferson Cty. Children Servs. Bd. v. Hallock </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 179, 182-183, 28 OBR 269, 502 N.E.2d 1036; <em>State ex rel. Hillyer v. Tuscarawas Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 94, 637 N.E.2d 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">{\u00b6 32} Our analysis of R.C. 305.14 does not end, however, with compelling or bypassing the joint application to the trial court. A prosecutor is authorized to advise or represent a county officer pursuant to R.C. 309.09(A) after the good-faith and well-intended determination is reached. It follows then, that to authorize outside counsel to advise or represent a county officer, that same good-faith and well-intended evaluation must take place. Common sense dictates that a party other than a prosecutor with a conflict of interest should make this determination. In interpreting R.C. 305.14(A), we find that the General Assembly intended the court to play this role. \u201cThe court of common pleas * * * <em>may authorize </em>the board [of commissioners] to employ legal counsel to assist * * * [a] county officer in any matter of public business * * * and in the prosecution or defense of any action * * * in which * * * [the] officer is a party or has an interest, in its official capacity.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 305.14(A). Therefore, under R.C. 305.14(A), authorization of outside counsel when a conflict of interest exists is at the court\u2019s discretion, insomuch as the court must make a good-faith, well-intended determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">{\u00b6 33} In the instant case, it is uncontroverted that a conflict of interest exists and that neither the prosecutor nor the commissioners filed an application under R.C. 305.14 to appoint separate counsel for relators; consequently, counsel was not appointed by the court. As a result, relators retained their own independent counsel, relying on the representations of the BOE that relators\u2019 attorney fees would be paid for if the charges against relators did not result in convictions. Additionally, there is evidence in the record alleging that an assistant county prosecutor told the BOE that \u201cthe county would only pay the indicted employees\u2019 legal fees if they were found not guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">{\u00b6 34} We do not go so far as to find that pursuant to R.C. 305.14(A), the prosecutor and board of commissioners automatically have a duty to file an application in the trial court when a conflict of interest exists. Rather, we follow the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s guidance on this issue, and hold that failure to make the application pursuant to R.C. 305.14(A), under the facts of the instant case, constitutes an abuse of discretion. See <em>Stamps, </em>42 Ohio St.3d at 167, 538 N.E.2d 105 (holding that \u201cthe <em>Seminatore </em>court did not find that the prosecutor and board of county commissioners had a <em>duty </em>to apply for appointment of special counsel under the statute. * * * Thus, while it does not find a duty on the prosecutor\u2019s part, <em>Seminatore </em>does recognize mandamus as a means to compel an application for special counsel where an abuse of discretion has been shown\u201d [emphasis sic]).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>{\u00b6 35} Respondents have a clear legal duty under R.C. 305.14(A) to make an application for the appointment of legal counsel for relators and the payment of relator\u2019s legal expenses unique to the exceptional facts and circumstances in the instant case. We stress that the following factors were considered in our analysis: the prosecutor abused his discretion in failing to make the application; relators relied on the BOE\u2019s and the prosecutor\u2019s office\u2019s representations that the county would pay their legal fees; the prosecutor\u2019s office allegedly led the commissioners to believe that they could not make the application unilaterally and that relators were not entitled to appointed counsel; and the BOE publicly supported relators, essentially stating that they acted in good faith and a well-intended manner when performing their official job duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">{\u00b6 36} Additionally, we find that relators have established that they have no adequate remedy at law, thus entitling them to relief in mandamus. See <em>Seminatore, </em>66 Ohio St.2d at 463-464, 20 O.O.3d 388, 423 N.E.2d 105 (holding that when \u201cthe prosecuting attorney * * * refuses to afford counsel to a county board in defense of an action * * *, mandamus would be an appropriate remedy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">{\u00b6 37} Having determined that relators established the prerequisites of mandamus relief, we now turn to the timeliness of this action. Ohio case law holds that \u201c[a]n application for a writ of mandamus must be made within a reasonable time after the alleged wrongful act occurred.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Madden v. Windham Exempted Village School Dist. </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 86, 90-91, 537 N.E.2d 646. Laches will preclude a mandamus action if the party asserting the defense shows it has been materially prejudiced by an unreasonable and inexcusable delay, although \u201cprejudice will not be inferred from a mere lapse of time.\u201d Id., citing <em>Smith v. Smith </em>(1959), 168 Ohio St. 447, 7 O.O.2d 276, 156 N.E.2d 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">{\u00b6 38} Between August 2005 and February 2006, relators were indicted for election-law violations, and the final substantive proceedings in the matters occurred on September 30, 2008, without any convictions of guilt. Just shy of one year later, on September 18, 2009, relators filed this mandamus action.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">{\u00b6 39} Respondents\u2019 wrongful act, specifically, their failure to make a joint application in the court of common pleas for appointment of outside counsel and payment of legal fees, was ongoing throughout this litigation. For example, the former director of the BOE orally requested the prosecutor\u2019s advice on legal issues in this case on August 15, 2005, and made the same request in writing on August 17, 2005. The prosecutor refused to meet with the BOE on August 16, 2005, and recused himself from the case on August 18, 2005. On April 5, April <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>17, and July 16, 2006, the attorneys for Dreamer and Maiden sent letters requesting the BOE to petition respondents to make an application under R.C. 305.14(A). In response, the BOE requested that the prosecutor make a joint application. However, no action was taken. The BOE also requested that the commissioners make the application unilaterally; however, the prosecutor\u2019s office advised the commissioners that they did not have authority to do this and were not entitled to relief. The attorney for Dreamer again asked the BOE to take action on November 28, 2006. At all times, the prosecutor either failed or flatly refused to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">{\u00b6 40} In opposition to the instant writ, respondents argue that \u201cthe alleged wrongful act occurred as early as August 2005\u201d and at the latest \u201cby the time the indictments were returned against the relators.\u201d However, as discussed above, the wrongful act was ongoing and thus occurred far beyond the dates of the indictments. Cf. <em>Ohio Civ. Rights Comm. v. Triangle Real Estate Servs., Inc., </em>Franklin App. No. 06AP-157, 2007-0hio-1809, 2007 WL 1125842, at \u00b6 22 (recognizing that \u201ca continuing [wrongful] practice, rather than an isolated incident of wrongful conduct,\u201d will act to start the running of a statute of limitations from the most recent time the conduct occurred).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">{\u00b6 41} Respondents further argue that relators \u201cdid nothing to secure the appointment of outside counsel.\u201d This argument lacks merit because relators requested action under R.C. 305.14 multiple times both before and during litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">{\u00b6 42} Respondents\u2019 final argument that this writ should be time-barred is that granting the writ now would be materially prejudicial, because respondents and county taxpayers \u201cshould not have to pay for exorbitant legal fees for which they did not agree to be bound and over which they had no supervisory or fiscal control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">{\u00b6 43} This argument is not well taken, because R.C. 305.17 gives the commissioners the power to \u201cfix the compensation\u201d of relators\u2019 appointed counsel. In other words, the commissioners have fiscal control over the amount of legal expenses the county may bear under R.C. 305.14(A). Additionally, respondents are not required to \u201cagree\u201d to the appointment or payment of fees; rather, because of the prosecutor\u2019s conflict of interest, \u201cthe court of common pleas possessed jurisdiction to authorize the employment of outside counsel pursuant to R.C. 305.14 without the acquiescence of the county prosecutor.\u201d <em>Hallock, </em>28 Ohio St.3d at 181-182, 28 OBR 269, 502 N.E.2d 1036.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">{\u00b6 44} We are aware of a line of opinions from the attorney general that advises that R.C. 309.09 and 305.14 do not authorize \u201cthe reimbursement of county officers who have, on their own initiative, employed private legal counsel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>* * * for expenses incurred in a legal action which is no longer pending.\u201d 1988 Ohio Att.Gen.Ops. No. 88-055; 1990 Ohio Ops.Atty.Gen. 90-096. Although not binding on this court, attorney-general opinions are persuasive authority. <em>State ex rel. Van Dyke v. Pub. Emp. Retirement Bd., </em>99 Ohio St.3d 430, 2003-Ohio-4123, 793 N.E.2d 438. Nonetheless, we conclude that the instant case can be factually distinguished from the advisory opinions cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">{\u00b6 45} The advisory opinions determined that reimbursement was not authorized when counsel was hired outside the procedures specified in R.C. 305.14. In 1988, Ohio Atty.Gen.Ops. No. 88-055, the attorney general opined that the word \u201cemploy,\u201d as found in R.C. 305.14, contemplates present or prospective action; the word \u201creimburse,\u201d on the other hand, contemplates fees already expended. This distinction is important, according to the attorney general, because \u201cthe county <em>was not given the opportunity </em>to provide a defense * * * while the case was pending.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">{\u00b6 46} In the instant case, relators did not hire independent counsel merely on their own initiative. Relators relied on continuous support and representations from the BOE that their legal fees would be paid. Additionally, relators petitioned the BOE, who, in turn, petitioned respondents to apply for the appointment. In the end, the county refused to provide relators with advice, and respondents refused to make the appropriate application under R.C. 305.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">{\u00b6 47} The attorney general implied that he might reach a different conclusion in cases \u2014 such as the one before us \u2014 in which the prosecutor abused his discretion by failing to file an application for appointment. \u201cIn reaching this conclusion I wish to emphasize that I am not expressing the opinion that the situation here presented is one in which the prosecuting attorney and the board of county commissioners <em>should have filed </em>an application pursuant to R.C. 305.14(A) for authorization to hire private legal counsel.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 1990 Ohio Atty.Gen.Ops. No. 90-096.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">{\u00b6 48} We also recognize that reimbursement of legal fees has been permitted in circumstances when R.C. 305.14(A) approval for the appointment of counsel is obtained while the underlying budget dispute was pending. <em>State ex rel. Wilke v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 55, 65, 734 N.E.2d 811. See also <em>Seminatore, </em>66 Ohio St.2d at 465, 20 O.O.3d 388, 423 N.E.2d 105 (stating that R.C. 304.15(A) confers upon the court the power to authorize outside counsel appointments for public officers \u201cin a pending action where to do so is in the best interests of the county\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">{\u00b6 49} While we acknowledge that the idea of a \u201cpending\u201d legal action was contemplated by the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Wilke </em>and <em>Seminatore, </em>we find these references incidental to the propositions of law for which these cases stand. In reaching this conclusion, we take into consideration that the word \u201cpending\u201d is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>used once in the <em>Seminatore </em>opinion and, although \u201cpending\u201d is used four times in the <em>Wilke </em>opinion, it is not used at all in the court\u2019s discussion of legal expenses under R.C. 305.14. Notably, neither case involved the reliance on assurances of reimbursement that we must consider here.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">{\u00b6 50} It is inconsistent for respondents to stand in the way of proper procedural performance under R.C. 305.14(A) while arguing that relators\u2019 writ of mandamus must fail because the particulars of R.C. 305.14(A) were not followed. See <em>Barrett v. Picker Internatl., Inc. </em>(1990), 68 Ohio App.3d 820, 826, 589 N.E.2d 1372 (holding that \u201cplaintiffs\u2019 status as third-party beneficiaries cannot be used as both a sword to reap the benefits * * * and a shield to protect them\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">{\u00b6 51} Thus, in conclusion, we hold that under the limited circumstances of the instant case, relators are entitled to relief in mandamus. As the Eleventh District Court of Appeals of Ohio held in <em>State ex rel. Latell v. Watkins </em>(Dec. 4, 1987), Trumbull App. No. 3905, 1987 WL 26685, \u201cwe are not oblivious to the unique and special factors presented in this ease * * * [and] judgment with this writ of mandamus is expressly limited to the facts before us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">{\u00b6 52} Respondents are ordered to make an application to the court of common pleas pursuant to R.C. 305.14(A). The court of common pleas, upon finding that relators acted in good faith and a well-intended manner in performing their official job duties, may authorize retroactive appointment of counsel and reimbursement of legal expenses in an amount fixed by the commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">{\u00b6 53} We, therefore, grant relief in mandamus. Respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">Motion denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b464-9\">Kilbane, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b464-10\">Gallagher, A. J., dissents with separate opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b458-10\">. The parties dispute whether a county officer has a clear legal right to criminal defense counsel. We observe that the applicable statutes do not distinguish between civil and criminal matters and, therefore, allow for the appointment of outside counsel at county expense for the \"defense of any action or proceeding in which such board or officer is a party or has an interest, in its official capacity.\u201d R.C. 305.14(A). Ordinarily, criminal conduct does not arise in the scope of a county official\u2019s duties. However, we view as persuasive authority the attorney general's determination that the entitlement to legal counsel at county expense extends to county officials engaging in a good faith, well-intended attempt to perform official duties or responsibilities that result in criminal charges. 1990 Ohio Atty.Gen.Ops. No. 90-096. This is a case-by-case determination that requires close consideration of the specific factual circumstances of the county officer's conduct. See id.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b464-11\">Sean C. Gallagher, Administrative Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Abx\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-12\">{\u00b6 54} I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion. While I empathize with the position in which relators were placed and do not fully condone the actions of the prosecutor\u2019s office, I do not believe relators are entitled to mandamus relief under existing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-13\">{\u00b6 55} In order for relators to establish a clear legal right to have legal counsel appointed at the expense of the county, they must show that they are entitled to this relief under the applicable statutes. R.C. 309.09(A) requires the prosecuting attorney to defend all actions to which a county officer is a party and explicitly states that other counsel may not be employed at county expense \u201cexcept as provided in section 305.14 of the Revised Code.\u201d Thus, the inquiry is twofold: (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>were relators county officers, and (2) did they follow the statutorily required procedure to have counsel appointed at county expense?</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">{\u00b6 56} Although the parties did not specifically raise the county-officer issue in their initial briefs to this court, there is no doubt that this court cannot issue mandamus relief when a legal right does not exist. Relators have the burden of proving their entitlement to the requested extraordinary relief in mandamus, and this burden cannot be waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">{\u00b6 57} Relators were Cuyahoga County Board of Elections (\u201cBOE\u201d) employees who were acting as election officials during the recount of the 2004 presidential race. The record reflects that they were placed in a position of trust, were performing duties in furtherance of the public interest, and exhibited other characteristics of county officers. However, relators cite no controlling legal authority to support their position that they were in fact county officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">{\u00b6 58} Relators rely upon certain definitions of \u201ccounty officers\u201d in support of their argument. <em>State ex rel. Attorney Gen. v. Brennan </em>(1892), 49 Ohio St. 33, 38-39, 29 N.E. 593, was decided at a time when all county officers were elected officials. The discussion in the concurring opinion in <em>Leber v. Smith </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 548, 554-556, 639 N.E.2d 1159 (Douglas, J., concurring), concerning the plain meaning of the words as defined in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary was in relation to a county sheriff, who is considered a county officer under statutory provisions providing for the salaries and compensation of county officers, R.C. 325.02 and R.C. 325.06. Also, the Ohio Attorney General opinions have remained limited to deputy sheriffs and volunteer deputy sheriffs. See 1980 Ohio Atty.Gen. Ops. No. 76 and 1973 Ohio Atty.Gen.Ops. No. 73-055.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">{\u00b6 59} It must be recognized that the county boards of elections are of statutory creation. The authority of a county board of elections and the performance of duties by its members are governed by applicable statutory requirements. See <em>State ex rel. Husted v. Brunner, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 288, 2009-Ohio-5327, 915 N.E.2d 1215, \u00b6 11. The secretary of state has authority over the county boards of elections. R.C. 3501.05. The secretary of state has authority to issue directives and advisories to the various boards of elections and to compel election officials to observe the requirements of the law. R.C. 3501.05(B) and (M). Members of each county board of elections are appointed by the secretary of state, and the members and employees of the board of elections are subject to dismissal by the secretary of state. R.C. 3501.06, 3501.16. R.C. 3501.01(U)(6) defines employees of the board of elections as election officers. Significantly, R.C. 3501.14 explicitly states that \u201cemployees of the board [of elections] are not public officers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">{\u00b6 60} In <em>State ex rel. Columbus Blank Book Mfg. Co. v. Ayres </em>(1943), 142 Ohio St. 216, 27 O.O. 176, 51 N.E.2d 636, the Ohio Supreme Court held that \u201call <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>matters pertaining to the conduct of elections are state functions\u201d and that \u201c[mjembers of the boards of elections act under the direct control of and are answerable only to the Secretary of State in his capacity as the chief election officer of the state. They perform no county functions and <em>are not county officers.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id. at paragraphs one and two of the syllabus. The court found nothing to indicate any legislative intent to make the members of the boards of elections county officers. Id. at 220, 27 O.O. 176, 51 N.E.2d 636; see also <em>State ex rel. Moss v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1980), 69 Ohio App.2d 115, 117, 432 N.E.2d 210 (recognizing that a board of elections is not a political subdivision and its members are not county officers).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">{\u00b6 61} Although R.C. 309.09 and 305.14 were not enacted at the time <em>Ayres </em>was decided, the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision is clearly on point. Employees, like members, of the board of elections are under the control of the secretary of state and are performing state functions in the conduct of elections. Because relators\u2019 authority was under the directive of a state official and because they were performing state functions, I do not agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that they are county officers under the plain meaning of the term.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">{\u00b6 62} There is no question that a county board of elections has some connection with the county in which it is situated. The expenses of the board of elections are paid from appropriations by the board of commissioners of the county, and compensation of board of elections employees is paid in the same manner as other county expenses are paid. R.C. 3501.17. Board of elections employees may also be afforded county health-insurance coverage. R.C. 305.171.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, at best, members and employees of a county board of elections have been considered to be \u201cconnected with the county\u201d in certain respects. See <em>State v. Rousseau, </em>159 Ohio App.3d 34, 2004-Ohio-5949, 822 N.E.2d 847. However, there remains no clear legal authority for considering an employee of a board of elections as a \u201ccounty officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">{\u00b6 63} I acknowledge the critical role of the board of elections in effecting and preserving the democratic process. The record supports relators\u2019 claim that they were acting in their official capacity for the BOE and were performing their duties or responsibilities in a good faith, well-intended manner and in furtherance of the election process. Relators make a compelling argument for their being included among the \u201ccounty officers\u201d for purposes of R.C. 309.09(A) and 305.14(A). As discussed above, however, there is no controlling legal authority in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>support of their argument. The General Assembly may, therefore, wish to consider clarifying the definition and scope of the term \u201ccounty officers\u201d for purposes of R.C. 309.09(A) and 305.14(A) in order to prevent future controversies.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">{\u00b6 64} Even if it is presumed, for the sake of argument, that relators were county officers, they still fail to demonstrate that they have a clear legal right to the relief requested and that respondents have a clear duty to provide that relief. R.C. 305.14(A), to which R.C. 309.09(A) refers, sets forth the procedure that must be followed in order for legal counsel, other than the prosecuting attorney, to be hired at the county\u2019s expense. This statute requires authorization from the court of common pleas upon a joint application of the prosecuting attorney and the board of county commissioners. Further, R.C. 305.17 requires the board of county commissioners to fix the compensation of appointed counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">{\u00b6 65} In this case, a joint application was not filed by the prosecutor and the Cuyahoga County Board of County Commissioners (\u201cthe commissioners\u201d) for the appointment of other counsel as required by R.C. 305.14(A). Rather, relators hired their own independent counsel. Simply because respondents refused or ignored the requests of relators, which were made through the BOE, does not obviate the statutory requirement for a trial court\u2019s authorization for independent counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">{\u00b6 66} I recognize that relators may have been forced to obtain independent counsel because of respondents\u2019 inaction and that certain representations were made by both the prosecutor and the BOE concerning an intention to pay relators\u2019 legal fees and expenses if their cases were resolved without convictions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> I also recognize that relators made repeated requests to the BOE concerning the appointment of counsel as the criminal proceedings ensued. I do not fully condone the inaction of the prosecutor\u2019s office in this matter. Nevertheless, there was nothing that prevented relators from obtaining the statutorily required authorization once the prosecutor expressed a conflict of interest. I am constrained to follow the law in this matter and cannot ignore relators\u2019 own failure to comply with the statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">{\u00b6 67} If relators wished to employ independent counsel at county expense, they were statutorily required to obtain authorization for the appointment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>independent counsel during the pendency of the criminal proceedings. Because R.C. 309.09 prevents anyone but the prosecutor from representing a county officer except as provided in R.C. 305.14, other counsel ordinarily should not be appointed unless a proper application has been filed pursuant to R.C. 305.14.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>State ex rel. Corrigan v. Seminatore </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 459, 462-463, 20 O.O.3d 388, 423 N.E.2d 105; <em>State ex rel. Stamps v. Automatic Data Processing Bd. of Montgomery Cty. </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 164, 167, 538 N.E.2d 105. However, when the prosecuting attorney has a conflict of interest, this joint application is not a prerequisite to a trial court\u2019s authorization of outside counsel. <em>State ex rel. Trumbull Cty. Bd. of Elections v. Trumbull Cty. Bd. of Commrs., </em>Trumbull App. No. 2009 TR 85, 2010-Ohio-2281, 2010 WL 2026075, \u00b6 20-21; <em>Stamps, </em>42 Ohio St.3d at 167, 538 N.E.2d 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">{\u00b6 68} In such circumstances, a court of common pleas may directly appoint legal counsel to represent the county officer without the acquiescence of the prosecuting attorney upon determining that a conflict of interest exists and that the county officer is entitled to representation at county expense. See <em>State ex rel. Jefferson Cty. Children Servs. Bd. v. Hallock </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 179, 182-183, 28 OBR 269, 502 N.E.2d 1036; <em>Seminatore, </em>66 Ohio St.2d at 465, 20 O.O.3d 388, 423 N.E.2d 105. Likewise, an action in mandamus is an appropriate remedy to compel a joint application to the common pleas court. <em>Trumbull Cty.-, State ex rel. Hillyer v. Tuscarawas Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 94, 637 N.E.2d 311; <em>Seminatore, </em>66 Ohio St.2d at 463-464, 20 O.O.3d 388, 423 N.E.2d 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">{\u00b6 69} In this case, it is uncontroverted that neither the prosecutor nor the commissioners filed an application under R.C. 305.14 to appoint separate counsel for relators. However, despite the prosecutor\u2019s obvious conflict of interest, relators retained their own independent counsel without having counsel appointed by the court of common pleas. Relators did not file an action seeking the appointment of independent counsel at the time they were indicted or at any time during the pendency of the criminal proceedings against them. Counsel\u2019s requests to the BOE reflect that relators were aware of the conflict of interest and the statutory requirement for the authorization of independent counsel, yet they did not directly seek appointment by the court of common pleas. They filed this action in mandamus seeking the retroactive appointment of counsel and reimbursement for their legal expenses on September 18, 2009, four years after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>relators were subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury and well after the criminal proceedings concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">{\u00b6 70} R.C. 309.09 and 305.14 do not authorize a county officer to employ independent legal counsel other than in accordance with the specific terms and procedures set forth therein. 1990 Ohio Atty.Gen.Ops. No. 90-096. The statutes, as written, contemplate the authorization of outside counsel to assist in the defense of a pending action. As the Ohio Supreme Court has recognized, \u201cR.C. 305.14 confers power upon the common pleas court to authorize the appointment of legal counsel other than the prosecuting attorney to represent a county board or officer in a <em>pending action.\u201d Seminatore, </em>66 Ohio St.2d at 465, 20 O.O.3d 388, 423 N.E.2d 105. When the required authorization is not obtained, these statutes do not permit the board of county commissioners to reimburse a county officer for legal expenses in an action that is no longer pending. See 1988 Ohio Atty.Gen.Ops. No. 88-055; see also R.C. 305.17.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In this case, there was nothing that impeded relators\u2019 ability to obtain the required statutory authorization. I believe that the mandamus action is untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">{\u00b6 71} Accordingly, relators have failed to establish that they are county officers under existing law. Even if relators were considered county officers who were legally entitled to representation, they were required by statute to obtain authorization for the appointment of legal counsel at county expense during the pendency of their criminal proceedings. Furthermore, because of the prosecutor\u2019s conflict of interest, court authorization was not dependent upon a joint application. Relators failed to comply with the required statutory procedure. For the foregoing reasons, relators have not established their entitlement to the requested extraordinary relief in mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">{\u00b6 72} For the foregoing reasons, I believe respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment should be granted and the requested mandamus relief denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b466-8\">. Importantly, R.C. 305.171(J) specifically defines \"county officer or employee\" for purposes of that section to include \"a member or employee of the county board of elections.\u201d This would suggest that unless otherwise defined, they are not considered county officers or employees. Also, R.C. 309.09(A) specifically lists the \"board of elections\u201d apart from \u201cother county officers and boards,\u201d suggesting a distinction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b467-9\">. Relators have submitted affidavits attesting that the BOE members unanimously committed and agreed that the BOE would pay relators\u2019 legal fees and expenses if they were not convicted of any criminal conduct. It is also averred that Assistant Prosecuting Attorney Reno Oradini informed the BOE members that the county would pay the indicted employees\u2019 legal fees only if they were found not guilty. I recognize that relators may have relied on these representations in obtaining independent legal counsel in the criminal proceedings without further pursuing the appointment of said counsel. However, the enforceability of any promise to pay relators\u2019 legal fees is not an issue in this matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b468-7\">. I agree with the view expressed in fh. 1 of the majority opinion and the attorney general's determination concerning the appointment of legal counsel for county officials engaging in a good-faith, well-intended attempt to perform official duties or responsibilities that result in criminal charges. However, in my opinion, such a determination is not necessary to the disposition of the within matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b469-8\">. It is recognized that reimbursement of legal fees has been permitted in circumstances where approval for the appointment of counsel is obtained during the pendency of a matter. In <em>State ex rel. Wilke v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 55, 734 N.E.2d 811, relied upon by relators, an application for the appointment of legal counsel was filed with the common pleas court during the pendency of the budget dispute and reimbursement for legal expenses was found warranted under R.C. 305.14.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
