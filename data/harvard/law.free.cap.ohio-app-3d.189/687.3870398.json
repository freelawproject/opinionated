Plaintiff-appellant and appellee, the state of Ohio (\u201cthe state\u201d), appeals the trial court\u2019s decision to (1) use a nunc pro tunc order to amend its verdict from finding defendant guilty of a second-degree felony drug-possession offense to a third-degree felony offense and (2) sentence defendant to community control despite a presumption of prison. For the following reasons, we vacate the nunc pro tunc order, reinstate the trial court\u2019s original verdict, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-10\">{\u00b6 2} Defendant was indicted on two offenses involving a drug commonly known as khat. Count 1 charged her with aggravated drug trafficking, a first-degree felony. Count 2 charged her with unlawfully possessing khat in \u201can amount equal to or exceeding fifty times the bulk amount but less than one hundred times the bulk amount.\u201d The indictment referred to the offense in Count 2 as \u201caggravated possession of drugs\u201d and designated it a second-degree felony based on the amount of khat in defendant\u2019s possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-11\">{\u00b6 3} Defendant pleaded not guilty and waived her right to a jury. Because defendant, a Somalian, did not speak English, an interpreter assisted her during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>the bench trial, including when she testified. The court did not determine whether the interpreter was qualified or was giving adequate translations. In any event, the interpreter pledged to \u201cmake true interpretations of the testimony and the statements of witnesses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">{\u00b6 4} After the parties presented evidence, the court orally announced its verdict. The court found defendant guilty of \u201caggravated possession of drugs\u201d and noted that it is a second-degree felony. The court acquitted defendant of aggravated drug trafficking. On January 23, 2009, the court journalized the verdict in a written entry, which stated that defendant was guilty of \u201cpossession of drugs,\u201d a second-degree felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">{\u00b6 5} Defendant filed a motion for a nunc pro tunc order to correct the trial court\u2019s January 2009 entry. She complained that the court had failed to use the term \u201caggravated possession of drugs\u201d in the entry when it identified the offense for which she was convicted. She also claimed that the court made no finding regarding the amount of khat she unlawfully possessed, and she argued that if the court determines that the quantity \u201cwas less than fifty (50) times bulk amount, then the * * * verdict should have been * * * guilty of a lesser included offense, which is a felony of the third degree rather than a felony of the second degree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">{\u00b6 6} At the sentencing hearing, the court granted defendant\u2019s motion for a nunc pro tunc order. The prosecution conceded that the offense defendant had been convicted of should be referred to as \u201cpossession of drugs as opposed to aggravated possession of drugs.\u201d Thus, the court said, \u201cWhile there was a finding of guilty on aggravated possession, that should be amended to possession of drugs.\u201d Next, the court said that it did not \u201cissue a finding with respect to the amount of drugs that were in the possession\u201d of defendant, and it concluded that she possessed khat in an amount \u201c[gjreater than bulk, but less than 50 times bulk.\u201d The court stated that this amount made the drug offense a third-degree felony. The prosecution objected, claiming that the evidence established that defendant possessed khat in an amount constituting a second-degree felony, as alleged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">{\u00b6 7} Defendant\u2019s nephew served as an interpreter during the sentencing hearing, replacing the one who assisted defendant at trial. He pledged to \u201ctruly interpret the proceedings.\u201d The court did not determine whether the interpreter was qualified or providing adequate translations, however. In fact, the court expressed \u201cconcerns\u201d that defendant\u2019s nephew was not translating, and it admonished him, \u201cYou need to be interpreting to her, sir.\u201d When the court advised defendant of her right to allocution, the interpreter translated her as saying, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Your Honor.\u201d The court questioned this translation, responding, \u201cWell, she was saying an awful lot to be saying she was okay.\u201d At another point in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>hearing, the court asked, \u201cSir, are you going to interpret \u2014 I have some concerns. I think I\u2019m almost to a point where I \u2014 do I need to get an official interpreter, counsel?\u201d Despite these concerns, however, the court allowed defendant\u2019s nephew to serve as an interpreter for the balance of the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">{\u00b6 8} The prosecution asserted that there is a presumption of prison for defendant\u2019s offense, but the court imposed community control instead. In its August 2009 entry of conviction and sentence, the court stated that it had originally found defendant guilty of aggravated possession of drugs as a second-degree felony. It said, however, that pursuant to defendant\u2019s motion, it was issuing a nunc pro tunc order to amend its verdict to guilty of \u201cPOSSESSION OF DRUGS IN AN AMOUNT GREATER THAN BULK BUT LESS [THAN] 50 TIMES THE BULK, * * * a Felony of the Third Degree.\u201d It explained that it had reached this conclusion after considering the parties\u2019 arguments on the matter and reviewing the trial transcripts.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">{\u00b6 9} Defendant appeals, raising two assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-7\">DEFENDANT\u2019S FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-8\">The lower court abused its discretion by not evaluating the credentials of the interpreter used for defendant-appellant Shamso Jama.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-9\">DEFENDANT\u2019S SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-10\">The lower court denied defendant-appellant\u2019s constitutional rights by failing to ensure appellant was given an opportunity to speak in her defense and understanding what is taking place.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-11\">{\u00b6 10} The state has also appealed, raising the following assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtB\">PLAINTIFF\u2019S FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-12\">The trial court\u2019s sentence of community control was contrary to law, as a presumption of prison applied, and the court failed to make the requisite statutory findings to overcome the presumption.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-13\">PLAINTIFF\u2019S SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-14\">The trial court\u2019s decision to \u201camend\u201d the verdict exceeded the court\u2019s authority to correct clerical errors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-15\">{\u00b6 11} We first consider the state\u2019s appeal. R.C. 2945.67(A) governs the prosecution\u2019s right to appeal and provides that it may appeal \u201cas a matter of right\u201d a trial court\u2019s decision to dismiss a charging instrument, suppress evidence, return seized property, or grant postconviction relief. That statute also indicates that \u201c[i]n addition to any other right to appeal * * *, a prosecuting attorney * * * may appeal, in accordance with section 2953.08 of the Revised Code, a sentence imposed upon a person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a felony.\u201d Likewise, R.C. 2953.08(B)(1) states that the prosecution may appeal as a matter of right a trial court\u2019s failure to impose a prison term for a felony when there is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>presumption of imprisonment. Therefore, pursuant to R.C. 2945.67(A) and 2953.08(B)(1), the state may appeal as a matter of right the subject of its first assignment of error, which challenges the trial court\u2019s decision to sentence defendant to community control despite the presumption of prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">{\u00b6 12} Neither R.C. 2945.67(A) nor 2953.08(B)(1) provides the state an appeal as a matter of right on the subject of its second assignment of error, which challenges the trial court\u2019s decision to issue a nunc pro tunc order. With leave from the appellate court, however, the prosecution may appeal \u201cany other decision\u201d when there is no appeal as of right, so long as the final verdict is not being appealed. R.C. 2945.67(A). Although the trial court\u2019s nunc pro tunc order amended its verdict, the state is not appealing the merits of the final verdict. Instead, the state claims that the trial court erred in its use of the nunc pro tunc order, and, pursuant to R.C. 2945.67(A), it may appeal that issue with leave of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">{\u00b6 13} The decision to grant or deny a motion for leave to appeal by the state in a criminal case is solely within the discretion of the court of appeals. <em>State v. Fisher </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 22, 26, 517 N.E.2d 911, citing <em>State v. Fernan </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 216, 12 O.O.3d 206, 389 N.E.2d 843. We grant the state\u2019s motion for leave to appeal, given the significant role the nunc pro tunc order played in this case, by amending the verdict, and because the appeal provides an opportunity to resolve uncertainty about the proper use of these orders. We proceed, then, to the merits of the state\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">{\u00b6 14} A nunc pro tunc order corrects a judicial entry that contains error in the recordation of a court\u2019s decision. <em>State v. Nye </em>(June 4, 1996), 10th Dist. No. 95APA11-1490, 1996 WL 303675. Specifically, the order corrects errors that are merely clerical, and this type of error does not involve any legal determinations. <em>Warren v. Warren, </em>10th Dist. No. 09AP-101, 2009-Ohio-6567, 2009 WL 4809429, \u00b6 7, 11; <em>State v. Brown, </em>10th Dist. No. 08AP-747, 2009-Ohio-1805, 2009 WL 1027181, \u00b6 8. Stated another way, a nunc pro tunc order shall not modify a court\u2019s judgment or render a decision on a matter when none was previously made. <em>Nye. </em>Consequently, an entry corrected by a nunc pro tunc order must reflect what the court had actually decided, not what the court might or should have decided. <em>State ex rel. Mayer v. Henson, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 276, 2002-Ohio-6323, 779 N.E.2d 223, \u00b6 14. See also <em>Norris v. Ohio Dept. of Rehab. &amp; Corr., </em>10th Dist. No. 05AP-762, 2006-Ohio-1750, 2006 WL 891023, \u00b6 12 (noting that a nunc pro tunc order is limited to memorializing what the court previously decided). An improper nunc pro tunc order is void. <em>Warren </em>at \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>{\u00b6 15} Defendant contends that a nunc pro tunc order was necessary to correct the trial court\u2019s January 2009 entry journalizing its decision to find her guilty of a second-degree felony drug-possession offense. Pursuant to R.C. 2925.11, the degree of felony for a drug-possession offense depends on the amount of illicit drugs a person possessed. Defendant asserts that when the trial court journalized its verdict in the January 2009 entry, it did not determine the amount of khat she possessed. The state claims that when the court found defendant guilty of a second-degree felony, it implicitly decided that she possessed an amount of khat necessary for that conviction. The court said, however, that it was granting defendant\u2019s motion for a nunc pro tunc order because it did not issue a finding with respect to the amount of drugs that she possessed. It was improper for the court to use a nunc pro tunc order to make that finding because it required a legal determination; it did not involve a clerical mistake. See <em>Warren </em>at \u00b6 7, 11; <em>Brown </em>at \u00b6 8. Furthermore, the trial court using the nunc pro tunc order to make the finding is contrary to the requirement that the order not render a decision on a matter when none was previously made. See <em>Nye.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">{\u00b6 16} Due to its finding on the amount of khat that defendant possessed, the trial court also used the nunc pro tunc order to amend its verdict from a second-degree felony to a third-degree felony drug-possession offense. But the court misused the nunc pro tunc order by making that substantive modification to its verdict. See <em>Nye. </em>Likewise, by making the modification, the court strayed from the proper purpose of a nunc pro tunc order, i.e., to memorialize a previous decision. See <em>Henson </em>at \u00b6 14; <em>Norris </em>at \u00b6 12. In fact, the January 2009 entry already memorialized the court\u2019s previous decision to find defendant guilty of a second-degree felony. Therefore, the trial court erred by using a nunc pro tunc order to make a finding about the amount of drugs in defendant\u2019s possession and to amend its verdict from a second-degree felony to a third-degree felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">{\u00b6 17} The court purportedly issued the nunc pro tunc order also to clarify that defendant is guilty of possession of drugs. When it orally announced the verdict, it referred to defendant\u2019s offense as aggravated possession of drugs, which is the term used in the indictment. Because the drug at issue is a Schedule IV substance, however, R.C. 2925.11(C)(2) defines the offense as \u201cpossession of drugs.\u201d Because the January 2009 entry used that correct term, the court did not commit clerical error, requiring a nunc pro tunc remedy, when it journalized the name of the offense for which defendant was convicted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>{\u00b6 18} To conclude, the trial court\u2019s nunc pro tunc order is erroneous, and, therefore, void. See <em>Warren, </em>2009-Ohio-6576, at \u00b6 7. Consequently, we sustain the state\u2019s second assignment of error. Because the nunc pro tunc order is void, defendant\u2019s third-degree felony drug-possession conviction and sentence can no longer stand, and the court\u2019s original verdict, as journalized in the January 2009 entry, must be reinstated. We emphasize that our holding is limited to the trial court\u2019s improper use of the nunc pro tunc order, and we do not decide whether the trial court may amend its original verdict through a different procedure on remand. Finally, because defendant\u2019s sentence is vacated, the state\u2019s first assignment of error, which challenges that sentence, is moot, and we need not address it. See App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">{\u00b6 19} We next address defendant\u2019s first and second assignments of error, in which she contends that the trial court erred by failing to (1) evaluate the qualifications of the interpreters who assisted her during trial and sentencing and (2) ensure that they were providing adequate translations. Although the record establishes that the court did not determine whether the interpreters were qualified or were providing adequate translations, defendant did not raise these issues at trial, and, thus, forfeited all but plain error. See <em>State v. Newcomb, </em>10th Dist. No. 03AP-404, 2004-Ohio-4099, 2004 WL 1752850, \u00b6 22-23; Crim.R. 52(B). Plain error exists when there is error, the error is an obvious defect in the trial proceedings, and the error affects the outcome of the trial. <em>State v. Barnes, </em>94 Ohio St.3d 21, 2002-Ohio-68, 759 N.E.2d 1240. A court recognizes plain error with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances, and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">{\u00b6 20} A court must \u201cappoint a qualified interpreter\u201d for parties needing that assistance during legal proceedings. R.C. 2311.14(A)(1). See also Evid.R. 604 (stating that \u201c[a]n interpreter is subject to * * * qualification as an expert\u201d). And the interpreter is obligated to provide adequate translations. <em>Newcomb </em>at \u00b6 22, 26. Defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s concerns about the sentencing-hearing interpreter\u2019s translations established that he was neither qualified nor effective. But the record does not establish that had the court probed its concerns, it would have found that the sentencing-hearing interpreter was unqualified or providing inadequate translations. Instead, the interpreter assured the court, through an oath, that he would provide true translations. He did not alert the court to any problems with his ability to translate. Moreover, defense counsel was able to confer privately with defendant and the interpreter during the sentencing hearing, and counsel did not seek a new interpreter after the court asked if a different one needed to be appointed. In any event, the sentencing-hearing interpreter\u2019s qualifications and effectiveness are inconsequen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>tial, given that we have already decided, for different reasons, to vacate defendant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">{\u00b6 21} Although the bulk of defendant\u2019s assignments of error challenge the sentencing-hearing interpreter, portions of her argument appear to also contest the trial court\u2019s failure to evaluate whether the trial interpreter was qualified or providing adequate translations. Defendant cannot establish prejudice, however, because there is no proof that the interpreter actually was unqualified or was giving inadequate translations. Instead, he pledged to provide true translations and alerted the court to no problems about his ability to translate. In fact, soon after the interpreter began translating for defendant, a colloquy between the court and defendant about her jury waiver showed that she understood the translations because she gave responsive answers to the court\u2019s questions. And defendant\u2019s extensive testimony with the aid of the interpreter confirms that they were communicating with one another sufficiently.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">{\u00b6 22} In the final analysis, defendant has not established plain error from the trial court\u2019s failure to evaluate whether the interpreters who assisted her during trial and sentencing were qualified and giving adequate translations. Accordingly, we overrule defendant\u2019s first and second assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">{\u00b6 23} To summarize, we overrule defendant\u2019s two assignments of error and render moot the state\u2019s first assignment of error. We also grant the state\u2019s motion for leave to appeal its second assignment of error, and we sustain that assignment of error. Consequently, we vacate the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas\u2019s nunc pro tunc order, reinstate the court\u2019s original verdict as journalized in its January 2009 entry, and remand the matter for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b726-8\">Klatt and Sadler, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b724-7\">. The parties do not argue, and we do not decide, whether the indictment should have been amended to identify the offense as possession of drugs, which all parties now agree is the correct term.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
