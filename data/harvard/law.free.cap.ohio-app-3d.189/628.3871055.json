We affirm in part and reverse in part the decision of the trial court, and we remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">{\u00b6 2} Meyer owned and operated two roofing companies, one based in Ohio, and the other based in Kentucky. As part of his normal course of business, Meyer frequently rented equipment from Sunbelt Rentals (\u201cSunbelt\u201d) and its predecessor, NationsRent. Depending on the job requirements, Meyer would rent equipment ranging from ladders and lifts to heavy gear such as Bobcat skid steers and loaders.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">{\u00b6 3} According to Meyer\u2019s trial testimony, he considered his business relationship with Sunbelt and NationsRent to be \u201clong-term\u201d and \u201cbased mainly on trust and handshakes.\u201d Sunbelt often permitted Meyer\u2019s employees to rent equipment on his behalf, and Meyer would submit payment after returning the equipment. Meyer testified that he understood the rental period to include the time he rented the equipment until \u201cthe time it comes back\u201d and further stated that he would return the equipment past the estimated rental period 93 percent of the time. According to Meyer, Sunbelt never expressed an unwillingness to permit his rental past the estimated return date, and keeping the equipment longer required \u201cjust a phone call and that\u2019s it, and sometimes not even that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">{\u00b6 4} On August 22, 2008, Meyer rented a Bobcat loader from the Sunbelt rental facility in Colerain, Ohio, for use at a jobsite in Kentucky. Although Meyer did not sign a contract or rental agreement at that time, Sunbelt agreed to deliver the equipment to Meyer\u2019s job site the following day. While the estimated return date on the paperwork was August 29, 2008, Meyer did not return the equipment on that date. However, Sunbelt did not inform Meyer that they wanted the Bobcat back and instead continued to invoice Meyer for the rental.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">{\u00b6 <em>5} </em>On August 26, 2008, Meyer rented a second Bobcat loader from Sunbelt. Meyer signed the appropriate paperwork and made a $396.17 deposit. According to the rental contract, the return date for the second Bobcat was the day after Meyer rented it. As with the first Bobcat, Meyer did not return the second Bobcat by the estimated return date, and Sunbelt continued to charge him for the rental. Meyer also rented a chainsaw on August 26 for use at a jobsite in Kentucky but did not give an estimated return date. Meyer admitted at trial that the chainsaw was destroyed when his crew used it on a demolition project.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">{\u00b6 6} On August 31, 2008, the first Bobcat Meyer rented was involved in an accident in Kentucky when a car hit one of the Bobcat\u2019s wheels and spun out of control. Police investigated the accident, prepared a report, and instructed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>Meyer not to move the Bobcat. On September 23, 2008, the county called Meyer to inform him that the investigation was over, and Meyer contacted a Sunbelt employee to tell him that they were now authorized to move the Bobcat.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">{\u00b6 7} Unaware of the accident, a Sunbelt manager called Meyer for details. Meyer and the manager began arguing over who was responsible for the damages to the Bobcat and the fact that Meyer failed to contact Sunbelt immediately after the accident occurred. After several unsuccessful attempts to rectify the situation, communication between Sunbelt and Meyer broke down. Eventually, Sunbelt picked up the Bobcats and assigned Meyer\u2019s unpaid rental account to a collection agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">{\u00b6 8} Sunbelt later reported the incident to law enforcement, and Meyer was indicted on a single count of grand theft of property valued at more than $5,000 but less than $100,000. By the indictment and the bill of particulars, the state charged Meyer with purposely depriving Sunbelt of its property by exceeding the scope of Sunbelt\u2019s original consent at the time Meyer rented the equipment. The state specified that the theft offense occurred \u201con or about the 22nd through the 26th day of August, 2008.\u201d Meyer pleaded not guilty, and a jury heard the issue over a four-day trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">{\u00b6 9} After the state called its first witness, Sunbelt\u2019s manager, the parties held a sidebar conference during which they discussed the impact the manager\u2019s testimony had on the state\u2019s theory of the case. The trial court told the prosecutor that it did not understand what direction the state was taking with the case and gave the state an opportunity to review its strategy during a recess. When the parties returned from the recess, the state expressed its confidence in its original theory, as stated in the indictment and bill of particulars, that Meyer committed theft by exceeding the scope of Sunbelt\u2019s consent when he did not return the rental equipment by the return date. The trial then continued, and the state and Meyer presented evidence specific to the information provided in the indictment and bill of particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">{\u00b6 10} During deliberations, the jury posed the following question to the trial court: \u201cAre we deliberating that the defendant deprived the owner of property only on August 22nd through August 26th?\u201d The trial court called the parties\u2019 counsel into the courtroom, and read the jury\u2019s question into the record. The state then moved to amend the indictment to expand the timeframe of the theft to include dates ranging from August 22 until October 1, 2008. Over Meyer\u2019s objection, the trial court granted the state\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">{\u00b6 11} The jury found Meyer guilty of theft of property valued at more than $500, but less than $5,000, and the trial court sentenced him to three years of community control and ordered restitution. During oral arguments before this court, the state conceded that by virtue of the jury\u2019s verdict, Meyer had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>found guilty of theft of the chainsaw alone. Because the jury found that the value of the property involved in the theft was more than $500 but less than $5,000, the state conceded that the jury could not have found Meyer guilty of stealing the Bobcats because their combined value greatly exceeded $5,000.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">{\u00b6 12} Meyer now appeals his conviction, raising the following assignments of error. For ease of discussion and because the second assignment of error is dispositive of this appeal, we will discuss the assignments out of order.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Assignment of Error No. 2</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cEven if amendment were proper, the trial court abused its discretion in failing to discharge the jury and continue the matter, as Mr. Meyer had been misled and prejudiced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">{\u00b6 14} In his second assignment of error, Meyer argues that the trial court erred in not discharging the jury and ordering a continuance once the court permitted the state to amend Meyer\u2019s indictment. We find this argument meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">{\u00b6 15} According to Crim.R. 7(D), \u201cif any amendment is made to the substance of the indictment * * * the defendant is entitled to a discharge of the jury on the defendant\u2019s motion, if a jury has been impaneled, and to a reasonable continuance, unless it clearly appears from the whole proceedings that the defendant has not been misled or prejudiced by the defect or variance in respect to which the amendment is made, or that the defendant\u2019s rights will be fully protected by proceeding with the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">{\u00b6 16} The state charged Meyer with theft in violation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(2), which states that \u201c[n]o person, with purpose to deprive the owner of property or services, shall knowingly obtain or exert control over either the property or services in any of the following ways: * * * Beyond the scope of the express or implied consent of the owner or person authorized to give consent.\u201d The state\u2019s theory of the case was that Meyer exceeded the scope of Sunbelt\u2019s consent by failing to return the equipment by the due dates listed in the rental agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-11\">{\u00b6 17} According to the state\u2019s argument on appeal, Meyer was not misled or prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s permission to amend the date range for the offense. Conversely, Meyer moved the court to dismiss the jury and grant a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>continuance because he was misled and prejudiced by the amendment. Meyer argued that he relied on the dates submitted in the bill of particulars and indictment in building his defense and that because of the amendment, he was not able to offer a defense specific to the scope of Sunbelt\u2019s consent beyond August 22 through August 26. We agree with Meyer and find that the trial court should have dismissed the jury and continued the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">{\u00b6 18} According to the record, Meyer\u2019s defense was specifically crafted around the time frame offered in the indictment and bill of particulars. Meyer offered evidence in an attempt to prove that keeping the equipment past the estimated due dates did not exceed Sunbelt\u2019s consent. Meyer\u2019s counsel continually cross-examined state witnesses specific to the scope of Sunbelt\u2019s consent during the August 22 to August 26 time period, and Meyer testified in his defense specific to the original indictment dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c[Defense counsel] Now, on August 26th when you went into \u2014 when you spoke with Sunbelt, did you feel you \u2014 were you under the impression that you were still authorized and had consent to use and operate the first Bobcat?</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c[Meyer] I do, and I think that \u2014 that it was \u2014 I had a ton of consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c[Defense counsel] And Mr. Meyer, did you feel that you had authorization and consent to use and operate the second Bobcat on or about August 26, 2008?</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c[Meyer] Heck ya. [sic] Yes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-10\">{\u00b6 23} We decline to assume that Meyer presented his defense knowing that he should offer evidence regarding dates past those included in the indictment based on a possibility that an amendment to the indictment might occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-11\">{\u00b6 24} Additionally, and as admitted by the state, the chosen amended date of October 1, 2008, was completely arbitrary and was not a direct reflection of the evidence offered at trial. After the trial court agreed to grant the state\u2019s motion, the court asked the state to choose an amended date.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-12\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c[Court] Pick a date. Pick a date. What are you going to pick?</p>\n<p id=\"b662-13\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c[State] October 1st. I know that makes no sense, but like I said I don\u2019t have anything in front of me so \u2014 * * * I admit that it is an arbitrary date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-14\">{\u00b6 27} The fact that the state chose an arbitrary date heightens our concern that Meyer was misled and prejudiced by the amendment. Without specifically choosing a date based on evidence presented to the jury, there is no way of knowing whether Meyer had been afforded the opportunity to offer a defense specific to Sunbelt\u2019s consent past the arbitrarily chosen date. Instead, the state requested an amendment only after the jury submitted a question during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>deliberation concerning the time period it was permitted to consider in relation to the theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">{\u00b6 28} Prompted by the jury\u2019s question, the state sought to amend the alleged dates of the offense. This retroactive amendment left Meyer unaware of the charges against him during trial and further misled him to the point that we cannot say that Meyer\u2019s rights were fully protected by proceeding with the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">{\u00b6 29} We also note that soon after the trial started, the trial court gave the state the opportunity to reconsider its strategy and ponder its approach during a recess. The state, satisfied with the information and charges within the indictment and bill of particulars, failed to request an amendment at that time. Throughout the remainder of the state\u2019s case-in-chief, as well as during his own defense, Meyer presented evidence in an effort to dispute the charges and establish that his actions did not exceed the scope of Sunbelt\u2019s consent within the time frame indicated in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">{\u00b6 30} In reliance upon the state\u2019s representation that it was satisfied with the original indictment, Meyer\u2019s defense was specific to the dates listed in the original indictment rather than the amended October 1, 2008 date. As a result, we find that it cannot clearly be shown that the state in this case did not mislead the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">{\u00b6 31} Under Crim.R. 7(D), appellant was entitled to a discharge of the jury and continuance as requested. Meyer\u2019s second assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">Assignment of Error No. 3</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cThe state\u2019s evidence was insufficient to demonstrate that Mr. Meyer committed an offense by October 1, 2008, as the state failed to prove the date of Sunbelt\u2019s withdrawal of consent occurred by that date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">{\u00b6 33} In his third assignment of error, Meyer argues that his conviction is not supported by sufficient evidence. This argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-12\">{\u00b6 34} Although we have sustained Meyer\u2019s second assignment of error, we will address his sufficiency argument based on <em>State v. Meador, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 450, 2009-0hio-5861, 917 N.E.2d 273, in which the Ohio Supreme Court directed this court to address Meador\u2019s sufficiency argument even though we found that he was entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-13\">{\u00b6 35} When reviewing the sufficiency of evidence underlying a criminal conviction, an appellate court examines the evidence in order to determine whether such evidence, if believed, would support a conviction. <em>State v. Wilson, </em>Warren App. No. CA2006-01-007, 2007-Ohio-2298, 2007 WL 1394631. Therefore, \u201c[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">{\u00b6 36} According to the record, the return date listed on the rental contract for the chainsaw was August 27, 2008. Meyer testified that he did not return the chainsaw by that date and later admitted that the chainsaw had been destroyed by his work crew during a demolition project. When viewing this evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of theft in violation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(2) proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">{\u00b6 37} Meyer\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Assignment of Error No. 1</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion and violated Mr. Meyer\u2019s constitutional rights by amending the indictment after trial to extend the claimed dates of the offense and thereby alter the identity of the theft crime charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">Assignment of Error No. 4</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cThe verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">{\u00b6 40} Because we have found Meyer\u2019s second assignment of error dispositive of this appeal and have determined that reversal is warranted, Meyer\u2019s first and fourth assignments of error are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">{\u00b6 41} The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-12\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b664-13\">Bressler, P.J., and Ringland, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b661-12\">. Although made moot by our decision, we also note that the trial court erred by ordering Meyer to pay $3,498.08 in restitution when Sunbelt had already accepted payment from Meyer for the destroyed chainsaw. According to Meyer\u2019s presentence-investigation report, Sunbelt expressed a willingness to accept $3,409.08 as a settlement for the unpaid rental charges. However, by virtue of the jury's verdict, restitution should have been limited to the cost of the chainsaw, an amount Meyer had already tendered.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
