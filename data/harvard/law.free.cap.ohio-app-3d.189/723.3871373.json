We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b755-13\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant, D.M. (\u201cMother\u201d), and appellee, J.M. (\u201cFather\u201d), were granted a divorce in May 2004. Mother was named the residential parent of the couple\u2019s three minor children. Mother and Father have been involved in contentious litigation since that time. In 2005, Mother obtained a civil protection order against Father. Father filed two civil lawsuits against Mother, which he dismissed. In 2005, Father brought a motion for modification of custody, which he withdrew upon resolution of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-14\">{\u00b6 3} The couple\u2019s oldest daughter suffered from mitochondrial disease and passed away in December 2006. Mitochondrial disease refers to any one of the at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>least 1,500 diseases in which a person\u2019s body does not make enough energy to support the body\u2019s functions. The disorder inhibits the body\u2019s ability to function normally and can affect, for example, the muscles, nervous system, digestive system, or multiple systems. Because mitochondrial disease is often genetically inherited, both parents were concerned that their youngest daughter, M.M., might also be afflicted with the disease. Father contacted Dr. Bruce Cohen, an expert in mitochondrial disease at the Cleveland Clinic, who had treated M.M.\u2019s older sister. The parties also consulted with Dr. Natowicz, another physician at the Cleveland Clinic. Although the diagnosis of mitochondrial disease can be at times verified through a muscle biopsy, the parties, in consultation with Dr. Cohen, declined to engage in that invasive procedure. Eventually, the parties were told that M.M. also suffered from the disease. Dr. Cohen recommended that the parties give M.M. a \u201cmitochondrial cocktail\u201d that consisted of a variety of vitamins that are believed to be helpful to persons suffering with the disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">{\u00b6 4} M.M.\u2019s primary physicians were at Akron Children\u2019s Hospital (\u201cChildren\u2019s\u201d). Mother, who is a nurse, had the primary responsibility for caring for M.M.\u2019s older sister as well as M.M. According to the guardian ad litem, Mother\u2019s excellent care is the reason M.M.\u2019s sister lived as long as she did. Mother and Father often attended meetings with doctors together; however, in light of Father\u2019s travel schedule, Mother also attended meetings when Father was absent. Mother kept extensive records regarding her observations of M.M.\u2019s symptoms and would report these symptoms to the doctors. These symptoms, which can be indicative of mitochondrial disease, included fatigue, elevated heart rate, low blood pressure, heat intolerance, night terrors, diarrhea, and food intolerance. M.M.\u2019s treatment became progressively more invasive and involved. In consultation with M.M.\u2019s doctors, a \u201cG-tube\u201d was inserted into M.M. to provide nourishment. In addition, a \u201cMediport\u201d was surgically implanted to treat what appeared to be a gamma-globulin deficiency. Both parents were involved in the consultation and decision to implant the devices. The doctors at Children\u2019s consulted with Dr. Cohen regarding the procedures. After an initial discussion, Dr. Cohen contacted M.M.\u2019s physician to ensure that the doctor felt it was necessary to proceed with the G-tube. Dr. Cohen was told by that doctor that the procedure was necessary. As a result, M.M. received her nutrition by way of the G-tube and did not eat ordinary food. M.M. was required to conduct her daily activities wearing a heavy backpack and generally, had a very limited lifestyle. At night, M.M. was hooked to an IV, which was in her bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">{\u00b6 5} Although Father did not often observe the symptoms that Mother reported, he largely deferred to Mother regarding M.M.\u2019s care because of Mother\u2019s medical training and because she was with M.M. the majority of the time. Mother was often critical of the manner in which Father cared for M.M. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>and contacted the guardian ad litem and M.M.\u2019s doctor\u2019s to report her concerns regarding Father\u2019s care. Father felt obligated to follow Mother\u2019s precise directives, and Father would be denied companionship if he questioned Mother regarding M.M.\u2019s care. Father made an effort to allow M.M. to engage in activities typical for a child of M.M.\u2019s age. Mother tended to be more restrictive and viewed these activities as posing a great risk to M.M.\u2019s health.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">{\u00b6 6} In early November 2007, M.M. was admitted to Children\u2019s on two separate occasions. Dr. Peter Cooper White, who was treating M.M. and had examined her medical history, began to question whether M.M. actually had mitochondrial disease. A conference was convened involving all of M.M.\u2019s treating physicians. Dr. Bruce Cohen participated by telephone. Dr. Daryl Steiner, director of the Care Center at Children\u2019s, was also asked to consult on the matter in order to determine whether M.M. was a victim of her Mother\u2019s Pediatric Condition Fabrication (\u201cPCF\u201d), formerly known as Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> PCF is a psychological condition in which usually the parent falsifies or exaggerates symptoms in order to convince others that the child is ill. The physician who ordered the implantation of the feeding tube was not present at the meeting. In addition, the doctors did not contact the doctor who had originally detected the gamma-globulin deficiency and had recommended the installation of the Mediport.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">{\u00b6 7} As a result of this conference, the physicians questioned the accuracy of M.M.\u2019s diagnosis. They also became suspicious that Mother may have falsified or exaggerated M.M.\u2019s symptoms. The group decided that all medical intervention should be withdrawn, including M.M.\u2019s surgically implanted feeding tube and Mediport. The group also believed that the likelihood of being able to bring about significant change in M.M.\u2019s medical care would be impossible with Mother making the decisions. Although Dr. Steiner had never met Mother, based upon the conference, he prepared a document entitled \u201cSuspected Child Abuse and Neglect Record/Consultation,\u201d in which he asserted that Mother had pursued medical treatment for an illness that had never been diagnosed and that Mother\u2019s pattern of behavior was consistent with \u201cFictitious Illness by Proxy Syndrome,\u201d also known as Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy. The doctors also decided that it was appropriate to refer the matter to the Summit County Children\u2019s Services Board (\u201cCSB\u201d) to assist with the withdrawal of the medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">{\u00b6 8} Dr. Cooper White spoke to Mother and told her about the meeting. Mother was surprised to learn that he and the other doctors felt that M.M. did not have mitochondrial disease. Dr. Cooper White told Mother that the doctors recommended the removal of the surgically implanted devices and the cessation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>of medications. He also informed Mother that CSB was involved. Mother agreed to the recommendations. Dr. Cooper White did not believe that Mother agreed to follow the physicians\u2019 advice out of concern about CSB\u2019s involvement. Dr. Steiner was unaware that Mother had agreed to the recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">{\u00b6 9} CSB contacted Ellen Kaforey, the guardian ad litem and parent coordinator. She was informed that CSB intended to take custody of M.M. The guardian ad litem promptly filed an emergency motion for transfer of custody to Father. In this motion, she attached the document that Dr. Steiner had prepared. The trial court immediately issued an order granting custody to Father and prohibiting Mother from having any contact with M.M. or Children\u2019s. After filing the motion, the guardian ad litem told Mother that she was not convinced that Mother suffered from PCF. The guardian ad litem explained that although she was not convinced of the diagnosis, she felt that it was better for M.M. to be with Father instead of in a foster home.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">{\u00b6 10} In light of the accusations concerning Mother\u2019s alleged falsification of M.M.\u2019s symptoms, Mother promptly submitted to a full evaluation by an expert on PCF. The record reflects that Mother filed several motions in which she averred that she did not have PCF and in which she attached the expert\u2019s report. In late November 2007, a hearing took place regarding the motion for emergency custody. The magistrate entered an order on January 3, 2008 in which Mother\u2019s request for visitation was denied. Subsequent to this order, Mother filed several motions seeking visitation with M.M. and other relief. Mother\u2019s motions were never heard by the court. As a result, Mother had no contact with M.M. for many months. Eventually, the guardian ad litem intervened to establish visitation because M.M. wanted to see Mother. Further discussions ensued concerning the entry of a court order for companionship; however, according to Mother and her counsel, the proposed order did not contain all of the agreed terms. Ultimately, in September 2008, the trial court entered an order for supervised companionship between Mother and M.M. for one day per week. This order was marked \u201cseen but not approved\u201d as to Mother and her counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">{\u00b6 11} In June 2008, Father filed his motion seeking the reallocation of parental rights and responsibilities. Several months later, the guardian ad litem filed a notice of dismissal of her November 2007 emergency motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">{\u00b6 12} An evidentiary hearing on Father\u2019s motion took place before a magistrate. Father\u2019s witnesses were Dr. Steiner, Dr. Cooper White, and Dr. Cohen. Father also offered his own testimony and Mother\u2019s. Mother\u2019s witnesses included the guardian ad litem, Dr. Boles, an expert in mitochondrial disease, and two nurses who cared for M.M. and had observed M.M.\u2019s symptoms. The parties stipulated that the court could take judicial notice of a psychological evaluation of Mother in 2005 and was located in the Family Court Services file.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>{\u00b6 13} The record reflects that Father did not substantiate the original allegation that Mother was afflicted with PCF, as none of the witnesses offered testimony that Mother was diagnosed with the disorder or that M.M. was a victim of child abuse. Dr. Steiner and Dr. Cooper White related the circumstances surrounding the November 2007 physician\u2019s meeting. At best, their testimony reveals that the physicians suspected that M.M. was a victim of Mother\u2019s PCF and that Mother had falsified or exaggerated M.M.\u2019s symptoms. Dr. Cooper White ultimately concluded that M.M. had been overtreated and that the medical profession had failed M.M. He did not believe that Mother was responsible for the medical care that M.M. received. He acknowledged that M.M.\u2019s medical records reflect a consistent diagnosis of mitochondrial disease and that if a parent was told of this diagnosis, it would be reasonable to assume that the diagnosis was true. Dr. Cooper White had no knowledge that any medical professional had ever suggested to Mother that M.M. did not have a mitochondrial disease. Dr. Boles, Mother\u2019s expert, also believed that M.M. had been overtreated and that there had been insufficient communication between the mitochondrial specialists and M.M.\u2019s other doctors.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">{\u00b6 14} Dr. Cooper White also stated that he was never able to conclude that Mother had made up M.M.\u2019s symptoms. He also acknowledged laboratory testing that verified symptoms associated with mitochondrial disease. Likewise, Dr. Steiner could not recall a single instance in which Mother had falsified M.M.\u2019s symptoms. He also acknowledged that many of the attributes of PCF, such as physician shopping and lack of communication among doctors, were not present in this case. Dr. Steiner also conceded that other than speculation, there was no specific evidence that Mother had made up or exaggerated any symptoms. There was also acknowledgement that once the medical devices were removed, Mother did not pose a threat to M.M. Mother presented the testimony of two nurses who were present in the home and had personally observed many of the symptoms Mother reported to the doctors.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">{\u00b6 15} Dr. Cohen testified that at the November 2007 physician\u2019s meeting, he concluded that M.M. was not afflicted with mitochondrial disease. However, his opinion was premised upon the presumption that the symptoms that had been reported to him were not true. Mother\u2019s expert, Dr. Boles, opined that M.M. is afflicted with a mild form of mitochondrial disease. He explained that it is common for one family member to be severely afflicted with the disease and others to be mildly affected. He acknowledged that it is more difficult to diagnose the mildly affected person. In reviewing M.M.\u2019s medical records, Dr. Boles stated that there were symptoms of mitochondrial disease present in M.M. and that M.M.\u2019s lab testing was highly consistent with the reported symptoms. Dr. Boles also stated that the symptoms that had been reported were not only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>consistent but \u201cclassic\u201d in a patient with mild mitochondrial disease. Dr. Boles also explained that it was typical for children with a mild form of the disease to have more problems when younger, around age three to five. Such children may then become asymptomatic through the school-age years until puberty, because puberty imposes higher energy demands on the body. He stated that M.M.\u2019s current lack of symptoms does not make it less likely that she is afflicted with mitochondrial disease. He also recommended that M.M. be closely monitored by her physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">{\u00b6 16} The magistrate recommended that parental rights and responsibilities be reallocated to Father. Mother objected to the magistrate\u2019s decision, and all of her objections were overruled by the trial court. Mother has timely appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">II</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-6\">Assignment of Error Number One</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-7\">The trial court erred in upholding the magistrate\u2019s decision as that decision was not supported by the manifest weight of the evidence and the evidence did not support the conclusion that a change of custody was necessary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">{\u00b6 17} A trial court possesses broad discretion with respect to its determination of custody, and its decision will not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion. See <em>Miller v. Miller </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 71, 74, 523 N.E.2d 846. Thus, the trial court\u2019s determination will not be disturbed unless the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140. As Mother also challenges the trial court\u2019s factual findings, its decision regarding questions of fact should be reversed if it is against the manifest weight of the evidence. See, e.g., <em>Scott v. Hong, </em>9th Dist. Nos. 08CA0010 and 08CA0018, 2009-Ohio-780, 2009 WL 427442, at \u00b6 18; <em>State ex rel. Rogers v. Elbert, </em>180 Ohio App.3d 284, 2008-Ohio-6746, 905 N.E.2d 235, at \u00b6 10-11. \u201cJudgments supported by some competent, credible evidence going to all the essential elements of the case will not be reversed by a reviewing court as being against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">\u201cBEST INTEREST\u201d ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b760-11\">{\u00b6 18} R.C. 3109.04(E)(1)(a) provides that a trial court can modify the designation of residential parent if it finds that a change in circumstances has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>occurred since the prior allocation and that modification is necessary to serve the best interest of the child. The statute further provides that \u201c[i]n applying these standards, the court shall retain the residential parent designated by the prior decree * * *, unless a modification is in the best interest of the child\u201d and one of three circumstances applies: either that (1) \u201c[t]he residential parent agrees to a change in the residential parent,\u201d (2) \u201c[t]he child, with the consent of the residential parent * * *, has been integrated into the family of the person seeking to become the residential parent,\u201d or (3) that the harm \u201ccaused by a change of environment is outweighed by the advantages of the change of environment to the child.\u201d R.C. 3109.04(E)(1)(a). Practically speaking, the court must first make a threshold determination that a change in circumstances has occurred. <em>Neighbor v. Jones, </em>9th Dist. No. 24032, 2008-Ohio-3637, 2008 WL 2814311, at \u00b6 6-8. If a change of circumstances is demonstrated, the trial court must then determine whether the modification is in the best-interests of the child. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">{\u00b6 19} The factors to be considered with respect to the child\u2019s best interest are enumerated in R.C. 3109.04(F)(1)(a) through (j). The trial court found that the best-interest factors that were relevant to the matter included R.C. 3109.04(F)(1)(d) (child\u2019s adjustment to home, school, and community), (e) (\u201cmental and physical health of all persons involved\u201d), (f) (\u201cparent more likely to honor and facilitate court-approved parenting time\u201d), (h) (whether any parent has been convicted of an offense resulting in child being an abused child or a neglected child), and (i) (whether the residential parent \u201chas continuously and willfully denied the other parent\u2019s right to parenting time in accordance with an order of the court[]\u201d). Mother does not challenge the trial court\u2019s conclusion that these factors were relevant by virtue of the evidence. In addition, Mother has not specifically challenged the trial court\u2019s best-interest determinations. Instead, Mother has generally asserted that the evidence did not support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that a change in custody was necessary. However, we conclude that there was competent, credible evidence to support the trial court\u2019s best-interest determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">Child\u2019s adjustment to home, school, and community</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">{\u00b6 20} Under R.C. 3109.04(F)(1)(d), the trial court must consider M.M.\u2019s adjustment to home, school, and community. M.M. previously resided with Mother, her older sister, and older brother. During some of this time, M.M. undoubtedly observed her sister\u2019s progressive illness and the medical care that was taking place in the home. Father described the atmosphere in Mother\u2019s home as unhealthy and dominated by illness and death. Father identified M.M.\u2019s positive changes since residing with him, which included changes in both her physical and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>mental well-being. Father described his home as a positive environment in which M.M. could flourish without living under a cloud of illness and fear of death. Father stated that M.M. had previously lived in an atmosphere \u201cwhere sickness ruled the house, not just the physical sickness but the thought of sickness.\u201d Father further stated that the \u201cidea of sickness was all around her.\u201d For example, in M.M.\u2019s room there was an IV pole next to her bed. Father has encouraged M.M. to engage in extracurricular activities and to behave as any normal child would of M.M.\u2019s age. Toward that end, M.M. participates in swimming twice weekly and has progressed from level one to level four in her swimming classes. He stated that M.M. was much more comfortable in the water now and that nine months ago, M.M. was afraid to jump in the water. Now, M.M. jumps off of the diving board. He described Mother as being more limiting as to M.M.\u2019s activities. For example, according to Father, Mother discouraged swimming as too dangerous to M.M. \u201cbecause of the antibodies and disease.\u201d Mother stated that M.M. was enrolled in tap dance, tumbling, and ballet classes. She acknowledged that she had reported to doctors that M.M. was sometimes fatigued after her activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">{\u00b6 21} The guardian ad litem stated that M.M. had expressed to her that she liked living at her Father\u2019s home and that she liked her current school and friends. The guardian ad litem acknowledged that M.M. also expressed a desire to visit with Mother. However, the guardian ad litem felt that it was in M.M.\u2019s best interest to be with Father because he provides a very loving home and a good environment and he communicates with Mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">{\u00b6 22} Father also stated that M.M.\u2019s relationship with his current wife was \u201cfantastic\u201d and that his wife loved M.M. as if she were her own child. Father also stated that M.M. is very close to her paternal grandparents and that in the past Mother had done all that she could to keep M.M. away from Father and his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">{\u00b6 23} Mother and Father live in different cities with different school districts. Mother stated that M.M. enjoyed the school in her district and had made good friends. In contrast to the guardian ad litem\u2019s testimony, Mother stated that M.M. had told her she did not like her current school. Father described M.M. as loving school and being very happy there, where she has made many new friends. He stated that M.M. is reading and enjoys math. He also supported M.M.\u2019s desire to keep in touch with one of her friends from her previous school.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">Mental and physical health of all persons involved</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">{\u00b6 24} R.C. 3109.04(F)(1)(e) requires consideration of the mental and physical health of everyone involved. There was significant evidence concerning M.M.\u2019s physical and mental health. With respect to her physical health, Dr. Cooper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>White stated that M.M. is healthy and has been weaned from all medical devices and drugs. He also stated that M.M. is at a healthier weight and that there were no limits on her lifestyle. Father stated that M.M. had been overweight when he obtained emergency custody of M.M. and he felt that her fatigue was symptomatic of being overweight and out of shape. Since that time, M.M. has lost weight and has been able to engage in physical activities such as swimming and playing at the park. Father described M.M. as a \u201cball of energy\u201d and said that there was a \u201cnight and day difference\u201d when comparing M.M. at present versus one year before. Father also stated that M.M. is now very confident, and she does not have the same fears or insecurities as she had before. He indicated that school was difficult for her and \u201ctough on her confidence\u201d because she was embarrassed about having to wear the backpack at school and being different from the other children. Father stated that he worked hard to let M.M. know that although her sister was sick, she is not sick. He stated that he reinforces that it is normal to be sick or to have a minor injury and such conditions would pass and are not life-threatening, as they might have been for her older sister. Father stated that he and his wife are helping M.M. cope with her sister\u2019s death and its impact on M.M. Father indicated that through much work, M.M.\u2019s attitude has changed with regard to how she feels about herself, how she looks at the death of her sister and her sister\u2019s life, as well as her own life.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">{\u00b6 25} Father expressed concern about Mother\u2019s mental state and felt that Mother had a need to do all that she could to prove that she was right about M.M.\u2019s illness. Father alluded to the 2005 psychological evaluation of Mother, which he claimed indicated that there were issues concerning Mother\u2019s mental health. Father felt that Mother needed the children to be sick because she needed and wanted pity and sorrow. Father also related that Mother\u2019s perception of symptoms was more dramatic than his. For example, if M.M. had diarrhea, he saw it as ordinary but Mother did not. Due to Mother\u2019s concern about M.M.\u2019s heat sensitivity, Father had to convince Mother to allow M.M. to go on an extended field trip to \u201cSafety Town.\u201d Because Mother did not feel M.M. could tolerate the heat in the bus, Father drove M.M. there himself. Dr. Cooper White described Mother as overly vigilant about M.M.\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">{\u00b6 26} The guardian ad litem expressed concern that after the death of M.M.\u2019s sister, Mother was so overcome with grief that she had refocused her energies on M.M., which resulted in \u201covermedicalizing\u201d her. She felt that Mother needed to obtain counseling to address her issues. The guardian ad litem believed that M.M. had been subjected to many procedures she did not need and had many limitations on her activities. Despite the fact that she could have been a healthy, normal, active child, M.M. was instead restricted to her bed and hooked up to TV's and feedings tubes. The guardian ad litem described Mother as having an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>obsessive concern regarding M.M.\u2019s health and said that Mother had a feeling that \u201cthere is danger lurking around the corner.\u201d She stated that if M.M. sneezes, Mother will call the doctor. She also described Mother as being entrenched in a position that M.M. has mitochondrial disease and is unable to see the \u201cbig picture\u201d with regard to M.M. The guardian ad litem was concerned that although she had encouraged Mother to visit with M.M., Mother\u2019s refusal to do so was a \u201cprotest\u201d about M.M.\u2019s improper removal from her custody. The guardian ad litem was also concerned that Mother did not send Christmas presents to M.M. and instead kept a Christmas tree in her home until May when M.M. visited in her home.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Parent more likely to honor and facilitate court-approved parenting time/interference with parenting time</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">{\u00b6 27} R.C. 3109.04(F)(1)(f) and (i) require consideration of which parent is \u201cmore likely to honor and facilitate court-approved parenting time rights or visitation and companionship rights\u201d and whether Mother, as residential parent, has \u201ccontinuously and willfully denied [Father\u2019s] right to parenting time.\u201d Father testified that whenever he disagreed about M.M.\u2019s symptoms or care, visitation was taken from him. He stated that \u201c[w]henever I stepped out of line in her mind, I wouldn\u2019t see my kids for a week or two.\u201d On one occasion, Mother rebuked Father for having sent some information directly to a doctor instead of directing the information to her as she had instructed. Father stated that Mother would not allow Father to be involved in the care of the children if he did not do things exactly the way she told him.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">{\u00b6 28} With respect to Father, the guardian ad litem testified that Father had been very good about trying to make sure that M.M. visited with Mother. Although Father expressed concern about Mother having unsupervised visitation with M.M., the guardian ad litem indicated that Father was willing to follow the recommendations of outside professionals as to visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">{\u00b6 29} The guardian ad litem also stated that she felt that Father would make sure that Mother visits with M.M., whereas there was a pattern of Mother putting impediments in Father\u2019s ability to visit, and Mother was not as conducive to trying to facilitate visitation as Father was. The guardian ad litem described Mother as being unwilling to allow Father to make up time when he had been traveling.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">Whether any parent has been convicted of an offense resulting in child being an abused or neglected child</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">{\u00b6 30} R.C. 3109.04(F)(1)(h) requires the court to consider whether any parent has been convicted of an offense resulting in a child being an abused child or a neglected child. The trial court acknowledged that Mother had not been charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>with or convicted of any crime in connection with her care of M.M.; however, it found that the decision of M.M.\u2019s treating physicians to refer the matter to CSB was relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">{\u00b6 81} Upon careful and thorough review of the record, we agree with Mother that serious allegations were made against her that were not substantiated at trial. Thus, while Mother has pointed to evidence that discredits the premise upon which custody was initially transferred to Father, the trial court\u2019s determination as to whether a change in custody was in M.M.\u2019s best interest extended beyond the issues that prompted the emergency transfer of custody. In light of all of the evidence in the record, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s decision to modify the allocation of parental rights and responsibilities was not an abuse of discretion. We also conclude that the trial court\u2019s determination that a reallocation of parental rights and responsibilities was in M.M.\u2019s best interest was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. Mother\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-6\">Assignment of Error Number Two</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-7\">The trial court erred in denying the appellant\u2019s motion in limine based upon Evidence Rule 708 as well as overruling her objection at trial to Dr. Steiner\u2019s testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">{\u00b6 32} In Mother\u2019s second assignment of error, she argues that the trial court erred by denying her motion in limine based upon Evid.R. 703 and overruling her objections at the magistrate\u2019s hearing to Dr. Steiner\u2019s testimony. Mother asserts that Dr. Steiner\u2019s testimony was not proper pursuant to Evid.R. 703 because his expert opinions were not based on facts that he observed.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-11\">{\u00b6 33} The magistrate denied Mother\u2019s motion in limine and the trial court affirmed the magistrate\u2019s denial of the motion. \u201cA ruling on a motion in limine is an interlocutory ruling as to the potential admissibility of evidence at trial and cannot serve as a basis for reviewing error on appeal.\u201d <em>Beggs v. Shue, </em>9th Dist. No. 04CA0031, 2005-Ohio-1128, 2005 WL 602692, at \u00b6 40. Thus, we will confine our review to whether the trial court erred in overruling Mother\u2019s objections to the admission of Dr. Steiner\u2019s testimony during the evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-12\"> {\u00b6 34} Evid.R. 703 provides that \u201c[t]he facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by [him] or admitted in evidence at the hearing.\u201d \u201cAn expert witness\u2019s opinion \u2018must be based upon facts within the witness\u2019 own personal knowledge or upon facts shown by other evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rasalan v. TJX Operating Cos., Inc. </em>(1998), 129 Ohio App.3d 364, 370, 717 N.E.2d 1123, quoting <em>Burens v. Indus. Comm. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>(1955), 162 Ohio St. 549, 55 O.O. 436, 124 N.E.2d 724, paragraph one of the syllabus. \u201cAs long as an expert bases an opinion at least in major part on facts or data perceived by him or admitted into evidence Evid.R. 703 has been satisfied.\u201d <em>Farkas v. Detar </em>(1998), 126 Ohio App.3d 795, 798, 711 N.E.2d 703.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">{\u00b6 35} Witnesses presented at trial can be categorized as either fact witnesses or expert witnesses. A fact witness testifies \u201cwith respect to matters relevant to the case and within [his] personal knowledge.\u201d <em>State v. Reinhardt, </em>9th Dist. No. 08CA0012-M, 2009-Ohio-1297, 2009 WL 735971, at \u00b69, citing Evid.R. 402; Evid.R. 602. On the other hand, an expert witness testifies \u201cwhen the subject matter of the testimony is related to matters that are beyond the knowledge or experience of laypersons; the witness possesses \u2018specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training or education\u2019 that relate to the subject matter; and the witness testifies based on \u2018reliable scientific, technical, or other specialized information.\u2019 \u201d <em>Reinhardt </em>at \u00b6 9, quoting Evid.R. 702(A) and (C). \u201cPersons who may qualify as an expert in certain circumstances may be called at other times as fact witnesses to testify as to matters within their knowledge.\u201d <em>Reinhardt </em>at \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">{\u00b6 36} Mother has not identified with particularity the objectionable expert opinions that Dr. Steiner rendered during the hearing. We note that in its journal entry, the trial court erroneously stated that \u201cDr. Steiner testified that his original diagnosis was Munchausen Syndrome by [P]roxy, but that he later changed the diagnosis to pediatric condition fabrication or falsification.\u201d However, the portion of the transcript the trial court cited in support of its finding consists of Dr. Steiner\u2019s explanation that a physician had asked him to engage in a consultation to determine whether M.M. was a victim of what was then known as Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy but has subsequently been relabeled and renamed as pediatric condition fabrication, or PCF. On direct examination, Dr. Steiner did not offer an expert opinion as to whether M.M. suffered from mitochondrial disease, whether Mother was diagnosed with PCF, or whether M.M. was actually a victim of PCF. Dr. Steiner related that in the course of that meeting, \u201c[b]ased on the opinion of the physicians at the tablet,] it was determined that [M.M.] did not have a mitochondrial disease.\u201d However, Dr. Steiner was not asked whether <em>in his opinion </em>M.M. had mitochondrial disease. We note that Dr. Steiner was not identified as an expert by Father, and Father did not ask the magistrate to qualify Dr. Steiner as an expert during the hearing. Had Dr. Steiner been qualified as an expert witness and offered an expert opinion on these subjects, he would have been required to disclose the underlying facts and data upon which he based his expert opinion. See <em>Pakeeree v. Pakeeree </em>(Mar. 11, 1992), 9th Dist. No. 15186, 1992 WL 48508, at *3. However, the substance of Dr. Steiner\u2019s testimony consisted of relating what had happened during the confer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>ence of doctors at Children\u2019s during which it was decided that medical treatment should be withdrawn from M.M. and that M.M. should be removed from Mother\u2019s custody in order to accomplish that goal. Thus, Evid.R. 703 was inapplicable. See <em>Reinhardt </em>at \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">{\u00b6 37} In her merit brief, Mother also contends that \u201ceven without Rule 703, almost all of Dr. Steiner\u2019s testimony was impermissible hearsay,\u201d and hence, Mother\u2019s objections to Dr. Steiner\u2019s testimony should have been sustained. However, Mother has not developed her argument on appeal. She has neither specifically identified which testimony was hearsay, nor has she offered applicable legal authority to support her argument. To the extent that Mother takes exception to those portions of Dr. Steiner\u2019s testimony where he testified as to what Dr. Cohen said, we note that Dr. Cohen\u2019s testimony was admitted into evidence and thus the court was able to fully evaluate what Dr. Cohen actually said. Accordingly, we overrule Mother\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">{\u00b6 38} The trial court\u2019s reallocation of parental rights and responsibilities to Father was not an abuse of discretion. The trial court\u2019s determination that a reallocation of parental rights and responsibilities was in M.M.\u2019s best interest was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. The trial court did not err in overruling Mother\u2019s objections to Dr. Steiner\u2019s testimony.
