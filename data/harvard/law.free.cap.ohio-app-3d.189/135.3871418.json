For the reasons that follow, the judgment is reversed, and this matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant, Melissa Sedlack, n.k.a. Tillinghast (\u201cthe mother\u201d), sets forth the following assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cI. Appellee\u2019s counsel and the magistrate engaged in an ex parte conversation regarding the substance of the magistrate\u2019s decision to the prejudice of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cII. The trial court erred in modifying the stipulations of the parties in its decision and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cIII. The trial court failed to apply the factors contained in Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 3109.051 and the trial court failed to consider the child\u2019s wishes in determining the best interests of the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">{\u00b6 6} The undisputed facts relevant to the issues raised on appeal are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-12\">{\u00b6 7} The parties were divorced in 1997 and are the parents of one minor child. The mother, who lives in Erie County, Ohio, is the residential and custodial parent of the child; the father, a resident of Texas, was granted parenting time. In September 2008, the father filed a motion requesting modifications of an October 2006 judgment regarding parental rights and responsibilities. The mother then filed a motion requesting a modification of the father\u2019s parenting time and an in camera interview of the minor child, then 11 years old. A magistrate interviewed the child on February 23, 2009, immediately prior to the commencement of the hearing on the motions. The magistrate\u2019s decision was filed on July 8, 2009; on July 22, 2009, the mother filed objections and a motion for a new trial. On September 10, 2009, the trial court issued a judgment entry denying the motion for a new trial and adopting the magistrate\u2019s decision. The mother filed an appeal to this court from the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-13\">{\u00b6 8} In her first assignment of error, the mother asserts that on an undetermined date following the hearing, the magistrate contacted the father\u2019s attorney and engaged in an ex parte communication regarding the substance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>the magistrate\u2019s findings and decision. The mother further asserts that the magistrate asked the father\u2019s attorney to draft the decision, which the mother claims was done. The mother claims that at no point did the magistrate contact her attorney to discuss the findings and review the draft decision, or to inform her of the magistrate\u2019s request that the father\u2019s attorney prepare the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">{\u00b6 9} The father does not dispute the mother\u2019s claim that ex parte contact occurred between the magistrate and the father\u2019s counsel during the time between the conclusion of the hearing and the release of the decision. In response, the father merely states that after both parties submitted written closing arguments, the magistrate \u201cinstructed counsel to provide him with a draft of an opinion.\u201d The father states that there was no \u201cconversation\u201d between counsel and the magistrate and that the magistrate contacted his attorney via email \u201cto facilitate any changes the Magistrate might want to make * *</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">{\u00b6 10} We note preliminarily that both parties refer in their appellate briefs to a complaint concerning this matter that the mother\u2019s counsel filed with the Disciplinary Counsel of the Supreme Court of Ohio. According to the father, the matter was investigated and eventually dismissed. The father argues on appeal that because the Disciplinary Counsel has already ruled on the complaint, it is not appropriate for the mother to raise the issue of the ex parte communication now. There is no dispute that the mother\u2019s claim of an inappropriate communication between the magistrate and the father\u2019s counsel was brought before the Disciplinary Counsel. However, that complaint and the resulting ruling are not a part of the record before this court and cannot be considered as we evaluate the merits of the mother\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">{\u00b6 11} The mother asserts that the judgment entry must be vacated based on the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Roberts, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 71, 2006-Ohio-3665, 850 N.E.2d 1168. In <em>Roberts, </em>the prosecutor assisted the trial court in drafting the findings of fact for a death sentence without the knowledge of defense counsel. In its decision, the Supreme Court stated: \u201c[0]ur confidence in the trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion is undermined by the fact that the trial judge directly involved the prosecutor in preparing the sentencing opinion and did so on an ex parte basis.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 159. The court found that \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s consultation with the prosecutor, particularly when undertaken without the knowledge or participation of defense counsel, can neither be ignored nor found to be harmless error.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 162. Thus, <em>Roberts </em>vacated the death sentence and remanded the case for resentencing and drafting of a new sentencing opinion. In so doing, the court stated: \u201cWe cannot cure the deficiencies in the preparation of the sentencing opinion by our own independent assessment. * * * The trial court\u2019s decision to use the prosecutor in preparing the sentencing opinion constitutes a grievous violation of the statutory deliberative process. It is so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>severe a violation that independent reweighing cannot serve as an adequate remedy.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 162-163.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">{\u00b6 12} A magistrate alone is charged with preparing a decision respecting any matter referred under the Rules of Civil Procedure. See Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(a). It is undisputed in this matter that the magistrate contacted the father\u2019s counsel regarding preparation of the decision. Upon consideration of the foregoing, we find that the magistrate\u2019s decision to involve the father\u2019s counsel in preparing the decision without opposing counsel\u2019s knowledge constituted a \u201cgrievous violation of the deliberative process.\u201d It is immaterial whether the contact between the magistrate and the father\u2019s counsel in this case occurred by way of e-mail, as the father claims, or by way of personal conversation. A blatant instance of ex parte communication took place at a crucial point in the judicial process, ultimately undermining this court\u2019s confidence in the impartiality of the magistrate\u2019s decision. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">{\u00b6 13} Based on our finding as to appellant\u2019s first assignment of error and our decision to remand this matter for further proceedings, appellant\u2019s second and third assignments of error are found to be moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">{\u00b6 14} On consideration whereof, the judgment of the Erie County Court of Common Pleas, Domestic Relations Division, is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision. This matter shall be assigned to a magistrate other than the magistrate who signed the July 8, 2009 decision in this matter. On remand, the magistrate shall personally review and evaluate the evidence and prepare a new decision as to the issues brought before it by the parties. Thereupon, the parties shall have 14 days from the date the decision is filed to file written objections pursuant to Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(b). Costs of this appeal are assessed to appellee pursuant to App.R. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b168-9\">Singer and Cosme, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
