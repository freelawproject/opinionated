His appellate counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California </em>(1967), 386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">{\u00b6 2} On April 13, 2009, a Montgomery County grand jury indicted appellant on one count of failure to register, a first-degree felony in violation of R.C. 2950.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">{\u00b6 3} Appellant initially entered a not-guilty plea, but later changed his plea to no contest. The trial court found him guilty. As agreed to by the parties, the court sentenced appellant to three mandatory years in prison and stayed the sentence pending this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">{\u00b6 4} Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal on July 22, 2009. Appellant\u2019s appointed counsel thereafter filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493, asserting that after a thorough review, he could find no viable issues for appeal, and he asked for permission to withdraw. Consequently, appellant filed a pro se brief raising five \u201cgrounds\u201d for relief. These grounds for relief provide:</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cPrior to Shawn Williamsfs] release from prison. His stipulations for release from his case manager at Madison Correctional Institution, was that he had to have a verified registered address. Or he would have to be released to a halfway house. After the three address[es] he turned into his case manager prior to his release [were] denied by the Adult Parole Authority Shawn Williams was released back into society without a verified address.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cUpon release Shawn Williams[\u2019s] parole officer Crystal Langer denied two addresses before he was charged with failure to notify. She denied his grandmother[\u2019]s address * * * at 1955 kipling dr. and his uncle[\u2019]s address * * * at 1950 kipling dr.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-12\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThere is a sex offender by the name of * * * living at 1936 kipling dr.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-13\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cShawn Williams registered with the Montgomery County sheriffs sex offender unit when he gave the address of 160 edger ave. which his parole officer denied and also the 214 kirkham address.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>{\u00b6 9} \u201cParole Officer Crystal Langer was suppose[d] to house Shawn Williams in the county jail or a halfway house. When she denied the first address at 160 edger ave. After being released three to five days from prison. Shawn Williams didn\u2019t receive any guidness [sic], aid, or help from the Adult Parole Authority Officer Crystal Langer. He was left in a situation that never should have happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">{\u00b6 10} First, it should be noted that appellant has failed to comply with seven out of eight subparts of App.R. 16(A), which sets forth the requirements for an appellant\u2019s brief. Yet in the interest of justice, we will address his arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">{\u00b6 11} Second, although not artfully drafted, the alleged errors asserted by appellant all attempt to assert the affirmative defense of impossibility to notify the sheriff of his change of address.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">{\u00b6 12} Third, and most important, plaintiff-appellee, the state, has conceded error in this case based on appellant\u2019s pro se brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">{\u00b6 13} During a pretrial conference, the state presented appellant with three options of how to proceed: (1) go to trial, (2) plead guilty to attempted failure to notify with an agreed mandatory sentence of two years, or (3) plead no contest to the offense as charged with an agreed three-year mandatory sentence and be permitted to remain on bond during appeal to challenge the trial court\u2019s ruling that appellant was precluded from raising the affirmative defense of impossibility. Appellant chose the third option.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">{\u00b6 14} At the change-of-plea hearing, the trial court again explained appellant\u2019s three options to him before accepting his plea. The trial court made a finding as a matter of law that appellant could not raise the defense of impossibility because failure to notify is a strict-liability offense that does not require proof of a culpable mental state. Appellant\u2019s counsel objected to this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">{\u00b6 15} A no-contest plea generally does not constitute a waiver of issues on appeal. <em>State v. Carter </em>(1997), 124 Ohio App.3d 423, 428, 706 N.E.2d 409. And a defendant always retains the right to challenge errors related to the entry of the plea itself, including whether the plea was entered knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. <em>State v. Kelley </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 127, 566 N.E.2d 658, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">{\u00b6 16} When a defendant challenges his plea on the basis that it was not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made, he must show a prejudicial effect. <em>State v. Stewart </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St.2d 86, 93, 5 O.O.3d 52, 364 N.E.2d 1163; Crim.R. 52(A). In other words, the defendant must demonstrate that the plea would not have been otherwise made. Id. at 108, 5 O.O.3d 52, 364 N.E.2d 1163. Appellant has met this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>{\u00b6 17} Appellant entered his plea with the belief that he could appeal the trial court\u2019s ruling that it would not permit him to introduce evidence of the affirmative defense of impossibility at a trial. But the trial court\u2019s ruling was nothing more than a preliminary ruling on the admissibility of evidence surrounding the affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">{\u00b6 18} A preliminary ruling on the evidence, or the granting of a motion in limine, is a \u201ctentative, interlocutory, precautionary ruling\u201d reflecting how the trial court will likely rule when the issue comes up during trial. <em>State v. Grubb </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 199, 201-202, 28 OBR 285, 503 N.E.2d 142. Because it is not a final order, it cannot serve as the basis of an appeal. <em>State v. Baker, </em>170 Ohio App.3d 331, 2006-Ohio-7085, 867 N.E.2d 426, at \u00b6 9. Unless the claimed error is timely objected to at trial, it is not reviewable on appeal. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">{\u00b6 19} Thus, the issue is not ripe for our review. In order for the issue to be ripe, appellant would have had to have proceeded to trial and the court would have had to have made the ruling there. Then, if appellant was found guilty, he could have appealed and properly raised the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">{\u00b6 20} Because the issue whether appellant could present evidence of an affirmative defense is not yet reviewable, appellant\u2019s plea was not knowingly or intelligently entered. Appellant entered his plea with the specific belief that this appellate court would review the trial court\u2019s ruling that he could not present the affirmative defense of impossibility at trial. In fact, he turned down the state\u2019s offer to plead guilty to the lesser included offense of attempted failure to notify, which included a two-year prison sentence, and instead pleaded no contest to failure to notify, which included a three-year sentence, seemingly in large part because the trial court told him that this plea provided him with the opportunity to challenge its ruling regarding his affirmative defense on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">{\u00b6 21} As an aside, although the issue whether the trial court should have allowed appellant to present evidence of the affirmative defense of impossibility is not yet ripe for review, if we were to review the issue we would reach the same result in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">{\u00b6 22} Appellant was convicted of violating R.C. 2950.05(F)(1), which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cNo person who is required to notify a sheriff of a change of address pursuant to division (A) of this section or a change in vehicle information or identifiers pursuant to division (D) of this section shall fail to notify the appropriate sheriff in accordance with that division.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">{\u00b6 24} R.C. 2950.05(G)(1) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b144-12\">{\u00b6 25} <em>\u201cIt is an affirmative defense to a charge of a violation of division (F)(1) of this section that it was impossible for the person to provide the written notice </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number><em>to the sheriff </em>as required under division (A) of this section because of a lack of knowledge, on the date specified for the provision of the written notice, of a residence, school, institution of higher education, or place of employment address change, and that the person provided notice of the residence, school, institution of higher education, or place of employment address change to the sheriff specified in division (A) of this section as soon as possible, but not later than the end of the first business day, after learning of the address change * * (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">{\u00b6 26} As observed by appellee, the affirmative defense of impossibility was not added to R.C. 2950.05 until April 29, 2005. The cases relied on by the trial court to support its finding that the offense of failure to notify is a strict-liability offense that does not require proof of an intent or a culpable mental state predate the addition of the affirmative defense <em>(State v. Hardy, </em>9th Dist. No. 21015, 2002-Ohio-6457, 2002 WL 31662666; <em>State v. Beasley </em>(Sept. 27, 2001), 8th Dist. No. 77761, 2001 WL 1152871).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">{\u00b6 27} And while a strict-liability offense does not require proof of intent or culpable mental state, a strict-liability offense may still be subject to affirmative defenses. See <em>State v. Jones, </em>4th Dist. No. 03CA29, 2004-Ohio-1495, 2004 WL 595638, at \u00b6 8 (selling alcohol to minors is a strict-liability offense subject to affirmative defenses).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">{\u00b6 28} Because appellant did not knowingly and intelligently enter his no-contest plea, we must vacate appellant\u2019s plea. For the reasons stated above, appellant\u2019s plea is hereby vacated. The trial court\u2019s judgment is reversed, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings pursuant to law and consistent with this opinion. Appellate counsel\u2019s request to withdraw is granted. On remand, the trial court is instructed to appoint new counsel to further assist appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b145-9\">Fain and Froelich, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
