Wasinski. For the reasons that follow, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">{\u00b6 2} This is the second time that this particular workers\u2019 compensation case has been up on appeal. In the prior appeal, this court ultimately affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment entry granting Wasinski her right to participate in the workers\u2019 compensation fund for two conditions. The issue in this appeal deals with the trial court\u2019s January 12, 2010 judgment entry, which granted Wasinski\u2019s motion for payment of costs and fees associated with the jury trial pursuant to R.C. 4123.512(D) and (F).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">{\u00b6 3} The procedural history of this case is not in dispute. Wasinski was employed by PECO II, Inc., a company doing business in Crawford County, Ohio. On or about January 20, 2001, Wasinski was injured in an automobile accident while she was in Dallas, Texas, on a business trip in the course of her employment with PECO. Wasinski filed an application for payment of compensation and benefits with the Industrial Commission of Ohio under the Ohio Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. This claim was allowed by the Industrial Commission of Ohio for injuries described as contusion to scalp and left knee, cervicothoracic strain, and lumbosacral strain.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">{\u00b6 4} On February 7, 2003, Wasinski moved to have her original claim modified to include the following additional allowances: (1) major depression single episode and moderate conversion disorder, (2) deferred with dependent traits, (3) multiple pain sites and neurological symptoms, and (4) pain symptoms and neurological symptoms, moderate. Wasinski\u2019s motion was denied by a district hearing officer on July 23, 2003, and by a staff hearing officer on September 15, 2003. The Industrial Commission refused Wasinski\u2019s appeal on October 11, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">{\u00b6 5} On December 8, 2003, Wasinski filed an appeal of the October 11, 2003 decision with the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas pursuant to R.C. 4123.512. This case was transferred to the Crawford County Court of Common Pleas and assigned case No. 04-CV-011. However, on February 23, 2004, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>case was dismissed without prejudice pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A)(1). On February 14, 2006, Wasinski refiled her complaint, naming PECO and appellant, the administrator of BWC, as defendants. This case was assigned case No. 06-CV-0068. The complaint alleged the right to participate in the benefits of the workers\u2019 compensation fund for major depression, single episode.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">{\u00b6 6} On May 12, 2006, Wasinski filed another motion with the BWC, requesting that her original claim again be additionally allowed for postural tachycardia syndrome and autonomic neuropathy. On August 11, 2006, a district hearing officer granted Wasinski\u2019s motion. PECO appealed the district hearing officer\u2019s decision, and on September 22, 2006, a staff hearing officer vacated the district hearing officer\u2019s decision and denied Wasinski\u2019s motion. On October 6, 2006, the Industrial Commission refused Wasinski\u2019s appeal from the staff hearing officer\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">{\u00b6 7} Consequently, on November 27, 2006, Wasinski filed a notice of appeal from the Industrial Commission\u2019s October 6, 2006 decision with the Crawford County Court of Common Pleas. On this same date, Wasinski also filed a complaint and jury demand in which she alleged her right to participate in the benefits of workers\u2019 compensation fund for the conditions of postural tachycardia syndrome and autonomic neuropathy. This matter was assigned case No. 06-CV-0508.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">{\u00b6 8} Case No. 06-CV-0508 and case No. 06-CV-0068 were consolidated for trial purposes on January 19, 2008, and the matters proceeded to a jury trial on May 13,14,15, and 16, 2008. At the close of all the evidence, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Wasinski on both of her proposed conditions. Specifically, the jury determined that Wasinski was entitled to participate in the benefits of the workers\u2019 compensation fund for the condition of postural tachycardia syndrome and for the condition described as major depression, single episode.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">{\u00b6 9} Subsequently, BWC appealed to this court, asserting various evidentiary and procedural errors allegedly made by the trial court during the jury trial. In addition, Wasinski filed a cross-appeal asserting additional errors, most of which were dependent upon this court sustaining one or more of BWC\u2019s assignments of error. Ultimately, on July 15, 2009, this court overruled both Wasinski\u2019s and BWC\u2019s assignments of error, and we affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment entry granting Wasinski her right to participate in the workers\u2019 compensation fund for her two proposed conditions. <em>Wasinski v. PECO II, Inc., </em>3d Dist. Nos. 3-08-14 and 3-08-16, 2009-Ohio-2615, 2009 WL 1579231.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">{\u00b6 10} On August 5, 2009, Wasinski renewed her motion in the trial court for payment of costs and fees associated with the jury trial proceedings pursuant to R.C. 4123.512(D) and (F). BWC agreed to some of the costs and fees requested by Wasinski but objected to the expenses related to two particular depositions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>and. mileage expenses for Wasinski\u2019s attorney, claiming that they were not authorized under the statute. On January 12, 2010, the trial court ordered the payment of all of the expenses sought by Wasinski, including the following costs at issue in this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-5\">Deposition witness fee of Robert Jones, M.D. $900.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3S\">Transcript fee for deposition of Robert Jones, M.D. $507.15</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxX\">Video deposition recording fee for Robert Jones, M.D. $575.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A43\">Mileage travel to deposition of Robert Jones, M.D. $123.32</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AW\">Mileage to court of appeals argument $ 96.96</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Acc\">Transcript (discovery) deposition of Blair Grubb, M.D. $269.55</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">{\u00b6 11} BWC now appeals and raises three assignments of error. For ease of our discussion, we elect to address all of BWC\u2019s assignments of error together.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-10\">Assignment of Error No. I</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-11\">The trial court erred in ordering the defendant administrator to pay, under R.C. 4123.512, the claimant\u2019s expert\u2019s fee, video deposition expense, transcript deposition expense and counsel\u2019s mileage to and from the expert\u2019s deposition, when the deposition was not used at the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-12\">Assignment of Error No. II</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-13\">The trial court erred in ordering the defendant administrator to pay, under R.C. 4123.512, the claimant\u2019s expense for a transcript of a discovery deposition of the claimant\u2019s expert, when the discovery deposition was not used at the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-14\">Assignment of Error No. Ill</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-15\">The trial court erred in ordering defendant administrator to pay, under R.C. 4123.512, claimant\u2019s counsel\u2019s mileage expense related to counsel\u2019s travel to and from the court of appeals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-16\">{\u00b6 12} In its three assignments of error, BWC claims that the trial court erred in granting certain expenses sought by Wasinski because these expenses were not authorized by the statute. First, BWC claims that it should not have to pay for the expenses associated with Dr. Jones\u2019s deposition, since Dr. Jones\u2019s deposition was excluded from being used at trial. Similarly, BWC argues that it should also not have to pay for Dr. Grubb\u2019s discovery deposition, because the trial court also excluded it from being used at trial. Finally, BWC claims that it should not have to pay for Wasinski\u2019s attorney\u2019s mileage expenses associated with traveling to this court\u2019s oral arguments on the first appeal in 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-17\">{\u00b6 13} First of all, despite BWC\u2019s argument to the contrary, the decision to grant or deny fees and costs under R.C. 4123.512(D) and (F) lies within the sound discretion of the trial court, and we will not disturb its decision absent an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>abuse of discretion. <em>Dixon v. Ford Motor Co., </em>8th Dist. No. 82148, 2003-Ohio-3959, 2003 WL 21710796, \u00b6 5. See also <em>Azbell v. Newark Group, Inc., </em>5th Dist. No. 07 CA 00001, 2008-Ohio-2639, 2008 WL 2572022, \u00b6 22; <em>Murawski v. Tamarkin Co., </em>9th Dist. No. 23103, 2006-Ohio-4870, 2006 WL 2686541, \u00b6 9, citing <em>Bay cliffs Homeowners Assn., Inc. v. Solomon, </em>6th Dist. No. OT-05-002, 2005-Ohio-4917, 2005 WL 2271742, \u00b6 59; <em>Hansford v. Midwest Staff Solutions, </em>8th Dist. No. 87226, 2006-Ohio-5581, 2006 WL 3030882, \u00b6 11, citing <em>Raymond v. Shaker Produce, Inc., </em>8th Dist. Nos. 84885 and 85391, 2005-Ohio-1670, 2005 WL 799170; <em>Kilgore v. Chrysler Corp. </em>(Feb. 4, 2000), 2nd Dist. Nos. 17906 and 17915, 2000 WL 125953, at *7, affirmed (2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 184, 749 N.E.2d 267. An abuse of discretion is more than an error of law; rather, it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">{\u00b6 14} Under R.C. 4123.512, a claimant who successfully appeals from a denial of benefits is entitled to recovery of certain costs of litigation. Specifically, R.C. 4123.512(D) and (F) govern a claimant\u2019s recovery of costs of an appeal to the trial court. R.C. 4123.512(D) concerns the payment for physicians\u2019 depositions filed with the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-6\">Any party may file with the clerk prior to the trial of the action a deposition of any physician taken in accordance with the provisions of the Revised Code, which deposition may be read in the trial of the action even though the physician is a resident of or subject to service in the county in which the trial is had. The bureau of workers\u2019 compensation shall pay the cost of the stenographic deposition filed in court and of copies of the stenographic deposition for each party from the surplus fund and charge the costs thereof against the unsuccessful party if the claimant\u2019s right to participate or continue to participate is finally sustained or established in the appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Under this provision, regardless of the outcome of the claimant\u2019s appeal, the claimant is entitled to be reimbursed for the costs of his or her own doctor\u2019s deposition if the deposition is filed with the court. <em>Kilgore, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 186, 749 N.E.2d 267. While R.C. 4123.512(D) allows reimbursement regardless whether the claimant wins or loses, it only pertains to a very specific tyoe of costs. R.C. 4123.512(F), on the other hand, allows for a broader type of reimbursable costs, but only if the claimant is successful on appeal and has been deemed eligible to participate in the workers\u2019 compensation fund. In particular, R.C. 4123.512(F) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-8\">The cost of any legal proceedings authorized by this section, including an attorney\u2019s fee to the claimant\u2019s attorney to be fixed by the trial judge, based upon the effort expended, in the event the claimant\u2019s right to participate or to continue to participate in the fund is established upon the final determination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>an appeal, shall be taxed against the employer or the commission if the commission or the administrator rather than the employer contested the right of the claimant to participate in the fund. The attorney\u2019s fee shall not exceed forty-two hundred dollars.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Besides determining whether a claimant has been successful, the key to allowing costs under this provision is whether it qualifies as R.C. 4123.512(F)\u2019s \u201ccosts of any legal proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">{\u00b6 15} Significantly, over the last several years, the Ohio Supreme Court has consistently construed the term \u201ccost of any legal proceedings\u201d liberally in favor of employees. See <em>Cave v. Conrad </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 299, 301, 762 N.E.2d 991. In <em>Moore v. General Motors Corp. </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 259, 262, 18 OBR 314, 480 N.E.2d 1101, the court held that \u201cthe cost of any legal proceedings authorized by this section\u201d included the fees charged by an expert witness whose deposition was used in a workers\u2019 compensation hearing. A few years later, the Supreme Court held that \u201c[pjursuant to R.C. 4123.512(F), reasonable videotaped deposition expenses may be taxed as costs and awarded to a successful workers\u2019 compensation claimant.\u201d <em>Cave, </em>94 Ohio St.3d 299, 762 N.E.2d 991, at syllabus. Similarly, in <em>Kilgore, </em>92 Ohio St.3d 184, 749 N.E.2d 267, at syllabus, the court expanded the phrase even more and held that \u201can attorney\u2019s travel expenses incurred in taking a deposition of an expert are a reimbursable \u2018cost of any legal proceedings\u2019 under R.C. 4123.512(F).\u201d Finally, and most recently, in <em>Schuller v. United States Steel Corp., </em>103 Ohio St.3d 157, 2004-Ohio-4753, 814 N.E.2d 857, at syllabus, the court declared that \u201c[a]n expert witness\u2019s fee for live in-court testimony is a reimbursable cost of legal proceedings pursuant to R.C. 4123.512(F), subject to the trial court\u2019s determination that the fee is reasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">{\u00b6 16} Central to all of the court\u2019s decisions was the rationale that R.C. 4123.512(D) and (F) were \u201c \u2018designed to minimize the actual expense incurred by an injured employee who establishes his or her right to participate in the fund.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cave, </em>94 Ohio St.3d at 301, 762 N.E.2d 991, quoting <em>Moore, </em>18 Ohio St.3d at 261-262, 18 OBR 314, 480 N.E.2d 1101. The court has stated that by enacting R.C. 4123.512(F), the General Assembly \u201c \u2018has demonstrated its intent that a claimant\u2019s recovery shall not be dissipated by reasonable litigation expenses connected with the preparation and presentation of an appeal.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Moore </em>at 262, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>18 OBR 314, 480 N.E.2d 1101. Despite its consistent liberal interpretation of R.C. 4123.512(F), the Ohio Supreme Court has recognized employers\u2019 concerns:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajs\">Appellants paint a picture of trial courts overwhelmed by requests for reimbursement for staples, paper clips, and, presumably, a claimant\u2019s lawyer\u2019s lucky tie if they are used in a successful appeal. However, our decision today does not allow reimbursement for everyday costs of doing business. It applies to costs bearing a direct relation to a claimant\u2019s appeal that lawyers traditionally charge to clients and that also have a proportionally serious impact on a claimant\u2019s award. As in the case at bar, approval of an attorney\u2019s travel expenses incurred in taking an expert\u2019s deposition is subject to the trial court\u2019s determination of their reasonable necessity to the presentation of the claimant\u2019s appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-5\"><em>Kilgore, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 187-188, 749 N.E.2d 267. Nevertheless, the court has repeatedly held that R.C. 4123.512(F) allows reimbursement for reasonable litigation expenses that \u201cbear[] a direct relation to a claimant\u2019s appeal that lawyers traditionally charge to clients and that also have a proportionally serious impact on a claimant\u2019s award.\u201d Id. at 188, 749 N.E.2d 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">{\u00b6 17} In this particular case, we believe that Dr. Jones\u2019s and Dr. Grubb\u2019s depositions were reasonable litigation expenses connected with the preparation and presentation of Wasinski\u2019s appeal that essentially bore a direct relation to the success of her appeal even though they were not admitted at trial. Dr. Jones was one of Wasinski\u2019s treating physicians and was treating Wasinski for one of the conditions (depression) that she was trying to seek coverage for in the workers\u2019 compensation fund. Despite Dr. Jones\u2019s deposition being inadmissible at trial, Dr. Jones\u2019s deposition led to Wasinski presenting another physician\u2019s testimony, Dr. Egan, at trial with respect to the issue of Wasinski\u2019s depression. Ultimately, the jury found that the depression was a sufficient basis for Wasinski to participate in the workers\u2019 compensation fund. Thus, Dr. Jones\u2019s deposition was instrumental in Wasinski\u2019s preparation and presentation of her claim for depression at trial, and therefore we find that it was reasonable and within the trial court\u2019s discretion to have allowed for the reimbursement expenses concerning Dr. Jones\u2019s deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">{\u00b6 18} In addition, we also believe that reimbursing Wasinski for Dr. Grubb\u2019s discovery deposition was reasonable under the circumstances. Despite BWC\u2019s assertion that Dr. Grubb\u2019s discovery deposition was properly excluded as evidence at trial, Civ.R. 32, which governs the use of depositions in all court proceedings, does not distinguish between trial and discovery depositions. <em>Beckman v. Yellow Freight Sys., Inc. </em>(Feb. 12, 1997), 9th Dist. No. 17845, 1997 WL 72104, at *3, citing <em>Van Meter v. Coates </em>(Aug. 12, 1992), 9th Dist. No. 91CA005220, 1992 WL 194372. See also <em>Coxson v. Miller </em>(Mar. 26, 1999), 11th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>Dist. No. 97-T-0179, 1999 WL 266691, at *2, citing <em>Dodson v. Oclese </em>(Sept. 30, 1987), 11th Dist. No. 3733, 1987 WL 18028, at *5. The rule specifically provides that a deposition of a witness \u201cmay be used by <em>any party </em>for <em>any purpose\u201d </em>so long as the witness is a medical expert. (Emphasis added.) Civ.R. 32(A)(3)(e). Dr. Grubb was a medical expert; therefore, filing Dr. Grubb\u2019s discovery deposition in anticipation of using it at the trial was both reasonable and permissible under the civil rules. Therefore, it was likewise reasonable for the trial court to have granted the reimbursement of its cost considering the deposition costs were incurred for the purposes of presenting Wasinski\u2019s appeal. See <em>Bramley v. Painesville </em>(Dec. 26, 1997), 11th Dist. No. 97-L-038, 1997 WL 799920, at *4 (finding that the trial court erred in not awarding workers\u2019 compensation claimant costs for the discovery deposition of a medical expert, since it was arguably incurred for the purposes of advancing claimant\u2019s appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">{\u00b6 19} Overall, in light of the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s broad interpretation of the phrase \u201ccost of any legal proceedings\u201d in R.C. 4123.512(F), we believe that it was reasonable, and certainly within the trial court\u2019s discretion, to have allowed the costs associated with Dr. Jones\u2019s deposition and Dr. Grubb\u2019s discovery deposition to be reimbursed, since they were directly related to Wasinski\u2019s appeal and thus could be considered as \u201ccost[s] of any legal proceedings\u201d under R.C. 4123.512(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">{\u00b6 20} However, despite our position above, we believe that it was unreasonable to have allowed Wasinski to be reimbursed for her attorney\u2019s mileage to and from the court of appeals for purposes of attending oral arguments for the prior appeal because that expense was not a cost directly related to Wasinski\u2019s appeal but rather an everyday cost of doing business. Furthermore, while we acknowledge that this court was willing to expand the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Kilgore </em>in our recent decision of <em>Ley v. Procter &amp; Gamble Co., </em>3d Dist. No. 1-09-11, 2010-Ohio-834, 2010 WL 761124, we find that <em>Ley </em>is distinguishable from the circumstances in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">{\u00b6 21} As we stated above, in <em>Kilgore, </em>the Supreme Court expanded the phrase \u201ccost[s] of any legal proceedings\u201d and held that \u201can attorney\u2019s travel expenses incurred in taking a deposition of an expert are a reimbursable \u2018cost of any legal proceedings\u2019 under R.C. 4123.512(F).\u201d 92 Ohio St.3d 184, 749 N.E.2d 267, at syllabus. In <em>Ley, </em>this court affirmed a judgment reimbursing a claimant for her attorney\u2019s travel expenses for taking depositions even though the attorney was an out-of-town attorney and the depositions were taken in the county where the action was filed. 2010-Ohio-834, \u00b6 52. Specifically, this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-8\">[W]e do not believe that the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Kilgore </em>is as narrow as P &amp; G suggests. We believe that the Court\u2019s rationale in <em>Kilgore, </em>just like its rationale in all of its recent cases dealing with R.C. 4123.512(D) and (F), was to allow those expenses that are directly related to a claimant\u2019s appeal that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>attorney would traditionally charge to clients and that would also have a proportionally serious impact on the claimant\u2019s award. <em>Kilgore, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 187, 749 N.E.2d 267. We believe that it was reasonable for the trial court to have believed that Ley\u2019s out-of-town attorney\u2019s mileage expenses to attend the depositions of Ley\u2019s witnesses did bear a direct relationship to Ley\u2019s appeal and would have a serious impact on her award if not granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Id. Nevertheless, we find the circumstances in this case to be distinguishable from the facts in <em>Ley. </em>Even though we stated that we did not believe that the court\u2019s holding in <em>Kilgore </em>was as narrow as the employer suggested and that it was reasonable to have allowed plaintiffs out-of-town attorney to have mileage expenses for attending depositions of witnesses, extending Kilgore\u2019s ruling in <em>Ley </em>was logical, since both cases involved attorney\u2019s mileage expenses concerning <em>the preparation </em>of the claimant\u2019s appeal (i.e. travel expenses to take witnesses\u2019 depositions). See <em>Ley, </em>2010-Ohio-834, 2010 WL 761124, at \u00b6 52; <em>Kilgore, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 188, 749 N.E.2d 267. Here, Wasinski\u2019s attorney is asking BWC to reimburse him for mileage to our courthouse for oral arguments with respect to the first appeal. As the Supreme Court itself stated in <em>Kilgore, </em>R.C. 4123.512(F) \u201cdoes not allow reimbursement for <em>everyday costs of doing business,\u201d </em>and we fail to see how an attorney traveling to a courthouse would be anything other than an everyday cost of doing business rather than one directly related to the claimant\u2019s appeal. See <em>Kilgore, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 188, 749 N.E.2d 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">{\u00b6 22} Furthermore, we note that at the time Wasinski filed her first complaint with the trial court, R.C. 4123.512(F) explicitly prescribed that an attorney may collect fees in an amount of up to $2,500, and in this particular case, the trial court awarded $2,500 in fees to Wasinski\u2019s attorney. Besides the statutory fee language and the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Kilgore, </em>which again only pertained to travel expenses to and from depositions in preparation of a claimant\u2019s appeal, no other miscellaneous expenses, such as an attorney\u2019s mileage to a courthouse, have been provided for in the statute. Thus, absent express statutory authority to the contrary, this court is unwilling to \u201c \u2018read into a statute something that cannot reasonably be implied from the statute\u2019s language.\u2019 \u201d <em>Breidenbach v. Conrad </em>(1997), 122 Ohio App.3d 640, 645-646, 702 N.E.2d 509, quoting <em>State ex rel. Williams v. Colasurd </em>(1995), 71 Ohio St.3d 642, 644, 646 N.E.2d 830, citing <em>Szekely v. Young </em>(1963), 174 Ohio St. 213, 22 O.O.2d 214, 188 N.E.2d 424, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">{\u00b6 23} Therefore, we find that the reimbursement of mileage to our courthouse for Wasinski\u2019s attorney for purposes of oral arguments in the first appeal was unreasonable because it was an everyday cost of doing business and not one \u201cdirectly related to the claimant\u2019s appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>{\u00b6 24} Therefore, BWC\u2019s first and second assignments of error are overruled, and BWC\u2019s third assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">{\u00b6 25} Having found no error prejudicial to the appellant in the particulars assigned and argued with respect to appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error, we affirm the judgment of the trial court. However, having found error prejudicial to the appellant in the particulars assigned and argued with respect to appellant\u2019s third assignment of error, we reverse the judgment of the trial court, and we remand the cause for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b590-6\">Rogers and Shaw, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b586-8\">. The prior version of the R.C. 4123.512(F) prescribed that the maximum amount of attorney fees was $2,500. Effective June 30, 2006 (approximately four months after Wasinski had filed her first complaint with the trial court), the statutorily prescribed maximum award of attorney fees was increased from $2,500 to $4,200. Here, the trial court awarded Wasinski attorney fees in the amount of $2,500. Neither party disputes the specific award of attorney fees in this particular case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
