Ryan, and third party defendant-appellant, Carolyn P. Ryan, appeal multiple decisions of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. For the following reasons, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">{\u00b6 2} On August 10, 2005, plaintiff-appellee, Ford Motor Credit Company (\u201cFord\u201d), brought a breach-of-contract action against James and Ryan and Ryan, Inc. (\u201cRRI\u201d), in the Franklin County Municipal Court. Ford alleged that James and RRI had failed to pay amounts due under a motor-vehicle lease agreement that James and RRI had entered into when they coleased a 2002 Ford Windstar. James and RRI answered the complaint, and James filed a counterclaim. Because the damages sought in the counterclaim exceeded the municipal court\u2019s monetary jurisdiction, the municipal court transferred the case to the common pleas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-11\">{\u00b6 3} In the common pleas court, Ford sought and received leave to file an amended complaint and a third-party complaint. In the amended complaint, Ford asserted three more breach-of-contract claims against James and RRI. These claims alleged that James and RRI had failed to pay amounts due under (1) a retail installment contract that James and Ryan and Ryan Real Estate Company (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> had entered into when copurchasing a 2004 Mercury Monterey, (2) a retail installment contract that James and R &amp; R had entered into when copurchasing a 2004 Mercury Mountaineer, and (3) a retail installment contract that James and R &amp; R had entered into when copurchasing a 2004 Mercury Mountaineer Premier.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-12\">{\u00b6 4} In its third-party complaint, Ford asserted a breach-of-contract claim against James\u2019s wife, Carolyn. Ford alleged that Carolyn had failed to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>amounts due under a retail installment contract that she had entered into when she purchased a 2004 Mercury Grand Marquis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">{\u00b6 5} At the time that Ford filed its amended complaint and third-party complaint, it had already repossessed the vehicles at issue in those pleadings. Ford had hired Automobile Recovery Services of Cincinnati, Inc. (\u201cARS\u201d), to accomplish each of the repossessions. Ford and ARS had a contractual arrangement whereby ARS provided Ford with repossession services. In the contract, ARS agreed to (1) forgo any repossession that would involve a breach of peace and (2) indemnify Ford for all expenses incurred in connection with legal claims that related to ARS\u2019s performance of its contractual obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">{\u00b6 6} ARS repossessed four of the Ryans\u2019 vehicles without incident. However, during the repossession of the Premier, James and the ARS agent engaged in a verbal and physical altercation. James\u2019s counterclaim had asserted multiple tort claims against Ford based on the actions of ARS\u2019s agent. Therefore, in addition to naming Carolyn, Ford\u2019s third-party complaint also named ARS as a third-party defendant. Ford alleged breach-of-contract and indemnity claims against ARS.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">{\u00b6 7} In response to Ford\u2019s amended and third-party complaints, James and Carolyn each filed an answer and counterclaim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> James and Carolyn asserted claims against Ford for (1) conversion, (2) trespass, (3) assault, (4) breach of peace, (5) intentional infliction of emotional distress, (6) invasion of privacy, (7) violation of Section 1983, Title 42, U.S.Code (\u201cSection 1983\u201d), (8) breach of contract, (9) violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, Section 1692, Title 15, U.S.Code (\u201cFDCPA\u201d), (10) violation of the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act, R.C. 1345.01 et seq. (\u201cCSPA\u201d), and (11) violation of the Ohio Retail Installment Sales Act, R.C. 1317.01 et seq. (\u201cRISA\u201d). James alone also asserted a claim for negligence against Ford.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">{\u00b6 8} Both James and Carolyn brought a cross-claim against ARS. The cross-claims stated claims for (1) conversion, (2) trespass, (3) assault, (4) breach of peace, (5) intentional infliction of emotional distress, (6) invasion of privacy, (7) violation of Section 1983, (8) violation of the FDCPA, and (9) violation of the RISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">{\u00b6 9} Additionally, both James and Carolyn named Bob-Boyd Lincoln Mercury, Inc. (\u201cBob-Boyd\u201d) as a third-party defendant. The Ryans had leased or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>purchased each of the vehicles at issue in the instant case from Bob-Boyd. James and Carolyn asserted claims against Bob-Boyd for (1) breach of contract, (2) violation of the CSPA, and (3) estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">{\u00b6 10} Ford, ARS, and Bob-Boyd moved for summary judgment on all the claims that James and Carolyn had asserted against them. Ford also moved for summary judgment as to its breach-of-contract claim against Carolyn, as well as its four breach-of-contract claims against both James and RRI. In three different judgment entries, the trial court granted all the summary-judgment motions. James and Carolyn separately appealed the three judgments to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">{\u00b6 11} On appeal, James and Carolyn point out that the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment had not resolved all the claims pending before the court. Despite the existence of unresolved claims, two of the judgments \u2014 those granting Ford\u2019s and Bob-Boyd\u2019s summary-judgment motions \u2014 did not contain Civ.R. 54(B) language. James and Carolyn argued that absent Civ.R. 54(B) language, those two judgments did not constitute final, appealable orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">{\u00b6 12} This court stayed the two appeals and remanded the matter to the trial court so that it could address the remaining claims. The trial court responded by again entering judgment in Ford and Bob-Boyd\u2019s favor on their summary-judgment motions, but this time, including Civ.R. 54(B) language in the judgment entries. Both James and Carolyn then filed additional appeals from the amended judgment entries. We have consolidated all the appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">{\u00b6 13} In their first appeals (designated as case Nos. 09AP-501 and 09AP-555), James and Carolyn assign the following errors:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>owners and to remove property from the cartilage of the home to the public street for the purpose of repossession. These actions taken by ARS and the finding of the Trial Courts Order permitting such actions violates Defendant/Plaintiff s rights under existing Ohio Law, the Ohio Constitution and the United States Constitution and contrary to the Trial Courts findings there are genuine issues of material fact in the record as set forth herein that are genuinely disputed that should be set for trial. ARS is not entitled to Summary Judgment as a matter of law and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non moving party, reasonable minds could not come to one conclusion adverse to the party against whom the motion is made.

Ryan was not in default of her Contract, that the motions do not meet the requirements of Civil Rule 56(C).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">{\u00b6 17} Before considering the merits of appellants\u2019 assignments of error, we must address ARS\u2019s motion to strike. In its motion, ARS requests that this court strike from the second appeals the assignments of error and arguments related to it. ARS points out that the judgment entry granting it summary judgment included Civ.R. 54(B) language, making it a final, appealable order. Appellants appealed that judgment in case Nos. 09AP-501 and 09AP-555, and they both filed briefs in support of their appeals. ARS contends that once the briefing in case Nos. 09AP-501 and 09AP-555 concluded, appellants could not, without leave of court, submit additional assignments of error and argument directed toward ARS. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">{\u00b6 18} The trial court\u2019s rulings on Ford and Bob-Boyd\u2019s summary-judgment motions did not become final, appealable orders until the trial court issued the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>amended judgment entries. Thus, in their second appeals, appellants could, and did, assign and argue error arising from those amended judgments. However, because the judgment granting ARS summary judgment was a final, appealable order, appellants\u2019 appeals from that judgment presented their only opportunity to assign and argue error as to that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">{\u00b6 19} Moreover, the appeal from the judgment granting ARS summary judgment gave appellants their only chance to appeal those interlocutory orders related to that judgment. When a final judgment does not terminate the entire case, but only terminates the case as to certain claims or parties, only prior interlocutory orders that relate to the final judgment will merge into the final judgment. <em>Davis v. Galla, </em>6th Dist. No. L-08-1149, 2008-Ohio-3501, 2008 WL 2700008, \u00b6 5-6. See also <em>Haley v. Reisinger, </em>9th Dist. No. 24376, 2009-Ohio-447, 2009 WL 250871, \u00b6 11-12; <em>Norcold, Inc. v. Gateway Supply Co., </em>3d Dist. No. 17-05-11, 2006-0hio-6919, 2006 WL 3802609, \u00b6 25-36 (an interlocutory order unrelated to the final judgment that terminated the case as to one party did not become appealable until the final disposition of the case). Thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\">For example, if a trial court judge makes an interlocutory ruling that certain documents will not be considered in making its decision on a summary judgment motion and subsequently, finding that there is no just reason for delay, the judge grants the summary judgment motion as to one of the defendants, then an appeal from the grant of summary judgment may include an appeal from the interlocutory ruling concerning the consideration of documents. The \u201cdocuments ruling\u201d will merge into the final order granting summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-7\"><em>Davis </em>at \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">{\u00b6 20} In the case at bar, prior to ruling on ARS\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the trial court denied appellants\u2019 Civ.R. 56(F) motion for a continuance to respond to ARS\u2019s motion. The judgment denying the Civ.R. 56(F) motion was an interlocutory order related to the judgment granting ARS summary judgment. Consequently, the judgment denying the Civ.R. 56(F) motion merged into the final judgment disposing of the claims brought against ARS. Appellants, therefore, had to assert and argue any errors arising from the denial of the Civ.R. 56(F) motion in their first set of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">{\u00b6 21} App.R. 16 allows an appellant to file an initial brief and a reply brief, and an appellee to file a response brief. \u201cNo further briefs may be filed except with leave of court.\u201d App.R. 16(C). Here, appellants did not seek leave to file additional briefing as to ARS. Accordingly, we strike the second and third assignments of error from case Nos. 10AP-263 and 10AP-274. To the extent that they relate to ARS, we also strike the fifth assignment of error from case No. 10AP-263 and the fourth assignment of error from case No. 10AP-274.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>{\u00b6 22} We will address case Nos. 09AP-501 and 09AP-555 first. By the first assignments of error in those appeals, appellants argue that the trial court did not render final, appealable orders when it ruled on Ford and Bob-Boyd\u2019s summary-judgment motions. These assignments of error became moot once the trial court issued the amended judgment entries. Accordingly, we need not decide appellants\u2019 first assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">{\u00b6 23} By appellants\u2019 second assignments of error, they argue that the trial court erred in granting ARS summary judgment on all their claims against it. Although these assignments of error challenge the trial court\u2019s ruling on appellants\u2019 claims for invasion of privacy, seizure, and violation of the FDCA, RISA, and CSPA, appellants do not advance any argument in support this challenge. Likewise, the assignments of error contest the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction over ARS, but appellants fail to assert an argument on this point. An appellant must demonstrate each assigned error through an argument supported by citations to legal authority and facts in the record. App.R. 16(A)(7); <em>Cross v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth. Chief, </em>10th Dist. No. 09AP-364, 2009-0hio-5027, 2009 WL 3065176, \u00b6 3. If an appellant neglects to advance such an argument, a court of appeals may disregard the assignment of error. App.R. 12(A)(2); <em>Bond v. Canal Winchester, </em>10th Dist. No. 07AP-556, 2008-Ohio-945, 2008 WL 600201, \u00b6 16-17. Accordingly, we will disregard those portions of the second assignments of error that appellants fail to separately argue.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">{\u00b6 24} We now turn to the merits of appellants\u2019 argument that their claims against ARS for trespass, conversion, assault, and violation of Section 1983 should have survived summary judgment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Appellate review of summary-judgment motions is de novo. <em>Andersen v. Highland House Co. </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 547, 548, 757 N.E.2d 329. \u201c \u2018When reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling on summary judgment, the court of appeals conducts an independent review of the record and stands in the shoes of the trial court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Abrams v. Worthington, </em>169 Ohio App.3d 94, 2006-Ohio-5516, 861 N.E.2d 920, \u00b6 11, quoting <em>Mergenthal v. Star Banc Corp. </em>(1997), 122 Ohio App.3d 100, 103, 701 N.E.2d 383. Civ.R. 56(C) provides that a trial court must grant summary judgment when the moving party demonstrates that (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>for summary judgment is made. <em>Gilbert v. Summit Cty., </em>104 Ohio St.3d 660, 2004-Ohio-7108, 821 N.E.2d 564, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">{\u00b6 25} When seeking summary judgment on the ground that the nonmoving party cannot prove its case, the moving party bears the initial burden of informing the trial court of the basis for the motion and identifying those portions of the record that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact on an essential element of the nonmoving party\u2019s claims. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 293, 662 N.E.2d 264. The moving party does not discharge this initial burden under Civ.R. 56 by simply making a conclusory allegation that the nonmoving party has no evidence to prove its case. Id. Rather, the moving party must affirmatively demonstrate by affidavit or other evidence allowed by Civ.R. 56(C) that the nonmoving party has no evidence to support its claims. Id. If the moving party meets this initial burden, then the nonmoving party has a reciprocal burden outlined in Civ.R. 56(E) to set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial and, if the nonmoving party does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against the nonmoving party. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">{\u00b6 26} Initially, we note that although ARS sought summary judgment on all appellants\u2019 claims, it failed to explain in its motion why the trial court should grant summary judgment on appellants\u2019 trespass claims. In fact, the motion does not mention the trespass claims at all, other than listing \u201ctrespass\u201d in its recitation of all the claims appellants asserted.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Likewise, ARS\u2019s brief on appeal contains no argument regarding appellants\u2019 trespass claims. Because ARS neither established the absence of a genuine issue of material fact regarding the trespass claims nor presented a legal reason why those claims must fail, we conclude that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to ARS on appellants\u2019 trespass claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">{\u00b6 27} Appellants next contend that the existence of genuine issues of material fact precluded summary judgment on their conversion claims. \u201c \u2018[C]on-version is the wrongful exercise of dominion over property to the exclusion of the rights of the owner, or withholding it from his possession under a claim inconsistent with his rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Toma v. Corrigan </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 589, 592, 752 N.E.2d 281, quoting <em>Joyce v. Gen. Motors Corp. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 93, 96, 551 N.E.2d 172. ARS argues that it did not wrongfully take appellants\u2019 vehicles because Ford had a contractual right to repossess the vehicles, and Ford hired ARS to exercise its contractual right. Section G of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>retail installment contracts states that if the obligor(s) default, Ford \u201cmay repossess (take back) the vehicle.\u201d In Ohio, this right to repossession is subject to R.C. 1309.609, which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">(A) After default, a secured party:</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">(1) May take possession of the collateral * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">(B) A secured party may act under division (A) of this section:</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">(1) Pursuant to judicial process; or</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">(2) Without judicial process if it acts without breach of the peace.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">{\u00b6 28} R.C. 1309.609 is virtually identical to Section 9-609 of the Uniform Commercial Code (\u201cU.C.C.\u201d). The General Assembly incorporated U.C.C. provisions into the Ohio Revised Code \u201c[t]o make uniform the laws among the various jurisdictions.\u201d R.C. 1301.02(B)(3). Accordingly, to supplement Ohio law, our analysis of R.C. 1309.609 relies upon precedent from other jurisdictions addressing U.C.C. 9-609 and similar state statutes. Additionally, this court looks to caselaw interpreting former R.C. 1309.46, which preceded R.C. 1309.609 and duplicated former U.C.C. 9-503.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 149 Ohio Laws, Part I, 106, 107-108. Like U.C.C. 9-609, former U.C.C. 9-503 also allowed the repossession of collateral upon default if the creditor accomplished the repossession without a breach of the peace. Consequently, precedent from other jurisdictions interpreting former U.C.C. 9-503 and like state statutes also inform our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">{\u00b6 29} R.C. 1309.609 gives a secured party the right to attempt self-help repossession if a debtor defaults. <em>State v.

However, \u201c[i]f the secured party, or a third party repossessing for the secured party, causes a breach of peace while repossessing the collateral, the repossession will be wrongful, and the debtor may sue the secured party in conversion for return of the collateral or damages.\u201d 9 Hawkland, Uniform Commercial Code Series (2001), Section 9-503:3.

See <em>Toma, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 592, 752 N.E.2d 281. R.C. 1309.609 provides a defense to such a conversion claim because it permits a repossessor to take possession of the vehicle, rendering the repossession lawful. This defense, however, depends on the absence of a breach of the peace. If a breach of the peace occurs, the repossessor cannot rely on R.C. 1309.609 to excuse its actions. <em>Marcus v.

Accordingly, no liability for conversion arose out of the repossessions of the three vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">{\u00b6 37} Appellants, however, argue that ARS did not have the right to enter onto their property because R.C. 1309.609 extends that authority only to the \u201csecured party.\u201d Because ARS is not the \u201csecured party,\u201d appellants contend that it cannot rely on R.C. 1309.609. We find this argument unavailing. Just because R.C. 1309.609 confers the right of repossession on the \u201csecured party\u201d does not mean that the secured party must personally repossess the collateral. 10 Anderson, Uniform Commercial Code (3d Ed.) 381, Section 9-503:137. The secured party may hire another to make the repossession, and the right of repossession accrues to the hired entity. Id. See also <em>Akerlund v. TCF Natl.

Here Ford, the \u201csecured party,\u201d hired ARS to repossess the vehicles, and thus, ARS operated under the auspices of R.C. 1309.609.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">{\u00b6 38} Appellants also argue that ARS cannot rely on R.C. 1309.609 to escape liability for conversion because that statute violates the Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Section 14, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">{\u00b6 39} Our analysis of the constitutionality of R.C. 1309.609 is guided by the strong presumption of constitutionality that all statutes enjoy. <em>Kaminski v.

The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment applies to the federal government, not state government. <em>Dusenbery v. United States </em>(2002), 534 U.S. 161, 167, 122 S.Ct. 694, 151 L.Ed.2d 597.

The Fourteenth Amendment precludes state government from depriving any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. Notably, both the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments provide protection against governmental \u2014 not private \u2014 action. <em>United States v.

Thus, we conclude that R.C. 1309.609 does not violate the Fourth or Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">{\u00b6 43} Having addressed the repossessions that occurred on February 7 and 8, 2006, we now examine the final repossession to determine if a question of fact exists as to whether ARS breached the peace. Unlike the February 7 and 8, 2006 repossessions, the January 12, 2006 repossession of the Premier occurred over James\u2019s objection. On January 12, 2006, at approximately 8:15 a.m., James was dressing when his wife told him that someone with a tow truck was in then-carport. James went out to the carport and found an ARS agent hooking the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Premier to his tow truck. James told the ARS agent to stop, unhook the Premier, and leave the premises because he was trespassing. James then reached down to unhook the Premier, and the ARS agent grabbed his hands, pushed him, and began screaming at him. According to James, the ARS agent screamed, \u201cI\u2019m going to make your neighbors know about what you\u2019re doing[;] you rich bastard, I got you.\u201d At that point, James began pushing back and yelling. James eventually backed away, and the ARS agent towed the Premier away.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">{\u00b6 44} Based upon this evidence, a reasonable finder of fact could conclude that a breach of the peace occurred. If the finder of fact reached such a conclusion, then it could also find ARS liable for conversion. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court erred in granting ARS summary judgment on James\u2019s claim for conversion of the Premier.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">{\u00b6 45} Next, we consider whether the trial court erred in granting ARS summary judgment on appellants\u2019 claims that an ARS agent assaulted them during the January 12, 2006 repossession. A plaintiff establishes the tort of assault by showing that the defendant willfully threatened or attempted to harm or offensively touch the plaintiff and that the threat or attempt reasonably placed the plaintiff in fear of such contact. <em>Stafford v. Columbus Bonding Ctr., </em>177 Ohio App.3d 799, 2008-Ohio-3948, 896 N.E.2d 191, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">{\u00b6 46} Although Carolyn entered the carport briefly during the repossession, she returned to the house after seeing her husband reach down to unhook the Premier. Based on Carolyn\u2019s recounting of the events of January 12, 2006, the ARS agent never threatened or attempted to contact her. Consequently, reasonable minds could only conclude that the ARS agent did not assault Carolyn, and thus, the trial court properly granted ARS summary judgment on Carolyn\u2019s assault claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">{\u00b6 47} The situation is different as to James. The ARS agent physically prevented James from unhooking the Premier from the tow truck. James testified that he backed away. He said, \u201c[The ARS agent was] about 30 years younger than I am and about another 150 pounds heavier than I was.\u201d In his July 25, 2008 deposition, James stated repeatedly that he had felt threatened by the ARS agent. Despite this evidence, ARS argues that James\u2019s actions demonstrated frustration or anger \u2014 not fear. We believe that reasonable minds could disagree regarding how to interpret James\u2019s actions and whether he reasonably feared that the ARS agent would strike him. We therefore conclude that the trial court erred in granting ARS summary judgment on James\u2019s assault claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\"> {\u00b6 48} Next, we must determine whether summary judgment was appropriate on appellants\u2019 claims for violation of Section 1983. Section 1983 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>\u201cprovides a remedy for deprivations of rights secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States when that deprivation takes place \u2018under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., Inc. </em>(1982), 457 U.S. 922, 924, 102 S.Ct. 2744, 73 L.Ed.2d 482, quoting Section 1983. A person is acting under the color of state law if \u201cthe conduct allegedly causing the deprivation of a federal right [can] be fairly attribut[ed] to the State.\u201d Id. at 937. For fair attribution to the state to exist, the person charged with committing the deprivation \u201cmust be a person who may fairly be said to be a state actor.\u201d Id. \u201cThis may be because he is a state official, because he has acted together with or has obtained significant aid from state officials, or because his conduct is otherwise chargeable to the State.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">{\u00b6 49} In the case at bar, appellants argue that ARS is a state actor because the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio regulates it. Appellants neither asserted nor presented any evidence to support this argument in the trial court. Moreover, we note that \u201c \u2018[t]he mere fact that a business is subject to state regulation does not by itself convert its action into that of the State.\u2019 \u201d <em>Am. Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan </em>(1999), 526 U.S. 40, 52, 119 S.Ct. 977, 143 L.Ed.2d 130, quoting <em>Jackson v. Metro. Edison Co. </em>(1974), 419 U.S. 345, 350, 95 S.Ct. 449, 42 L.Ed.2d 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">{\u00b6 50} Appellants also claim that ARS is a state actor because it repossessed the vehicles with the authorization of R.C. 1309.609. However, \u201cthe existence of [a] self-help repossession provision in state law, and [a party\u2019s] use of the same to effectuate [a] repossession, is not enough, on its own\u201d to convert a private repossessor into a state actor. <em>Albertorio-Santiago v. Reliable Fin. Servs. </em>(D.P.R.2009), 612 F.Supp.2d 159, 166. See also <em>Elliott v. Chrysler Fin. </em>(C.A.10, 2005), 149 Fed.Appx. 766, 768 (\u201cMerely following a procedure established by state law does not transform a private party\u2019s activity into state action\u201d); <em>Pahls v. Kesselring </em>(C.A.6, 2000), 230 F.3d 1359 (table) (\u201csimply invoking the authority of a valid state law does not amount to state action for \u00a7 1983 purposes\u201d). As both appellants\u2019 arguments fail, we conclude that ARS is not a state actor, and thus, the trial court properly granted ARS summary judgment on appellants\u2019 Section 1983 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">{\u00b6 51} We next turn to the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on James\u2019s claim against ARS for the conversion of personal property that was in the Premier when ARS repossessed that vehicle on May 9, 2005. To clarify, ARS repossessed the Premier twice \u2014 first on May 9, 2005, and after James redeemed the Premier, then again on January 12, 2006. James asserted a claim against ARS for eonvei-sion of multiple items of personal property that were in the Premier when ARS repossessed it the first time. This personal property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>included clothing, prescription eyeglasses, boating paraphernalia, CDs, and cash. After the repossession, James contacted ARS and requested the return of the personal property in the Premier and the vehicle\u2019s license plates. ARS returned only the license plates.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">{\u00b6 52} Although R.C. 1309.609 permits a repossessor to lawfully take possession of another\u2019s vehicle, that permission does not extend to the personal items inside the vehicle. Consequently, even though a lawful repossession leaves the debtor with no claim for conversion of his vehicle, he may assert a conversion claim against the repossessor for any personal property taken with the vehicle and not returned. <em>Perkins v. City Natl. Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>(Mar. 22, 1977), 10th Dist. No. 76AP-730, 1977 WL 200020 (the plaintiff could recover for the conversion of personal items that \u201cthe defendant bank had no right, by virtue of the contractual arrangements of the parties on the security agreement, to repossess along with the motor home\u201d). See also <em>McGrady v. Nissan Motor Acceptance Corp. </em>(M.D.Ala.1998), 40 F.Supp.2d 1323, 1330 (\u201cConversion may occur when, during a repossession, personal property located in the repossessed vehicle is taken. * * * [Although the taking of the vehicle was lawful, the taking of Plaintiffs personal property * * * was not lawful\u201d); Billings, Handling Automobile Warranty <em>&amp; </em>Repossession Cases (2d Ed.2003), Section 11:47 (\u201cConversion may occur during an otherwise lawful repossession if the debtor\u2019s personal property is taken along with the automobile. The financier\u2019s security interest is in the automobile alone, and not in items located in it at the time of possession\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">{\u00b6 53} Here, ARS does not dispute that when it repossessed the Premier in May 2005, the Premier contained personal items that it did not return to James. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court erred in granting ARS summary judgment on James\u2019s claim for conversion of his personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">{\u00b6 54} In sum, we conclude that the trial court erred in granting ARS summary judgment on appellants\u2019 claims for trespass, James\u2019s claim for conversion of the Premier, James\u2019s claim for assault, and James\u2019s claim for conversion of personal property in the Premier. Consequently, we sustain appellants\u2019 second assignments of error to the extent that they challenge those rulings. In all other respects, we overrule appellants\u2019 second assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">{\u00b6 55} By their third assignments of error, appellants argue that the trial court erred in granting ARS summary judgment on their claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The third assignments of error also include a challenge to the trial court\u2019s determination that appellants could not recover punitive damages. Appellants, however, do not separately argue that point. We therefore decline to address it. App.R. 12(A)(2); <em>Bond, </em>2008-Ohio-945, 2008 WL 600201, at \u00b6 16-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>{\u00b6 56} A defendant is liable for intentional infliction of emotional distress if his \u201cextreme and outrageous conduct intentionally or recklessly causes serious emotional distress to another.\u201d <em>Yeager v.

Weinfeld, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 464, 2007-Ohio-2451, 866 N.E.2d 1051. \u201cSerious emotional distress\u201d goes beyond merely trifling disturbance, mere upset, or hurt feelings. <em>Paugh v.

The emotional injury must be so severe and debilitating that \u201ca reasonable person, normally constituted, would be unable to cope adequately with the mental distress engendered by the circumstances of the case.\u201d Id. Serious emotional distress includes traumatically induced neurosis, psychosis, chronic depression, and phobia. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"> {\u00b6 57} A plaintiff claiming serious emotional distress must present some \u201c \u2018guarantee of genuineness\u2019 \u201d in support of his claim to prevent summary judgment in favor of the defendant. <em>Powell v. Grant Med. Ctr. </em>(2002), 148 Ohio App.3d 1, 6, 771 N.E.2d 874, quoting <em>Paugh, </em>6 Ohio St.3d at 76, 6 OBR 114, 451 N.E.2d 759. In most instances, a plaintiff can supply that genuineness with expert medical testimony. <em>Schultz v. Barberton Glass Co. </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St.3d 131, 135, 4 OBR 376, 447 N.E.2d 109. Such testimony, however, is not always necessary. <em>Powell, </em>148 Ohio App.3d 1, 6-7, 771 N.E.2d 874. In lieu of expert testimony, a plaintiff may submit testimony of lay witnesses who \u201ctestify as to any marked changes in the emotional or habitual makeup that they discern in the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Paugh </em>at 80, 6 OBR 114, 451 N.E.2d 759. See also <em>Buckman-Peirson v. Brannon, </em>159 Ohio App.3d 12, 2004-Ohio-6074, 822 N.E.2d 830, \u00b6 41; <em>Powell </em>at 6-7. A court may decide whether the emotional injury alleged constitutes \u201cserious emotional distress\u201d as a matter of law. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">{\u00b6 58} In the case at bar, James testified that his interactions with the ARS agents have \u201cshaken [him] up mentally\u201d and that he \u201cwake[s] up probably at least two times a night * * * to see if they\u2019ve come to tow any cars.\u201d Carolyn stated that she was \u201ctruly frightened\u201d by the ARS agents\u2019 behavior. Neither James nor Carolyn sought the treatment of a psychologist, psychiatrist, or any other mental-health provider as a result of their experiences with ARS. No expert medical witness testified regarding the Ryans\u2019 mental states, and no lay witness acquainted with the Ryans testified as to a marked change in their mental states.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">{\u00b6 59} Given the state of the evidence, we conclude that no reasonable finder of fact could find that the Ryans have incurred the type of severe and debilitating emotional injury necessary for them to prevail on their claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Although the Ryans have felt emotional discom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>fort, as a matter of law their suffering did not rise to the level of serious emotional distress. See <em>Oglesby v. Columbus, </em>10th Dist. No. 01AP-1289, 2002-Ohio-3784, 2002 WL 1726033, \u00b6 29 (upholding summary judgment because reasonable minds could not conclude that the plaintiff had suffered severe emotional distress when the evidence established that the plaintiff felt humiliated, became emotional at times, and was unable to eat or sleep but never sought medical treatment for his distress).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">{\u00b6 60} Appellants, however, assert that they had identified a physician who would have testified as to their extreme emotional stress. Appellants failed to introduce into the record any testimony from this physician in response to ARS\u2019s summary-judgment motion. Consequently, the physician\u2019s alleged opinion cannot factor into our review of the trial court\u2019s summary-judgment ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">{\u00b6 61} Because the evidence in the record does not establish severe emotional distress, the trial court properly granted ARS summary judgment on appellants\u2019 claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Accordingly, we overrule appellants\u2019 third assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">{\u00b6 62} By their fourth assignments of error, appellants attack the trial court\u2019s award of summary judgment to Ford on its claims. First, James argues that the trial court erred in declaring that the lease agreement and retail installment contracts specified that the co-obligors to those contracts were jointly and severally responsible for making the required payments. In making this argument, James misinterprets both the amended complaint and the trial court\u2019s summary-judgment ruling. Ford never sought a declaratory judgment as to the character of the co-obligors\u2019 liability under the relevant contracts. Ford, instead, filed four breach-of-contract claims. Consequently, in granting summary judgment to Ford, the trial court did not declare that James and RRI were jointly and severally liable under the lease agreement or that James and R &amp; R were jointly and severally liable under the retail installment contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">{\u00b6 63} Moreover, in the amended judgment entry deciding Ford\u2019s summary-judgment motions, the trial court awarded damages consistent with Ford\u2019s concession that the co-obligors were only jointly liable under the contracts. The trial court specified that James and RRI were jointly liable for the $2,742.65 owed under the lease agreement, and it awarded Ford only half of the amounts due under the retail installment contracts.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">{\u00b6 64} Second, James argues that summary judgment was inappropriate because Ford failed to state any claims for relief in its amended complaint. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Specifically, James claims that Ford did not allege in the amended complaint that he and his co-obligors defaulted on the contracts. James also claims that Ford neglected to comply -with Civ.R. 10(D)(1). The record belies both claims. Ford alleged that James and his co-obligors had defaulted on their payment obligations when it stated that those obligations were \u201cpast due,\u201d and it specified the amounts owing under each contract. Also, pursuant to the dictates of Civ.R. 10(D)(1), Ford attached the lease agreement to its original complaint, and it attached the retail installment contracts to its amended complaint. Consequently, we conclude that Ford appropriately pleaded the breach-of-contract claims for which it later sought summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">{\u00b6 65} Third, James argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on Ford\u2019s claims for breach of the retail installment contracts because Ford never made R &amp; R a party to the action. As we explained above, James copurchased three vehicles with R <em>&amp; </em>R, and thus both James and R &amp; R are liable for the debt to Ford. Although Ford sued James for breach of the retail installment contracts arising from the purchase of those three vehicles, it did not also sue R <em>&amp; </em>R. James argues that R.C. 2721.12(A) required Ford to join R &amp; R, and Ford\u2019s failure to do so rendered the trial court\u2019s judgment void. R.C. 2721.12(A) states, \u201c[W]hen declaratory relief is sought under [R.C. Chapter 2721] in an action or proceeding, all persons who have or claim any interest that would be affected by the declaration shall be made parties to the action or proceeding.\u201d This statute is inapplicable here because Ford did not seek declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">{\u00b6 66} James also argues that Civ.R. 10(A) necessitated the joinder of R &amp; R. Civ.R. 10(A) merely requires that the title of a complaint \u201cinclude the names and addresses of all the parties.\u201d It does not list criteria for determining what parties are necessary to an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">{\u00b6 67} Although James never cites it, Civ.R. 19 is the applicable authority. <em>State ex rel. Gill v. Winters </em>(1990), 68 Ohio App.3d 497, 503, 589 N.E.2d 68 (Civ.R. 19 \u201cdescribes persons whose presence is needed for a just adjudication of the action\u201d). Civ.R. 19(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-8\">A person who is subject to service of process shall be joined as a party in the action if (1) in his absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already parties, or (2) he claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in his absence may (a) as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to protect that interest or (b) leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of his claimed interest * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>An appellate court reviews a trial court\u2019s decision whether a person is a necessary party under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Hambleton v. R.G. Barry Corp. </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 179, 184, 12 OBR 246, 465 N.E.2d 1298.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">{\u00b6 68} Here, R &amp; R is not a necessary party under Civ.R. 19(A)(1) because a court can accord complete relief among Ford and James. A creditor who sues a co-obligor for his portion of the debt can receive from that obligor the complete relief it requests (i.e., half of the debt). <em>Davis v. Middleton </em>(May 28, 1985), 12th Dist. No. CA84-08-054, 1985 WL 8677. Consequently, the other co-obligor is not a necessary party to the suit. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">{\u00b6 69} R &amp; R also fails to qualify as a necessary party under Civ.R. 19(A)(2). R &amp; R\u2019s absence from the instant case does not \u201cas a practical matter impair or impede [its] ability to protect\u201d its interest in the repossessed vehicles. Civ.R. 19(A)(2)(a). James is a party to this case, and as the 100 percent shareholder in R <em>&amp; </em>R, James\u2019s interests are completely aligned with R &amp; R\u2019s interests. Thus, James can fully protect R <em>&amp; </em>R\u2019s interests. Moreover, James is not \u201csubject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations.\u201d Civ.R. 19(A)(2)(b). As we explained above, the trial court entered judgment against James for only the portion of the debt that he owed. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to join R <em>&amp; </em>R as a party. James, therefore, cannot use the lack of joinder as a reason to overturn the trial court\u2019s award of summary judgment to Ford on its breach-of-contract claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">{\u00b6 70} Because James does not prevail on any of his arguments, we overrule his fourth assignment of error. Likewise, we overrule Carolyn\u2019s fourth assignment of error. Carolyn merely adopted James\u2019s arguments in support of her fourth assignment of error, and none of those arguments challenge the grant of summary judgment on Ford\u2019s breach-of-contract claim against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">{\u00b6 71} By their fifth assignments of error, appellants argue that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Ford and Bob-Boyd on appellants\u2019 CSPA claims. While we agree with appellants that Carolyn\u2019s CSPA claim against Bob-Boyd should have survived summary judgment, we find that the trial court appropriately awarded summary judgment on James\u2019s CSPA claims and Carolyn\u2019s CSPA claim against Ford.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">{\u00b6 72} R.C. 1345.02 and 1345.03 prohibit suppliers from engaging in unfair, deceptive, or unconscionable practices \u201cin connection with a consumer transaction.\u201d A \u201cconsumer transaction\u201d means \u201ca sale, lease, assignment, award by chance, or other transfer of an item of goods, a service, a franchise, or an intangible, to an individual for purposes that are primarily personal, family, or household.\u201d R.C. 1345.01(A). The definition of \u201cconsumer transaction\u201d does not include \u201ctransactions between persons, defined in sections 4905.03 and 5725.01 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>the Revised Code, and their customers.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Id. The \u201cpersons\u201d listed in R.C. 5725.01 include \u201cdealers in intangibles,\u201d which R.C. 5725.01(B)(1) defines as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-5\">[Ejvery person who keeps an office or other place of business in this state and engages at such office or other place in a business that consists primarily of lending money, or discounting, buying, or selling bills of exchange, drafts, acceptances, notes, mortgages, or other evidences of indebtedness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">{\u00b6 73} In the case at bar, Ford claims that appellants cannot sue it for violation of the CSPA because it is a \u201cdealer in intangibles.\u201d Ford attached to its motion for summary judgment the affidavit of Randall E. Golliher, a territory sales manager for Ford, in which Golliher testified that Ford maintained an office in Ohio from 2003 through 2006. Golliher also stated that at that office, Ford engaged in a business that primarily consisted of lending money or discounting, buying, or selling bills of exchange, drafts, acceptances, notes, mortgages, or other evidences of indebtedness. Appellants offer no evidence to rebut Golliher\u2019s affidavit. Accordingly, as Ford presented uncontradicted evidence that it qualifies as a \u201cdealer in intangibles,\u201d appellants\u2019 CSPA claims against Ford must fail. See <em>Reagans v. MountainHigh Coachworks, Inc., </em>117 Ohio St.3d 22, 2008-Ohio-271, 881 N.E.2d 245, \u00b6 33 (\u201cAs a general matter, transactions between financial institutions and their customers are exempted from the definition of a \u2018consumer transaction\u2019 subject to the Consumer Sales Practices Act\u201d); <em>Columbus Mtge., Inc. v.

Thus, James argues that he can assert a CSPA claim against Ford despite its being a \u201cdealer in intangibles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">{\u00b6 75} James acknowledges that he raises this argument for the first time before this court. Ordinarily, such a belated assertion of an argument results in its forfeiture. <em>State ex rel. Ohio Civ. Serv. Emp. </em>Assn., 104 Ohio St.3d 122, 2004-Ohio-6363, 818 N.E.2d 688, at \u00b6 10. James contends that he did not forfeit this argument because Ford did not attach the page of the retail installment contracts that contained the FTC-mandated notice to its summary-judgment motion. James is mistaken. Ford included that page in the copies of the retail installment contracts reproduced in the appendix to its motion. Thus, we decline to consider James\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">{\u00b6 76} Unlike Ford, Bob-Boyd does not claim to be a \u201cdealer in intangibles.\u201d Rather, Bob-Boyd argues that summary judgment was warranted on appellants\u2019 CSPA claims against it because appellants did not purchase their vehicles for primarily personal, family, or household purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">{\u00b6 77} A consumer cannot recover under the CSPA unless he entered into a \u201cconsumer transaction,\u201d i.e., a purchase made for primarily personal, family, or household purposes. R.C. 1345.01(A); <em>Giffin v. Crestview Cadillac, </em>10th Dist. No. 09AP-278, 2009-Ohio-6569, 2009 WL 4809862, \u00b6 21. Purchases of goods for primarily business purposes are not \u201cconsumer transactions\u201d and thus cannot support a CSPA claim. Id. at \u00b6 21. When deciding whether a \u201cconsumer transaction\u201d occurred, \u201ccourts look to \u2018the point in time when the parties have entered a binding agreement.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 22, quoting <em>Tomes v. George P. Ballas Leasing, Inc. </em>(Sept. 30, 1986), 6th Dist. No. L-85-359, 1986 WL 11420. Courts then examine the \u201cobjective manifestations\u201d that the purchaser made at that time regarding how he intended to use the purchased item. Id. If the purchaser\u2019s intentions are unclear, then courts apply the \u201cprincipal use\u201d test. Id. at \u00b6 26. The outcome of the principal-use test depends on how the owner of the item uses that item after its purchase.

No. 88AP-1030, 1989 WL 29351.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">{\u00b6 78} Here, as to the Premier, James made no objective manifestations regarding how he intended to use the vehicle. Although the retail installment contract contained a section in which the purchaser could indicate the \u201cUse For Which Purchased,\u201d that section is blank. As to the Monterey and Mountaineer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>James made conflicting objective manifestations regarding his purpose. James checked the \u201cpersonal\u201d box in the section of the retail installment contracts entitled \u201cUse For Which Purchased.\u201d However, James purchased each vehicle jointly with a corporation \u2014 R &amp; R. By definition, a corporation purchases goods only for business purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">{\u00b6 79} Ford recognized the inconsistency created by the representation that a corporation purchased the vehicles for personal use. Upon review of the retail installment contracts for the purchases of the Monterey and Mountaineer, Ford sent letters to R &amp; R indicating that \u201c[t]he Personal Use box is checked incorrectly\u201d and \u201c[t]he correct use for which [the vehicle was] purchased is Commercial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">{\u00b6 80} Based upon the totality of the evidence, we conclude that the objective manifestations regarding the intended use were either nonexistent or ambiguous. Thus, we turn to the principal-use test to determine whether the vehicles were purchased for personal or business purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">{\u00b6 81} After purchase, the vehicles were titled in the name of R &amp; R. Additionally, R <em>&amp; </em>R depreciated the vehicles as business assets on its 2004 federal tax return. That tax return indicates that in 2004, 90 percent of the Monterey\u2019s use was for business purposes, 85 percent of the Mountaineer\u2019s use was for business purposes, and 95 percent of the Premier\u2019s use was for business purposes. Accordingly, we conclude that James purchased the vehicles for primarily business, not personal, use. Because the purchases do not qualify as \u201cconsumer transactions,\u201d James\u2019s CSPA claims against Bob-Boyd must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">{\u00b6 82} We reach the opposite conclusion on Carolyn\u2019s CSPA claim against Bob-Boyd. Unlike James, Carolyn did not co-purchase her vehicle with a corporation. The only objective manifestation as to Carolyn\u2019s purpose is that she checked the \u201cpersonal\u201d box when designating the purpose for which she purchased the car. Therefore, we conclude that Carolyn engaged in a \u201cconsumer transaction,\u201d and thus, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on her CSPA claim against Bob-Boyd.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">{\u00b6 83} In sum, we overrule James\u2019s fifth assignment of error. We overrule Carolyn\u2019s fifth assignment of error to the extent it challenges the trial court\u2019s summary-judgment ruling as to Ford, but we sustain that assignment of error to the extent it challenges the trial court\u2019s ruling as to Bob-Boyd.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">{\u00b6 84} By his sixth assignment of error, James argues that the trial court erred in granting Ford\u2019s motion for an order exercising jurisdiction over the Premier and denying its return to him. The decision at issue arose due to a mix-up that occurred when ARS repossessed the Premier on January 12, 2006. Originally, the ARS agent had gone to the Ryans\u2019 home to repossess a 2001 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Mercury Villager, but instead, he mistakenly hooked the Premier to his tow truck. After a physical confrontation with James, the ARS agent towed away the Premier. Ford later sued James for breach of contract for his failure to make payments on the Villager, and that case was assigned to Judge Schneider. James moved for an order directing Ford to return the Premier to him. Ford responded that because James had defaulted on his obligation to pay for the Premier, the repossession of the Premier was lawful. Ford informed Judge Schneider that a breach-of-contract claim as to the Premier was pending in front of Judge Lynch. In his December 28, 2005 decision granting James\u2019s motion, Judge Schneider ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">[T]he present case does not concern the 2004 Mercury Mountaineer Premier vehicle, and so plaintiffs retaining possession of this vehicle through proceedings in the present case is unwarranted. However, the effective date of this decision shall be delayed ten (10) days to give plaintiff an opportunity to obtain a determination as to possession of this vehicle from Judge Lynch, if desired.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">{\u00b6 85} Ford then filed a motion before Judge Lynch requesting that she exercise jurisdiction over the Premier and deny the return of the Premier to James. Eventually, Judge Lynch granted that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">{\u00b6 86} The decision at issue is interlocutory and unrelated to the final judgments that resolved the claims of and against Ford, ARS, and Bob-Boyd. Consequently, this judgment is not yet ripe for appeal. <em>Haley, </em>2009-Ohio-447, 2009 WL 250871, at \u00b6 11-12; <em>Davis, </em>2008-Ohio-3501, 2008 WL 2700008, at \u00b6 6. Once the trial court enters a final order that disposes of the entirety of the instant case, James, if he chooses, may appeal this decision. We thus dismiss James\u2019s sixth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">{\u00b6 87} Having addressed appellants\u2019 first appeals, we now turn to their second appeals. By their first assignments of error, appellants argue that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Bob-Boyd on appellants\u2019 claims for breach of contract, estoppel, and violation of the CSPA.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We have addressed the CSPA claims above, so we need only consider whether summary judgment was appropriate on appellants\u2019 claims for breach of contract and estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">{\u00b6 88} Appellants claim that Bob-Boyd breached the retail installment contracts by repossessing the vehicles that secured the debt in the absence of any default. Bob-Boyd responds that although it initially executed the retail installment contracts, it subsequently assigned those contracts to Ford. Pointing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>those assignments, Bob-Boyd argues that it is no longer a party to the contracts, and thus, it cannot be liable for any breach of the contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">{\u00b6 89} An assignment is a transfer of property or of some right or interest from one person to another that causes the property, right, or interest to vest in the other person. <em>Siebert v. Columbus &amp; Franklin Cty. Metro. Park Dist. </em>(Dec. 28, 2000), 10th Dist. No. 00AP-583, 2000 WL 1877585; <em>Leber v. Buckeye Union Ins. Co. </em>(1997), 125 Ohio App.3d 321, 332, 708 N.E.2d 726. Generally, an assignment extinguishes the right in the assignor and transfers it to the assignee. <em>Griffin v. Porco </em>(Apr. 24, 1996), 1st Dist. No. C-941013, 1996 WL 194242. The assignee \u201cstands in the shoes of the assignor\u201d and \u201csucceeds to all the rights and remedies of the latter.\u201d <em>Inter Ins. Exchange of Chicago Motor Club v. Wagstaff </em>(1945), 144 Ohio St. 457, 460, 30 O.O. 44, 59 N.E.2d 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">{\u00b6 90} In the case at bar, Bob-Boyd relied on the affidavit of William L. Dawes, Bob-Boyd\u2019s dealer-operator, president, and co-owner, to prove its entitlement to summary judgment on the breach-of-contract claim. Dawes testified that after entering into the retail installment contracts, Bob-Boyd assigned them to Ford. Faced with this evidence, appellants concede that Bob-Boyd assigned the retail installment contracts to Ford. Appellants, however, argue that Bob-Boyd has \u201cprobable remaining interests\u201d under the contracts. Because appellants offer nothing but speculation to support this argument, we reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">{\u00b6 91} Appellants also argue that Bob-Boyd did not assign the purchase orders for the vehicles to Ford. While this may be true, it is inconsequential. Appellants did not assert a claim against Bob-Boyd for a breach of the purchase orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">{\u00b6 92} By assigning the retail installment contracts, Bob-Boyd transferred its interest in the contracts and does not retain any interest in them. We thus conclude that the trial court properly granted Bob-Boyd summary judgment on appellants\u2019 breach-of-contract claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">{\u00b6 93} Next, appellants contend that their estoppel claims should have survived Bob-Boyd\u2019s summary-judgment motion. Appellants claim that Bob-Boyd informed them that the contract extensions that Ford granted them were valid and enforceable. Appellants maintain that they relied on this representation to their detriment, and thus, Bob-Boyd should be estopped from denying that it made the representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">{\u00b6 94} Bob-Boyd presents two arguments in response. First, Bob-Boyd argues that appellants are seeking equitable estoppel, which is an affirmative defense and not a cause of action. Equitable estoppel precludes recovery \u201c \u2018when one party induces another to believe certain facts exist and the other party changes his position in reasonable reliance on those facts to his detriment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Doe v. Archdiocese of Cincinnati, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 538, 2008-Ohio-67, 880 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>N.E.2d 892, \u00b6 7, quoting <em>State ex rel. Chavis v. Sycamore City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 26, 34, 641 N.E.2d 188. Promissory estoppel allows recovery of damages when a defendant makes \u201c \u2018[a] promise which the [defendant] should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the [plaintiff] * * * and which does induce such action or forbearance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hortman v. Miamisburg, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 194, 2006-Ohio-4251, 852 N.E.2d 716, \u00b6 23, quoting Restatement of the Law 2d, Contracts (1981), Promise Reasonably Inducing Action or Forbearance, Section 90. The key distinction between the two doctrines is that equitable estoppel arises from a misrepresentation of fact, while promissory estoppel arises from a promise. <em>Hortman </em>at \u00b6 24. Moreover, equitable estoppel is a defense to a legal or equitable claim, while promissory estoppel is a cause of action. <em>Stern v. Shainker, </em>8th Dist. No. 92301, 2009-Ohio-2731, 2009 WL 1636173, \u00b6 11-12; <em>Callander v. Callander, </em>10th Dist. No. 07AP-746, 2008-Ohio-2305, 2008 WL 2026431, \u00b6 31; <em>Holt Co. of Ohio v. Ohio Mach. Co., </em>10th Dist. No. 06AP-911, 2007-Ohio-5557, 2007 WL 3027084, \u00b6 28. Equitable estoppel is a shield; promissory estoppel is a sword. <em>Stem </em>at \u00b6 12; <em>Callander </em>at \u00b6 31; <em>Holt Co. </em>at \u00b6 28; <em>First Fed. S. &amp; L. Assn. of Toledo v. Perry\u2019s Landing, Inc. </em>(1983), 11 Ohio App.3d 135, 144, 11 OBR 215, 463 N.E.2d 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">{\u00b6 95} We agree with Bob-Boyd that appellants appear to be seeking recovery for equitable estoppel. Appellants allege that Bob-Boyd made a misrepresentation, not a promise, which they detrimentally relied upon. Because equitable estoppel does not constitute a cause of action, appellants cannot prevail on such a \u201cclaim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\"> {\u00b6 96} Additionally, even if we construe appellants\u2019 claims as claims for promissory estoppel, Bob-Boyd presents a persuasive argument preventing appellants\u2019 recovery. In order to prove a claim for promissory estoppel, a plaintiff must establish (1) a clear, unambiguous promise, (2) that the person to whom the promise was made relied on the promise, (3) that reliance on the promise was reasonable and foreseeable, and (4) that the person claiming reliance was injured as a result of reliance on the promise. <em>Pappas v. Ippolito, </em>177 Ohio App.3d 625, 2008-Ohio-3976, 895 N.E.2d 610, \u00b6 55. Bob-Boyd contends that appellants cannot prove that they reasonably relied on Bob-Boyd\u2019s \u201cpromise\u201d because they knew that Ford was the party to whom they owed payment for the vehicles. Thus, Bob-Boyd posits, appellants understood that Ford \u2014 not Bob-Boyd \u2014 controlled whether they would receive extensions on their payment obligations. The evidence supports Bob-Boyd\u2019s argument. James testified that he arranged payment extensions with Ford. James understood that Ford was the creditor who had provided the financing for the vehicles and that Ford instrumented the repossessions. Therefore, we conclude that no reasonable finder of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>fact could find that appellants reasonably relied on anything Bob-Boyd \u201cpromised\u201d regarding payments appellants owed Ford.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">{\u00b6 97} In sum, we conclude that the trial court properly granted summary judgment to Bob-Boyd on appellants\u2019 claims for breach of contract and estoppel and on James\u2019s claim for violation of the CSPA. The trial court, however, erred in granting Bob-Boyd summary judgment on Carolyn\u2019s claim for violation of the CSPA. We thus sustain the first assignments of error as to Carolyn\u2019s CSPA claim only. In all other respects, we overrule the first assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">{\u00b6 98} By James\u2019s fourth assignment of error, he argues that R.C. 1309.609 violates the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, as well as Sections 1, 16, and 19, Article I of the Ohio Constitution. For the most part, we have already considered and rejected this argument. In this assignment of error, James relies on additional sections of the Ohio Constitution to bolster his earlier-asserted challenge to R.C. 1309.609\u2019s constitutionality. James, however, has forfeited any argument based on the Ohio Constitution because he failed to assert such an argument before the trial court. <em>State ex rel. Ohio Civ. Serv. Emp. Assn., </em>104 Ohio St.3d 122, 2004-Ohio-6363, 818 N.E.2d 688, at \u00b6 10. Accordingly, we overrule James\u2019s fourth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">{\u00b6 99} Next, we consider James\u2019s fifth and Carolyn\u2019s fourth assignments of error. By those assignments of error, appellants argue that the trial court erred in denying their Civ.R. 56(F) motions. For the reasons discussed above, we strike these assignments of error to the extent that they pertain to ARS. We will, however, review whether the trial court erred in denying the Civ.R. 56(F) motion that appellants filed seeking a continuance to respond to Ford\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">{\u00b6 100} Pursuant to Civ.R. 56(F), a party may seek additional time in which to develop the facts needed to adequately oppose a motion for summary judgment. <em>Hatton v. Interim Health Care of Columbus, Inc., </em>10th Dist. No. 06AP-828, 2007-Ohio-1418, 2007 WL 902176, \u00b6 10. The party seeking the Civ.R. 56(F) continuance bears the burden of establishing why the party cannot present sufficient facts to justify its opposition to a motion for summary judgment without a continuance. <em>Perpetual Fed. Sav. Bank v. TDS2 Prop. Mgt, L.L.C., </em>10th Dist. No. 09AP-285, 2009-Ohio-6774, 2009 WL 4936380, \u00b6 13; <em>Waverly City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Triad Architects, Inc., </em>10th Dist. No. 08AP-329, 2008-Ohio-6917, 2008 WL 5423269, \u00b6 17. The moving party cannot meet this burden with mere allegations; rather, the moving party must aver in an affidavit a particularized factual basis that explains why further discovery is necessary. <em>Morantz v. Ortiz, </em>10th Dist. No. 07AP-597, 2008-Ohio-1046, 2008 WL 642630, \u00b6 22; <em>Hahn v. Groveport, </em>10th Dist. No. 07AP-27, 2007-Ohio-5559, 2007 WL 3027075, \u00b630. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Absent an abuse of discretion, an appellate court will not reverse a trial court\u2019s ruling on a Civ.R. 56(F) motion. <em>State ex rel. Sawyer v. Cuyahoga Cty. Dept. of Children &amp; Family Servs., </em>110 Ohio St.3d 343, 2006-Ohio-4574, 853 N.E.2d 657, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">{\u00b6 101} Appellants expressed two motivations for filing their Civ.R. 56(F) motion. First, appellants\u2019 attorney, Ira B. Sully, explained that his co-counsel had withdrawn from the case approximately one week before Ford filed its motion for summary judgment. Apparently, the co-counsel had maintained the case file. Although the co-counsel claimed that he had delivered the entire case file to Sully, Sully believed that the file was incomplete. Sully sought additional time to review the court filings and discovery. Second, appellants wished to conduct additional discovery regarding whether ARS was acting as an agent or an independent contractor for Ford.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">{\u00b6 102} Sully faced a difficult task in assuming the role as appellants\u2019 primary counsel immediately before an opposing party filed a motion for summary judgment. However, as the trial court noted, Sully initially appeared in the ease in May 2006 \u2014 approximately three years before Ford sought summary judgment. Sully, therefore, was familiar with the facts and issues raised in Ford\u2019s motion. Additionally, although Sully claimed that the case file appeared incomplete, he failed to explain in his affidavit what documents were missing or how the absence of those documents adversely impacted his ability to respond to Ford\u2019s motion. Thus, the trial court was not persuaded by his plea for additional time to prepare a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">{\u00b6 103} The trial court also rejected appellants\u2019 bid for additional time to conduct discovery, stating that the discovery deadline had passed and that trial was only weeks away. In an agreed scheduling order filed on October 27, 2008, the parties agreed to April 13, 2009, as the discovery-cut-off date. Ford originally filed its motion for summary judgment, in which it argued that ARS was an independent contractor, on September 30, 2008.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, at the time appellants\u2019 attorneys (including Sully) agreed to the April 13, 2009 discovery deadline, they were aware of the independent-contractor issue. Apparently, appellants neither sought discovery on the issue nor requested an extension of the discovery deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">{\u00b6 104} Given Sully\u2019s previous involvement in the case and appellants\u2019 lack of diligence in conducting discovery, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>its discretion in denying appellants\u2019 Civ.R. 56(F) motion. Accordingly, we overrule James\u2019s fifth and Carolyn\u2019s fourth assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">{\u00b6 105} By James\u2019s sixth assignment of error, he argues that the trial court erred in granting Ford\u2019s motion for an order exercising jurisdiction over and denying the return of the Premier. For the reasons discussed in response to James\u2019s sixth assignment of error in his first appeal, we dismiss this assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">{\u00b6 106} We next turn to James\u2019s seventh assignment of error and Carolyn\u2019s fifth assignment of error. By these assignments of error, appellants argue that the trial court erred in granting Ford summary judgment on its breach-of-contract claims and appellants\u2019 claims. First, appellants contend that Ford failed to produce any evidence proving that appellants had defaulted on their payment obligations. Appellants are wrong. Ford presented the trial court with the affidavits of two of its employees to establish appellants\u2019 defaults.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">{\u00b6 107} First, Stephen Barbato, the center operations manager in the loss-prevention department at Ford\u2019s Greenville Service Center testified that (1) payment on the Premier was 61 days past due when ARS repossessed it, (2) payment on the Mountaineer was 55 days past due when ARS repossessed it, (3) payment on the Monterey was 22 days past due when ARS repossessed it, and (4) payment on Carolyn\u2019s Grand Marquis was 24 days past due when ARS repossessed it. Second, Barbara Travis, a center operations manager at Ford\u2019s National Recovery Center in Mesa, Arizona, testified that (1) the retail installment contract for the purchase of the Premier \u201chas been and remains in default,\u201d with $3,481.79 due and owing on the account, (2) the retail installment contract for the purchase of the Mountaineer \u201chas been and remains in default,\u201d with $8,784.40 due and owing on the account, (3) the retail installment contract for the purchase of the Monterey \u201chas been and remains in default,\u201d with $3,224.74 due and owing on the account, (4) the retail installment contract for the purchase of Carolyn\u2019s Grand Marquis \u201chas been and remains in default,\u201d with $8,635.24 due and owing on the account, and (5) the lease agreement for the lease of the Windstar \u201chas been and remains in default,\u201d with $2,742.65 due and owing on the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">{\u00b6 108} With these two affidavits, Ford established that each contract at issue was in default. Consequently, to avoid summary judgment, appellants had to present evidence creating a genuine issue of material fact as to the existence of the defaults or posit a legal reason why Ford could not recover on its claims. Appellants pursued the latter option, arguing that Ford waived the defaults by repeatedly accepting late payments from appellants. Appellants rely on <em>Slusser v. Wyrick </em>(1986), 28 Ohio App.3d 96, 97, 28 OBR 139, 502 N.E.2d 259, in which the Twelfth District held, \u201c[T]he acceptance of late payments by a creditor who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>has the statutory or contractual right to repossess the collateral estops the creditor from lawfully repossessing said collateral without notice after subsequent late payment default.\u201d Appellants assert, and Ford does not dispute, that Ford previously had accepted late payments from appellants. Additionally, appellants assert, and Ford does not dispute, that prior to initiating the repossessions, Ford did not notify appellants that they would have to strictly comply with the payment deadlines to avert repossession. Thus, appellants contend that, based on <em>Slusser, </em>Ford waived their defaults.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">{\u00b6 109} Although application of the rule pronounced in <em>Slusser </em>could have conceivably precluded Ford from employing its contractual remedies for appellants\u2019 default, it does not prevent Ford from pursuing a claim for breach of contract against appellants. In other words, Ford\u2019s failure to notify appellants of its intent to strictly enforce the retail installment contracts would, at best, estop Ford from repossessing the vehicles. Contrary to appellants\u2019 reading of <em>Slusser, </em>failure to notify does not excuse the default. Thus, <em>Slusser </em>does not provide a defense to Ford\u2019s breach-of-contract claims for appellants\u2019 default on their payment obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">{\u00b6 110} In any event, Ford also contends that <em>Slusser </em>is inapplicable to the case at bar because the retail installment contracts contain an antiwaiver provision. Unlike the contract at issue in <em>Slusser, </em>the retail installment contracts include a provision intended to prevent waiver from arising from acceptance of late payments. Pursuant to Section E of the retail installment contracts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADP\">Acceptance of a late payment or late charge does not excuse your default or mean that you can keep making payments after they are due. The Creditor may take the steps set forth in this contract if there is any default.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Section G of the retail installment contracts specifies that Ford can repossess the vehicle that secures the debt if the debtor defaults.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">{\u00b6 111} Typically, Ohio courts enforce antiwaiver clauses according to their terms. <em>Fields Excavating, Inc. v. McWane, Inc., </em>12th Dist. No. CA200812-114, 2009-Ohio-5925, 2009 WL 3721013, \u00b6 35. Consistent with that general rule, this court has already indicated that an antiwaiver provision in a security agreement precludes the application of <em>Slusser. Pizarro v. Credit Acceptance Corp. </em>(2001), 10th Dist. No. 01AP-392, 2001 WL 1263682. As courts outside of Ohio have held, if an antiwaiver clause preserves the secured party\u2019s right to demand strict compliance with the contractual terms and the debtor\u2019s failure to comply with the terms would otherwise give rise to the right to repossession without notice, then the secured party may repossess without providing the debtor notice. <em>Minor v. Chase Auto Fin. Corp., </em>\u2014 S.W.3d-, 2010 Ark. 246; <em>Williamson v. Nissan Motor Acceptance Corp. </em>(Ala.1993), 631 So.2d 241, 242; <em>Van Bibber v. Norris </em>(1981), 275 Ind. 555, 563-565, 419 N.E.2d 115; <em>Wade v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number><em>Ford Motor Credit Co. </em>(E.D.Mo.1978), 455 F.Supp. 147, 149-150. Such a rule adheres to the general principle that \u201ca security agreement is effective according to its terms between the parties.\u201d R.C. 1309.201(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">{\u00b6 112} Here, the retail installment contracts warned appellants that Ford\u2019s acceptance of late payments did not prohibit Ford from repossessing the vehicles as a consequence of subsequent late payments. Pursuant to this contractual term, Ford had a right to repossess after <em>any </em>default on the payment obligation. Ford, therefore, did not have to notify appellants before repossessing their vehicles. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err in granting Ford summary judgment on its breach-of-contract claims against appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">{\u00b6 113} Appellants next argue that Ford is derivatively liable for the torts that ARS committed when it repossessed the vehicles. Ford contends that because ARS is an independent contractor, it is not liable for ARS\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">{\u00b6 114} Generally, an employer of an independent contractor is not liable for the acts of the independent contractor. <em>Pusey v. Bator </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 275, 278, 762 N.E.2d 968. Two exceptions to this general rule, each stemming from the nondelegable duty doctrine, apply here. Nondelegable duties arise from (1) affirmative duties that are imposed on the employer by statute, contract, franchise, charter, or common law and (2) duties imposed on the employer that arise out of the work itself because its performance creates dangers to others, i.e., inherently dangerous work. Id. at 279. \u201cIf the work to be performed fits into one of these two categories, the employer may delegate the <em>work </em>to an independent contractor, but he cannot delegate the <em>duty.\u201d </em>(Emphasis sic.) Id. In other words, the employer is not insulated from liability if the independent contractor\u2019s actions result in a breach of the duty. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">{\u00b6 115} R.C. 1309.609 allows a secured party to repossess its collateral only if the secured party can accomplish the repossession without a breach of peace. Thus, the secured party has a statutory duty to avoid breaching the peace. <em>Leighty v. Am. Can Credit Union </em>(Dec. 9, 1982), 8th Dist. No. 44496, 1982 WL 2574 (\u201cShould a creditor seek to utilize the statutorily conferred right to self-help in recovering its collateral, it is incumbent upon that creditor to ensure that the means utilized do not constitute a breach of the peace\u201d). See also <em>Clark, </em>877 F.Supp. at 1448 (the Tennessee version of former U.C.C. 9-503 imposed \u201ca definite statutory obligation to take precautions against a breach of the peace\u201d); <em>MBank El Paso, N.A., </em>836 S.W.2d at 153 (\u201c[Former] section 9-503 of the UCC imposes a duty on secured creditors pursuing nonjudicial repossession to take precautions for public safety\u201d); <em>Gen. Fin. Corp. v. Smith </em>(Ala.1987), 505 So.2d 1045, 1048 (\u201cBy implication, [ ] a secured party is under a duty to take those precautions which are necessary at the time to avoid a breach of the peace.\u201d); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number><em>Rand v. Porsche Fin. Servs. </em>(Ct.App.2007), 216 Ariz. 424, 433, 167 P.3d 111 (Arizona\u2019s self-help repossession statute, based on U.C.C. 9-609, \u201cimpose[s] the specific safeguard that a creditor not breach the peace if that creditor elects to forgo judicial process when repossessing collateral\u201d); <em>Sammons v. Broward Bank </em>(Fla.App.1992), 599 So.2d 1018, 1020 (\u201cThe duty to repossess property in a peaceable manner is specifically imposed on a \u2018secured party\u2019 by the uniform commercial code\u201d); <em>Massengill v. Indiana Natl. Bank </em>(Ind.App.1990), 550 N.E.2d 97, 99 (the Indiana reiteration of former U.C.C. 9-503 and common law \u201cmake it clear that repossession of a secured chattel must be accomplished without breaching the peace. A clear statutory duty is present\u201d); <em>Nichols v. Metro. Bank </em>(Minn.App.1989), 435 N.W.2d 637, 640 (\u201cThe conditional nature of the secured party\u2019s self-help remedies and the language of the [self-help repossession statute] indicate that a secured party must ensure that there is no risk of harm to the debtor and others if the secured party chooses to repossess the collateral by self-help methods\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">{\u00b6 116} Because statutory duties are nondelegable, the secured party who must meet the duty is responsible for the actions of the independent contractor hired to carry out the duty. <em>Clark, </em>877 F.Supp. at 1448; <em>MBank El Paso, N.A., </em>836 S.W.2d at 153; <em>Gen. Fin. Corp., </em>505 So.2d at 1048; <em>Rand, </em>216 Ariz. at 434, 167 P.3d 111; <em>Massengill, </em>550 N.E.2d at 99; <em>Robinson v. Citicorp Natl. Servs., Inc. </em>(Mo.App.1996), 921 S.W.2d 52, 54-55; <em>Fulton v. Anchor Sav. Bank, FSB </em>(1994), 215 Ga.App. 456, 462-463, 452 S.E.2d 208; <em>Leighty, </em>8th Dist. No. 44496, 1982 WL 2574; <em>Sammons, </em>599 So.2d at 1020. Consequently, Ford is liable for ARS\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">{\u00b6 117} Moreover, even if no statutory duty existed, the exception for inherently dangerous work would also render Ford liable. Inherently dangerous work is work that \u201cinvolves a risk, recognizable in advance, of physical harm to others, which is inherent in the work itself.\u201d <em>Pusey, </em>94 Ohio St.3d at 280, 762 N.E.2d 968. The work \u201cmust create a risk that is not a normal, routine matter of customary human activity, such as driving an automobile, but is rather a special danger to those in the vicinity arising out of the particular situation created, and calling for special precautions.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">{\u00b6 118} Courts have recognized that self-help repossession constitutes an inherently dangerous activity. <em>Williamson v. Fowler Toyota, Inc., </em>1998 OK 14, 956 P.2d 858, \u00b6 8; <em>Hester v. Bandy </em>(Miss.1993), 627 So.2d 833, 841-843; <em>DeMary v. Rieker </em>(1997), 302 N.J.Super. 208, 221, 695 A.2d 294. Self-help repossession is a hazardous business because it necessitates activities that appear to the public as theft. Billings, Handling Automobile Warranty and Repossession Cases (2d Ed.) 631, Section 11:20. Whenever a person confiscates the property of another, particularly when the owner believes he is entitled to keep the property, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>potential for a dispute is high, and injury to person or property a foreseeable risk. <em>DeMary </em>at 221. Consequently, we conclude that self-help repossession creates a special danger arising out of the situation created by the work, and it calls for special precautions.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">{\u00b6 119} Because self-help repossession is inherently dangerous work, the secured party has a nondelegable duty to ensure that repossessions occur without a breach of the peace. <em>Williamson, </em>1998 OK 14, at \u00b6 16; <em>DeMary, </em>302 N.J.Super. at 222, 695 A.2d 294. Therefore, Ford is liable for ARS\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">{\u00b6 120} Consistent with the outcome of the above analysis, the drafters of the U.C.C. have also opined that creditors should be held liable for the actions of the independent contractors that they hire to repossess collateral. In the Official Comment to U.C.C. 9-609, the drafters state, \u201cIn considering whether a secured party has engaged in a breach of peace, [ ] courts should hold the secured party responsible for the actions of others taken on the secured party\u2019s behalf, including independent contractors engaged by the secured party to take possession of collateral.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">{\u00b6 121} Earlier, we concluded that a question of fact remains regarding whether ARS breached the peace when it repossessed the Premier on January 12, 2006. As Ford has a nondelegable duty to avoid a breach of the peace, Ford is liable for any torts that ARS committed during that repossession. We thus conclude that the trial court erred in granting Ford summary judgment on appellants\u2019 claims for conversion of the Premier, the trespass that allegedly occurred on January 12, 2006, and assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">{\u00b6 122} In sum, we conclude that the trial court appropriately awarded Ford summary judgment on its breach-of-contract claims. However, we conclude that summary judgment was inappropriate on James\u2019s claims for conversion, trespass, and assault and Carolyn\u2019s claim for trespass. Accordingly, we overrule James\u2019s seventh and Carolyn\u2019s fifth assignments of error to the extent that they challenge the trial court\u2019s ruling regarding Ford\u2019s breach-of-contract claims. We sustain James\u2019s seventh and Carolyn\u2019s fifth assignments of error to the extent that they challenge the trial court\u2019s ruling on James\u2019s claims for conversion, trespass, and assault and Carolyn\u2019s claim for trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">{\u00b6 123} We next turn to James\u2019s eighth and Carolyn\u2019s sixth assignments of error. By those assignments of error, appellants argue that the trial court erred in granting Ford leave to sell their vehicles. On September 19, 2006, Ford sought leave of court to sell the Premier and Monterey copurchased by James and R &amp; R as well as Carolyn\u2019s Grand Marquis. Apparently, Ford requested this court order to buttress its right under R.C. 1309.610(A) to sell collateral after default. The trial court granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>{\u00b6 124} Because the trial court\u2019s decision is interlocutory and unrelated to judgments resolving the claims of and against Ford, ARS, and Bob-Boyd, it is not yet ripe for appeal. <em>Haley, </em>2009-Ohio-447, 2009 WL 250871, at \u00b6 11-12; <em>Davis, </em>2008-Ohio-3501, 2008 WL 2700008, at \u00b6 6. Accordingly, we dismiss James\u2019s eighth and Carolyn\u2019s sixth assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">{\u00b6 125} For the foregoing reasons, in case Nos. 09AP-501 and 09AP-555, (1) we find the first assignments of error moot, (2) we sustain in part and overrule in part the second assignments of error, (3) we overrule the third and fourth assignments of error, (4) we overrule the fifth assignment of error in case No. 09AP-501, (5) we overrule in part and sustain in part the fifth assignment of error in case No. 09AP-555, and (6) we dismiss the sixth assignment of error in case No. 09AP-501.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">{\u00b6 126} In case Nos. 10AP-263 and 10AP-274, (1) we overrule the first assignment of error in case No. 10AP-263, (2) we overrule in part and sustain in part the first assignment of error in case No. 10AP-274, (3) we strike the second and third assignments of error, (4) we overrule the fourth assignment of error in case No. 10AP-263, (5) we strike the fifth assignment of error in case No. 10AP-263 and the fourth assignment of error in case No. 10AP-274 as they relate to ARS, (6) we overrule the fifth assignment of error in case No. 10AP-263 and the fourth assignment of error in case No. 10AP-274 as they relate to Ford, (7) we dismiss the sixth assignment of error in case No. 10AP-263, (8) we overrule in part and sustain in part the seventh assignment of error in case No. 10AP-263 and the fifth assignment of error in case No. 10AP-274, and (9) we dismiss the eighth assignment of error in case No. 10AP-263 and the sixth assignment of error in case No. 10AP-274.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">{\u00b6 127} Given the foregoing, we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgments of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, and we remand this case to that court for further proceedings consistent with law and this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">Judgments affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b637-9\">Bryant and Sadler, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b602-13\">. At this stage in the proceedings, Ford did not appreciate that RRI and R &amp; R are two different corporations. Although Ford later sought to add R &amp; R as a defendant, it never achieved service on R &amp; R. Accordingly, R &amp; R is not a party to this action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b602-14\">. Ford also brought a counterclaim against RRI solely for breach of a retail installment contract for the purchase of a 2004 Mercury Grand Marquis that R &amp; R had copurchased with Thomas J. Ryan, James and Carolyn's son.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b603-10\">. Ford also brought a third-party complaint against Thomas J. Ryan alleging that he had failed to pay as he had agreed in the retail installment contract that he entered into when copurchasing the Grand Marquis with R &amp; R.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b603-11\">. RRI also filed a counterclaim against Ford. This counterclaim remains pending before the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b604-11\">. We quote all the assignments of error verbatim, without correcting the grammatical, spelling, punctuation, or citation errors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b607-11\">. Carolyn's second appeal is designated appeal No. 10AP-274.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b609-7\">. In making this argument, James presumes that he can pursue claims arising from the repossession of the Mercury Grand Marquis copurchased by Thomas J. Ryan and R &amp; R. Because James neither purchased nor had any personal ownership interest in the Grand Marquis, he cannot assert any claims related to it. Thus, we do not address the Grand Marquis in our consideration of James\u2019s arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b610-8\">. ARS apparently recognized this deficiency, acknowledging in its reply brief that it \u201cdid not address [the trespass claims] within its Motion.\u201d Nevertheless, ARS still claimed that it was entitled to summary judgment on all appellants\u2019 claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b611-12\">. Former R.C. 1309.46 read, \"Unless otherwise agreed a secured party has on default the right to take possession of the collateral. In taking possession a secured party may proceed without judicial process if this can be done without breach of the peace.\u201d 129 Ohio Laws, 13, 168. Former R.C. 1309.46 is identical to former U.C.C. 9-503.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b615-9\">. Appellants failed to argue before the trial court that R.C. 1309.609 violates Section 14, Article I of the Ohio Constitution. Normally, this failure would result in forfeiture of the argument, and we would refuse to consider it. <em>State ex rel. Ohio Civ. Serv. Emp. Assn., AFSCME, Loe. 11, AFL-CIO v. State Emp. Relations Bd., </em>104 Ohio St.3d 122, 2004-Ohio-6363, 818 N.E.2d 688, \u00b6 10. We will, however, address appellants\u2019 argument because the language of Section 14, Article I of the Ohio Constitution is virtually identical to the language of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Appellants\u2019 argument before the trial court included the assertion that R.C. 1309.609 violated the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b616-7\">. Many of these cases actually address whether passage of the self-help repossession statute at issue qualified as action \u201cunder color of state law\u201d for Section 1983 purposes. However, conduct that satisfies the \"color of state law\u201d test also constitutes state action. <em>Brentwood Academy v. Tenn. Secondary School Athletic Assn. </em>(2001), 531 U.S. 288, 295, 121 S.Ct. 924, 148 L.Ed.2d 807, fn. 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b621-10\">.

Appellants also claim that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Bob-Boyd on their claims for negligent misrepresentation and violation of the RISA. Appellants did not assert either of these claims against Bob-Boyd in their counterclaims. As these claims are not part of this case, we will not consider them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b631-9\">. Appellants objected to Ford's original summary-judgment motion on the basis that they had yet to conduct discovery. The trial court did not rule on Ford\u2019s motion.
