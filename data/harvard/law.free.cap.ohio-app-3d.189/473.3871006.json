Smith Clinic and Clinic Investment L.L.C. (\u201cthe clinic\u201d) and dismissing his complaint against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">{\u00b6 2} On April 20, 2004, Martha was entering the clinic, aided by the use of a cane, when she was knocked down by the automatic sliding doors at the main entrance while in the threshold of the doors. Gayle Hayman, who had witnessed the incident, waited with Martha until employees of the clinic arrived and placed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>Martha on a stretcher and removed her from the scene. As a result of this incident, Martha suffered a broken elbow.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">{\u00b6 3} Martha filed a complaint in the Marion County Common Pleas Court on March 7, 2006, against the clinic and \u201cJohn Doe No. 1 Corporation and John Doe No. 2 Individual\u201d for the injuries she sustained from the accident. On June 15, 2005, Martha died from causes unrelated to the injuries she sustained in this matter, and, on July 15, 2005, her son, Randy, was appointed executor of her estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">{\u00b6 4} On February 15, 2007, the complaint was voluntarily dismissed pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A)(2). On February 8, 2008, Randy, as executor, refiled the complaint against the clinic and The Stanley Works, Stanley Access Technologies, and Stanley Magic-Door, Inc. (\u201cStanley\u201d), the manufacturer and provider of preventative maintenance for the doors by contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">{\u00b6 5} On February 25, 2008, and April 7, 2008, respectively, the clinic and Stanley filed their answers. Thereafter, on June 20, 2008, and July 24, 2008, respectively, the clinic and Stanley filed motions for summary judgment. On February 10, 2009, Randy filed a response to the clinic\u2019s motion, but on February 12, 2009, Randy voluntarily dismissed Stanley. On February 27, 2009, the clinic filed a reply and memorandum in support of its motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">{\u00b6 6} On October 16, 2009, the trial court granted the clinic\u2019s motion for summary judgment, finding that the automatic sliding doors were an open and obvious danger for which the clinic owed no duty to warn Martha. On November 12, 2009, the trial court filed a journal entry dismissing the action with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">{\u00b6 7} This appeal followed, and Randy now asserts two assignments of error.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-9\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR I</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-10\">The trial court failed to apply the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur to the premature closing of the automatic sliding glass doors which caused injury to the plaintiff which would defeat defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-11\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR II</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-12\">There is a question of fact of whether a business owner is negligent when the owner of the business has previously been advised that its automatic sliding glass doors prematurely closed on a business invitee and fails to remedy that hazard which causes an injury to a subsequent business invitee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-13\">{\u00b6 8} For ease of discussion, we elect to address these assignments of error out of the order in which they appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>\n<em>Second Assignment of Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">{\u00b6 9} In Randy\u2019s second assignment of error, he contends that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the clinic because there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the clinic breached the duty of care it owed to Martha based upon its failure to provide a warning about not stopping on the threshold, its creation of the hazard, and its failure to remedy the hazard after it existed for 19 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">{\u00b6 10} An appellate court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo, without any deference to the trial court. <em>Conley-Slowinski v. Superior Spinning &amp; Stamping Co. </em>(1998), 128 Ohio App.3d 360, 363, 714 N.E.2d 991; see also <em>Hasenfratz v. Warnement, </em>3d Dist. No. 1-06-03, 2006-Ohio-2797, 2006 WL 1519921, citing <em>Lorain Natl. Bank v. Saratoga Apts. </em>(1989), 61 Ohio App.3d 127, 572 N.E.2d 198. A grant of summary judgment will be affirmed only when the requirements of Civ.R. 56(C) are met. Summary judgment requires the moving party to establish the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">[W]hen, looking at the evidence as a whole, (1) no genuine issue of material fact remains to be litigated, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) it appears from the evidence, construed most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, that reasonable minds could only conclude in favor of the moving party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-8\"><em>Horton v. Harwick Chem. Corp. </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 679, 653 N.E.2d 1196, paragraph three of the syllabus. See also Civ.R. 56(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">{\u00b6 11} The party moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of identifying the basis for its motion in order to allow the opposing party a \u201cmeaningful opportunity to respond.\u201d <em>Mitseff v. Wheeler </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 112, 526 N.E.2d 798, syllabus. The moving party also bears the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact as to an essential element of the case. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 292, 662 N.E.2d 264. Once the moving party demonstrates that he is entitled to summary judgment, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to produce evidence on any issue about which that party bears the burden of production at trial. See Civ.R. 56(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">{\u00b6 12} In ruling on a summary-judgment motion, a court is not permitted to weigh evidence or choose among reasonable inferences; rather, the court must evaluate evidence, taking all permissible inferences and resolving questions of credibility in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>Jacobs v. Racevskis </em>(1995), 105 Ohio App.3d 1, 7, 663 N.E.2d 653. Additionally, Civ.R.56(C) mandates that summary judgment shall be rendered if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence, and written stipula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>tions of fact show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">{\u00b6 13} To prevail in a negligence action, a plaintiff must demonstrate that (1) the defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff, (2) the defendant breached that duty, and (3) the defendant\u2019s breach proximately caused the plaintiff to be injured.

The applicable duty is determined by the relationship between the landowner and the plaintiff when the alleged negligence occurs in a premises-liability context. Id., citing <em>Gladon v. Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Auth. </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 312, 315, 662 N.E.2d 287.

In a premises-liability action, the plaintiff can prove the defendant\u2019s breach of duty if any one of three conditions is satisfied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">[T]he defendant, through its officers or employees, was responsible for the hazard complained of; (2) at least one of such persons had actual knowledge of the hazard and neglected to give adequate notice of its presence or to remove it promptly; or (3) such danger existed for a sufficient length of time reasonably to justify the inference that the failure to warn against it or remove it was attributable to a want of ordinary care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-7\"><em>Gouhin v.

Overhead Door Corp. </em>(Apr. 26, 1988), 3d Dist. No. 1-86-23, 1988 WL 40434, *1.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">{\u00b6 16} In the case sub judice, Randy maintains that the clinic was responsible for the hazard, i.e., the doors closing while a person was in the threshold, because it had no policies and procedures for implementing the daily safety checklist provided to it by Stanley Access Technologies, the company that serviced the doors at the clinic, and had no method by which it documented which employee implemented the checklist on any particular day. In addition, Randy asserts that the clinic was responsible for the hazard because it determined the length of time the doors would remain open before the doors automatically closed and because it was informed by a Stanley technician that the OmniScan sensor that operated the opening and closing of the doors was obsolete and should be upgraded.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">{\u00b6 17} We find that Randy\u2019s assertion regarding the clinic\u2019s control of the length of time the doors would remain open before automatically closing has merit. First, Rich Cole, a supervisor for Stanley, testified about the operation of various sensors. For instance, Cole testified that one type of threshold sensor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>referred to as the \u201cStan-Guard,\u201d \u201clooks straight down from the bottom of the header across the opening of the door to make sure that there\u2019s nobody standing in the opening of the door.\u201d However, this sensor has a blind spot because of its limited width, and if there is no movement in the threshold for a certain period of time, the sensor will \u201ctime-out,\u201d resulting in the doors closing. Cole testified that the timer on the Stan-Guard is determined by the customer and can be set to time-out from anywhere between 30 seconds and three minutes. He further testified that because of the Stan-Guard\u2019s limitations, a redundant threshold sensor, referred to as a \u201cholding beam,\u201d is often used in the sides of the doorway so the door will not close on someone who is in the threshold. Although Cole was unfamiliar with the OmniScan sensor and how it operated, his testimony reveals that there are numerous options available to customers and that it is the customer who chooses the door and the safety mechanisms that will be installed. Further, a Stanley technician recommended in June 2003 that the OmniScan sensors be upgraded. Although this recommendation was made based upon the sensors\u2019 being obsolete rather than because they were not working, the fact that the technician was making a <em>recommendation </em>to the clinic to upgrade demonstrates that the choice of sensors was the clinic\u2019s, rather than the service provider\u2019s. Thus, the clinic determined what safety devices would be utilized.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">{\u00b6 18} Second, the testimony of Ralph Neddleton, the Facilities Director for the clinic, revealed that the clinic chose what company would maintain these doors and when the doors would be serviced. Further, the clinic knew in September 2002 that another incident similar to Martha\u2019s had occurred when Lee Ann Murraya, who was using a walker, was knocked down by the same doors as she was entering the clinic. Once the clinic knew this type of incident could happen, it alone had the power to determine whether to have new sensors installed to accommodate the types of invitees that frequented its establishment. In the alternative, if possible on the current sensors, it could have lengthened the amount of time before the doors would time-out or it could have adjusted the sensors that detected whether someone/something was in the pathway of the doors to ensure that the doors would not close if someone was in the threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">{\u00b6 19} When construing this evidence in a light most favorable to Randy, we find that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the clinic created this hazard by failing to choose adequate safety measures or otherwise warning its invitees about the length of time they had to safely traverse the threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">{\u00b6 20} Randy also maintains that the clinic had actual knowledge of the hazard and neglected to give adequate notice of its presence or to remove it promptly. In support of his position, Randy relies upon the previously noted prior occurrence of a similar incident involving these doors.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>{\u00b6 21} In this incident, the affidavit of Lee Ann Murraya stated that she was injured at the clinic on September 23, 2002. More specifically, Murraya averred that she was entering the clinic through the automatic sliding doors at the main entrance with the aid of her walker when the doors started to close on her. She attempted to stop the doors but was unable to do so. The doors then knocked her to the ground. This fall resulted in a broken finger on her right hand. Murraya further stated that she was immediately taken by wheelchair to a receptionist, where she checked in for her doctor\u2019s appointment. She told the receptionist about her fall and completed an incident report. Four days later, Murraya was contacted by a claims specialist from the clinic\u2019s insurance company, and her claim was later settled out of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">{\u00b6 22} When viewed in a light most favorable to Randy, this evidence reveals that the clinic was aware of a prior incident in which a woman, who was unable to walk without assistance, was injured while in the threshold of these sets of doors. Yet there is no evidence that the clinic took any steps to alleviate this problem after the first incident. While the evidence shows that Stanley conducted routine preventive maintenance on these doors in March and June 2003 and the doors were functioning properly and within ANSI<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> standards, there is nothing to indicate that anyone attempted to determine at any point after Murraya\u2019s fall how long a person could remain in the threshold before the doors would close.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">{\u00b6 23} Further, the record is devoid of any evidence that steps were taken by the clinic to ensure that disabled persons entering the clinic, who require more time to walk through a doorway than the average nondisabled person, could safely traverse through the doors. Notably, this is a medical clinic, catering to the needs of those who may be ill, injured, and/or disabled. Although the doors may be operating properly and the time-out setting is satisfactory for the average person using those doors, the clinic was aware that a previous invitee who had to use assistance in order to walk was struck and injured by these doors. At that point, reasonable minds could conclude that the clinic should have pursued one of two options: (1) remedy this problem by installing better sensors that could detect whether an object was in the threshold, even if that object was immobile, so that the doors would either not begin to close or not continue to close while someone/something was in the path of these doors, or (2) place some sort of notice in a location easily observed by those entering and exiting these doors, warning people to use caution and notifying them that the doors automatically close in \u201cx\u201d amount of time. Given this evidence, we find that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the clinic had actual knowledge of the hazard and neglected to give adequate notice of its presence or to remove it promptly.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>{\u00b6 24} In addition, the clinic was made aware of this incident on September 23, 2002, some 19 months prior to Martha\u2019s accident. However, the record reveals only two times that the doors were inspected, and neither of these indicates that the clinic ever attempted to evaluate whether it needed to obtain more sensitive sensors or install sensors that could detect when someone/something was in the threshold, whether that person was mobile or stationary. Accordingly, reasonable minds could conclude that this hazard existed for a sufficient length of time, i.e., 19 months, to reasonably justify the inference that the failure to warn against it or remove it was attributable to a want of ordinary care. Thus, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to this issue as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">{\u00b6 25} Lastly, a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the clinic failed to take reasonable precautions to protect the invitee, Martha, from dangers that were foreseeable from the arrangement or use of these doors. As previously noted, this obligation extends to the original installation of these doors when it results in a dangerous condition. See <em>Perry, </em>53 Ohio St.2d at 53, 7 O.O.3d 130, 372 N.E.2d 335. Therefore, even if this prior incident had not occurred, the clinic should have taken reasonable precautions to protect its invitees, who undoubtedly included disabled and ill persons who oftentimes require more time to walk through a doorway than the average nondisabled person, by equipping its doors with protection devices to prevent closure in the event that someone is in the threshold of the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">{\u00b6 26} In light of the evidence, and construing all of the evidence in a light most favorable to Randy, we find that there exists a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the clinic breached its duty of care to Martha, and the trial court erred in finding otherwise. Nevertheless, the clinic asserts that it did not owe Martha a duty of care because the opening and closing of the doors was an open and obvious danger. We disagree, as did the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">{\u00b6 27} The Supreme Court of Ohio summarized the case law on the open-and-obvious doctrine in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-7\">\u201cWhere a danger is open and obvious, a landowner owes no duty of care to individuals lawfully on the premises.\u201d <em>Armstrong v. Best Buy Co., Inc., </em>99 Ohio St.3d 79, 2003-Ohio-2573, 788 N.E.2d 1088, syllabus, approving and following <em>Sidle v. Humphrey </em>(1968), 13 Ohio St.2d 45, 42 O.O.2d 96, 233 N.E.2d 589. \u201c[T]he owner or occupier may reasonably expect that persons entering the premises will discover those dangers and take appropriate measures to protect themselves.\u201d <em>Simmers v. Bentley Constr. Co. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 642, 644, 597 N.E.2d 504. Thus, when a plaintiff is injured by an open and obvious danger, summary judgment is generally appropriate because the duty of care necessary to establish negligence does not exist as a matter of law. <em>Armstrong </em>at \u00b6 14-15.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number><em>Lang v. Holly Hill Motel, Inc., </em>122 Ohio St.3d 120, 2009-Ohio-2495, 909 N.E.2d 120, at \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">{\u00b6 28} Although a commercial building with automatic sliding doors is very commonplace in today\u2019s society, common experience with these doors does not suggest that they are likely to close on a person. To the contrary, most expect that these doors are equipped with safety mechanisms to prevent the door from closing on a person, to prevent injuries from occurring. For instance, these doors usually begin to close after a certain amount of time, but when someone or something enters the threshold, they cease closing and either remain in their position or reopen. Thus, we do not find that automatic sliding doors pose the open and obvious danger of closing on a person and causing injury so that an owner or occupier may reasonably expect that persons entering the premises will take appropriate measures to protect themselves.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, the open-and-obvious doctrine does not apply in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">{\u00b6 29} For all of these reasons, the first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">\n<em>First Assignment of Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">{\u00b6 30} Randy contends in his first assignment of error that the trial court erred by failing to apply the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur to the premature closing of the automatic sliding doors. In contrast, the clinic asserts that this doctrine is inapplicable because the clinic did not have exclusive control over the automatic doors, and two or more equally probable causes exist for the injuries sustained by Martha.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cThe res ipsa loquitur doctrine is an evidentiary rule which permits, but does not require, an inference of negligence when the elements of the doctrine are shown.\u201d <em>Cochran v. Ohio Auto Club </em>(Oct. 3, 1996), 3d Dist. No. 9-96-33, 1996 WL 562055, citing <em>Morgan v. Children\u2019s Hosp. </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 185, 18 OBR 253, 480 N.E.2d 464.

George Wiedemann Brewing Co. </em>(1970), 23 Ohio St.2d 65, 66-67, 52 O.O.2d 366, 262 N.E.2d 703; <em>Fink v. New York Cent. RR. Co. </em>(1944), 144 Ohio St. 1, 28 O.O. 550, 56 N.E.2d 456. <em>\u201cRes ipsa loquitur </em>does not apply where the facts are such that an inference that the accident was due to a cause other than defendant\u2019s negligence could be drawn as reasonably as if it was due to his negligence.\u201d <em>Cochran, </em>3d Dist. No. 9-96-33, 1996 WL 562055, *4, citing <em>Greer v. Frazier-Williams Chevrolet-Oldsmobile, Inc. </em>(Apr. 3, 1991), 1st Dist. No. C-900242, 1991 WL 45569.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">{\u00b6 32} Here, the clinic asserts that it did not have exclusive management and control of the door because it contracted with Stanley for the maintenance and inspection of the doors. The clinic also maintains that there are other efficient and probable causes of Martha\u2019s injury that are not attributable to the negligence of the clinic.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">{\u00b6 33} As to the issue of exclusive management and control, Cole testified that the customer, such as the clinic, signs a contract for preventive maintenance with the company, and the contract terms provide how often maintenance will be performed. Further, the customer determines when maintenance will be performed. For instance, Cole testified that some customers request that the Stanley technician call before coming to the customer\u2019s location. Otherwise, the technician will simply go to the location and inquire of the customer whether \u201cit\u2019s a good day for the inspection.\u201d Beyond preventive maintenance, the service provided by Stanley is at the request of the customer: \u201c[W]e [Stanley] don\u2019t go somewhere we\u2019re not asked to go.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">{\u00b6 34} Neddleton testified that the service contract with Stanley was for a yearly inspection of the doors and for any repairs or maintenance needed on the doors. If a repair was needed, the technician would provide a service ticket to Neddleton, who would either approve or not approve the repair. Then, any approved repairs would be performed by the technician. Beyond this, the clinic\u2019s maintenance department is not responsible for the maintenance of the doors but is responsible for making sure that the doors operate safely at the beginning of each business day. In order to do this, a maintenance worker unlocks the doors<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and turns them on at approximately 6:30 each morning. The worker then follows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>a checklist, which is located on the upper right-hand corner of the outside door frame. This procedure consists of allowing the doors to \u201ccycle\u201d and close, and then the worker walks through both sets of doors (beginning on the inside of the clinic, as the worker enters the clinic through an employee entrance) and back through them. This walk-through is done one time. However, this check does not include stopping in the threshold to determine whether the doors will close on the worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">{\u00b6 35} A review of the evidence also reveals that Stanley conducted preventive maintenance in March and June 2003 and at that time, the threshold scan and/or safety beams were working properly and within ANSI standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">{\u00b6 36} Martha was injured in April 2004, some ten months after this last service. During this time, the evidence reveals that the only people responsible for ensuring that the doors worked properly and safely were the employees in the clinic\u2019s maintenance department. While anyone entering and exiting the clinic was capable of activating the doors by merely entering the pathway of the sensors responsible for automatically opening the doors, the record is devoid of any evidence that the general public could manipulate the activity and/or sensitivity of the sensors either purposely or inadvertently or, more importantly, could make decisions about the timing of the sensors or the <em>closing </em>of the doors.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">{\u00b6 37} Further, the clinic exerted exclusive management and control over when these doors were accessible to the public by locking them at night and unlocking them in the morning. Neddleton also provided testimony as to what would happen if the doors did not function properly, such as shutting them down in the event that they malfunctioned or securing them in an open position if there was an operational problem. Thus, the evidence when viewed in a light most favorable to Randy indicates that the clinic had the sole power to determine when and if the public would have access to these doors.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">{\u00b6 38} Moreover, as previously noted, the clinic determined what kind of doors it would have, what sensors it wanted on these doors, what company would maintain these doors, and when the doors would be serviced. Further, once the clinic knew of another incident similar to Martha\u2019s, it alone had the power to determine whether to have new sensors installed to accommodate the types of invitees that frequented its establishment or, if possible on the current sensors, to lengthen the amount of time before the doors would time-out or adjust the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>sensors that detected whether someone or something was in the pathway of the doors.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">{\u00b6 39} For all of these reasons, we find that Randy presented sufficient evidence that <em>at the time of Martha\u2019s injury, </em>the doors were under the exclusive management and control of the clinic.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">{\u00b6 40} Our inquiry does not end there, however. The next question is whether the injury occurred under such circumstances that in the ordinary course of events, it would not have occurred if ordinary care had been observed. Several courts have concluded that \u201c[ajutomatic doors do not, in the ordinary course of things, cause injury to those who pass through them.\u201d <em>Brown v. Scrivner, Inc. </em>(1992), 241 Neb. 286, 488 N.W.2d 17, 19. See also <em>Rose v. Port of New York Auth. </em>(1972), 61 N.J. 129, 293 A.2d 371, 375 (\u201c[mjembers of the public passing through automatic doors, whether in an airport, office building or supermarket do so generally, without sustaining injury. What happened to the plaintiff here is fortunately unusual and not commonplace. It strongly suggests a malfunction which in turn suggests neglect\u201d; noted in Prosser &amp; Keeton, Law of Torts (5th Ed.1984)); <em>Landmark Hotel &amp; Casino, Inc. v. Moore </em>(1988), 104 Nev. 297, 757 P.2d 361, 364 (\u201c[a]utomatic sliding glass doors * * * are ubiquitous, affording the public safe ingress and egress to countless facilities on a daily basis. What happened to Moore is unusual; it strongly suggests a malfunction attributable to negligence\u201d). But see <em>Hisey v. Cashway Supermarkets, Inc. </em>(1967), 77 N.M. 638, 426 P.2d 784.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">{\u00b6 41} We agree with those courts that have found that automatic doors do not ordinarily close on a person absent negligence. Nevertheless, the clinic maintains that there is more than one reasonable probable cause of the door\u2019s closing on Martha that is not attributable to the clinic\u2019s negligence: (1) the manufacturer\u2019s limit to a maximum of three minutes for the doors to remain open when Martha may have needed more time to traverse the doors, (2) poor design of the sensor that may not have \u201cseen\u201d Martha while she was standing in that area of the door, and (3) Martha\u2019s failure to position herself where the sensors could detect her or \u201cto move quickly enough to have avoided the closing door.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">{\u00b6 42} What the clinic fails to acknowledge is that none of these contentions alleviates its knowledge of the door\u2019s sensors and thus, its negligence in failing to address these issues. The clinic knew the make-up of its clientele. The clinic would be the party with the knowledge about what doors it used and what type of timing the sensors had. The clinic knew of another incident wherein a disabled invitee was injured when she did not \u201cmove quickly enough\u201d to avoid being struck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>by the closing automatic doors. Yet the record is devoid of any evidence that the clinic did anything to obtain more sensitive sensors, lengthen the amount of time before the doors timed-out, if possible, or otherwise warn its disabled invitees to stay in the path of the sensors and/or \u201cmove quickly enough to avoid injury.\u201d Further, there is nothing in the record to show that Martha had acted in any negligent manner. Hayman\u2019s undisputed affidavit demonstrates that Martha merely attempted to walk through the doorway as one would ordinarily do, albeit slowly because she needed a cane to walk. Simply not having the agility to avoid being hit by a closing door does not amount to negligence. Therefore, we find that Martha was injured under such circumstances that in the ordinary course of events would not have occurred if <em>ordinary care </em>had been observed. Accordingly, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur does apply, and the first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">{\u00b6 43} For all of these reasons, the judgment of the Common Pleas Court of Marion County, Ohio, is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b518-7\">Rogers, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b518-8\">Preston, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b512-7\">. ANSI is the acronym for the American National Standards Institute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b514-12\">. The dissent cites a number of cases, many of which are from courts in Michigan, in support of its position that the open-and-obvious doctrine should apply in this case. A review of those cases reveals that those decisions are inapposite to the case sub judice. In fact, most of those cases did not involve automatic <em>sliding </em>doors that retract to the sides, as is the case sub judice, but were automatic hinged doors. We find a distinct difference as to the open and obvious danger presented by automatic hinged doors, which need space to open and can actually open and hit a person who is in the path of the doors, and the type of doors at issue in this case, which do not present such dangers in their normal operation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b515-8\">. Neddleton testified that security for the clinic locks the doors each night between 10:00 and 10:30.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b516-9\">. We find the cases cited by the clinic regarding public access to instrumentalities causing an invitee injury to be inapposite to the case sub judice. Rather, those cases involved situations wherein the public's access to these things could have as readily resulted in the injuries to the plaintiff as any act or omission by the defendant-business. See e.g., <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Wal-Mart Stores, </em>4th Dist. No. 07CA2990, 2008-Ohio-2477, 2008 WL 2152000 (merchandise display was in location that customers could access and manipulate).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b517-8\">. Once again the dissent relies on a number of cases that are factually distinguishable from the case sub judice to avoid application of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitor.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b518-9\">Preston, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AbU\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">{\u00b6 44} The majority\u2019s opinion fails to hold Randy to his reciprocal burden under Civ.R. 56(E) to set forth facts showing a genuine issue for trial. As a result of this fundamental error, the majority opinion incorrectly concludes that a question of fact remains, fails to apply the open-and-obvious doctrine, and incorrectly applies the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">{\u00b6 45} The Smith Clinic moved for summary judgment primarily for two reasons: (1) that plaintiff failed to demonstrate a breach of duty and (2) that it owed Martha no duty of care since the automatic doors\u2019 <em>normal operation </em>was an open and obvious danger. In his response brief at trial <em>and on appeal, </em>Randy offered <em>no </em>argument regarding the application of the open-and-obvious doctrine to the normal operation of the automatic doors; rather, Randy argued that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applied and that evidence existed demonstrating a breach of the clime\u2019s duty of care. In fact, the trial court noted Randy\u2019s lack of argument in its judgment entry: \u201cPlaintiff did not address this issue in its response brief and therefore has not raised any genuine issue of material fact with regards to the operation of the open and obvious doctrine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>{\u00b6 46} Nevertheless, the majority concludes \u2014 with little analysis \u2014 that the open-and-obvious doctrine does not apply to the automatic doors in this case. Several courts have concluded otherwise when, like here, there is no evidence that the automatic doors malfunctioned. <em>Brown v. Pet Supplies Plus </em>(Aug. 26, 1999), 7th Dist. No. 98 CA 9, 1999 WL 689206; <em>Cassani v. Meijer, Inc. </em>(Mich.Ct.App.2003), No. 240486, 2003 WL 1365919, at *1; <em>Rummel v. Henry Ford Health Sys. </em>(Mich.Ct.App.2007), No. 271563, 2007 WL 1791955, at *1. See also <em>Mann v. Tractor Supply Co. </em>(S.D.Ohio 2010), No. 2:08-cv-569, 2010 WL 1856312, at *4-5 (open-and-obvious doctrine does <em>not </em>apply when the automatic door malfunctions); <em>Horvath v. Fisher Foods, Inc. </em>(App.1963), 93 Ohio Law Abs. 182, 28 O.O.2d 113, 194 N.E.2d 452, 455 (question of fact concerning <em>abnormal </em>operation of automatic door); <em>Hoganson v. Menard, Inc. </em>(W.D.Mich.2007), No. 2:04-cv-299, 2007 WL 4395534 (same). The evidence in this case demonstrated that the automatic doors were inspected just months prior to Martha\u2019s accident and found to be working within ANSI safety standards. But for the accidents, there is simply a lack of evidence indicating a door malfunction in this case, and to avoid summary judgment, Randy was required under Civ.R. 56(E) to set forth specific facts indicating a malfunction. As an additional matter, the warning that Randy suggests should have been provided to patrons \u2014 \u201c[d]on\u2019t stop on the threshold\u201d \u2014 declares the open-and-obvious nature of the hazard upon ordinary inspection by a reasonable person.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">{\u00b6 47} The majority also incorrectly concludes that a question of fact remains concerning a breach of duty. Like in <em>Gouhin v. Giant Eagle, </em>there was simply a lack of evidence in this case demonstrating a breach of duty. 10th Dist. No. 07AP-548, 2008-Ohio-766, 2008 WL 500334. Rich Cole\u2019s testimony concerning the operation of the Stanley \u201cStan-Guard\u201d sensor is irrelevant to show a breach of duty because the Smith Clinic\u2019s automatic doors were equipped with \u201cOmniScan\u201d sensors. When asked how Stan-Guard sensors differed from Omni-Scan sensors, Cole testified, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what an OmniScan is or does. * * * [a]nd I had never heard of them before I saw it on the document here.\u201d When asked if Stan-Guard sensors were technologically superior to Omni-Scan sensors, Cole testified, \u201cNot better, just different. I don\u2019t know that it was better or not, I don\u2019t know what the OmniScan was, what it did.\u201d In fact, the record indicates that Cole has never even seen the clinic\u2019s automatic doors or sensors. Despite Cole\u2019s lack of knowledge and his testimony that the clinic\u2019s OmniScan sensor <em>was </em>operating within ANSI safety standards, the majority concludes that the clinic\u2019s <em>ability </em>to replace the OmniScan sensors with better or additional safety sensors \u2014 including those not required by ANSI safety standards \u2014 demonstrates a breach of the clinic\u2019s duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>{\u00b6 48} The majority\u2019s decision is even more troubling because, in practice, it requires business owners to install safety devices <em>beyond </em>those ANSI safety standards require \u2014 at least to avoid tort liability. For example, the majority suggests that the clinic should have installed a sensor that would have held the doors open when someone/something was in the door\u2019s path and immobile. This would have probably required that the clinic install a \u201cholding beam,\u201d which Cole testified that ANSI safety standards did not require at that time. The Smith Clinic could have reasonably relied upon Stanley Door\u2019s conclusion that their automatic doors were compliant with ANSI safety standards. Reliance upon these national standards provides businesses with guidance in maintaining safe automatic doors. The majority\u2019s opinion undermines this guidance and reliance. The majority has inappropriately replaced ANSI safety standards with its own.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">{\u00b6 49} The majority also errs in concluding that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applies in this case. Again, Randy has failed to meet <em>his burden </em>to \u201cadduce evidence\u201d in support of the doctrine\u2019s two required conclusions. <em>Jennings Buick, Inc. v. Cincinnati </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 167, 170, 406 N.E.2d 1385. In his response to the clinic\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Randy merely <em>alleged: </em>\u201cThere should be no dispute * * * that at the time of the injury * * * the sliding glass doors to the main entrance to the Fredrick C. Smith Clinic was under the exclusive management and control of the defendant.\u201d Likewise, on appeal, Randy failed to point to any evidence in the record upon which a rational trier of fact could conclude that the automatic doors were in the clinic\u2019s exclusive management and control. In fact, Randy mistakenly asserted: \u201cIt is unrefuted that Defendant Clinic had exclusive management and control of the automatic sliding doors during the time in question.\u201d The clinic, both in its reply brief in the trial court and in its appellate brief, strongly refuted that the automatic doors were in their exclusive control and management. Further, Randy has filed no reply brief with this court. \u25a0 Aside from that, the doctrine is inapplicable here because the evidence affirmatively demonstrated that the accident <em>could have </em>occurred even if the OmniScan sensor was functioning properly and the doors were equipped with holding beams.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">{\u00b6 50} Furthermore, the Court of Appeals in Ohio has rejected the application of the doctrine, finding that the business owners did not have exclusive management and control of the automatic doors since patrons control the doors\u2019 operation. <em>Knox v. Bag-N-Save Foods </em>(Apr. 8, 1999), 5th Dist. No. 1998AP080100, 1999 WL 254518, at *3; <em>Lewis v. Newburg Supermarket </em>(Sept. 24, 1998), 8th Dist. No. 73238, 1998 WL 655491, at *4. See also <em>Farina v. First Natl. Bank </em>(1943), 72 Ohio App. 109, 27 O.O. 29, 51 N.E.2d 36 (manual revolving bank door). One district in Ohio found the doctrine applicable where the evidence affirmatively demonstrated \u201cthat automatic doors, when properly operating, do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>not close on people.\u201d <em>Musial v. Tamarkin Co. </em>(Sept. 1, 1994), 7th Dist. No. 98 C.A. 40, 1994 WL 813603, at *1. Cole\u2019s testimony here was exactly the opposite. The majority ignores these Ohio decisions, and instead, relies upon cases from other states to reach its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">{\u00b6 51} For all these reasons, I respectfully dissent. I would overrule the assignments of error and affirm the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
