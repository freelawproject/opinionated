The Dyes alleged that the appellants removed a garage from property the Smiths were renting from the Dyes and that during the removal, Mr. Smith, the Carsons, and Ash attacked Mr. Dye. The trial court entered a default judgment against the appellants and found that they were jointly and severally liable for $14,000 in damages for removing the garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>The appellants contend that the trial court erred in finding the Carsons and Ash liable because the complaint did not seek damages for injury to the real estate from them. Civ.R. 54(C) provides that a default judgment cannot be \u201cdifferent in kind from or exceed in amount that prayed for in the demand for judgment.\u201d In their demand for judgment, the Dyes sought damages for the garage removal only from the Smiths. Thus, the trial court erred in finding the Carsons and Ash jointly and severally liable for those damages. Moreover, our resolution of this issue renders moot the appellants\u2019 additional claim that R.C. 5301.61 does not permit an award of such damages against the Carsons or Ash.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-12\">{\u00b6 3} In addition, the appellants argue that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied the Smiths\u2019 motion for relief from the default judgment. The Smiths claim that their failure to respond to the complaint constitutes inadvertence or excusable neglect because they thought that the complaint related to a grand-jury investigation of Mr. Dye and his father-in-law for their role in the altercation during the garage removal. However, at the motion hearing, the Smiths admitted that they had received the complaint, read it, knew they were being sued for money damages, and knew they had 28 days to respond to the complaint. And though the Smiths claimed to believe that an attorney was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>handling the matter for them based on statements Steve Carson made, they never personally spoke to the attorney about this lawsuit. Thus, the trial court\u2019s finding that the Smiths had failed to establish inadvertence or excusable neglect was not unreasonable, unconscionable, or arbitrary, and the court properly denied their motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">{\u00b6 4} In June 2009, the Dyes filed a complaint against the appellants. The Dyes alleged that with their permission, the Smiths had constructed a garage, affixed by a concrete foundation, on property they leased from the Dyes. Subsequently, the Smiths gave the Dyes notice that they wanted to terminate their month-to-month tenancy and planned to dismantle the garage and remove it from the property. Over the Dyes\u2019 objection, the Smiths began to dismantle the garage with the assistance of the Carsons and Ash. The Dyes claimed that when Mrs. Dye and her mother-in-law approached the appellants and demanded that they stop, Mr. Smith, the Carsons, and Ash threatened to physically harm them. When Mr. Dye and Anthony Atkinson (his father-in-law) went to the property, Mr. Smith, the Carsons, and Ash attacked them, causing \u201csignificant bodily injury.\u201d The Dyes alleged that after the fight, Mr. Smith, the Carsons, and Ash finished removing the garage from the property. The Dyes claimed that the appellants\u2019 actions were \u201cwillful, wanton and intentional\u201d and made the following demand for judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-6\">WHEREFORE, the Plaintiffs * * * respectfully demand * * * that they be awarded a judgment against the Defendants, CELESTA J. SMITH AND BRADLEY N. SMITH, in an amount sufficient to compensate them for the destruction of the garage on the Plaintiffs\u2019 property, plus interest, both prejudgment and post judgment; that the Plaintiffs be awarded a judgment against the Defendants, BRADLEY N. SMITH, STEVE L. CARSON, KYLE L. CARSON and MICHAEL L. ASH, jointly and severally, for bodily injuries suffered by the Plaintiff, BRION K. DYE, as a result of the physical attack on him, plus interest, both pre-judgment and post judgment; that the Plaintiffs be awarded a judgment for punitive damages against the Defendants, CELESTA J. SMITH, BRADLEY N. SMITH, STEVE L. CARSON, KYLE L. CARSON and MICHAEL L. ASH, jointly and severally, plus interest, both pre-judgment and post judgment; that the Plaintiffs be awarded their attorney\u2019s fees and the costs of this action, and other relief as to the Court may seem [sic] just and equitable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">(Boldface sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">{\u00b6 5} After the appellants received service of process and failed to respond to the complaint, the Dyes filed a motion for default judgment. The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>entered a judgment in favor of the Dyes \u201cagainst each of the Defendants, jointly and severally, on the issue of liability\u201d and scheduled a damages hearing. The appellants filed a Civ.R. 60(B) motion for relief from judgment, which the court denied after a hearing. The court found that there was \u201cno mistake, inadvertence, excusable neglect, newly discovered evidence, fraud, or other evidence\u201d to support the motion. And after the damages hearing, which the appellants participated in, the court entered a judgment against the appellants, jointly and severally, for $14,000 for the loss in fair-market value to the Dyes\u2019 property from the garage\u2019s removal, plus interest and costs. The court denied the Dyes\u2019 request for attorney fees. In addition, the court found that it could not \u201cdetermine which side or which party initiated the fight\u201d and did not award the Dyes \u201cpunitive damages for the fight.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">II. Assignments of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">{\u00b6 6} Appellants assign the following errors for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-7\">The trial court erred when it granted judgment for damages against defendants-appellants other than Celesta and Bradley Smith for the reduction in value of plaintiffs-appellees\u2019 real property on the assertion that the statute (R.C. Sec. 5301.61) allowed for the recovery of such damages from persons who were not buyers, lessees, tenants, occupants, and who have no interest in the real property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-8\">The trial court erred when it granted judgment for damages against defendants-appellants other than Celesta and Bradley Smith for the reduction in value of plaintiffs-appellees\u2019 real property when the demand contained in the complaint only demanded such damages from Celesta and Bradley Smith, who were lessees and occupants of the real property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-9\">The trial court abused its discretion when it denied the motion for relief from judgment filed by the defendants-appellants Celesta and Bradley Smith.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">For ease of analysis, we will address the appellants\u2019 assignments of error out of order.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">III. Default-Judgment Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b150-12\">{\u00b6 7} In their second assignment of error, the appellants contend that the trial court erred in finding the Carsons and Ash liable for the damages caused by the garage removal because the Dyes did not request those damages in their complaint. We review a trial court\u2019s decision to grant a motion for default judgment under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Ramsey v. Rutherford, </em>Ross App. No. 09CA3094, 2009-Ohio-5146, 2009 WL 3112018, at \u00b6 10. But unlike the initial decision to grant a default judgment, \u201cthe determination of the kind and maximum amount of damages that may be awarded is not committed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>discretion of the trial court, but is subject to the mandates of Civ.R. 55(C) and Civ.R. 54(C).\u201d <em>Natl. City Bank v. Shuman, </em>Summit App. No. 21484, 2003-Ohio-6116, 2003 WL 22715585, at \u00b6 6. The Civil Rules are \u201cthe law of this state with regard to practice and procedure in our state courts.\u201d <em>Rockey v. 84 Lumber Co. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 221, 224, 611 N.E.2d 789. Thus, \u201cthe question of whether a trial court\u2019s grant of default judgment complies with Civ.R. 55(C) and Civ.R. 54(C) is one of law, which we review de novo.\u201d <em>Natl. City Bank </em>at \u00b6 6; see also <em>Masny v. Vallo, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 84983, 2005-Ohio-2178, 2005 WL 1048237, at \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\"> {\u00b6 8} Civ.R. 55(C) provides that \u201c[i]n all cases a judgment by default is subject to the limitations of Rule 54(C).\u201d And under Civ.R. 54(C), \u201c[a] judgment by default shall not be different in kind from or exceed in amount that prayed for in the demand for judgment.\u201d \u201cThe primary purpose of Civ. R. 54(C)\u2019s limitations on default judgments is to ensure that defendants are clearly notified of the maximum potential liability to which they are exposed, so that they may make an informed, rational choice to either: (1) enable a default judgment by not responding, or (2) invest the time and expense involved in defending an action.\u201d <em>Natl. City Bank </em>at \u00b6 11, citing <em>White Oak Communities, Inc. v. Russell </em>(Nov. 9, 1999), Franklin App. No. 98AP-1563, 1999 WL 1009745; see also <em>Masny </em>at \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">{\u00b6 9} The Dyes\u2019 complaint alleged that the Carsons and Ash participated in the removal of the garage. However, in the demand for judgment, the Dyes specifically requested a judgment against \u201cCELESTA J. SMITH AND BRADLEY N. SMITH, in an amount sufficient to compensate them for the destruction of the garage on the Plaintiffs\u2019 property.\u201d The Dyes did not similarly request a judgment against the Carsons or Ash to compensate them for the destruction of the garage. Therefore, the trial court erred in entering a default judgment against them for those damages. See <em>Natl. City Bank </em>at \u00b6 2, 8 (finding court erred in granting bank a default judgment and awarding damages against a guarantor on a line of credit because complaint only contained demand for judgment against borrower and not against guarantor). Moreover, our resolution of this assignment of error renders moot the appellants\u2019 first assignment of error, in which they argue that R.C. 5301.61 did not permit a judgment against the Carsons and Ash for these damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">{\u00b6 10} We note that the Dyes alleged in their complaint that the Carsons and Ash joined Mr. Smith in attacking Mr. Dye. In the demand for judgment, the Dyes specifically requested \u201ca judgment against the Defendants, BRADLEY N. SMITH, STEVE L. CARSON, KYLE L. CARSON and MICHAEL L. ASH, jointly and severally, for bodily injuries suffered by the Plaintiff, BRION K. DYE, as a result of the physical attack on him.\u201d And the court entered a default judgment \u201cagainst each of the Defendants, jointly and severally, on the issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>liability.\u201d But in its October 2009 judgment entry, the court states that it could not determine \u201cwhich side or which party initiated the fight\u201d and did not award the Dyes punitive damages for this fight. Thus, instead of interpreting the complaint as alleging a battery claim with the issue of liability decided by the default judgment, the court appeared to consider the altercation only as a potential basis for a punitive-damages award. The Dyes do not contest that characterization or appeal the court\u2019s failure to award damages for Mr. Dye\u2019s bodily injuries. And we note that the Dyes made no effort to quantify damages from Mr. Dye\u2019s injuries in the complaint or at the damages hearing. Therefore, we need not address those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">IV. Civ.R. 60(B) Motion for Relief from Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">{\u00b6 11} The appellants jointly filed a Civ.R. 60(B) motion for relief from judgment. However, in their third assignment of error, the appellants contend that the trial court erred only in denying the Smiths\u2019 request for relief. Civ.R. 55(B) provides that \u201c[i]f a judgment by default has been entered, the court may set it aside in accordance with Rule 60(B).\u201d And to prevail on a Civ.R. 60(B) motion, the movant must demonstrate (1) timeliness of the motion, (2) entitlement to relief under one of the grounds stated in Civ.R. 60(B)(1) through (5), and (8) a meritorious claim or defense to present if relief is granted. <em>GTE Automatic Elec., Inc. v. ARC Industries, Inc. </em>(1976), 47 Ohio St.2d 146, 150-151, 1 O.O.3d 86, 351 N.E.2d 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">{\u00b6 12} Absent an abuse of discretion, we will not disturb a trial court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a Civ.R. 60(B) motion. <em>Griffey v. Rajan </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 75, 77, 514 N.E.2d 1122. The term \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, unconscionable, or arbitrary. <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 16 O.O.3d 169, 404 N.E.2d 144. When applying the abuse-of-discretion standard, a reviewing court is not free to merely substitute its judgment for that of the trial court. <em>In re Jane Doe 1 </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 135, 138, 566 N.E.2d 1181.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">{\u00b6 13} The appellants argue that the Smiths (1) timely filed their motion for relief from judgment, (2) were entitled to relief based on excusable neglect or inadvertence under Civ.R. 60(B)(1), and (3) had a meritorious defense to the complaint, i.e., they caused no damage to the Dyes\u2019 property, and the Dyes came to court without clean hands. Although the Smiths raised other grounds in Civ.R. 60(B)(1) through (5) as a basis for relief from the judgment, they did not renew those arguments on appeal, so we need not address them. Moreover, the Dyes do not challenge the timeliness of the Smiths\u2019 motion. Therefore, we begin by addressing the appellants\u2019 claim that the court erred in finding that the Smiths failed to demonstrate inadvertence or excusable neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>{\u00b6 14} Inadvertence is \u201c[a]n accidental oversight; a result of carelessness.\u201d <em>Guider v. Am. Heritage Homes Corp., </em>Logan App. No. 8-07-16, 2008-Ohio-2402, 2008 WL 2080686, at \u00b6 7, quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th Ed.Rev. 1999) 762. The phrase \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d is \u201can elusive concept which has been difficult to define and to apply.\u201d <em>Kay v. Marc Glassman, Inc. </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 18, 20, 665 N.E.2d 1102. The inaction of a defendant is not excusable neglect if it can be labeled as a \u201ccomplete disregard for the judicial system.\u201d Id., quoting <em>GTE Automatic Elec, </em>at 153, 1 O.O.3d 86, 351 N.E.2d 113. \u201cGenerally, a failure to plead or respond after admittedly receiving a copy of a court document is not \u2018excusable neglect.\u2019 \u201d <em>Natl. City Home Loans Serv., Inc. v. Gillette, </em>Scioto App. No. 05CA3027, 2006-Ohio-2881, 2006 WL 1555903, at \u00b6 18, citing <em>Katko v. Modic </em>(1993), 85 Ohio App.3d 834, 838, 621 N.E.2d 809, and <em>Andrew Bihl Sons, Inc. v. Trembly </em>(1990), 67 Ohio App.3d 664, 667, 588 N.E.2d 172. However, the determination of whether excusable neglect justifying relief from judgment occurred in a particular case \u201cmust of necessity take into consideration all the surrounding facts and circumstances.\u201d <em>Colley v. Bazell </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 243, 249, 18 O.O.3d 442, 416 N.E.2d 605. And \u201c[although courts should strive to decide cases upon their merits rather than upon procedural grounds, that principle must be balanced against the competing principle that litigation must be brought to an end.\u201d <em>Newman v. Farmacy Natural &amp; Specialty Foods, </em>168 Ohio App.3d 630, 2006-Ohio-4633, 861 N.E.2d 559, at \u00b6 22, citing <em>Rose Chevrolet, Inc. v. Adams </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 17, 21, 520 N.E.2d 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">{\u00b6 15} The appellants contend that the Smiths\u2019 failure to respond to the complaint constitutes excusable neglect or inadvertence because the Smiths believed that the complaint was \u201cpart of the criminal case against the Appellees.\u201d In an affidavit accompanying the Civ.R. 60(B) motion, Mr. Smith averred that he thought that the complaint was related to a grand-jury investigation of Mr. Dye and Mr. Atkinson\u2019s roles in the altercation that occurred during the garage\u2019s removal. And during the hearing on the motion, Mr. and Mrs. Smith testified to this effect. However, the Smiths admitted that they had received the complaint, read it, knew that they were being sued for money, and knew that they had 28 days to respond to the complaint. Moreover, although the Smiths claimed at the hearing to believe that an attorney was handling the matter based on statements Steve Carson made to them, the Smiths never spoke to this attorney about the complaint or about representing them in this case. The Smiths contacted this attorney only one time, prior to receiving the complaint, about the possibility of filing suit against Mr. Dye and Mr. Atkinson.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">{\u00b6 16} The Smiths were clearly aware of the pending lawsuit and essentially ignored the matter until after the trial court granted a default judgment on the issue of liability. Under these circumstances, the trial court did not abuse its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>discretion in finding that the Smiths\u2019 disregard of the legal process was not \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d or \u201cinadvertence\u201d entitling them to relief from the default judgment. And because the Smiths failed to establish one of the three required elements to succeed on a Civ.R. 60(B) motion, i.e., entitlement to relief under one of the grounds stated in Civ.R. 60(B)(1) through (5), we need not address the issue of whether they had a meritorious defense to present. Accordingly, we overrule the appellants\u2019 third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">{\u00b6 17} We overrule the appellants\u2019 third assignment of error. We sustain their second assignment of error, and this decision renders moot their first assignment of error. Accordingly, we remand this cause to the trial court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b154-7\">Abele and Kline, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
