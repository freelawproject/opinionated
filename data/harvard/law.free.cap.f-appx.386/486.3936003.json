He contends that the district court clearly erred in denying a mitigating role adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. Section 3B1.2 provides for a four-level reduction in a defendant\u2019s offense level if the defendant was a \u201cminimal\u201d participant in a concerted criminal activity, a two-level reduction in his offense level if he was a \u201cminor\u201d participant, and a three-level reduction if the defendant\u2019s role fell between that of a \u201cminimal\u201d participant and a \u201cminor\u201d participant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-24\">The burden is on the defendant to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he is entitled to a mitigating role adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.2.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And \u201c \u00a7 3B1.2 only applies when a defendant is \u2018substantially less culpable than the average participant.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cIt is not enough that a defendant does less than other participants; in order to qualify as a minor participant, a defendant must have been peripheral to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>the advancement of the illicit activity.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Whether Marquez was entitled to a reduction under \u00a7 3B 1.2 is a factual determination that is reviewed for clear error.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cA factual finding is not clearly erroneous if it is plausible in light of the record read as a whole.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Marquez\u2019s statements to authorities concerning his involvement with the drug trafficking dealings of one of his co-defendants, Jaime Luna, indicate that Marquez had an established and ongoing relationship with Luna\u2019s drug trafficking activities and stood to profit from the specific activity that led to the arrests in this case. Marquez was the only participant in Luna\u2019s drug trafficking activities who accompanied Luna to both of the transfers of methamphetamine. After Marquez\u2019s arrest, investigators found inside Marquez\u2019s residence materials consistent with drug trafficking, such as electronic scales and a clear plastic bag containing methamphetamine residue that was similar to the bag used in the transfer of one pound of methamphetamine earlier that day. Luna stated to investigators that he left this pound of methamphetamine in Marquez\u2019s possession prior to the transfer. The district court\u2019s finding that Marquez\u2019s role in the offense did not warrant an adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.2 was plausible in light of the record as a whole and, thus, not clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Marquez alternatively contends that his sentence was substantively unreasonable due to the district court\u2019s refusal to grant a downward variance despite his limited role in the drug trafficking activities in this case. Because Marquez objected to his sentence as unreasonable in the district court, this argument has been preserved for appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Marquez\u2019s sentence is presumed reasonable because it was within his guidelines range,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and he has not shown sufficient reason for this court to disturb that presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b508-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
