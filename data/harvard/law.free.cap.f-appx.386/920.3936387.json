Because Krist filed his habeas petition before exhausting his administrative remedies, the district court properly dismissed his petition for lack of jurisdiction. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b943-10\">On 15 April 2009, Krist filed a <em>pro se </em>petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, alleging that Warden Ike Eichenlaub had unlawfully denied him entry into the final component of a drug abuse treatment program, which would have made him eligible for a possible sentence reduction. Rl-1. Eichenlaub placed a memorandum in Krist\u2019s file indicating that he would not be considered for treatment in a residential reentry center because, based on his prior convictions for escape and kidnapping, he was considered a significant threat to the community. <em>Id. </em>at 27. To appeal that decision, Krist asserted that he filed a request for informal resolution BP-8 on 17 March 2009, and a formal written Administrative Remedy Request BP-9 on 6 April 2009, but never received responses. <em>Id. </em>at 3. He attached a copy of his BP-9 to his habeas petition, which included a handwritten date of 6 April 2009. <em>Id. </em>at 29. In his memorandum in support of his petition, Krist argued that the district court had discretion to waive the administrative exhaustion requirement, and that it should have exercised that discretion in his case because by the time he had exhausted his administrative remedies, it would have been too late to receive the drug therapy he sought. Rl-5 at 3-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-13\">Krist later amended his petition, asserting that he had in fact exhausted his administrative remedies, and submitted an affidavit and additional documents as evidence. Rl-21; Rl-21-1. In his affidavit, he alleged that he hand-delivered his BP-8 to a designated prison official on 17 March 2009, and his BP-9 to the same prison official on 6 April 2009. Rl-21-1 at 1. He asserted that the warden had 20 days to respond to his BP-9, and when he did not receive a timely response, he properly appealed to the Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) Regional Office on 28 April 2009, using a BP-10 form. <em>Id. </em>at 2. After being rejected, he appealed again to the BOP central office on 13 May 2009, using a BP-11 form, and was rejected again. <em>Id. </em>On 19 June 2009, Krist received a series of documents, including responses to his BP-8 and BP-9. <em>Id. </em>at 1. He asserted that the central office\u2019s rejection was the final step in the administrative appeal process, such that he had exhausted his administrative remedies. <em>Id. </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-14\">The attachments to Krist\u2019s affidavit included a denial of his BP-8. <em>Id. </em>at 8-10. There also appeared to be denials of two separate BP-9s, one \u201cdated April 6, 2009,\u201d and one \u201creceipted June 2, 2009,\u201d both denied on the merits. <em>Id. </em>at 5-7, 11. However, the denial referencing the 6 April 2009 BP-9 was unsigned, undated, and did not include a case number. <em>Id. </em>at 11. There was a copy of Krist\u2019s BP-10, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>dated 28 April 2009, which the regional office rejected, stating he must first file a BP-9 with the institution. <em>Id. </em>at 15-18. Finally, there was also a copy of his BP-11, dated 13 May 2009, which the central office rejected, again instructing Krist to first file a BP-9 with the institution. <em>Id. </em>at 12-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">Eichenlaub responded to Krist\u2019s petition, asserting both that Krist had not exhausted his administrative remedies, and that his petition should be denied on the merits. Rl-27 at 7-11. Attached to the response was a statement from Gary Sail- or, Unit Manager of Krist\u2019s prison, stating that \u201c[wjhile it appears Petitioner may have indeed filed the April [6, 2009] BP-9, the BOP has no record of [it] being logged into its SENTRY database, nor was [it] given a tracking number.\u201d Rl-27-1 at 5. There was also a computer-generated list of all of Krist\u2019s administrative remedy filings, which indicated that the only BP-9 he filed regarding this issue was received on 2 June 2009. <em>See </em>Rl-27-6 at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">Krist replied, asserting again that he had exhausted his administrative remedies. Rl-31 at 7-9. In doing so, he conceded that he \u201chad not exhausted [his] administrative remedies] at the time he filed his petition,\u201d but asserted that he had since done so. <em>Id. </em>at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">The magistrate judge issued a Report and Recommendation (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d), recommending that Krist\u2019s petition be denied without prejudice for failure to exhaust his administrative remedies. Rl-40 at 12. The magistrate judge found that there was no record that Krist had filed a BP-9 in April, and that he had refiled it in June, after both his BP-10 and BP-11 were rejected. <em>Id. </em>at 7-8. The magistrate judge concluded that this did not satisfy the administrative exhaustion requirements, stating that \u201c[w]hile it may seem nonsensical at first blush to require the petitioner to re-submit a BP-10 and a BP-11 after having done so, the fact of the matter is, the only BP-10 and BP-11 that were submitted were rejected on procedural grounds, without an examination of their merits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8. \u201c[I]n order for there to be complete and proper exhaustion of the merits of petitioner\u2019s claim, he should have filed appeals after the BP-9 was considered on its merits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The magistrate judge further stated that the record appeared to include two BP-9 denials, one \u201creceipted June 2, 2009,\u201d and one \u201cdated April 6, 2009.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9-10. However, since Krist never appealed the response dated 6 April 2009, the BOP was never afforded the opportunity to consider the merits of Krist\u2019s appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">Krist filed an objection to the R &amp; R, arguing that he had already filed every appeal required by the BOP, and thus, had exhausted his administrative remedies. Rl-42 at 1-4. He further asserted that he was time-barred from appealing the denial of his BP-9, and that he was prohibited from appealing twice on the same issue, such that it was impossible for him to ever exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>Id. </em>at 4, 6-7. He argued that the BOP did have an opportunity to consider the merits of his case, since he attached his original \u201clost\u201d BP-9 to his subsequent appeals. <em>Id. </em>at 5-7. He further contended that his petition should be granted because its denial would result in irreparable harm. <em>Id. </em>at 7-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-9\">The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s R <em>&amp; </em>R without further elaboration, and denied Krist\u2019s petition without prejudice for failure to exhaust his administrative remedies. R1^43.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b944-11\">On appeal, Krist argues that the district court erred in finding that he had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>exhausted his administrative remedies. He asserts that he properly submitted a BP-9 form on 6 April 2009, and that prison authorities intentionally hid the document in an effort to indefinitely delay his relief. He argues that by dismissing his habeas petition for lack of jurisdiction, the district court unconstitutionally suspended the writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000). Prisoners seeking habeas relief pursuant to \u00a7 2241 are subject to administrative exhaustion requirements. <em>Skinner v. Wiley, </em>355 F.3d 1293, 1295 (11th Cir.2004). For purposes of \u00a7 2241 relief, \u201cexhaustion of administrative remedies is jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Gonzalez v. United States, </em>959 F.2d 211, 212 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">The BOP has established regulations governing formal review of prisoner complaints relating to any aspect of imprisonment. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 542.10-19. Prisoners generally must first present an issue to institution staff, and attempt to resolve it informally. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 542.13. If an issue cannot be resolved informally, a prisoner must submit a formal written Administrative Remedy Request, using a BP-9 form, to a designated institution staff member. <em>Id. </em>at 542.14(a), (c)(4). If a prisoner is not satisfied with the warden\u2019s response to his BP-9, he may appeal to the BOP regional director, using a BP-10 form, and if he is not satisfied with the regional director\u2019s response, may appeal to the BOP general counsel, using a BP-11 form. <em>Id. </em>at 542.15(a). An appeal to the general counsel is the final administrative appeal. <em>Id. </em>A BP-9 form \u201cis considered filed on the date it is logged into the Administrative Remedy Index as received.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 542.18. The warden must respond to a BP-9 within 20 calendar days, and if a prisoner does not receive a response within that time period, he \u201cmay consider the absence of a response to be a denial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Only after a prisoner exhausts these administrative remedies may he file for habe-as relief in district court. <em>United States v. Herrera, </em>931 F.2d 761, 764 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">Krist conceded that he did not exhaust his administrative remedies before he filed his \u00a7 2241 habeas petition in the district court. Rl-31 at 9. Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that Krist\u2019s alleged 6 April 2009 BP-9 was properly submitted, he filed his habeas petition only nine days later, before any response regarding his BP-9 was due. <em>See </em>Rl-1. He then filed his BP-10 on 28 April, and his BP-11 on 13 May, nearly one month after his habeas petition. Rl-21-1 at 13-14, 16-18. Since prisoners must exhaust their administrative remedies before seeking relief in court, and Krist conceded that he did not do so, the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider his petition. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>959 F.2d at 212; <em>Herrera, </em>931 F.2d at 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-9\">Further, a BP-9 form is not considered filed until it is logged into the Administrative Remedy Index, which in Krist\u2019s case, was not until 2 June 2009. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 542.18; Rl-27-7 at 3. The warden responded within the required 20-day period, denying Krist\u2019s request on the merits. Rl-21-1 at 5. To exhaust his administrative remedies, Krist was required to appeal that determination to the regional director, and then to the general counsel. <em>See </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7 542.15(a). Although Krist had already filed each of these appeals, they were premature, as they were filed before his BP-9 was properly filed, and before he received the warden\u2019s response. As such, he did not exhaust his administrative remedies prior to seeking relief in the district court, and was jurisdictionally barred from doing so. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>959 F.2d at 212; <em>Herrera, </em>931 F.2d at 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">Because Krist filed his habeas petition before exhausting his administrative remedies, the district court properly dismissed his petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
