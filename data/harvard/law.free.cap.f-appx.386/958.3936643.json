Magua<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> asserts the BIA erred in denying his applications for asylum and withholding of removal because the incidents of violence he suffered are sufficient to establish past persecution on account of his race.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After review,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>The Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security has discretion to grant asylum if an alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A). A \u201crefugee\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5K\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, 257 </em>F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). In order to carry this burden, the applicant must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1257 (11th Cir. 2006). Moreover, \u201cevidence that either is consistent with acts of private violence ... or that merely shows that a person has been the victim of criminal activity, does not constitute evidence of persecution based on a statutorily protected ground.\u201d <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1258. In order to prove eligibility for withholding of removal, an alien must show it is \u201cmore likely than not she will be persecuted or tortured upon being returned to her country.\u201d <em>Sepulve-da v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1232 (11th Cir.2005) (quotations omitted). This standard is more stringent than the \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standard for asylum. <em>Mazariegos v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1324 n. 2 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s conclusions<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that Magua did not show a nexus between the harm he suffered and a protected ground. First, two of the incidents of robbery Magua described happened when he was not home, so he had no way of knowing who committed the crimes or their motive. Second, during one of the auto parts store robberies, the perpetrators robbed the black store customers as well as Magua, suggesting that Magua was targeted for his money, not because of his race. Third, the fact racial slurs were used during the store robberies does not establish the perpetrators were singling Magua out because of his race, because, as noted above, in one instance the perpetrators also robbed the black customers. Finally, the frequency of the events does not show they were related, as Magua presented no evidence the perpetrators were the same people or had any connection to him or to each other. Accordingly, because the evidence does not show that Magua was singled out because of his race, and because Magua presented no evidence except for the frequency of the events to show they were related, he failed to meet his burden of establishing he was targeted because of his race. Furthermore, the evidence sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>ports the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s determination Magua was the victim of unfortunate crime, but not a victim of persecution on account of his race. Therefore, Magua failed to establish his eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b981-10\">. Magua fails to argue his CAT claim in his brief, and thus, the issue is abandoned. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (stating \"[wjhen an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b981-11\">. Throughout the remainder of this opinion, Magua\u2019s name will be used to refer to all of the petitioners collectively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b981-12\">. Magua further contends he has a well-founded fear of future persecution based on a pattern and practice of persecuting white South Africans. However, he failed to raise this argument before the BIA and we lack jurisdiction to consider an unexhausted argument. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (holding we lack jurisdiction to review claims that were not exhausted before the BIA).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b981-22\">.To the extent the BIA\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, review is <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247 (11th Cir.2001). The BIA's factual determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>nations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we \"must affirm the BIA's decision if it is 'supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.' \" <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2001). \"To reverse the IJ's fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b982-8\">. When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. Here, the BIA agreed with the IJ's opinion, but made additional findings, and, thus, we will review both decisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
