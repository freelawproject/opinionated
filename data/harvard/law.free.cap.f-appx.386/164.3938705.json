Because we conclude that this appeal lacks arguable merit, we will dismiss it pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-17\">The District Court has summarized the case and its findings in detail, so a brief statement of the facts is sufficient. David Henderson was granted leave by the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>with a complaint against Kenneth Keisling, his brother-in-law, and Nancy Henderson, his sister-in-law. In the complaint Henderson identifies himself as a former Foreign Service Officer with knowledge of a covert deal between George H.W. Bush and Iran to delay the release of American hostages in order to influence the outcome of the 1980 presidential elections, which he refers to as the \u201cOctober Surprise.\u201d He alleges that because of this knowledge \u201che has been under a death threat by the CIA since October 1980 and this fact is due to the defendants ... who for personal and political reasons have engaged in a Conspiracy [sic] of silence to keep plaintiff from knowing what he knows.\u201d Henderson seeks damages totaling $27,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>The Eastern District of Pennsylvania approved Henderson\u2019s request to withdraw his complaint against defendant Nancy Henderson. The case was ultimately transferred to the Middle District of Pennsylvania, where defendant Kenneth Keis-ling resides. The case was assigned to a Magistrate Judge, who issued a Report and Recommendation (R <em>&amp; </em>R) concluding that Henderson\u2019s complaint amounted to no more than a \u201cfantastic or delusional scenario\u201d lacking any basis in fact and should be dismissed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 328, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). Henderson filed a document stating merely that he \u201cappeals the Report and Recommendation.\u201d The District Court, declining to treat the document as a proper objection, reviewed the R &amp; R for clear error only, and, by order entered March 9, 2010, adopted it and dismissed Henderson\u2019s complaint. Henderson appeals, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">We granted Henderson <em>in forma pau-peris </em>status, and we now review this appeal to determine whether it should be dismissed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). An appeal must be dismissed if it \u201clacks an arguable basis in either law or fact.\u201d <em>Neitzke, </em>490 U.S. at 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827. We conclude that dismissal is required here.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The District Court correctly dismissed Henderson\u2019s complaint. Even if we accept as true that Henderson was a Foreign Service Officer, had knowledge of an \u201cOctober Surprise,\u201d and was under a death threat by the CIA, he alleges no arguable claim against Keisling (or Nancy Henderson, for that matter).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Henderson\u2019s sole allegation against the defendants is that they \u201cengaged in a Con-spirecy [sic] of silence to keep plaintiff from knowing what he knows\u201d \u2014 a confusing statement that fails to suggest any conceivable claim. <em>See Neitzke, </em>490 U.S. at 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827. Further, the District Court need not have allowed opportunity to amend because doing so would be futile. <em>See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., </em>293 F.3d 103, 106 (3d Cir.2002). Finally, there is no basis to challenge the District Court\u2019s review of the Magistrate Judge\u2019s R &amp; R since only those \u201cspecific objections\u201d made by Henderson must be separately considered by the District Court. <em>See Goney v. Clark, </em>749 F.2d 5, 7 (3d Cir.1984).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Henderson\u2019s February 25, 2010 \u201cobjection\u201d to the R <em>&amp; </em>R contains no specific objections for the District Court to review, and merely states that \u201cplaintiff appeals the Report and Recommendation to the District Judge in this case[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">In sum, we agree that Henderson\u2019s complaint was frivolous, and we conclude that amendment would be futile. Our independent review reveals that there is no arguable basis to challenge the District Court\u2019s ruling on appeal. Accordingly, this appeal will be dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-6\">. Henderson sought to add Nancy Henderson back into the complaint at the last minute but the District Court justifiably refused because he states no viable claim against either Keis-ling or Henderson.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b188-7\">. We note that the Magistrate Judge attached to the R &amp; R a copy of the Local Rule requiring the filing of specific objections and noting that <em>de novo </em>review by the District Judge was contingent on filing those objections. <em>Cf. Leyva v. Williams, </em>504 F.3d 357, 364 (3d Cir.2007) (declining to apply plain error review on appeal when a Magistrate Judge failed to warn a <em>pro se </em>litigant of the consequences of failing to file objections).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
