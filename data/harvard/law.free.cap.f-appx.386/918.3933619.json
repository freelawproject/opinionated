Stanley challenges the ruling on two grounds. First, Stanley challenges the decision not to give controlling weight to the opinion of his treating physician, Michael Wofford, that Stanley was totally disabled. Second, Stanley argues that the administrative law judge failed to consider all his impairments in assessing his residual functional capacity. We affirm the decision to discount Wofford\u2019s opinion, but we reverse the decision about Stanley\u2019s residual functional capacity and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">We review the decision by the Commissioner \u201cto determine if it is supported by substantial evidence and based on proper legal standards.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004). \u201c \u2018Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1439 (11th Cir.1997)). That review \u201cprecludes deciding the facts anew, making credibility determinations, or re-weighing the evidence.\u201d <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">Substantial evidence supports the decision to discount Wofford\u2019s opinion that in December 1997 Stanley was \u201ctotally and permanently disabled for all work.\u201d Wofford\u2019s opinion is inconsistent with his medical notes about Stanley\u2019s condition, the opinions of other doctors who examined Stanley, and Stanley\u2019s testimony. <em>See Jones v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>941 F.2d 1529, 1532-33 (11th Cir.1991); <em>Edwards v. Sullivan, </em>937 F.2d 580, 583 (11th Cir.1991). Wofford recorded essentially the same complaints about Stanley\u2019s severe back pain and headaches between 1995 and 1997, and Wofford stated in 1995 and 1996 that Stanley was capable of performing light work. Although in 1997 Stanley suffered two bouts of bursitis and an increase in kidney stones, Wofford\u2019s notes do not suggest that those conditions were disabling. Physicians Dean Talley and Alfred Hauser examined Stanley in July 1996 and September 1997, and neither physician concluded that Stanley was disabled. Furthermore, Stanley\u2019s testimony about walking up to a mile, shopping for groceries, attending his sons\u2019 baseball games, and hunting a couple of times a year suggests that he was not permanently disabled. The only evidence in the record that supports Wofford\u2019s opinion is a report detailing the findings of an exercise physician and a physical trainer during a vocational assessment, but those individuals do not qualify as acceptable medical sources who can provide evidence to establish that Stanley was impaired. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1513(a). We affirm the decision not to give controlling weight to Wofford\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-9\">Although the decision of the administrative law judge reflects a reasoned consideration of Wofford\u2019s opinion, the decision does not reflect a reasoned consideration of all the medical evidence in determining Stanley\u2019s residual functional capacity. \u201c[T]he regulations define [residual functional capacity] as that which an individual is still able to do despite the limitations caused by his ... impairments.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1238 (11th Cir.2004) (citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1545(a)). Residual functional capacity is determined by considering cumulatively \u201call the relevant medical and other evidence,\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(e), in the case. <em>Walker v. Bowen, </em>826 F.2d 996, 1001 (11th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-10\">Stanley presented evidence that he suffered from kidney disease, cervical disease, lumbar disc disease, headaches, and adjustment disorder, but the administrative law judge failed to consider the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>bined effect of these impairments. The administrative law judge mentioned but did not consider evidence about Stanley\u2019s kidney disease, and the administrative law judge evaluated separately Stanley\u2019s cervical and lumbar diseases and his adjustment disorder. After the administrative law judge found that the adjustment disorder was not a severe impairment, he assessed Stanley\u2019s residual functional capacity based solely on Stanley\u2019s cervical and lumbar diseases and his headaches. Ultimately, the administrative law judge found that Stanley could \u201cperform a significant range of sedentary work.\u201d Substantial evidence does not support that finding because the administrative law judge failed to account for the combined effect of all of Stanley\u2019s impairments. We reverse the order of the district court that affirmed this portion of the decision of the Commissioner and we remand \u201cfor review of all of the evidence under the proper legal standards.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1002.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">We AFFIRM the decision to discount the opinion of Stanley\u2019s treating physician, but we REVERSE the decision of the district court affirming the decision about Stanley\u2019s residual functional capacity, and we REMAND for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">AFFIRMED IN PART, and REVERSED and REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
