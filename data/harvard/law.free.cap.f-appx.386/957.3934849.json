Wyche challenges the enhancement of his sentence for his leading role in the offense. United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 3B1.1. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-13\">The district court did not err by applying the aggravating role enhancement. Wyche orchestrated an extensive conspiracy to commit bank fraud. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3Bl.l(a). Wyche recruited Leroy Thibou to enlist coconspirators into whose bank accounts Wyche transferred electronically money owned by the Bank of America. Wyche controlled the bank accounts, instructed the coconspirators how to withdraw the proceeds, and disbursed the proceeds. Wyche ordinarily received the largest percentage of the proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-14\">Even if the district court had erred in enhancing Wyche\u2019s sentence, that error would have been harmless. The district court stated that it would have imposed the same sentence regardless of whether the enhancement was applicable. <em>See United States v. Keene, </em>470 F.3d 1347, 1348-49 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-15\">Wyche\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
