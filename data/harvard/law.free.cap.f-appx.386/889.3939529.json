Amendment 706 provided for a two-level reduction in the sentencing guideline base offense level for certain defendants who had been sentenced for crack cocaine offenses. Smith argues that the district court erred in concluding that he was not eligible for a reduction under Amendment 706 because his guidelines range was determined by a statutory mandatory minimum sentence and not U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. After thorough review, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-10\">Smith pleaded guilty to a five-count indictment alleging, among other things, conspiracy to distribute more than 50 grams of crack cocaine and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. In his written plea agreement, Smith acknowledged that his conviction for these offenses carried a mandatory minimum 120-month sentence, followed by a statutorily mandated consecutive 60-month sentence. At sentencing, the district court determined that Smith\u2019s advisory guidelines range was 168 to 210 months in prison. Because Smith faced a combined statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 180 months, however, his guidelines range became 180 to 210 months pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(c)(2). Smith requested a 180-month sentence at the bottom of the guidelines range, which the district court imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-12\">Smith did not appeal his sentence and continued to cooperate with the government. This cooperation evidentially bore fruit, because the government filed a motion under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b) for a reduction in Smith\u2019s sentence based on his substantial assistance. Following this, the district court reduced Smith\u2019s sentence to 161 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-13\">Smith then filed a <em>pro se </em>motion for sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). He argued that he was entitled to a further reduction in his sentence based on Amendment 706. The district court denied the motion, however, finding that Smith\u2019s guidelines range was not affected by Amendment 706 because it was set by the mandatory minimum sentences. Smith moved for reconsideration, which the district court summarily denied. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-15\">Smith argues that the district court erred in concluding that because he received a statutory minimum sentence, his guidelines range was unaffected by Amendment 706. He argues that because he was granted relief following the government\u2019s Rule 35(b) motion, his statutory mandatory minimum \u201chas been eliminated.\u201d Therefore, according to Smith, he is eligible for a further reduction in his sentence despite the fact that the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>mandatory minimum sentences originally fixed the low-end of his guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the sentencing guidelines, for abuse of discretion. However, where the issue presented involves a legal interpretation, our review is <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1338-39 (11th Cir.2008) (quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Section 3582(c) gives federal courts authority to consider reducing the sentence \u201cof a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In such a case, \u201cthe court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">\u201cAmendment 706 allows a defendant to seek a reduction in his sentence if that sentence is based on the \u00a7 2D1.1 offense level for crack cocaine.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1339; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. App. C., amend. 706. The Sentencing Commission\u2019s applicable policy statement provides, however, that a reduction in the defendant\u2019s sentence is not authorized where Amendment 706 \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). Thus, \u201ca reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) ... if ... the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision (e.g., a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">We have repeatedly held that relief under Amendment 706 is not available where a defendant\u2019s original sentence is based on something other than \u00a7 2D1.1, such as a statutory mandatory minimum or the career offender provisions of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See, e.g., Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1339-40 (sentence based on statutory mandatory minimum pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii)); <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327 (11th Cir.2008) (sentence based on career offender enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1). This is because the mandatory minimum sentence effectively displaces the guidelines range for the original offense. <em>Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1340. The defendant\u2019s resulting sentence therefore is not determined based on the \u00a7 2D1.1 offense level for crack cocaine offenses, and Amendment 706 \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guidelines range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A); <em>Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1339-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-11\">A district court\u2019s decision to impose a sentence below an otherwise applicable mandatory minimum based on the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance does not change this result. In <em>Williams, </em>for example, we considered whether a defendant who was subject to a 120-month mandatory minimum sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii) was nonetheless eligible for a reduction under Amendment 706 because the district court imposed a downward departure sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e). <em>Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1338. We rejected the argument that \u201cthe district court\u2019s granting of the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion effectively waived the statutory mandatory minimum and thus entitled [the defendant] to a sentence reduction under Amendment 706.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1339-40. We explained that because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>the defendant\u2019s sentence was based on the mandatory minimum, any departure was from the mandatory minimum rather than the base offense level. <em>Id. </em>at 1340. That being so, any change in the guidelines range for the original offense would not affect the defendant\u2019s sentence because the district court\u2019s \u201cpoint of departure would not shift as a result of the amendment\u2019s lowering of the crack offense levels.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">Our decision in <em>Williams </em>forecloses Smith\u2019s claim for a sentence reduction under Amendment 706. Smith\u2019s 180-month sentence was based on consecutive mandatory minimum sentences under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1), respectively. These mandatory m\u00ednimums effectively replaced his original guidelines range of 168 to 210 months. Because he was not sentenced according to the base offense level in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, he does not fall within the scope of Amendment 706. <em>See Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1340-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">The fact that Smith received a sentence reduction under Rule 35(b), as opposed to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, does not change this conclusion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Such a reduction \u201cdoes not constitute a waiver\u201d or \u201csomehow eliminate the otherwise applicable mandatory minimum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1341. And because the point of the district court\u2019s departure does not shift as a result of the lowering of the crack cocaine offense levels by Amendment 706, <em>id. </em>at 1340, the amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). That being the case, Smith is not entitled to a sentence reduction under Amendment 706. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b914-6\">. It is of no moment that <em>Williams </em>involved a downward departure under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e), while the district in this case reduced Smith\u2019s sentence under Rule 35(b). As we have explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-7\">Section 3553(e) does the same service as does Rule 35(b); it authorizes the district court, on the government\u2019s motion, to impose a sentence \u201cbelow a level established by statute as minimum sentence so as to reflect a defendant's substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense.\u201d Given that Rule 35(b) and section 3553(e) utilize the same language to achieve the same end, we accord them the same interpretation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b914-20\"><em>United States v. Aponte, </em>36 F.3d 1050, 1052 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
