Accordingly, we WITHDRAW our previous opinion and replace it with the following opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-19\">Clarke petitioned this court for review of the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) dismissing his appeal and affirming the immigration judge\u2019s (IJ) order finding him ineligible for cancellation of removal because he had committed an aggravated felony; removable pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)\u00a9 because he had been convicted of a controlled substance violation; and removable pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) because he had been convicted of an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-20\">In the now-withdrawn opinion, filed in December 2009, this panel relied on <em>Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>570 F.3d 263, 266-68 (5th Cir.2009), and held that the BIA did not err in finding Clarke committed an aggravated felony based upon his 2006 conviction in New York of criminal possession of crack cocaine in the seventh degree after he had been convicted in New York in 1995 of criminal possession of cocaine in the seventh degree. On June 14, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>2010, the Supreme Court unanimously reversed our decision in <em>Carachuri-Rosendo. Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>560 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2577, 177 L.Ed.2d 68 (2010), rejecting this court\u2019s \u201chypothetical approach\u201d and holding that \u201cthe defendant must <em>also </em>have been <em>actually convicted </em>of a crime that is itself punishable as a felony under federal law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2588, 2589.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\"><em>Carachuri-Rosendo, </em>however, does not carry the day for Clarke, because the BIA found Clarke removable as an aggravated felon, and thus ineligible for cancellation of removal, for two independent reasons. Although we had no reason to address the Board\u2019s alternate finding in our earlier opinion, Clarke was also convicted in 1991 for attempted criminal sale of cocaine in the third degree, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 110 and 220.39(1) of the N.Y. Penal Law. \u201cTo qualify as an \u2018aggravated felony\u2019 under the [Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) ], the conduct prohibited by state law must be punishable as a felony under federal law.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Carachuri-Rosendo, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2589 (citing <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 60, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006)). The BIA properly found that Clarke\u2019s conviction for attempted criminal sale of cocaine encompassed conduct punishable as a felony under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846, attempted possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">A recent panel of this court stated that \u201cwe have found that a violation of [N.Y. Penal Law] \u00a7 220.39 for criminal sale of controlled substances in the <em>third </em>degree does not constitute a drug trafficking crime under the [United States Sentencing Guidelines]\u201d because statutes that punish \u201coffers to sell\u201d are not drug trafficking crimes under the CSA. <em>Davila v. Holder, </em>381 Fed.Appx. 413, 416 (5th Cir.2010) (unpublished) (citing <em>United States v. Stanley, </em>281 Fed.Appx. 370, 372 (5th Cir.2008) (unpublished)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Stanley, </em>however, actually held that \u201ca conviction under New York Penal Statute \u00a7 220.39, <em>based on the text of the statute alone, </em>is not a conviction for a drug trafficking offense.\u201d <em>Stanley, </em>281 Fed.Appx. at 372 (emphasis added). Using the method approved by the Supreme Court in <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), the court in <em>Stanley </em>looked to the charging instrument and to \u201cthe law of the jurisdiction in which the guilty plea was entered\u201d to determine whether the defendant was subject to a sentencing enhancement under the categorical approach. <em>Id. </em>Under New York law, a guilty plea \u201cconstitutes an effective judicial admission by a defendant that he committed the acts charged in the accusatory instrument.\u201d <em>People v. Lee, </em>58 N.Y.2d 491, 462 N.Y.S.2d 417, 448 N.E.2d 1328, 1329 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-14\"><em>Stanley </em>noted that while the statutory definition of \u201cto sell\u201d contained in \u00a7 220.39 encompassed an \u201coffer to sell,\u201d <em>see </em>N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 220.00(1), Stanley\u2019s indictment alleged that she committed \u201ca violation of \u00a7 220.39[1] \u2018as follows.\u2019 The indictment alleges that she \u2018sold ... cocaine.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stanley, </em>281 Fed.Appx. at 373. \u201cWhen determining whether a prior offense is a drug-trafficking offense, the court may also consider documents such as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>charging instrument and the jury instructions.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 712, 714 (5th Cir.2007) (per curiam). In <em>United States v. Gutierrez-Ramirez, </em>we stated that we could not use an indictment to narrow the offense of conviction where \u201cthe indictment merely tracks the language of the statute, and includes language relating to conduct that would not qualify as a \u2018drug trafficking offense.\u2019 \u201d 405 F.3d 352, 359 (5th Cir.2005). In <em>Stanley, </em>however, the indictment alleged that Stanley \u201cknowingly and unlawfully sold\u201d cocaine, \u201cconduct which falls within the definition of \u2018drug trafficking offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stanley, </em>281 Fed.Appx. at 373. The court rejected Stanley\u2019s contention that it should \u201cinterpret [the word] \u2018sold\u2019 in her indictment to encompass all of the alternative definitions provided in \u00a7 220.00(1), including \u2018offer to sell.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Giving the term \u201cto sell\u201d as it is used within the statutory definition of \u201csell\u201d its ordinary meaning, the court concluded that the district court had not committed plain error when it determined Stanley\u2019s \u00a7 220.39 conviction was a drug trafficking offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">The record is sufficient to establish that Clarke\u2019s conviction under N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 220.39 is a drug trafficking crime under the CSA. The record indicates Clarke pleaded guilty to \u00a7 220.39. Under New York law, this plea constitutes a judicial admission of commission of the acts charged in the indictment. <em>Lee, </em>448 N.E.2d at 1329. Because a violation of \u00a7 220.39 may encompass conduct that does not qualify as a drug trafficking crime under the CSA, we consider Clarke\u2019s indictment. The language in Clarke\u2019s indictment is virtually indistinguishable from the indictment discussed in <em>Stanley. </em>It accuses Clarke of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (\u00a7 220.39) \u201cas follows: The defendants, each aiding the other, on or about March 20, 1989, in the County of Kings, knowingly and unlawfully sold a narcotic drug, namely: cocaine, to a person known to the grand jury.\u201d As in <em>Stanley, </em>Clarke\u2019s indictment does not merely track the language of the statute \u2014 it alleges he \u201csold\u201d cocaine to another individual. Like the panel in <em>Stanley, </em>we accord the word \u201csold\u201d its ordinary meaning and conclude that the record establishes Clarke\u2019s \u00a7 220.39 conviction was not for an \u201coffer to sell,\u201d and that it therefore constitutes a drug trafficking crime under the CSA. <em>Cf. Davila, </em>381 Fed.Appx. at 416 (\u201cIn this case, examining these documents does not reveal anything about the nature of Davi-la\u2019s \u2018sale,\u2019 because the indictment merely tracks the language of the statute. Thus, the record fails to establish that Davila\u2019s conviction under N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 220.41 was not merely for an offer to sell.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Carachuri-Rosendo </em>did not disturb our other conclusions. We recount them here. Clarke\u2019s claims that several due process violations occurred with respect to his removal proceedings were not exhausted before the BIA, and we therefore lack jurisdiction to consider them. <em>See Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 137 (5th Cir.2004) (per curiam). Clarke also previously filed a petition for review (PFR) of the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration, raising arguments identical to arguments raised with respect to Clarke\u2019s PFR from the BIA\u2019s dismissal of his appeal. Accordingly, Clarke\u2019s PFR from the denial of his motion for reconsideration lacks merit for the same reasons stated above. The Government also moved to dismiss Clarke\u2019s PFR from the denial of his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">For the reasons stated above, Clarke\u2019s PFR from the dismissal of his appeal is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>DENIED, his PFR from the denial of his motion for reconsideration is DENIED, and the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss is DENIED as unnecessary. All other motions pending before this court are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b524-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b525-8\">. We note that under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(U), an attempt to commit any of the offenses described therein is an aggravated felony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b525-11\">. We have previously held that because \"the Guidelines definition of \u2018controlled substance offense\u2019 is nearly identical to the definition of conduct defined as a felony under the Controlled Substances Act,\u201d <em>Vasquez-Martinez v. Holder, </em>564 F.3d 712, 719 (5th Cir.2009), CSA cases may rely on determinations of drug trafficking crimes made in the sentencing context. <em>Davila, </em>381 Fed.Appx. at 416.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
