For the reasons stated below, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-27\">The procedural history of this case and the details of Subh\u2019s claims are well known to the parties, set forth in the District Court\u2019s thorough opinion, and need not be discussed at length. Briefly, Subh alleged that he was terminated from his job at Wal-Mart in retaliation for his complaints of discrimination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He asserted that the co-store manager caused him to be arrested based on false allegations and intentionally inflicted emotional distress. Appellees filed a motion for summary judgment which the District Court granted. Subh filed a timely notice of appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. In his Report and Recommendation, which was adopted by the District Court, the Magistrate Judge thoroughly laid out Subh\u2019s allegations and the factual background of the case. We have little to add to his analysis of Subh\u2019s discrimination claims. We agree that Subh has not shown that Wal-Mart terminated his employment in retaliation for his filing a complaint or for discriminatory reasons based on race or national origin. Wal-Mart terminated his employment for gross misconduct. Subh admitted to confronting the store manager at the Wal-Mart where he worked before his transfer with a raised voice and repeatedly calling her arrogant, ignorant, rude, and crude. He was dressed as a security guard and carrying a night stick at the time. Subh pled <em>nob contendere </em>to a charge of menacing arising from the incident.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We also agree with the District Court that appellees were entitled to summary judgment on Subh\u2019s state law claims of defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">Summary action is appropriate if there is no substantial question presented in the appeal. <em>See </em>Third Circuit LAR 27.4. For the above reasons, as well as those set forth by the District Court, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>Third Circuit I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b53-17\">. His prior complaints of discrimination were the basis of another lawsuit in the District Court and another appeal in this Court. <em>See Subh v. Wal-Mart, </em>C.A. No. 09-4189.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b53-30\">. Subh was represented by an attorney in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>District Court but proceeded pro se after the Magistrate Judge issued his Report and Recommendation. He is proceeding <em>pro se </em>on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b54-16\">.
