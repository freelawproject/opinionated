He was sentenced to serve 286 months in prison under the career offender guidelines.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirmed Bax\u2019s conviction and sentence in 1994. Since then, Bax has unsuccessfully challenged his conviction and sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2255, 2244 and 2241, and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(a) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(A)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-19\">In February 2009, Bax filed a motion to modify his prison term pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). He claimed that the court should shorten his sentence in light of Amendment 706 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d), which generally reduced the base offense level (\u201cBOL\u201d) for drug convictions involving crack cocaine by two levels. He also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>claimed that his sentence should be lowered based on his rehabilitation while in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The District Court denied Bax\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Relying on <em>United </em>States v. <em>Mateo, </em>560 F.3d 152 (3d Cir. 2009), the court concluded that it lacked authority to modify Bax\u2019s sentence under Amendment 706 and its corresponding policy statement U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, because the Amendment listed in subsection (c) did not have the effect of lowering Bax\u2019s applicable guideline range. The court determined that Bax\u2019s sentence range would remain the same because his career offender status raised the offense level to 34 and gave him a criminal history category of VI. The District Court also held that it could not grant relief based on Bax\u2019s rehabilitation claim because relief under \u00a7 3582(c) was limited to consideration of the effect of the retroactive amendment on a defendant\u2019s sentence. Bax filed this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Because there is no substantial question on appeal, the District Court\u2019s order will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">As the District Court properly determined, our holding in <em>Mateo </em>controls the result in Bax\u2019s case. In <em>Mateo, </em>we held that the District Court lacked authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce Mateo\u2019s 188-month sentence for distribution of crack cocaine based on Amendment 706 and \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B), because Mateo\u2019s ultimate sentencing range was determined by his career offender status, upon which Amendment 706 had no effect.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Mateo, </em>560 F.3d at 155. We discern no material distinction between Bax\u2019s case and <em>Mateo. </em>We also agree with the District Court that it lacked authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to consider Bax\u2019s rehabilitation as a ground for modifying his sentence. <em>See United States v. Doe, </em>564 F.3d 305, 309 (3d Cir.2009) (holding that a district court lacks jurisdiction to consider a sentence reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if a defendant fails to show eligibility for relief under that provision).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b62-11\">. The sentencing court determined that the amount of crack cocaine involved amounted to between five and fifty grams, resulting in a BOL for Bax of 26. As a career offender, however, his base offense level (\u201cBOL\u201d) under \u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(B) became 34. Bax's sentencing range, at a BOL of 34 and a criminal history of VI, was 262 to 327 months. Bax\u2019s sentence was roughly in the middle of that range.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b63-8\">. Bax\u2019s reliance on <em>United States v. Corner, </em>598 F.3d 411 (7th Cir.2010) (en banc), in his motion to reinstate the appeal is misplaced as it does not address the retroactive application of Amendment 706. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals has held that a defendant may not seek reduction in sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) when Amendment 706 does not lower the defendants's sentencing range due to his career-offender status. <em>See United States v. Forman, </em>553 F.3d 585, 589-90 (7th Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
