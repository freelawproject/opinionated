On appeal, he argues that the district court improperly enhanced his sentence for possession of a weapon, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), and denied him safety-valve relief, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(2), but concedes that any alleged error is insufficient for reversal because the court stated that it would still impose the same sentence regardless of its resolution of those guideline issues. Walker further argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. We review a defendant\u2019s sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 264, 125 S.Ct. 738, 767, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1179 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-19\">Walker has not satisfied his burden of establishing that his sentence was unreasonable. First, he concedes that the district court stated that it would have imposed a 36-month sentence regardless of the \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) enhancement and \u00a7 5C1.2 safety-valve relief. Even if Walker\u2019s objections had been granted, his guideline range would have been 37 to 46 months\u2019 imprisonment, so his 36-month sentence was still below the applicable guideline range. Thus, any alleged guideline errors did not affect his sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Furthermore, he failed to show that his sentence was substantively unreasonable, as the district court stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and imposed a sentence that was sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 3553(a). The court also reviewed Walker\u2019s criminal history, discussed the need for deterrence, considered the advisory guideline range, and stated that it wanted to take into account Walker\u2019s age, health, family obligations, and lack of recidivism, all of which are proper considerations under \u00a7 3553(a). Accordingly, we hold that Walker\u2019s sentence was reasonable and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b908-16\">. Walker\u2019s claims also fail on the merits, as the district court properly applied the weapons enhancement and denied safety-valve relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
