Wilson asserts he established <em>prima facie </em>cases of both race discrimination and retaliation, and the district court erred in concluding otherwise. After review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to BST.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-11\">Wilson relies on circumstantial evidence to support his complaints of discrimination and retaliation, and we will assume, without deciding, that Wilson established <em>pri-ma facie </em>cases of race discrimination and retaliation. After a plaintiff establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case, the employer must proffer a legitimate, nondiscriminatory and non-retaliatory reason for the adverse employment action. <em>Holifield v. Reno, </em>115 F.3d 1555, 1566 (11th Cir.1997). <em>Id. </em>at 1566. If the employer offers legitimate reasons for the employment action, the plaintiff must then demonstrate the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is pretext for discrimination or retaliation. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe plaintiff must meet the reason proffered head on and rebut it.\u201d <em>Crawford v. City of Fairburn, </em>482 F.3d 1305, 1308 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-12\">BST satisfied its burden in offering legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for terminating Wilson, specifically his continued failure to follow established work procedures, taking unauthorized overtime, and missing customer due dates. Wilson has not rebutted these reasons head on. Instead, he merely alleges these reasons were \u201cpretextual.\u201d These conclusory allegations of pretext are insufficient for Wilson to meet his burden. <em>See Young v. Gen. Foods Corp., </em>840 F.2d 825, 830 (11th Cir.1988) (holding that conclusory allegations, without more, are insufficient to raise an inference of pretext). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to BST.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b994-10\">. We review the district court\u2019s ruling on summary judgment <em>de novo. Rojas v. Florida, </em>285 F.3d 1339, 1341 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cWhen deciding whether summary judgment is appropriate, all evidence and reasonable factual inferences drawn therefrom are reviewed in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1341-42 (quotations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
