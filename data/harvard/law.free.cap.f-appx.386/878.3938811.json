On appeal, Slaughter asserts the district court erred, after granting his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, in treating him as an armed career criminal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) and by running his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) mandatory 60-month sentence consecutive to his other sentences. After review, we affirm Slaughter\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-20\">On October 1, 1996, pursuant to a written plea agreement, Slaughter pled guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (Count 1), robbing a 7-Eleven store by actual and threatened force and violence, 18 U.S.C. <em>\u00a7 </em>1951(a) (Count 2), and knowingly using and carrying a firearm during a crime of violence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) (Count 3). In December 1996, after determining Slaughter qualified as an armed career criminal, the district court sentenced Slaughter to terms of imprisonment of 188 months on Count 1 and 120 months on Count 2 to run concurrently. The district court also imposed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>60-month imprisonment term on Count 3 to run consecutive to Counts 1 and 2, resulting in a total imprisonment term of 248 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">In September 2009, Slaughter filed his <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for reduction of sentence based on Amendment 599 to the Guidelines. The district court summarily granted Slaughter\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and reduced Slaughter\u2019s total term of imprisonment from 248 to 240 months: 180 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count 1 to run concurrent with 112 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count 2, and 60 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count 3 to run consecutive to Counts 1 and 2.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">A \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding does not constitute a de novo resentencing\u201d and <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original resentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000) (emphasis in original). Thus, the district court lacked authority to consider Slaughter\u2019s arguments. <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781. First, the district court could not reexamine Slaughter\u2019s status as an armed career criminal because Amendment 599 did not apply and all the original sentencing determinations remained unchanged. Therefore, the district court did not err in resentencing him to a 15-year statutory minimum, pursuant to \u00a7 924(e). <em>Id. </em>Second, the retroactive Amendment 599 had no effect on the \u00a7 924(c) sentence per Count 3, as the district court was statutorily required to impose a consecutive 5-year mandatory sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4, comment, (n. 2(A)) (stating a term of imprisonment under \u00a7 924(c) \u201cshall run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment.\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b900-14\">. We review for abuse of discretion a district court's decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005). However, where the issue is the interpretation of Amendment 599 or the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the sentencing guidelines, we conduct a <em>de novo </em>review. <em>United States v. Pringle, </em>350 F.3d 1172, 1178 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b901-9\">. Amendment 599 did not have the effect of lowering his applicable guideline range because Slaughter was sentenced based on his status as an armed career criminal, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 1(A)). The government, does not challenge the eight-month reduction in Slaughter\u2019s sentence even though Slaughter was not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction. Moreover, there is no other basis for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
