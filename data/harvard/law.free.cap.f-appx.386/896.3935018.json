On appeal, Sherum argues that his sentence should be vacated because it is unreasonable based on the evidence he offered in mitigation, and was longer than necessary to achieve the statutory purposes of sentencing. After review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the district court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">We review a sentence for reasonableness under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>United States v. Sarras, </em>575 F.3d 1191, 1219 (11th Cir.2009) (citation omitted). The reasonableness inquiry is a two-step process. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). The party challenging the sentence carries the burden of establishing unreasonableness. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-18\">First, we determine whether the district court \u201ccommitted any significant procedural error, such as miscalculating the advisory guidelines range, treating the guidelines range as mandatory, or failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Sarras, </em>575 F.3d at 1219 (citation omitted). Procedural errors can also include selection of a sentence that is based on clearly erroneous facts, or failure to adequately explain the chosen sentence. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008) (citation omitted). The \u00a7 3553(a) factors need not be discussed individually, as the district court just needs to have considered the arguments and factors in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-19\">Second, we review the sentence for substantive reasonableness in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Beckles, </em>565 F.3d 832, 845 (11th Cir.2009) (citation omitted). The sentencing court shall impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b919-20\">The weight given to any \u00a7 3553(a) factor is within the sound discretion of the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>trict court, and we do not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors. <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007) (citation omitted). \u201c[W]e recognize that there is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose.... \u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">We ordinarily expect a sentence within the advisory guidelines range to be a reasonable one. <em>Id. </em>We will only remand a sentence when the district court commits \u201ca clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">With this background, we turn to Sherum\u2019s challenges to the reasonableness of his sentence. Because Sherum does not offer argument pertaining to the procedural reasonableness of his sentence, he has abandoned any such argument. <em>See United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1283 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003) (stating that a party abandons an issue if he does not raise it in his initial brief). Even if such an argument was made however, Sherum\u2019s sentence is proeedurally reasonable because the district court acknowledged that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, noted the guidelines were advisory and articulated its reasons for imposing the sentence. <em>Cf. United States v. Jennings, </em>599 F.3d 1241, 1255 (11th Cir.2010) (finding that a sentence was proeedurally reasonable where \u201cthe court clearly articulated the section 3553 factors, noted the guidelines were advisory and articulated its reasons for imposing the sentence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">With respect to the substantive reasonableness of Sherum\u2019s sentence, the district court stated that a 15-month sentence was necessary to achieve two goals of sentencing: (1) to guarantee that She-rum would have no online contact with minors; and (2) to ensure that Sherum received medical treatment, which was the court\u2019s \u201cfirst priority.\u201d (Doc. 45 at 73-76). That the district court placed more weight on these sentencing objectives than She-rum\u2019s argument in mitigation, is within its sound discretion, and we will not re-weigh the relevant factors on appeal. <em>See Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d at 832. Moreover, the district court sentenced Sherum at the bottom end of the guidelines range (15 to 21 months), and well below the statutory maximum of 10 years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1470; <em>see also Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788 (finding a sentence at the low end of the guidelines range was reasonable); <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2848, 174 L.Ed.2d 568 (2009) (concluding that a sentence was reasonable in part because it was well below the statutory maximum).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-10\">Furthermore, \u201c[cjhild sex crimes are among the most egregious and despicable of societal and criminal offenses, and courts have upheld lengthy sentences in these cases as substantively reasonable.\u201d <em>Sarras, </em>575 F.3d at 1220; <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1202 (\u201c[W]e have typically treated child sex offenses as serious crimes, upholding severe sentences in these cases.\u201d). Here, the district court imposed a sentence that reflects the nature and circumstances of the offense and the other considerations stated in \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-11\">Thus, we conclude that the district court did not commit a \u201cclear error in judgment\u201d by sentencing Sherum to 15 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-12\">As a result, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b919-11\">.
