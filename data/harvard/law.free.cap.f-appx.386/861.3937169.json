Brown appears to argue that the prosecutor in his criminal trial violated <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), both by failing to disclose to him prior to trial that one of the prints found at the crime scene did not match Brown\u2019s prints and by suppressing the preparation of a second fingerprint report detailing these findings. <em>After </em>careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of a statute of limitations. <em>Baker v. Birmingham Bd. of Educ., </em>531 F.3d 1336, 1337 (11th Cir.2008). <em>\u201cPro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">A plaintiff must commence a \u00a7 1983 claim arising in Florida within four years of when the cause of action accrues. <em>See Burton v. City of Belle Glade, </em>178 F.3d 1175, 1188 (11th Cir.1999). Federal law determines the date on which the cause of action accrues and the statute of limitations begins to run, and the statute of limitations for a \u00a7 1983 action begins to run from the date \u201cthe facts which would support a cause of action are apparent or should be apparent to a person with a reasonably prudent regard for his rights.\u201d <em>McNair v. Allen, </em>515 F.3d 1168, 1173 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-14\">A <em>Brady </em>violation of a defendant\u2019s due process rights occurs where the prosecution suppresses material evidence favorable to the defendant. <em>Brady, </em>373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194. To establish that a <em>Brady </em>violation occurred, the defendant must prove that (1) the prosecution suppressed evidence, (2) the suppressed evidence was favorable to the defense, and (3) the suppressed evidence was material. <em>United States v. Luis-Gonzalez, </em>719 F.2d 1539, 1548-49 (11th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-15\">To comply with <em>Brady, </em>the prosecutor has a duty to disclose favorable evidence that is in his possession as well as to seek out \u201cany favorable evidence known to others acting on the government\u2019s behalf.\u201d <em>Parker v. Allen, </em>565 F.3d 1258, 1277 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation omitted). However, \u201cthere is no suppression if the defendant knew of the information or had equal access to obtaining it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, the government does not violate <em>Brady </em>when it loses evidence or simply fails to pursue a potentially exculpatory witness. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>917 F.2d 1286, 1291 (11th Cir.1990), <em>vacated in part on other grounds, </em>935 F.2d 194 (11th Cir.1991); <em>United States v. Walker, </em>559 F.2d 365, 373 (5th Cir.1977).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b884-16\">To the extent that Brown is arguing that the prosecutor failed to disclose to him prior to trial that one of the prints did not match Brown\u2019s prints, we reject this claim. Brown conceded in both his initial and his reply briefs that he was aware at trial that the fingerprint examiner only matched one of the prints to Brown\u2019s prints. There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>fore, while the parties dispute the exculpatory nature of this evidence, if there was a <em>Brady </em>violation based on the prosecutor\u2019s failure to disclose, it should have been apparent to Brown after the examiner testified that only one print matched his prints. Because more than four years passed between Brown\u2019s 1996 trial, and the October 2008 filing of this lawsuit, his \u00a7 1988 claim based on this alleged <em>Brady </em>violation is barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">Second, to the extent that Brown is claiming that the prosecutor suppressed evidence by failing to generate a second fingerprint report, <em>Brady </em>does not require the state to generate reports documenting its evidence, so Brown\u2019s allegation that his discovery of this fact was delayed makes no difference to the running of the limitations period. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Brown\u2019s complaint as barred by the running of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b884-10\">.
