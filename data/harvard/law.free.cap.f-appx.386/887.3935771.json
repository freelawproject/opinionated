A jury convicted Defendant on one count of possession and acquitted Defendant on the remaining counts. Defendant sold 6.2 grams of methamphetamine during the transaction for which Defendant was convicted. During sentencing, the District Court attributed 59.9 grams of methamphetamine to Defendant. We see no reversible error; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-23\">Defendant was involved in selling methamphetamine to a confidential informant. The first three transactions were supposed to be for methamphetamine \u201cice\u201d totaling 53.7 grams. The \u201cdrugs\u201d sold during the first three transactions were not what had been agreed upon; the police lab determined the substance contained no methamphetamine. During the fourth transaction, Defendant provided 6.2 grams of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-24\">The presentence report recommended holding Defendant accountable for 53.7 grams of methamphetamine \u201cice\u201d and 6.2 grams of methamphetamine. Using these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>quantities, the presentence report assigned a base offense level of 32. Defendant objected to culpability for drug quantity above the 6.2 grams of methamphetamine that he had actually been convicted of possessing.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">During the sentencing hearing, the United States presented two witnesses who had not testified at trial. Both witnesses discussed their relationship with Defendant\u2019s son. Defendant\u2019s son ran a drug ring and used Defendant for some smaller transactions \u2014 these smaller transactions were the focus of the testimony. Defendant would act as a mule between his son and the witnesses on occasion, and the witnesses testified on both the quantity and nature of the drugs that Defendant carried.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">The District Court credited the witnesses\u2019 testimony that Defendant was a drug go-between. The District Court did not credit the witnesses\u2019 testimony that Defendant carried methamphetamine \u201cice\u201d; \u25a0 it only attributed methamphetamine to the Defendant. The District Court determined that Defendant was reasonably capable of providing \u2014 and was culpable for \u2014 59.9 grams of methamphetamine. The District Court calculated a base offense level of 26, which provides a base guideline range of 63 to 78 months. Based in part on Defendant\u2019s refusal to admit guilt in the face of video evidence, the District Court sentenced Defendant to 70 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">We review the District Court\u2019s determination of the quantity of drugs for sentencing purposes for clear error. <em>United States v. Zapata, </em>139 F.3d 1355, 1357 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">The District Court determined the quantity of methamphetamine that Defendant was sentenced for based on the four transactions Defendant had with the informant, even though Defendant was acquitted of the counts relating to three of those transactions. A District Court may take acquitted conduct into account during sentencing. <em>United States v. Duncan, </em>400 F.3d 1297, 1304-05 (11th Cir.2005). As long as the final sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum for the convicted count, no constitutional violation is involved. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">Application note 12 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2D1.1 says \u201c[tjypes and quantities of drugs not specified in the count of conviction may be considered in determining the offense level.\u201d The note later goes on to say, \u201c[i]f the offense involved both a substantive drug offense and an attempt ... the total quantity involved shall be aggregated to determine the scale of the offense.\u201d Also, \u201c[i]f an offense involving an agreement to sell a controlled substance, the agreed-upon quantity of the controlled substance shall be used to determine the offense level....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b910-10\">The District Court based the 59.9 gram drug quantity on the amount of methamphetamine that Defendant attempted to sell to the confidential informant. The District Court was also authorized to take into account the quantities to which the witnesses testified. <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>89 F.3d 1501, 1506 (11th Cir.1996)(\u201cIn estimating the quantity of drugs attributable to a defendant, a court may base its computation on evidence showing the average frequency and amount of a defendant\u2019s drug sales over a given period of time\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-11\">The record supports the District Court\u2019s calculation of 59.9 grams of methamphetamine. Defendant\u2019s sentence was within the statutory range for the count of conviction. Defendant asks us to overturn the District Court\u2019s credibility determination on the two witnesses. \u201c[W]e give great deference to the district court\u2019s assess<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>ment of the credibility and evidentiary content of [witnesses\u2019s] testimony.\u201d <em>United States v. Lee, </em>68 F.3d 1267, 1276 (11th Cir.1995). \u201cBecause appellate courts reviewing a cold record give particular deference to credibility determination of a fact-finder who had the opportunity to see live testimony we do not second guess the court\u2019s judgments.\u201d <em>CBS Broad., Inc. v. EchoStar Commc\u2019ns Corp., </em>450 F.3d 505, 517 n. 23 (11th Cir.2006)(internal citation omitted). We see no reason to second-guess the District Court\u2019s credibility determinations in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
