The district court screened and dismissed Simpson\u2019s complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, which requires the court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>screen complaints in all civil actions that are filed by prisoners against government entities. On appeal, Simpson argues that: (1) the district court erred in dismissing his false arrest claim because the resulting charges against him were <em>nolle prossed; </em>and (2) the district court erred by dismissing his deliberate indifference claim against Sheriff D. Stewart because Sheriff Stewart was responsible for setting the policy for the treatment of prisoners. After thorough review, we affirm in part, and vacate and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">\u201cA district court\u2019s decision to dismiss for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A is reviewed <em>de novo, </em>taking the allegations in the complaint as true.\u201d <em>Boxer X v. Harris, </em>437 F.3d 1107, 1110 (11th Cir.2006). A complaint must be dismissed if it fails to articulate enough specific facts \u201cto raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). <em>\u201cPro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Boxer X, </em>437 F.3d at 1110.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">First, we agree with Simpson that the district court erred in dismissing his false arrest claim. The Supreme Court has held that \u201cin order to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment ... a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.\u201d <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). If the plaintiff cannot show that his conviction or sentence has been invalidated, then he is barred from bringing a \u00a7 1983 claim for false arrest. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Here, the district court found that Simpson\u2019s false arrest claim was barred by <em>Heck </em>because he failed to allege that his conviction or sentence was invalidated. But in his complaint, Simpson specifically alleged that he was charged with 41 counts of forgery as a result of his false arrest, and that all of these counts were subsequently <em>nolle prossed. </em>As a result, Simpson\u2019s false arrest claim is not barred by <em>Heck, </em>and the district court erred in dismissing the claim on this basis. Accordingly, we vacate this portion of the district court\u2019s decision and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">We are unpersuaded, however, by Simpson\u2019s claim that the district court erred by dismissing his deliberate indifference claim against Sheriff D. Stewart. \u201c[S]upervisory officials are not liable under \u00a7 1983 for unconstitutional acts of their subordinates on the basis of <em>respondeat superior </em>or vicarious liability.\u201d <em>Hartley v. Parnell, </em>193 F.3d 1263, 1269 (11th Cir.1999) (quotation omitted). \u201cSupervisory liability under \u00a7 1983 occurs either when the supervisor personally participates in the alleged constitutional violation or when there is a causal connection between actions of the supervising official and the alleged constitutional deprivation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted). \u201cThe causal connection can be established when a history of widespread abuse puts the responsible supervisor on notice of the need to correct the alleged deprivation, and he fails to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cThe deprivations that constitute widespread abuse sufficient to notify the supervising official must be obvious, flagrant, rampant and of continued duration, rather than isolated occurrences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). A causal connection could also be established and supervisory liability imposed where the supervisor\u2019s improper custom or policy \u201cresults in deliberate indifference to constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>In his complaint, Simpson alleged that Sheriff Stewart was liable for the failure to provide Simpson with proper medication because Sheriff Stewart was responsible for the well-being of all the inmates in the jail. However, this is insufficient to establish Sheriff Stewart\u2019s liability because there was no allegation that Sheriff Stewart was personally involved in the deliberate indifference against Simpson, and there was likewise no allegation that there existed widespread abuse that should have notified Sheriff Stewart that Simpson was not getting his proper medication.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm this portion of the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b883-15\">. While Simpson argues, for the first time on appeal, that Sheriff Stewart was liable because he set the policy for how prisoners were taken care of, he does not provide any specific facts to support this argument, and there are no specific facts in the record showing that Sheriff Stewart deliberately adopted a system-wide policy that resulted in Simpson not getting his proper medications. Thus, Simpson has not alleged any facts that would raise his deliberate indifference claim above the speculative level. <em>See Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
