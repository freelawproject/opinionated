We have also rejected the argument that using a conviction to increase the offense level and to calculate criminal history is impermissible double counting. <em>See Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31; <em>see also Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 366-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-19\">The assertions regarding his personal history and characteristics and his motive for reentering the United States are insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v.

He has not demonstrated that the district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence at the bottom of the advisory guidelines range was error, plain or otherwise, or an abuse of discretion. <em>See Puckett, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1429; <em>see also Gall v.
