On appeal, Bostic argues that the district court erred in basing its denial of his motion on the mistaken belief that he had been sentenced as a career offender. Because he was sentenced using the higher offense level determined by the drug quantity, Bostic argues, he was eligible for a reduction pursuant to Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-21\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment based on a guideline imprisonment range that was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-22\">Amendment 706, which amended the Drug Quantity Table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), provides a two-level reduction in base offense levels for certain crack cocaine offenses. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1325 (11th Cir.2008). Specific to this case, a pre-amendment base offense level of 38 is now 36 for defendants who are responsible for at least 1.5 kilograms but less than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. <em>Jones, </em>548 F.3d at 1369. However, Amendment 706 does not apply to defendants responsible for 4.5 kilograms or more.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Additionally, defendants sentenced as career offenders under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 are ineligible for a reduced sentence under Amendment 706. <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-23\">Here, the district court erred in denying Bostic\u2019s motion to modify his sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>based on its finding that Bostic was sentenced as a career offender. At Bostic\u2019s original sentencing hearing, the district court calculated the offense level from both the career offender guideline and the drug quantity guideline and concluded that the career offender range was lower than the drug quantity range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) (noting that the career-offender guideline applies if the offense level under \u00a7 4B1.1 \u201cis greater than the offense level otherwise applicable\u201d). Furthermore, the court adopted the pre-sentencing investigation report which indicated that the career offender enhanced offense level was not applied because it was lower than the drug quantity offense level. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand the case for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b899-18\">. The government\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that Bostic was responsible for 15 kilograms of crack cocaine and therefore Amendment 706 is inapplicable to his case. However, the record below clearly indicates that Bostic is responsible for 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, an amount within the required range of Amendment 706.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
