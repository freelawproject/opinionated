At a merits hearing held on June 17, 2008, an Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denied their applications for asylum and withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cCAT\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158, 1229a(c)(6), and 1231, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c), and ordered their removal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) dismissed their appeal of the IJ\u2019s decision on June 22, 2009, and they now petition this court for review.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-14\">The applications Hysaj and Maylinda filed alleged persecution resulting from Hysaj\u2019s support of the Albanian Democratic Party. The IJ and the BIA rejected their applications on the ground that them testimony was not credible. In their petition for review, they argue that substantial evidence does not support this adverse credibility finding.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-15\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>as the Board adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this case, the BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s reasoning. Accordingly, we will discuss both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Al Najjar, 257 </em>F.3d at 1284.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">In their brief to us, petitioners argue that remand is necessary because the IJ failed to acknowledge the inapplicability of the REAL ID Act, Pub.L. No. 109-13, \u00a7 101(a)(3), (d), 119 Stat. 231, 303-05 (2005). They further challenge the IJ\u2019s consideration of minor inconsistencies, immaterial omissions, and the absence of corroboration and his failure to explain adequately his rationale for the adverse credibility finding or to provide petitioners with an opportunity to explain inconsistencies or lack of supporting documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">We \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc) (quotation omitted). Under this \u201csubstantial evidence test,\u201d we can reverse the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s factual determinations \u201conly when the record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We review the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s legal determinations <em>de novo. Delgado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 860 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">An alien is eligible for discretionary asylum relief if the alien is a refugee within the meaning of INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). INA \u00a7 208(b)(1)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A). A refugee is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab4\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant bears the burden of proving \u201crefugee\u201d status. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). In order to meet this burden, \u201cthe applicant must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground or (2) a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Mejia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>498 F.3d 1253, 1256 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-12\">An alien seeking withholding of removal must show that it is more likely than not that he or she will be persecuted or tortured upon being returned to his or her country. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1232 (11th Cir.2005). This standard is more stringent than the standard for asylum. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, an alien who fails to establish eligibility for asylum generally cannot satisfy the higher burden for withholding of removal. <em>Id. </em>at 1232-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-13\">\u201cAn IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determinations are also factual findings, and thus, are also subject to the substantial evidence test, and may not be overturned unless the record compels that result.\u201d <em>Alim v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 1239, 1254 (11th Cir.2006). Adverse credibility determinations must be made explicitly, and \u201cIJ\u2019s must make clean determinations of credibility.\u201d <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). \u201cAs the trier of fact, the IJ must determine credibility, and this court may not substitute its judgment for that of the IJ with respect to credibility findings.\u201d <em>Alim, </em>446 F.3d at 1254 (quotation and alteration omitted). The IJ satisfies his obligation to give \u201crea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>soned consideration\u201d to the petition and make \u201cadequate findings\u201d when it has \u201cconsidered the issues raised and announced its decision in terms sufficient to enable a reviewing court to perceive that it has heard and thought and not merely reacted.\u201d <em>Shkambi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>584 F.3d 1041, 1048 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation and alterations omitted). \u201cOnce the IJ makes an adverse credibility determination, the burden is on the alien to show that the determination was not supported by specific, cogent reasons, or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1254-55 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">\u201cThe testimony of the applicant, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.13(a), 208.16(b); <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cConversely, an adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application.\u201d <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1255 (quotation omitted). \u201cIndications of reliable testimony include consistency on direct examination, consistency with the written application, and the absence of embellishments.\u201d <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1255. \u201c[A]n adverse credibility determination does not alleviate the IJ\u2019s duty to consider other evidence produced by an asylum applicant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf an applicant produces evidence beyond his own testimony, it is not sufficient for the IJ to rely solely on an adverse credibility determination in those instances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">The REAL ID Act amended the INA\u2019s asylum provisions under INA \u00a7 208(b)(l)(B)(iii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii), to provide that an adverse credibility determination can be based on inconsistencies, inaccuracies, or falsehoods, regardless of whether they relate to the heart of an applicant\u2019s claim. Pub.L. No. 109-13, \u00a7 101(a)(3), (d), 119 Stat. 231, 303-05 (2005). However, Hysaj and Maylinda filed their asylum applications in 2002 and 2003 respectively, before the May 11, 2005, effective date of the REAL ID Act, such that this provision does not apply to their claims. <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 109-13, \u00a7 101(h)(2), 119 Stat. 231, 305; (AR at 594,1038).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">In analyzing adverse credibility in the pre-REAL ID Act context, some circuits have held that discrepancies in the petitioner\u2019s testimony must go to the \u201cheart of the asylum claim.\u201d <em>See Kaita v. Att\u2019y Gen. of the U.S., </em>522 F.3d 288, 296 (3d Cir.2008); <em>Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>301 F.3d 1109, 1111-12 (9th Cir.2002). We have not resolved and need not resolve in this appeal whether the \u201cheart of the claim\u201d test applies to pre-REAL ID Act cases because, as shown by the BIA\u2019s June 22, 2009 decision, significant inconsistencies in this case go to the heart of petitioners\u2019 claims. Some of the inconsistencies are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASt\">Maylinda\u2019s testimony about going into hiding following her husband Agim\u2019s beating and arrest in August 2000 was substantially different than his testimony. Agim never testified that his family went into hiding, and his testimony and written declaration detail an event in August of 1999 and December 2001. Later during his testimony, Agim asserted the December 2001 incident actually occurred in December 2000. Agim never testified or asserted that he was arrested and beaten in August 2000. Moreover, Agim testified that during the August 1999 incident, he and his coworker were beaten and kicked, which is inconsistent with his written account that no one was injured.... Although Agim testified about a 1991 shooting during a pro-democracy demonstration that \u2018left hundreds of people dead,\u2019 he did not mention this significant fact in his asylum application. Agim\u2019s written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>declaration, that \u2018police took steps to end the demonstration\u2019 and \u2018[t]his resulted in physical altercations, the destruction of property and a number of arrests\u2019 is therefore materially inconsistent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-5\">[A]lso implausible [was] Maylinda\u2019s account that upon a brief return to Albania, she was able to be identified and ultimately kidnaped and raped by her attackers. Maylinda\u2019s asylum application mentions generally that she was the \u2018victim of a violent attack\u2019 on March 7, 2003, during a brief return to Albania, but does not provide any details of the attack or the fact that she was kidnaped or raped. Moreover, it was not clearly erroneous for the [IJ] to disbelieve [her] testimony that she was immediately identified at the airport after leaving the country approximately 2 years earlier, and that she was beaten, kicked, knocked unconscious, raped, and thrown onto a street, yet she did not seek medical attention or police assistance, and flew from Albania the next morning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">In sum, substantial evidence supports the Id\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility finding as to both Hysaj and his wife, which was not overcome by proffered corroborating documents. On this basis, we conclude that petitioners failed to establish their eligibility for asylum and, likewise, failed to meet the higher burden required for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b858-11\">. Hysaj came to the United States from Albania as a non-immigrant visitor on June 17, 2001, with permission to stay until December 16, 2001. The children, Odeta and Ivi, came to the United States from Italy on August 1, 2001, using fraudulent travel documents. Maylinda entered the United States without a valid entry document on March 12, 2003. Notices to Appear issued separately for Hysaj the two children, and for Maylinda. The children are derivative beneficiaries of Hysaj's application for asylum; Maylinda submitted a separate application or asylum. Petitioners conceded removability as charged in the Notices to Appear.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b858-12\">. Petitioners have abandoned their claim for CAT relief because they do not challenge the IJ's and the BIA's denial of such relief in the brief they filed in support of their petition for review. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b858-17\">.The IJ and the BIA denied petitioners\u2019 applications on an alternative ground, that the Attorney General rebutted their claim of a well-founded fear of future persecution based on evidence of changed country conditions. Petitioners argue that substantial evidence does not support that alternative ground. Given our resolution of their first argument, regarding the adverse credibility finding, we need not, and do not, address this alternative finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
