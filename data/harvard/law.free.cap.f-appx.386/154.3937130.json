LAR 27.4; 3d Cir. IOP 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">In February 2010, Crooker filed a petition under \u00a7 2241 alleging that, as a prisoner at FCI Loretto, he had been improperly sanctioned for violating BOP disciplinary rules, but was exonerated after an administrative appeal. Crooker claimed that he intended to file a suit for damages under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1495 \u2014 the unjust conviction statute \u2014 and sought from the District Court a \u201ccertificate of innocence,\u201d as provided for by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2513. The District Court denied the request over Crooker\u2019s objections, reasoning that Crooker\u2019s suit would be frivolous because a reversed disciplinary sanction does not amount to a reversed conviction that would provide the basis for a suit under \u00a7 1495, and that the District Court lacked authority to issue a \u201ccertificate of innocence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">A person who intends to file a suit under \u00a7 1495 must demonstrate that his conviction was reversed, and \u201c[pjroof of the requisite facts shall be by a certificate <em>of the court </em>or pardon wherein such facts are alleged to appear_\u201d \u00a7 2513(b) (emphasis added). In denying the petition, the District Court reasoned that because Crooker\u2019s disciplinary sanction was set aside by an administrative appeals board, the plain language of \u00a7 2513 permitted only that board to issue a certificate of innocence. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-19\">In his objections, Crooker argued that the District Court had the authority to issue a certificate of innocence, and cited <em>Roberson v. United States, </em>124 F.Supp. 857, 861 (Ct.Cl.1954). In <em>Roberson, </em>the Court of Claims reasoned \u2014 but did not expressly hold \u2014 that a District Court had the authority to issue Roberson a certificate of innocence because that court set aside his conviction on a writ of habeas corpus. <em>See id. </em>at 861-63. It did not suggest, however, that a District Court may issue a certificate of innocence merely because it entertains a habeas petition. Thus, <em>Roberson </em>has no bearing on Crook-er\u2019s case, as the District Court did not set aside his disciplinary sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-20\">Because we agree that the District Court could not issue Crooker a certificate of innocence, we need not consider its other reasons for denying his petition. Accordingly, we will summarily affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b177-12\">. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253. In determining whether a district court properly denied a petition for habeas corpus brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, we exercise plenary review over the district court's legal conclusions and apply a clearly erroneous standard to its factual findings. <em>See Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
