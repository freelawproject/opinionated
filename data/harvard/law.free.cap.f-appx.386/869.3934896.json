Jones argues that the district court abused its discretion by failing to account for his substantial assistance to the government, as a factor in its 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing analysis. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-15\">We review the sentence a district court imposes for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-16\">In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we perform two steps. <em>Id. </em>at 1190. First, we must \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence' \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court need not discuss each \u00a7 3553(a) factor. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>(11th Cir.2005). Rather, \u201c[t]he sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decision-making authority.\u201d <em>Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">If we conclude that the district court did not procedurally err, we must consider the \u201c \u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586). This review is \u201cdeferential,\u201d requiring us to determine \u201cwhether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. There is a \u201crange of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose,\u201d and a sentence within the guideline range is ordinarily expected to be reasonable. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, when considering whether a defendant\u2019s sentence is reasonable, we have compared the sentence actually imposed to the statutory maximum. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Valnor, </em>451 F.3d 744, 751-52 (11th Cir.2006) (upholding sentence as reasonable in part because it was \u201cappreciably below the length of the statutory maximum\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">\u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court, and we will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation and brackets omitted). We will remand for resentenc-ing only if we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191 (citation and internal quotation omitted). The burden is on the defendant to show that the sentence was unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">As applied here, Jones has not demonstrated that the district court committed any procedural error or that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable. Jones conceded at sentencing that his applicable guidelines range was correctly calculated, and does not allege otherwise on appeal. Jones also concedes on appeal that, because the government did not file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, the district court lacked the authority to depart downward based on his substantial assistance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">In addition, at the sentencing hearing, the district court allowed both parties to present arguments as to what they believed the appropriate sentence should be. The court considered Jones\u2019 arguments for a \u201cdownward departure\u201d based on his cooperation with the government, as well as his request for concurrent, rather than consecutive, sentences on the two telephone counts. Notably, the court heard Jones\u2019 argument that he cooperated with authorities from the very beginning of the case and agreed to \u201ckeep quiet\u201d so as to prevent the investigation from being hampered; it also heard the government\u2019s response that it sought to reward Jones upfront for his cooperation by allowing him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>to plead guilty to the telephone counts, instead of the conspiracy counts. The court responded to Jones\u2019 request for a downward departure by pointing out that Jones \u201cgot a better deal\u201d by this charge bargain, noting that, because Jones was allowed to plead to the telephone counts, as opposed to the conspiracy charges, he received the added benefit of serving only one year of supervised release, instead of five years. The court accepted the plea agreement because it \u201cadequately reflect[ed] the seriousness of the actual offense behavior, and [did] not undermine the statutory purposes of sentencing,\u201d and it considered Jones\u2019 individual characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Moreover, the district court acknowledged that it considered all of the factors identified in \u00a7 3553(a) and found the 78-month total sentence to be sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the statutory purposes of sentencing. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786 (\u201can acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient ... \u201d). Indeed, the district court correctly calculated the applicable guideline range, treated the guidelines as advisory, acknowledged that it considered the parties\u2019 arguments, as well as the PSI, the plea agreement, and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and ultimately sentenced Jones at the bottom of the guidelines range. Jones has therefore failed to show that his sentence was proeedurally unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Jones also has failed to demonstrate that his bottom-of-the-guidelines total sentence was substantively unreasonable. As for his claim that the \u201ccharge bargain\u201d that he accepted was not a better deal than pleading guilty to the charges of conspiracy, Jones ignores the fact that, if he had pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charges, he could have faced a 20-year term of imprisonment as well as a five-year term of supervised release, and a mandatory minimum of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment if the government had filed a notice under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 based on Jones\u2019 prior drug offense. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A), 846, 851; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(b)(1). In contrast, by pleading guilty to the telephone charges, Jones faced a lesser eight-year statutory maximum term of imprisonment and a one-year supervised release term. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b), (d)(1); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(b)(3). Further, Jones\u2019 bottom-of-the-guidelines 78-month total sentence also was below the statutory maximum of eight years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(d) (providing for a maximum term of imprisonment of four years, as to each count); <em>Valnor, </em>451 F.3d at 751-52; <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. Accordingly, Jones has not met his burden, in light of the record and the pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors, to show that the district court abused its discretion in sentencing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b892-12\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b893-7\">. \"Upon motion of the government stating that the defendant has provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense, the court may depart from the guidelines.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1.
