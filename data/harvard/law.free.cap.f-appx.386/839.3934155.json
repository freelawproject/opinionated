On appeal, he argues that the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over his \u00a7 751 offense; that his plea was involuntary because the district court had ordered him to obtain a psychiatric examination; and that his underlying conviction for making, possessing, and uttering a counterfeit security, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 513(a) and 2, that had subjected him to confinement from which he escaped, was invalid. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-16\">We review the voluntariness of a guilty plea <em>de novo. United States v. Frye, </em>402 F.3d 1123, 1126 (11th Cir.2005). A \u201cdefendant who enters a plea of guilty waives all nonjurisdictional challenges to the constitutionality of the conviction, and only an attack on the voluntary and knowing nature of the plea can be sustained.\u201d <em>Wilson v. United States, </em>962 F.2d 996, 997 (11th Cir.1992). However, the requirement that the district court have subject-matter jurisdiction over the charge of conviction cannot be waived. <em>United States v. De La Garza, </em>516 F.3d 1266, 1271 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1668, 173 L.Ed.2d 1035 (2009). District courts have original jurisdiction over all offenses against the laws of the United States. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-19\">Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 751 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-20\">Whoever escapes ... from the custody of the Attorney General or his authorized representative, or from any institution or facility in which he is confined by direction of the Attorney General, or from any custody under or by virtue of any process issued under the laws of the United States by any court, judge, or magistrate judge, or from the custody of an officer or employee of the United States pursuant to lawful arrest, shall, if the custody or confinement is by virtue of an arrest on a charge of felony, or conviction of any offense, be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-21\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 751(a). In <em>United States v. Smith, </em>534 F.2d 74, 75 (5th Cir.1976),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the defendant had been convicted of \u00a7 751(a) and had argued that his conviction for escape was invalid because there was an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>irregularity in the sentencing for his original conviction. <em>Id. </em>The defendant had asserted that there was no valid confinement from which he could have escaped. <em>Id. </em>We held that we need not determine the validity of the defendant\u2019s original sentence because it was clear that \u201cvalidity of conviction under which an escapee is confined is not an element of the offense of unlawfully escaping from confinement in a federal institution.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">As an initial matter, we hold that district court had subject-matter jurisdiction over Dumonde\u2019s \u00a7 751(a) conviction because escape from custody is an offense against the laws of the United States. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 751(a), 3231. We also hold that Dumonde is not challenging the voluntariness of his plea, but rather challenging the district court\u2019s order requiring him to obtain a psychiatric examination. Because this is a nonjurisdictional challenge to Dumonde\u2019s conviction, Dumonde has waived this argument. <em>See Wilson, </em>962 F.2d at 997. Similarly, because the validity of Dumonde\u2019s underlying conviction for 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 513(a) and 2 is not at issue in this case, Dumonde has waived this claim, which is another nonjurisdictional challenge to Dumonde\u2019s current guilty plea conviction. <em>See id. </em>And in any event, the argument lacks merit because the validity of the underlying conviction is not a defense to escape. <em>See Smith, </em>534 F.2d at 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b862-12\">.
