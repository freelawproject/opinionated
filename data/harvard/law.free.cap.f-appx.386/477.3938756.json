Ruiz contends that the district court erred in accepting her guilty plea because she did not understand the consequences of entering into her plea agreement due to ineffective assistance of counsel, and that the district court erred in sentencing her to the statutory minimum sentence due to ineffective assistance of counsel. The record is insufficiently developed to allow consideration at this time of Ruiz\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-23\">Ruiz\u2019s plea agreement provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-24\">The Defendant waives the right to appeal any aspect of the conviction and sentence, and waives the right to seek collateral relief in post conviction proceedings, including proceedings under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. This waiver does not apply to ineffective assistance of counsel or prosecutorial misconduct of constitutional dimension of which the Defendant did not have knowledge at the time of sentencing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-25\">We decline to consider at this juncture whether the appeal waiver is enforceable and whether the waiver precludes consideration of Ruiz\u2019s ineffective assistance claims because those claims were known to Ruiz at the time of sentencing. The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b499-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
