Marie appeals convictions on all five counts. Sophia appeals convictions on Counts 1 and 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-15\">I. <em>Defendants\u2019Entrapment Defense</em></p>\n<p id=\"b936-16\">Both defendants argue that the district court erroneously denied them judgments of acquittal, claiming that the government insufficiently rebutted their affirmative defense of entrapment. We review this preserved claim de novo, \u201cviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, and drawing all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>218 F.3d 1243, 1244 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-17\">Once the Jean-Baptistes produced some evidence of inducement, it was for the government to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that they were predisposed to commit the offense. <em>United States v. Ryan, </em>289 F.3d 1339, 1343 (11th Cir.2002). Predisposition is a \u201cfact-intensive\u201d and subjective inquiry, and a jury\u2019s credibility assessments are critically important to gauging \u201cthe defendant\u2019s readiness and willingness to engage in the charged crime absent any contact with the government\u2019s ... agents.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>43 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>F.3d 618, 624-25 (11th Cir.1995). Predisposition may be demonstrated by \u201cthe defendant\u2019s ready commission of the charged crime [or] evidence that the defendant was given opportunities to back out of illegal transactions but failed to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 625.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">The evidence was clearly sufficient under these standards to convince a reasonable jury that the Jean-Baptistes were predisposed to commit the planned crimes prior to contact with the government\u2019s confidential informant (Cl). The evidence showed that Marie gave the Cl instructions on the best way to murder their victim and gain access to hidden drugs, including specific direction on how to \u201cpersuade\u201d a different victim to reveal the drugs\u2019 location. There was also evidence that Sophia herself initiated contact with the Cl and expressed independent concern that a drug theft accompany the murder. On the basis of these facts, the jury was entitled to find predisposition beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">II. <em>Outrageous Conduct by Government against Sophia Jean-Baptiste</em></p>\n<p id=\"APy\">[2] Citing her one-time romantic relationship with the Cl, Sophia argues that the government\u2019s conduct in securing her conviction was outrageous as to violate due process under <em>United States v. Russell, </em>411 U.S. 423, 431-32, 93 S.Ct. 1637, 1642-43, 36 L.Ed.2d 366 (1973). We disagree. Looking to the totality of the circumstances, we do not find that the government\u2019s use of the Cl in this case shocks the \u201cuniversal sense of justice,\u201d as required by our caselaw. <em>United States v. Edenfield, </em>995 F.2d 197, 200-01. The many recorded conversations between the Cl and the Jean-Baptistes provided substantial evidence that Sophia was a willing participant in the planned crimes, quite apart from her prior intimate involvement with the Cl.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-9\">III. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence for Sophia Jean-Baptiste\u2019s Conspiracy Conviction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b937-10\">Sophia claims that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that she knowingly and voluntarily joined the conspiracies.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She argues that the government failed to prove her knowledge of the essential nature of the conspiracy, including the specific purpose of the alleged robbery. On the basis of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), she further argues that the government was obligated but failed to show that she had specific knowledge of the five kilograms of cocaine to be stolen. These arguments fail for at least two reasons. First, the same evidence which refutes Sophia\u2019s entrapment defense adequately demonstrates her willing and knowing participation in the charged conspiracies. Second, Sophia\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>argument is clearly foreclosed by the well settled rule that \u201cin the context of federal drug cases, drug type and quantity do not have to be charged in the indictment or submitted to the jury for proof beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d except where a defendant\u2019s sentence would exceed the prescribed statutory maximum. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number><em>States v. Tinoco, </em>304 F.3d 1088, 1100 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">IV. <em>Federal Jurisdiction over \u00a7 1958 Charge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">Marie Jean-Baptiste appeals her conviction for conspiracy to use a facility of interstate commerce \u2014 here, interstate telephone lines \u2014 with the intent to commit murder. She urges this Court to hold that purely intrastate use of an interstate facility does not support federal jurisdiction under \u00a7 1958(a), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-6\">Whoever ... uses ... any facility of interstate or foreign commerce, with intent that a murder be committed in violation of the laws of any State or the United States as consideration for the receipt of, or as consideration for a promise or agreement to pay, anything of pecuniary value, or who conspires to do so shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than ten years, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">This provision was recently amended to address the courts\u2019 difficulty in interpreting it, with Congress changing the phrase \u201cany facility <em>in </em>interstate or foreign commerce\u201d to \u201cany facility <em>of </em>interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d <em>See United States v. Drury, </em>396 F.3d 1303, 1311 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 336, 163 L.Ed.2d 48 (2005); Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, \u00a7 6704, Pub.L. No. 108-458, 118 Stat. 3638. In <em>Drury, </em>we held that this alteration makes \u201cabsolutely clear that \u00a7 1958 establishes federal jurisdiction whenever any \u2018facility of interstate commerce\u2019 is used in the commission of a murder-for-hire offense, regardless of whether the use is interstate in nature (i.e. the telephone call was between states) or purely intrastate in nature (i.e. the telephone call was made to another telephone within the same state).\u201d Evidently, our holding in <em>Drury </em>directly precludes Marie\u2019s jurisdictional challenge to her \u00a7 1958 conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-11\">V. <em>Marie </em>Jean-Baptiste''s <em>Claim of Mistrial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b938-12\">At trial, Dr. Rey, a government witness on voodoo, stated that Marie\u2019s voodoo defense was \u201cvery stretched.\u201d On Marie\u2019s objection, the district court instructed the jury to disregard all of Dr. Rey\u2019s testimony, and later narrowed the exclusion to encompass only the offending statement. On appeal, Marie argues that Dr. Rey\u2019s non-expert assessment of her argument effectively tarred her defense as \u201cbogus\u201d and that the district court therefore should have granted her motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-13\">Reviewing for an abuse of discretion, <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>405 F.3d 1260, 1272 (11th Cir.2005), we conclude that the court properly refused Marie\u2019s request for a mistrial. In <em>United States v. Warren, </em>772 F.2d 827, 839 (11th Cir.1985) (internal quotation and citation omitted), we held that improper evidence may be cured by a corrective instruction unless \u201cthe evidence is so highly prejudicial as to be incurable by the trial court\u2019s admonition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Dr. Rey\u2019s statement did not rise to this exceptional level. Moreover, the fact that the court modified the scope of its evidentiary exclusion, striking only a portion of Dr. Rey\u2019s testimony rather than all of it, hardly minimizes the ultimate curative effect of its instruction. If any \u201cconfusion\u201d actually arose from the court\u2019s revision, we do not see why the government, rather than Marie herself, would have benefitted from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b937-7\">.
