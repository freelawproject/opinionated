He first contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress and to dismiss the indictment on the ground that his removal proceedings in June 2000 were fundamentally unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-20\">The district court\u2019s denial of the suppression motion is reviewed de novo. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Vasquez, </em>227 F.3d 476, 481-82 (5th Cir.2000). Because Canales failed to exhaust his remedies and has not shown that he was deprived of judicial review as to the underlying removal order, we find no error in the district court\u2019s ruling. <em>See United States v. Mendoza-Mata, </em>322 F.3d 829, 832 (5th Cir.2003) (internal quotations and citations omitted); <em>United States v. Benitez-Villafuerte, </em>186 F.3d 651, 658 <em>&amp; </em>n. 8 (5th Cir.1999); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d); <em>see also United States v. Lopez-Ortiz, </em>313 F.3d 225, 230 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-21\">Canales devotes his argument regarding exhaustion and judicial review to his 2000 removal. He does not explain why he failed to challenge the later, separate, July 2003 removal order, either administratively or judicially. <em>See United States v. Nava-Perez, </em>242 F.3d 277, 279 (5th Cir.2001). To the extent that Canales argues that his failure to exhaust should be excused because he was never informed that he was eligible for relief under 8 U.S.C \u00a7 1159(c), his argument fails because he was not in fact eligible for such relief given that he had not applied for (but had actually withdrawn his application for) adjustment of status. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1182, 1159(a)(2) and (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-22\">Canales\u2019 argument that the sentencing provisions in \u00a7 1326 are unconstitutional is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Canales contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Canales properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b306-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
