She argues that the Supreme Court amended the sentencing guidelines with its decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and thus the district court should give retroactive effect to the amendment and resentence her.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">We review issues of subject-matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. United States v. Moore, </em>443 F.3d 790, 793 (11th Cir.2006). The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \u201cgovern the procedure in the United States district courts in all suits of a civil nature ...\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 1. While Rule 60(b) provides for relief from a final judgment, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b), it does not provide for relief from judgment in a criminal case and, therefore, cannot be used to challenge a sentence, <em>United States v. Mosavi, </em>138 F.3d 1365, 1366 (11th Cir.1998) (addressing a challenge to a criminal forfeiture).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">Because Rule 60(b) does not offer relief from a criminal judgment, Zuluaga is unable to collaterally attack her sentence through a Rule 60(b) motion. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not have subject-matter jurisdiction to grant her Rule 60(b) motion. To the extent that Zuluaga\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motion could be construed as one for relief under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) or 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, the decision in <em>Booker </em>is not an appropriate ground for relief in either motion. Finally, we do not consider Zuluaga\u2019s request to consider the Rule 60(b) motion as an independent action because she raised it for the first time in her reply brief. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Zuluaga\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
