Battles pled guilty, pursuant to a written plea agreement, to one count of robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951 (2000). Battles was sentenced following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The district court applied the holding of <em>Booker </em>and sentenced Battles to 97 months of imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised release. Counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but addressing whether Battles\u2019 sentence was reasonable, given his limited role in the offense, his age at the time of the offense, and his cooperation by pleading guilty. Although informed of his right to file a supplemental pro se brief, Battles has not done so. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker, </em>a sentencing court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540 (4th Cir.2005). However, in determining a sentence post-<em>Booker, </em>sentencing courts are still required to calculate and consider the applicable guideline range as well as the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006). <em>Id. </em>If the sentence imposed is within the properly calculated guideline range, it is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">Battles\u2019 sentence was both within the guideline range of 97-121 months and within the statutory maximum of twenty years imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a). Because the district court appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory, and properly calculated and considered the guideline range and the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including those enumerated by counsel, we find the sentence reasonable. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-12\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
