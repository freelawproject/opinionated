Over three years later, Brown filed a motion to file a direct appeal out of time, which the district court denied. After review, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Brown\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">After Brown pled guilty, the district court sentenced Brown to 200 months\u2019 imprisonment and 5 years\u2019 supervised release and entered the judgment on July 10, 2002. After pronouncing the sentence, the district court advised Brown that he had ten days to file an appeal, and Brown responded that he understood. However, Brown did not file a direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">Three and a half years later, on January 10, 2006, Brown filed a \u201cMotion pursuant to Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(1),\u201d in which he argued that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel when his trial attorney failed to file a notice of appeal as Brown requested. Brown did not explain why he had waited over three years to file this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">The district court transmitted the motion to this Court. In turn, this Court construed the motion as a motion for an out-of-time appeal and returned it to the district court because Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b)(4) provides that only the district court may grant an out-of-time appeal. The district court entered an order denying Brown\u2019s motion, finding that Brown had \u201cnot established sufficient reasons for seeking to file an appeal more than three and one-half years after he was sentenced.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b967-9\">Ordinarily, a criminal defendant must file a notice of appeal within ten days of the final judgment, as proscribed by Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(l)(A)(i); <em>see also United States v. Phillips, </em>225 F.3d 1198, 1199 (11th Cir.2000). This requirement is \u201cjurisdictional and strictly applied.\u201d <em>Phillips, </em>225 F.3d at 1200. However, under Rule 4(b), upon a finding of excusable neglect or good cause, the district court may extend the time for filing a notice of appeal \u201cfor a period not to exceed 30 days from the expiration of the time otherwise prescribed by Rule 4(b).\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>see also Dismuke v. United States, </em>864 F.2d 106, 107 (11th Cir.1989). We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a Rule 4(b) motion for leave to file an out-of-time appeal. <em>Dismuke, </em>864 F.2d at 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-11\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. The district court concluded that Brown had not \u201cestablished sufficient reasons for seeking to file an appeal more than three and one-half years after he was sentenced.\u201d This determination was not an abuse of discretion given that Brown failed to give any explanation as to why he waited until January 10, 2006 to file his motion when he was sentenced on July 9, 2002. Brown was fully informed at sentencing that he had ten days to file a notice of appeal, and, by his own admission, requested that his trial counsel do so after the sentencing. Brown offered no basis for finding that his three and one-half year delay in filing his Rule 4(b) motion was due to excusable neglect or that good cause exists to permit him to file an out-of-time appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-12\">Furthermore, Rule 4(b)(4) prohibits a district court from extending the time for filing a notice of appeal more than thirty days beyond Rule 4(b)\u2019s ten-day deadline. <em>See United States v. Grant, </em>256 F.3d 1146, 1150-51 (11th Cir.2001) (finding that defendant\u2019s second notice of appeal was filed outside the 30-day window of Rule 4(b)(4)). Brown sought to file his notice of appeal well beyond this thirty-day period. The district court entered Brown\u2019s judgment on July 10, 2002. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(6). Under Rule 4(b)(l)(A)(i) and Rule 26(a), a notice of appeal was due to be filed on July 24, 2002. Under Rule 4(b)(4), given the proper circumstances, the district court was authorized to extend that deadline to August 23, 2002, but no fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>ther. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Brown\u2019s Rule 4(b) motion filed on January 10, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">Finally, we note that Brown does allege in his motion that his counsel was ineffective for not filing a direct appeal. Alternatively, even if we were to construe Brown\u2019s motion as a motion brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, this does not change the result. The one-year period for filing a \u00a7 2255 motion had expired by January 10, 2006, and Brown set forth no facts which would arguably toll the limitations period. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1), (2); <em>Steed v. Head, </em>219 F.3d 1298, 1300 (11th Cir.2000) (holding that equitable tolling of \u00a7 2244(d)\u2019s one-year limitations period requires \u201cextraordinary circumstances that are both beyond [the defendant\u2019s] control and unavoidable even with diligence,\u201d which means more than a \u201cgarden variety claim of excusable neglect\u201d (quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">For all of these reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Brown\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
