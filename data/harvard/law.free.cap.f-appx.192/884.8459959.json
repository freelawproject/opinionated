Specifically, Jimerson argues that the district court (1) failed to give sufficient weight to the evidence showing that he was dependent on hydrocodone for back pain, and would face withdrawal symptoms if he ceased taking the medication and (2) did not adequately consider his arguments concerning his inability to serve his sentence in a halfway house or the hardship of serving a custodial sentence with his medical problems. Jimerson also offers a variety of reasons why we should find his sentence unreasonable under the factors outlined in \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-17\">After <em>Booker, </em>we review a defendant\u2019s sentence for \u201cunreasonableness\u201d in the context of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 264, 125 S.Ct. 738, 767, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005). Section 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the advisory guidelines range; (8) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (9) the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-18\">We have held that, although a guidelines sentence is not <em>per se </em>a reasonable sentence, \u201cordinarily we would expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cReview for reasonableness is deferential.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[N]othing in Booker or elsewhere re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>quires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3558(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Robles, </em>408 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2005) (stating that post-Booker district courts are not required to conduct an accounting of every \u00a7 3553(a) factor and explain how each factor played a role in the sentencing decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">The district court adequately considered both of Jimerson\u2019s arguments concerning his medical condition, as well as the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and sentenced him to the middle of the advisory guidelines range. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. With respect to Jimerson\u2019s need for hydrocodone, the court stated that the Bureau of Prisons could supply alternative medication that would satisfy Jimerson\u2019s needs. The district court found that the 20-month sentence was reasonable in light of \u201call of the attributes of the defendant plus the offense conduct and also the sentencing goals that courts are required to consider in determining a sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">None of Jimerson\u2019s arguments and nothing in the record convinces us that this is an unusual case. Having carefully reviewed the record, we find the sentence to be reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
