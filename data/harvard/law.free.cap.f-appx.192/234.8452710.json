For the reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">The Appellants were convicted by a jury for their participation in a scheme to obtain millions of dollars by making and selling fictitious mortgage notes to the Federal National Mortgage Association (\u201cFannie Mae\u201d) and the Government National Mortgage Association (\u201cGinnie Mae\u201d). The charges set forth in the 66-count indictment fell into eight groups: wire fraud to sell fraudulent mortgages to Fannie Mae; wire fraud through the transmission of false Department of Housing and Urban Development (\u201cHUD\u201d) documents to secure Ginnie Mae mortgage securities; submitting false statements in connection with the Ginnie Mae scheme; making false entries on monthly status reports required by HUD; making and passing false mortgage notes to influence HUD; bank fraud against BB &amp; T; money laundering; and conspiracy to commit the above-mentioned substantive offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">McLean was convicted of all sixty-six counts. Based on a total offense level of thirty-seven and a criminal history category of II, McLean\u2019s sentencing guidelines range was 235 to 293 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court initially sentenced McLean to 252 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">Paul and Debbie Zimmerman were convicted of conspiracy to defraud the United States and of passing to HUD false mortgage notes dated after February 1, 2000. For both Zimmermans, the statutory maximum for the conspiracy charge was five years, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (2000), and the statutory maximum for counts forty-seven, fifty-one and fifty-two (the money laundering charges) was two years for each count, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1010 (2000), leaving a combined statutory maximum of 132 months\u2019 imprisonment. Because 132 months is less than the low end of each of the guidelines ranges (168 months for Paul Zimmerman; 135 months for Debbie Zimmerman), the guidelines sentences were reduced to 132 months\u2019 imprisonment pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5Gl.l(a) (1998). The district court imposed the statutory maximum for each count. On appeal, we affirmed Appellants\u2019 convictions, but vacated their sentences in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and remanded for resentencing. <em>See United States v. McLean, </em>131 Fed.Appx. 34 (4th Cir .2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-12\">On remand, McLean and Paul Zimmerman received the same sentences as previously imposed. The district court sentenced Debbie Zimmerman to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, which amounted to a twelve-month reduction from her previous sentence. On appeal, Appellants argue that their sentences are unreasonable under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-13\">After <em>Booker, </em>a sentencing court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). However, in determining a sentence post-Booker, sentencing courts are still required to calculate and consider the guideline range prescribed thereby as well as the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006). <em>Id. </em>This court will affirm a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence if it is both reasonable and within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>the statutorily prescribed range. <em>Id. </em>at 546-47; <em>see also United States v. Green, </em>486 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.) (stating a sentence imposed within a properly calculated guideline range is presumptively reasonable), cer<em>t. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). When reviewing the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines, this court reviews findings of fact for clear error and questions of law de novo. <em>Green, </em>436 F.3d at 456. A sentence is unreasonable if based on an error in construing or applying the sentencing guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 456-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Moreover, reasonableness review involves both procedural and substantive components. <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 434 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). When conducting reasonableness scrutiny, we note two considerations. First, although a sentence may be procedurally unreasonable if the district court provides an inadequate statement of reasons or fails to make a necessary factual finding, a district court need not \u201crobotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345 (4th Cir.2006). Second, although a sentence may be substantively unreasonable if the court relies on an improper factor or rejects policies articulated by Congress or the Sentencing Commission, <em>see Moreland, </em>437 F.3d at 434, \u201cexcessive weight\u201d may not be given to any one \u00a7 3553 factor. <em>See United States v. Hampton, </em>441 F.3d 284, 288-89 (4th Cir. 2006). Applying the above principles, we cannot find that the sentences imposed after remand were unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">We therefore affirm Appellants\u2019 sentences. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
