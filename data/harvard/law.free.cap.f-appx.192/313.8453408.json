Reviewing the dismissal as frivolous for an abuse of discretion and the dismissal for failure to state a claim de novo, <em>Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005), we affirm for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-4\">1. Esparza\u2019s hand-written complaint, much like his briefing to this court, borders on unintelligible. The magistrate judge properly conducted a hearing to permit Esparza to explain his allegations pursuant to <em>Spears v. McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179 (5th Cir. 1985). Esparza\u2019s explanation revealed that he was not happy with the limited number of shift hours he was scheduled to work as a hamburger cook, but that he had no evidence of any guarantee of a certain number of work hours nor of any discrimination against him on the part of McDonald\u2019s or his supervisors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-5\">2. We agree with the magistrate that Esparza\u2019s pleadings in this action and explanation at the <em>Spears </em>hearing collectively fail to show that his IFP action has an arguable basis in law or fact. <em>Geiger, </em>404 F.3d at 373.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b337-38\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
