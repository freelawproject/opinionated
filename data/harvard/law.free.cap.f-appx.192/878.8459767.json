Goggans.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-21\">According to the complaint, Goggans represented Morris in a civil suit and a subsequent criminal prosecution. Morris alleged that Goggans refused to communicate with him despite Morris\u2019s repeated attempts to contact Goggans and improperly dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-22\">Morris claimed that Goggans\u2019s failures amounted to legal malpractice and ineffective assistance of counsel. Morris hired new counsel and asked the court to (1) remove Goggans as counsel; (2) require that Goggans return all documents in Morris\u2019s file and refund $5,000 paid to Goggans in attorney\u2019s fees; and (3) award punitive damages. Morris also alleged governmental misconduct in the form of illegal searches of his home, but did not name a government agency or employee as a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-23\">The allegations in Morris\u2019s complaint do not state a cause of action arising under federal law. Nor do his allegations establish that the district court had diversity jurisdiction over his suit. Although Morris alleges violations of his constitutional rights arising out of allegedly unlawful searches, he did not bring any claim against a governmental entity and thus has not brought a valid claim pursuant to ei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>ther 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 or <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 395-97, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">To the extent that Morris\u2019s complaint states a claim against Goggans for legal malpractice, that claim is governed by state law and must be brought in state court. <em>See Diaz v. Sheppard, </em>85 F.3d 1502, 1505 (11th Cir.1996). To the extent that Morris\u2019s claim is based on ineffective assistance of counsel, it is appropriate in a motion to vacate a sentence, brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 505, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003). Here, Morris has not been sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">Because the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Morris\u2019s claims, his complaint was properly dismissed. We therefore AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
