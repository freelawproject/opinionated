NCDOT removed the case to federal court and moved for summary judgment. The district court dismissed the \u00a7 1981 cause of action and granted summary judgment to NCDOT on the state constitutional claims and the Title VII retaliation claims. The court denied summary judgment on the hostile work environment claims, however. After trial on those claims, a jury found that the co-worker\u2019s behavior constituted a hostile work environment, but that NCDOT was not liable for the co-worker\u2019s acts. The employees appeal, contending that the district court should have remanded their state constitutional claims to state court, and that the court gave erroneous jury instructions regarding the employer\u2019s liability for the hostile work environment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-15\">The employees work at NCDOT\u2019s Beryl Road Equipment Unit. They maintain that on or about February 1, 2002, the first day of Black History Month, a fellow employee, Raymond Powell, fashioned a hangman\u2019s noose out of a piece of rope and hung it from a wire antenna over his workstation. They further contend that the rope remained in place until March 14, and that during that time, shop supervisors repeatedly commented on the noose and laughed. They also maintain that at a staff meeting in March, Powell stated, \u201cwe [white people] need to go back to the way things used to be. Fight \u2018em and hang'em like my father did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-16\">The employees reported these allegations to the Civil Rights Division of the state Office of Administrative Hearings, which is the agency designated by the state legislature to receive EEOC complaints. NCDOT received notice of those EEOC charges on March 14, 2002, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>which point it began its own investigation of the events. On May 7, 2002, NCDOT issued a statement, concluding that it found no noose in the workshop, and that the only rope at Powell\u2019s workstation was a \u201cspecial tool designed by Raymond Powell .... to pull electrical wire and hydraulic hoses through tight inaccessible pathways such as pipes, tubes, and other metal/steel pathways.\u201d In July 2002, the Office of Administrative Hearings determined there was \u201ccredible evidence\u201d that Powell had displayed a hangman\u2019s noose. After failed conciliation efforts between the employees and NCDOT, EEOC issued right-to-sue letters to the employees, who then filed the instant action.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">On appeal, the employees first contend that the district court erred by granting summary judgment against them on their state constitutional claims instead of remanding those claims to state court. They seem to suggest that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the state claims. <em>See </em>Brief of Appellants at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Because the district court had supplemental jurisdiction over the state claims, it did not err in exercising that jurisdiction. Federal courts may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims if they \u201cform part of the same case or controversy\u201d as claims that are properly within the jurisdiction of the federal court. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1367 (West 1993). \u201cThe state and federal claims must derive from a common nucleus of operative fact. But if, considered without regard to their federal or state character, a plaintiffs claims are such that he would ordinarily be expected to try them all in one judicial proceeding, then, assuming substantiality of the federal issues, there is power in federal courts to hear the whole.\u201d <em>United Mine Workers of Am. v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715, 725, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966); <em>see also Axel Johnson, Inc. v. Carroll Carolina Oil Co., Inc., </em>145 F.3d 660, 662 (4th Cir.1998) (noting that \u00a7 1367 codified the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in Gibbs).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">There can be no doubt that the employees\u2019 state constitutional claims arise out of the \u201csame core of operative facts\u201d as their Title VII claims. Indeed, in pleading their state claims in the complaint, the employees specifically incorporated by reference all of the factual allegations supporting their federal claims. All of the allegations in the complaint concern the alleged harassment of the employees by co-workers and the NCDOT\u2019s assertedly inadequate investigation of those complaints. Therefore, \u00a7 1367 permits the exercise of federal jurisdiction over the state claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">Of course, even if the requirements for supplemental jurisdiction are met, a district court has the discretion not to exercise such jurisdiction. A federal court may decline to exercise jurisdiction over state law claims if, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe claim raises a novel or complex issue of state law.\u201d 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1367(c). The employees apparently believe that this exception applies here; they contend that their claims present novel questions of state law because \u201cthe 1971 anti-discrimination clause in question has not been interpreted by [the] North Carolina appellate division.\u201d Brief of Appellant at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">That assertion is simply false. Article I, \u00a7 19 of the North Carolina Constitution\u2014 on which the employees base their state constitutional claims \u2014 is not a new or obscure provision. On the contrary, it is the state\u2019s fundamental guarantee of equal protection. North Carolina courts have repeatedly interpreted this provision, holding that it parallels the Fourteenth Amendment. \u201cThe principle of equal protection of the law is explicit in both the Fourteenth Amendment to the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>States Constitution and Article I, Section 19 of the Constitution of North Carolina. ... Our courts use the same test as federal courts in evaluating the constitutionality of challenged classifications under an equal protection analysis.\u201d <em>Richardson v. N.C. Dep't of Corr., </em>845 N.C. 128, 478 S.E.2d 501, 505 (1996); <em>see also Disher v. Weaver, </em>308 F.Supp.2d 614, 624 (M.D.N.C. 2004) (\u201cNorth Carolina courts have consistently interpreted [Art. I, \u00a7 19] to be synonymous with the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, finding that equivalent rights and protections are provided by each source.\u201d) (citing <em>Bacon v. Lee, </em>353 N.C. 696, 549 S.E.2d 840, 856 n. 11 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Even if the state constitutional claims did present novel or complex questions of state law, the district court was not <em>required </em>to remand them. Section 1367(c) is permissive \u2014 it merely allows a district court to dispose of a state claim over which it could exercise supplemental jurisdiction. For that reason, we review a district court\u2019s decision to retain jurisdiction for abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., White v. County of Newberry, S.C., </em>985 F.2d 168, 172 (4th Cir.1993) (reviewing decision to retain jurisdiction under \u00a7 1367 for abuse of discretion). In the present case, the district court\u2019s decision to retain discretion over state claims based on the same core of operative facts as the employees\u2019 \u00a7 1981 and Title VII claims constitutes no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The employees next argue that the district court erred in defining the term \u201csupervisor\u201d in its instructions to the jury. They preserved this contention by objecting to that definition at trial; accordingly, we review the alleged error for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Ebersole, </em>411 F.3d 517, 526 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">The district court instructed the jury that if it determined that a co-worker created a hostile work environment for the employees, it could not impose liability on NCDOT unless it found two additional facts by a preponderance of the evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-8\">First, that plaintiffs supervisor or successively higher authority knew, that is had actual knowledge, or should have known, that is had constructive knowledge, of the racially hostile or abusive environment; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-9\">Second, that the supervisor or higher authority permitted it to continue by failing to take remedial action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">The employees acknowledge that this instruction was a correct statement of the law. <em>See </em>Brief of Appellant at 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">Nevertheless, they argue that the court erred when it defined the term \u201csupervisor\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-12\">A supervisor is a person with immediate or successively higher authority over the employee. The essence of supervisory status is the authority to affect terms and conditions of employment, primarily consisting of the power to hire, fire, demote, promote, transfer, or discipline the employee. This includes someone with the power to provide significant input into employment decisions, to instruct the offending employee to cease harassing behavior, or to implement other means of taking remedial action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-13\">J.A. 904. According to the employees, this instruction impermissibly \u201cdirected the jury away from agency and negligence law applicable to a co-employee harasser case,\u201d and instead invited them to consider the \u201crelative power of [employer\u2019s] \u2018agents.\u2019\u201d Brief of Appellee at 30, 35. Although their argument is not entirely clear, apparently the employees contend on appeal that the district court should not have defined \u201csupervisor,\u201d but simply should have focused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>on NCDOT as an organization \u2014 \u201cwhat did the employer or agency know? What should <em>it </em>have known? When did <em>it </em>know about the harassment? When should <em>it </em>have known about the harassment?\u201d Brief of Appellant at 33 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The problem with this argument is that we cannot know what NCDOT knew (or should have known) without knowing what its agents and supervisors knew (or should have known). An organization can only act through human beings. <em>See United States v. W.F. Brinkley &amp; Son Const. Co., Inc., </em>783 F.2d 1157, 1159 n. 5 (1986) (\u201cOf course, a corporation acts through its officers or agents.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. One Parcel of Land Located at 7326 Highway 15 North, </em>965 F.2d 311, 316 (7th Cir.1992) (\u201cAs a legal fiction, a corporation cannot \u2018know\u2019 like an individual.... A corporation acts through its agents. Similarly, a corporation \u2018knows\u2019 through its agents.\u201d) (citing W. Fletcher, 3 Corporations \u00a7 787 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The employees themselves acknowledged just this in the district court, asking the court to instruct the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">Defendant, as the Plaintiffs\u2019 employer, will be responsible or liable for permitting such behavior only if the Plaintiff proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the Plaintiffs supervisor or successively higher authority knew, that is, had <em>actual knowledge </em>[,] or should have known, that is, had <em>constructive knowledge, </em>of the hostile or abusive work environment and permitted it to continue by failing to take remedial action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Like the court\u2019s instruction, the employees\u2019 proposed instruction imposed liability only when a \u201csupervisor or successively higher authority\u201d had knowledge of the harassment. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion by focusing the jury\u2019s attention on the knowledge of NCDOT\u2019s supervisory employees rather than on what NDCOT, as a nameless, faceless entity, \u201cknew.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process. For all of the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
