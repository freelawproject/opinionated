Stat. \u00a7 760.01 et seq. Strauss also appeals the district court\u2019s denial of her Rule 60(b) motion for relief from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-18\">The district court granted summary judgment to Rent-A-Center, holding that Strauss\u2019s claims were barred by res judicata, accord and satisfaction, and judicial estoppel. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-19\">Strauss\u2019s retaliation claims are not barred by res judicata nor by accord and satisfaction because her claims are distinct from those claims that were settled by the consent decree entered by the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>court in the Southern District of Illinois, on October 11, 2002, in <em>Wilfong, et al. v. Rent-A-Center, </em>Civil Action No. 00-680-DRH. As to unnamed class members, that consent decree resolves only sex discrimination and sexual harassment claims; it does not address any retaliation actions by unnamed class members.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">We also hold that, under the circumstances of this case, application of the doctrine of judicial estoppel is reversible error. We do not think this is a case where Strauss\u2019s nondisclosure of her employment action on her Chapter 13 petition was \u201c \u2018shown to have been calculated to make a mockery of the judicial system.\u2019 \u201d <em>Burnes v. Pemco Aeroplex, Inc., </em>291 F.3d 1282, 1285 (11th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Salomon Smith Barney, Inc. v. Harvey, M.D., </em>260 F.3d 1302, 1308 (11th Cir.2001)). Strauss was not successful in \u201cpersuading a tribunal to accept the earlier position, so that judicial acceptance of the inconsistent position in a later proceeding creates the perception that either court was misled.\u201d <em>Bumes, </em>291 F.3d at 1285 (citing <em>New Hampshire v. Maine, </em>532 U.S. 742, 750-51, 121 S.Ct. 1808, 1815, 149 L.Ed.2d 968 (2001)). This is not a case like <em>Barger v. City of Cartersville, Ga., </em>348 F.3d 1289 (11th Cir.2003), in which there was evidence that: (1) the debtor intentionally misled the bankruptcy court as to the existence and then character of her employment lawsuit, and (2) the debtor\u2019s success at concealing the true character of her lawsuit from the bankruptcy court resulted in a bankruptcy court ordered discharge of all her debts. The bankruptcy court never entered any order discharging any of Strauss\u2019s debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Reni&gt;-A-Center is reversed and the action is remanded to the district court. We need not address Strauss\u2019s appeal of the denial of her Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
