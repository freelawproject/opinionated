Cardine contends the district court erred by banning him from all equestrian-related employment when his conviction stemmed only from the fraudulent sale of horses. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">District courts have broad latitude in imposing special conditions of supervised release, and we review a district court\u2019s imposition of a special condition for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Dotson, </em>324 F.3d 256, 259-60 (4th Cir.2003). A condition may be imposed prohibiting a defendant from engaging in a specified occupation, business, or profession bearing a reasonably direct relationship to the conduct relevant to the offense of conviction. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3563(b)(5) (2000); 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(d) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006); <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 5F1.5(a)(1) (1998). The restriction must be \u201creasonably necessary to protect the public because there is reason to believe that, absent such restriction, the defendant will continue to engage in unlawful conduct similar to that for which the defendant was convicted.\u201d USSG \u00a7 5F1.5(a)(2). The condition shall be imposed for the minimum time and to the minimum extent necessary to protect the public. USSG \u00a7 5F1.5(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by imposing the special condition of supervised release prohibiting Cardine from employment in the equestrian industry. Cardine pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit fraud and swindle of livestock in interstate commerce in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (2000). Cardine\u2019s employment in the equestrian industry allowed him to accomplish his crime and thus bore a reasonably direct relationship to the offense of conviction. The district court considered but rejected Cardine\u2019s assertion that a complete ban from the industry was not reasonably necessary to protect the public from conduct similar to that for which he was convicted. We have reviewed the record and conclude the district court did not err or abuse its discretion in this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order modifying Cardine\u2019s criminal judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
