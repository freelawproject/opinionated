Because the district court properly classified Williams as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-22\">Williams was indicted for two counts of possession with intent to distribute in excess of five grams of crack. Pursuant to a written plea agreement, he pleaded guilty to one count, in exchange for which the second count was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-23\">The probation officer calculated the offense level as 34 in light of Williams\u2019s status as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, with a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, resulting in a total offense level of 31. In support of the career-offender classification, the probation officer noted two prior felony convictions for controlled substance offenses. Based on Williams\u2019s criminal history and his status as a career offender, he received a criminal history category of VI. The resulting advisory guidelines range was 188 to 235 months imprisonment. Had Williams not been classified as a career offender, his adjusted offense level would have been 25, with the same criminal history category, resulting in a range of 110 to 137 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-24\">Williams objected, inter alia, to the application of the career-offender provision because the prior convictions were neither charged in the indictment nor proven to a jury. He conceded, however, that this court\u2019s case law did not support his argument. At sentencing, the court overruled the objection and sentenced Williams to 188 months imprisonment. Williams now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>We review constitutional sentencing issues de novo. <em>United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005). The district court\u2019s classification of a defendant as a career offender is a question of law that we also review de novo. <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1243 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2911, 165 L.Ed.2d 931 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court held that prior convictions need not be proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. We are bound by that decision. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>434 F.3d 1318, 1323 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2946, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2006). And we have repeatedly held that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains good law. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-11\">Moreover, in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) , and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) , the Supreme Court reaffirmed its holding that prior convictions need not be proven to a jury, and nothing in <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), alters this conclusion. <em>United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1316 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005). Therefore, we reject Williams\u2019s argument. <em>See Martinez, </em>434 F.3d at 1323; <em>Gibson, </em>434 F.3d at 1244. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
