Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005). At resentencing, the district court rejected Lynch\u2019s request for a jury trial on those facts that increased his offense level. The district court considered <em>Booker, Hughes </em>and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000) factors and sentenced Lynch to the same sentence imposed under the mandatory guidelines scheme. On appeal, Lynch contends: (1) he should have been given a jury trial to determine the factual issues; (2) the court\u2019s factual findings were clearly erroneous; and (3) the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to hold that the Sentencing Guidelines are now advisory is unconstitutional. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-22\">At the original sentencing, the district court held a hearing and listened to witness testimony prior to determining the facts that increased Lynch\u2019s offense level. On appeal, we found there was no error. After the subsequent remand, there was no authority for the court to convene a jury trial in order to determine the factual findings. <em>See Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-23\">Because we found no error with respect to the district court\u2019s factual findings, we will not revisit the issue in this appeal as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>is the law of the case. <em>United States v. Aramony, </em>166 F.3d 655, 661 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Finally, Lynch\u2019s argument that it is unconstitutional for the guidelines to be advisory is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s amended judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
