Relying on our decision in <em>Wachovia Bank v. Schmidt, </em>388 F.3d 414 (4th Cir.2004), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 941, 163 L.Ed.2d 797 (2006), Wachovia moved to dismiss for lack of diversity jurisdiction. The district court granted the motion. We vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-25\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Evans v. B.F. Perkins Co., </em>166 F.3d 642, 647 (4th Cir.1999). The district court should grant the Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss \u201conly if the material jurisdictional facts are not in dispute and the moving party is entitled to prevail as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Evans, </em>166 F.3d at 647 (quoting <em>Richmond, Fredericksburg &amp; Potomac R. Co. v. United States, </em>945 F.2d 765, 768 (4th Cir.1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-26\">In <em>Schmidt, </em>we held that national banks are \u201clocated\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1348 (2000), in every state in which they operate a branch office. 388 F.3d at 432. The district court relied on our decision to find that because Wachovia has branch offices in Virginia and Halifax is a citizen of Virginia, diversity jurisdiction did not exist under \u00a7 1348. While this case was pending on direct review, the Supreme Court re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>versed this court\u2019s judgment in <em>Schmidt, </em>resolving a circuit split and holding that for the purposes of diversity jurisdiction, a bank is \u201clocated\u201d in the state designated in its articles of association as its main office under \u00a7 1348. <em>Schmidt, </em>126 S.Ct. at 952.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">\u201cWhen [the Supreme Court] applies a rule of federal law to the parties before it, that rule is the controlling interpretation of federal law and must be given full retroactive effect in all cases still open on direct review and as to all events, regardless of whether such events predate or postdate our announcement of the rule.\u201d <em>Harper v. Virginia Dep\u2019t of Taxation, </em>509 U.S. 86, 97, 113 S.Ct. 2510, 125 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993). We find that because this case was pending on direct review at the time of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Schmidt, </em>it applies to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Because the parties are citizens of different states, and the amount in controversy exceeds the $75,000 threshold set forth in \u00a7 1332, the requirements for jurisdiction have been satisfied. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
