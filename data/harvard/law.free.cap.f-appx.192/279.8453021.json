Under \u00a7 1915A(b)(l), a district court is to review a prisoner\u2019s complaint and to dismiss the complaint if it \u201cis frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\u201d \u00a7 1915A(b)(l). This court reviews dismissals under \u00a7 1915A <em>de novo. See Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-20\">Hirsch argues that Physician Assistant Fortner, Dr. Love, Warden Blevins, Dr. Stovo, Dr. Reimer, and Dr. Murray were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs. Hirsch has failed to demonstrate that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to a serious medical need. <em>See Domino v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>239 F.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir.2001). To the extent that Hirsch sued Dr. Love, Warden Blevins, Dr. Stovo, Dr. Reimer, and Dr. Murray in their supervisory capacities, Hirsch has not shown the defendants\u2019 personal involvement in a constitutional deprivation. <em>See Thompkins v. Belt, </em>828 F.2d 298, 303-04 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-21\">Hirsch argues that the magistrate judge prevented him from filing an amended complaint. A Spears<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> hearing is \u201cin the nature of an amended complaint or a more definite statement.\u201d <em>Adams v. Hansen, </em>906 F.2d 192, 194 (5th Cir.1990). At the <em>Spears </em>hearing, the magistrate judge allowed Hirsch to amend his complaint orally, which he did, adding three defendants. Hirsch does not suggest that he attempted to file an amended complaint after the hearing. Hirsch also argues that the magistrate judge should have appointed a medical expert prior to dismissing his claims, but Hirsch has not demonstrated that expert testimony was warranted prior to the dismissal as frivolous under \u00a7 1915A.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-22\">Hirsch does not challenge the district court\u2019s order, stayed pending appeal, severing and transferring his claims against Dr. Grezula. By failing to address the district court\u2019s order severing and transferring his claims against Dr. Grezula, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Hirsch has abandoned the issue for purposes of appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>see also Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of the magistrate judge is AFFIRMED. Any other requested relief is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b303-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b303-23\"><em> Spears v. McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
