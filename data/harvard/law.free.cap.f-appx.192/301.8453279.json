The 51-month sentence included an upward departure from Criminal History Category VI pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">King argues that the district court reversibly erred in departing upwardly by two offense levels under \u00a7 4A1.3. He contends that, because most of his prior convictions were for misdemeanors, the district court erred by concluding that he had an egregious, serious criminal history warranting an upward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">Although King\u2019s extensive criminal record included some relatively minor offenses, he also had convictions for unauthorized use of vehicles and for possession of codeine. This court has stated that \u201cdrug crimes, and theft ... pose an obvious danger to society.\u201d <em>United States v. Lee, </em>358 F.3d 315, 329 (5th Cir.2004). In view of the extent and nature of King\u2019s criminal history, the district court did not abuse its discretion in departing upwardly. <em>See id.; </em>\u00a7 4A1.3(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-14\">King also contends that the district court erred by failing to consider the intermediate offense level on the sentencing table and by failing to explain why the intermediate level was inadequate. In only a \u201cvery narrow class of cases\u201d will \u201cthe district court\u2019s departure be so great that, in order to survive our review, it will need to explain in careful detail why lesser adjustments\u201d are inadequate. <em>United States v. Lambert, </em>984 F.2d 658, 663 (5th Cir.1993) (en banc). The district court\u2019s implicit explanation for rejecting the intermediate offense level is sufficient in this case. <em>See id.; see also United States v. Ashbum, </em>38 F.3d 803, 809-10 (5th Cir.1994)(en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b326-11\"> Pursuant <em>to </em>5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
