We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-21\">Lianas contends, for the first time on appeal, that his sentence should be vacated because the district court did not articulate any of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) to the facts of his case, thus failing to exercise or to show that the court exercised its discretion. The plain-error standard of review is applicable. <em>See United States v. Izaguirre-Losoya, </em>219 F.3d 437, 440-42 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-22\">Under the discretionary sentencing scheme established by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), district courts retain the duty to consider the Sentencing Guidelines along with the sentencing factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). Lianas\u2019s sentence is within the guideline range and is presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 553-55 (5th Cir.2006). We infer in our reasonableness review that the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including Lianas\u2019s history and characteristics, in imposing sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>tence. <em>See Alomo, </em>435 F.3d at 554. Consequently, Llanas is not entitled to relief on grounds of plain error. <em>See Izaguirre-Losoya, </em>219 F.3d at 440-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b304-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
