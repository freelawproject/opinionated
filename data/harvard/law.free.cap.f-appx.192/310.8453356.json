He argues that the BIA should have reopened his 1999 removal proceedings because although the immigration judge in the 1999 proceedings found his theft conviction rendered him statutorily ineligible for a waiver of removal, the subsequent decision of <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001), clarified that he was eligible for such relief under former Immigration and Nationality Act \u00a7 212(c), former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c). Specifically, he argues that the 1999 removal proceedings violated his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">Alvarado-Molina\u2019s due process claim, which we review de novo, is without merit. <em>See Ogbemudia v. INS, </em>988 F.2d 595, 598 (5th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Lopez-Ortiz, </em>313 F.3d 225, 230-31 (5th Cir.2002). Alvarado-Molina has not otherwise shown that the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen was an abuse of discretion. <em>See Lara v. Trominski, </em>216 F.3d 487, 496 (5th Cir.2000); <em>see also Navarro-Miranda v. Ashcroft, </em>330 F.3d 672, 674-76 (5th Cir.2003). The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b335-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
