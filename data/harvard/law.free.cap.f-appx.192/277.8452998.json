Sifuentes contends that he should have been granted the continuance so that he could challenge the 2003 alien-smuggling conviction that rendered him removable.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Article III, \u00a7 2, of the Constitution limits federal court jurisdiction to actual cases and controversies. <em>See Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998). The case-or-controversy requirement demands that \u201csome concrete and continuing injury other than the now-ended incarceration or parole \u2014 some \u2018collateral consequence\u2019 of the conviction \u2014 must exist if the suit is to be maintained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Tobias has served the sentence that was imposed pursuant to the district court\u2019s finding of contempt. Accordingly, there is no case or controversy for this court to address. The appeal and Tobias\u2019s various motions are rendered moot. <em>See Spencer, </em>523 U.S. at 7, 118 S.Ct. 978. Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED. Tobias\u2019s motion to proceed as a sanctioned litigant is DENIED. All other outstanding motions are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>This court reviews the denial of a continuance for abuse of discretion. <em>Witter v. INS, </em>113 F.3d 549, 555-56 (5th Cir.1997). An IJ may grant a continuance upon a showing of good cause. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Sifuentes cites to two BIA decisions having nothing to do with the granting of a continuance, and he makes no argument directly relevant to the \u201cgood cause\u201d that must be shown in order to obtain a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Sifuentes fails to show that the denial of a continuance was an abuse of discretion. His petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b301-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
