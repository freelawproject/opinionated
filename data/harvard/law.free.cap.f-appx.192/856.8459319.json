After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b881-10\">Prior to this case, Perez-Colona, a native and citizen of Mexico, was convicted in 1994 in a Georgia state court of cocaine trafficking and sentenced to a 15-year term of imprisonment. In 1997, PerezColona was transferred to federal custody for deportation proceedings and was subsequently deported to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-11\">In 2001, Perez-Colona illegally re-entered the United States. On July 1, 2005, Perez-Colona was arrested by local law enforcement for loitering. In an interview with the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Perez-Colona admitted that he had illegally re-entered the United States after having been deported.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-12\">A federal grand jury indicted Perezs Colona of one count of being an alien found unlawfully in the United States after having been previously deported, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2). PerezColona pled guilty to the indictment without the benefit of a plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-15\">The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) set Perezr-Colona\u2019s base offense level at 8. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a). The PSI recommended that Perez-Colona\u2019s offense level be increased sixteen levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i), due to his deportation after a felony drug trafficking conviction for which the sentence exceeded 13 months. The PSI also recommended a three-level decrease in PerezColona\u2019s offense level for timely acceptance of responsibility. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a), (b). Based on Perez-Colona\u2019s 1994 drug conviction and the fact that Perez-Colona committed the instant offense while on probation, the PSI recommended a criminal history category of III, resulting in an advisory guidelines range of 46 to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-16\">In his written objections, Perez-Colona did not dispute the existence of his prior felony drug conviction; nor did he dispute the factual accuracy of the PSI. Instead, Perez-Colona objected to the 16-level enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i), and to the use of his prior felony drug conviction to increase his criminal history category based on <em>Blakely v. </em>Washington, 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Perez-Colona also objected to the failure to grant him a 4-level reduction in order to avoid an unwarranted sentencing disparity created by the existence of \u201cfast-track programs\u201d in other judicial districts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>At the sentencing hearing, Perez-Colona renewed his <em>Blakely </em>objections to the 16-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) and to the increase in his criminal history category, but conceded that this Circuit had \u201cruled very clearly against us\u201d and that his objections were being renewed to preserve them for appeal. Perez-Colona also argued that the district court should grant him a 4-level reduction, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), because other similarly situated defendants in judicial districts with fast-track programs were receiving 4-level reductions.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">The district court overruled Perez-Colona\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>objections to the PSI\u2019s use of his prior felony drug conviction. The district court also refused to give a 4-level variance from the advisory guidelines range based on disparities in sentences caused by fast-track programs in other districts. The district court concluded that a reasonable sentence would not fall outside the guidelines range. The district court imposed a 46-month sentence, at the low end of the advisory guidelines range of 46 to 57 months. In so doing, the district court noted that economic factors motivated Perez-Colona\u2019s decision to illegally reenter the United States and that PerezColona was not engaged in any criminal wrongdoing when taken into custody. Perez-Colona filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A-f\">A. Prior Felony Drug Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">On appeal, Perez-Colona argues that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated when the district court used his prior felony drug conviction to calculate his guidelines range. As Perez-Colona acknowledges, even after <em>Blakely </em>and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), this Circuit remains bound by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), in which the Supreme Court held that the fact of a prior conviction does not need to be alleged in an indictment nor proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1275-76 (11th Cir.2006) (reversing the district court\u2019s ruling that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was no. longer good law following <em>Booker); United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1246 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2911, 165 L.Ed.2d 931 (2006) (explaining that \u201c[i]t is not given to us to overrule the decisions of the Supreme Court,\u201d and adhering to <em>Almendarez-Torres ). </em>In addition, Perez-Colona did not deny the factual existence of his prior felony drug conviction, but rather raised only a <em>Blakely, </em>now <em>Booker, </em>claim, which we reject. <em>See United States v. Burge, </em>407 F.3d 1183, 1191 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 551, 163 L.Ed.2d 467 (2005) (concluding that there was no <em>Booker </em>error when the defendant did not dispute the fact of his prior conviction). Thus, the district court did not err in using Perez \u2014 Colona\u2019s prior felony drug conviction to enhance his guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-12\">B. Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b882-13\">We review sentences imposed under the <em>post-Booker </em>advisory guidelines scheme for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244 (11th Cir.2005). After <em>Booker, </em>the district court must first correctly calculate the defendant\u2019s advisory guideline range, and then, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>using the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, the court can impose a more severe or more lenient sentence as long as it is reasonable. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1179 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Perez-Colona argues that his sentence is unreasonable because of the disparity between his sentence and the sentences of similarly situated defendants in judicial districts with \u201cfast-track\u201d programs. Perez-Colona emphasizes that \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities\u201d is one of the factors in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). This Court recently rejected this argument in <em>United States v. Anaya Castro, </em>455 F.3d 1249 (11th Cir. 2006). In <em>Anaya Castro, </em>we concluded that \u201c[a]ny disparity created by section 5K3.1 does not fall within the scope of section 3553(a)(6)\u201d because, when Congress directed the Sentencing Commission to promulgate a fast-track departure, it \u201cimplicitly determined that the disparity was warranted.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">Nor can we say on this record that Perez-Colona\u2019s 46-month sentence is unreasonable. Perez-Colona\u2019s sentence was at the low end of the advisory guidelines range of 46 to 57 months and well below the statutory maximum of twenty years. In addition, the district court\u2019s comments during the sentencing hearing reflect consideration of several \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the nature and circumstances of the offense and the characteristics of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">We affirm Perez-Colona\u2019s 46-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b881-13\">. Early disposition or \"fast-track\u201d programs have been established in some districts to help ease congestion by the large number of immigration cases. <em>See United States v. Melendez-Torres, </em>420 F.3d 45, 52 (1st Cir.2005). Pursuant to a provision of the recent PROTECT Act, the Sentencing Commission promulgated U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K3.1, which allows the district court, upon the government\u2019s motion, to depart downward not more than 4 levels \"pursuant to an early disposition program authorized by the Attorney General of the United States and the United States Attorney for the district in which the court resides.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>The Northern District of Georgia does not have an early disposition program as described in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K3.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
