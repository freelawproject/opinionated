The land at issue is part of a recently built housing subdivision. The subdivision was built on land adjacent to property owned by the appellant, Mabel Johnson. Johnson claims she has adversely possessed the strip of land adjacent to her property, on which part of the housing subdivision now sits. The district court rejected Johnson\u2019s claim of adverse possession and entered summary judgment for the appellees. Reviewing the summary judgment <em>de novo </em>and applying the same standards as the district court, we affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-18\">The district court rejected Johnson\u2019s claim of adverse possession because the land at issue had been sold for delinquent taxes in 1988. The district court properly concluded that under Mississippi law, the tax sale extinguished any claim of adverse possession.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On appeal, Johnson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>argues that she paid taxes on the land at issue, and therefore it could not have been included in the tax sale. The only evidence in support of Johnson\u2019s argument is an aerial photograph and a statement by the county tax collector regarding that photograph.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That evidence was excluded by the district court,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion by excluding the evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Johnson also argues that the record owners of the property attempted to confirm the tax title without giving her notice, even though they constructively knew she occupied the land, and therefore the order confirming the tax title is void. This argument does not aid Johnson\u2019s adverse possession claim. Assuming the proceeding to confirm the tax title is void, the remedy would be a new proceeding to confirm the title, in which Johnson would participate<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and could assert the invalidity of the tax title.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Yet Johnson has participated in this proceeding. Her claim against the invalidity of the tax sale has been rejected, her claim of adverse possession has been rejected and the overlap between her deed and the appellee\u2019s deed has been resolved in her favor. Accordingly, there is no need for a new proceeding and her argument is of no avail.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-15\">Finally, Johnson argues that even if the land was validly sold for delinquent taxes in 1988, she has since established ownership by adverse possession. This argument lacks merit. The ten-year limitations period for adverse possession<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> is interrupted if a suit is filed \u201c \u2018before the expiration of the ten-year period\u2019 \u201d or if there is \u201c \u2018a physical interruption of the adverse possession, or some unequivocal asserting of the claimant\u2019s rights, which would enable the person in possession to institute legal proceedings in trespass or otherwise to prevent acts of ownership.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> An \u201cunequivocal assertion of the claimant\u2019s rights\u201d was made before the limitations period expired. In 1997, Johnson sought a temporary restraining order and an injunction against the appellees\u2019 \u201cland development operations\u201d on her property. In response, the appellees claimed ownership of the land at issue, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>including all land covered by their deed. This assertion of ownership was sufficient to toll the limitations period, which had not reached ten years. Johnson\u2019s claim of adverse possession was properly rejected. For these reasons, the district court\u2019s summary judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b312-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
