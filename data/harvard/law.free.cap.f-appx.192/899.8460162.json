(\u201cLan\u201d) and the district court\u2019s grant of Lan\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-22\">We review a district court\u2019s order denying a motion for leave to amend the complaint under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>Spanish Broad. Sys. of Fla., Inc. v. Clear Channel Commc\u2019ns, </em>376 F.3d 1065, 1077 (11th Cir.2004). We review an order granting summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same legal standards that bound the district court and viewing all facts and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>See Strickland v. Water Works and Sewer Bd. of the City of Birmingham, </em>239 F.3d 1199, 1203 (11th Cir.2001). Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthere is no genuine issue of material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-23\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Horamar\u2019s untimely motion for leave to amend its amended complaint. Horamar was aware, as early as May 21, 2004, that the Warsaw Convention governed and preempted its state law negligence claim against Lan. However, the record demonstrates that Horamar did not file its motion for leave to amend its amended complaint to add a claim under the Warsaw Convention against Lan until April 4, 2005, which was more than eight months past the pleadings amendment deadline of July 23, 2004, less than two months before the scheduled trial, and six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>months after Lan filed its motion for summary judgment, asserting, among other things, Warsaw Convention\u2019s preemption of Horamar\u2019s state law negligence claim. Consequently, we agree with Lan that Horamar failed to meet the \u201cgood cause\u201d standard of Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(b), and the district court was not required to address the merits of Horamar\u2019s motion under the liberal standards of Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a). <em>See Sosa v. Airprint Sys., Inc., </em>133 F.3d 1417, 1418 (11th Cir.1998). Moreover, we affirm the district court\u2019s order granting Lan\u2019s motion for summary judgment for the reasons set forth in its well-reasoned order filed on October 4, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
