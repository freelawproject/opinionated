Price was also convicted of possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The district court sentenced Billingsley to 324 months\u2019 imprisonment and Price to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment. Both men filed timely appeals. For the reasons below we affirm their convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">Billingsley challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a mistrial based on the Government\u2019s failure to disclose an inculpatory statement made by Billingsley to a detective involved in the case, which Billingsley\u2019s counsel elicited fi'om the detective on cross-examination. We review the denial of a motion for a mistrial for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Dorsey, </em>45 F.3d 809, 817 (4th Cir.1995). Pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(A), the Government must \u201cdisclose to the defendant the substance of any relevant oral statement made by the defendant ... in response to interrogation by a person the defendant knew was a government agent if the government intends to use the statement at trial.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(d)(2) provides several remedies if a party fails to comply with disclosure requirements, including permitting the court to \u201center any ... order that is just under the circumstances.\u201d The district court denied Billingsley\u2019s motion for a mistrial, but offered to give the jury instructions to disregard the statement, which Billingsley\u2019s counsel refused for fear that such instructions would draw additional attention to the statement. We hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for mistrial and offering instead to provide a limiting instruction to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-13\">Billingsley next appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence that he asserts was seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Specifically, Billingsley claims that the officers lacked reasonable suspicion to stop his car and this unlawful stop tainted Billingsley\u2019s consent to search the car. Billingsley also argues that the officer lacked probable cause to arrest him since the cocaine found in the car appeared after Billingsley exited the vehicle. On appeal, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Perkins, </em>363 F.3d 317, 320 (4th Cir.2004). \u2018When an officer observes a traffic offense or other unlawful conduct, he or she is justified in stopping the vehicle under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>United States v. Hassan El, </em>5 F.3d 726, 730 (4th Cir.1993). The officer who stopped Billingsley\u2019s vehicle had a sufficient basis to support his action after observing the vehicle stopped in the roadway in violation of Virginia law. This traffic infraction provided the officer with the basis to request that Billingsley step outside of the car. <em>See Pennsylvania v. Mimms, </em>434 U.S. 106, 111 n. 6, 98 S.Ct. 330, 54 L.Ed.2d 331 (1977) (\u201cOnce a motor vehicle has been lawfully detained for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>traffic violation, the police officers may order the driver to get out of the vehicle without violating the Fourth Amendment\u2019s proscription of unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d). Furthermore, the officer had sufficient probable cause to arrest Billingsley based on the $500 in cash that he found on Billingsley\u2019s person and the bag of cocaine that he found in the front seat of the car after Billingsley consented to both searches. Even if the cocaine was first noticed by the officer after Billingsley exited the vehicle, it is reasonable to infer that all of the occupants of the car \u201chad knowledge of, and exercised domain and control over, the cocaine.\u201d <em>Maryland v. Pringle, </em>540 U.S. 366, 372, 124 S.Ct. 795, 157 L.Ed.2d 769 (2003) (finding sufficient probable cause to arrest a front seat passenger in a car when a search of the vehicle yielded $793 in rolled-up cash in the glove box and \u201cfive plastic glassine baggies of cocaine ... behind the back-seat armrest and accessible to all three men\u201d). We hold that the district court did not err in denying Billingsley\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Price appeals the district court\u2019s decision to admit evidence under Fed. R.Evid. 404(b) that he had a large amount of cash on his person when he was remanded to jail after sentencing in a state court matter. We review the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Weaver, </em>282 F.3d 302, 313 (4th Cir.2002). We need not reach the merits of Price\u2019s claim, however, because the admission was harmless. <em>See Id. </em>(noting that \u201c[ejvidentiary rulings are subject to review for harmless error\u201d); <em>see id. </em>at 313-14 (finding the evidence to be harmless \u201cin light of the overwhelming evidence against the defendant\u201d). In the present case, the evidence pointing to Price\u2019s involvement in the drug conspiracy is overwhelming: multiple witnesses testified that they purchased crack cocaine from Price, Price was arrested in an area known for drug activity, the officer who searched Price incident to the arrest found in his pockets cash and two bags that the defense stipulated contained powdered cocaine and crack cocaine, and two drug distributors testified that they engaged in either crack cocaine transactions with Price. Because there is overwhelming evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty, we find that the admission of the evidence was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Billingsley and Price also challenge their sentences, asserting that the district court did not adequately consider the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), as required by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Although the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker </em>rendered the sentencing guidelines advisory, the sentencing court must still consider the properly calculated guideline range in addition to the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345 (4th Cir.2006). We review sentences under the advisory guidelines for reasonableness, and sentences that fall within the guideline range are presumed to be reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 341. Billingsley and Price claim that their sentences are unreasonable because the district court\u2019s \u201canalysis lack[ed] any meaningful consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d Brief of the Appellants at 10. The district court, however, does not need to \u201cexplicitly discuss every \u00a7 3553(a) factor on the record .... particularly ... when the district court imposes a sentence within the applicable guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations and citations omitted). Because the district court properly used the preponderance of the evidence standard to assess the drug quantity attributable to the defendants, properly calculated the guideline range, treated the guidelines as advisory, considered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>defendant\u2019s arguments, and sentenced the defendants within the guidelines range, we conclude that the defendants\u2019 sentences are reasonable. Therefore, we affirm the defendants\u2019 sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the convictions and sentences of Billingsley and Price. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the Court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
