Hoss argues that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court did not consider the necessary sentencing factors. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">Hoss was indicted and convicted on three counts: (1) using a means of interstate commerce to entice a minor to engage in sexual activity, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b); (2) crossing state lines with the intent to engage in sexual activity with a child under the age of 12, <em>id. </em>2241(c); (3) knowingly receiving and attempting to receive child pornography, <em>id. </em>2252. After the district court sustained Hoss\u2019s objection to the grouping of counts in the presentence investigation report, the advisory guidelines range for Hoss\u2019s sentence was 210 to 262 months of imprisonment. At the sentencing hearing, members of Hoss\u2019s family, Hoss\u2019s attorney, and Hoss spoke on his behalf. The district court thanked members of Hoss\u2019s family and described the statement of Hoss\u2019s sister as \u201cintelligent and thoughtful.\u201d The district court sentenced Hoss to 262 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-12\">We review a sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785 (11th Cir.2005). Our \u201c[r]eview for reasonableness is deferential.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 788. Hoss bears the burden of establishing that his sentence is unreasonable in the light of the record and the sentencing factors in section 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>\u201c[O]rdinarily we would expect a sentence within the guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b892-13\">Hoss raises two arguments on appeal. First, he argues that the district court did not consider statements made at the sentencing hearing in Hoss\u2019s defense by his family, his attorney, and Hoss himself. This argument fails because the district court need not discuss individually each sentencing factor as long as the district court acknowledges that it considered the arguments of the defendant and the factors listed in section 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>at 786; <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). The district court stated specifically that it considered the section 3553(a) factors and the district court permitted Hoss, his family, and his attorney to speak. Nothing in the record that suggests the district court did not consider the statements it heard immediately before it sentenced Hoss.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-14\">Second, Hoss argues that the district court did not give sufficient weight Hoss\u2019s background, his military service, his lack of a criminal history, and the support of his family. These factors are all part of the \u201cnature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>The district court stated that it considered the section 3558(a) factors, which included the factors listed by Hoss. Nothing in the record suggests the district court did not consider all the factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">The sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
