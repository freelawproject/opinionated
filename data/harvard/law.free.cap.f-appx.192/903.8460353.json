U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir.2003). We do have jurisdiction to hear Guerrero-Bermudez\u2019s claims on appeal because they are constitutional or present a question of law. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), (D) (removing our jurisdiction to review a final removal order against an alien convicted of certain criminal offenses unless the petitioner raises a constitutional question or a question of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">In this case, we review the decisions of the IJ and the BIA. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001) (noting that we review the BIA\u2019s decision; but \u201c[ijnsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well\u201d). In addition, we review the denial of \u00a7 212(c) relief for abuse of discretion. <em>Ramsey v. INS, </em>55 F.3d 580, 582 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">Guerrero-Bermudez raises three constitutional claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> First, he argues that the IJ\u2019s conclusion that he was ineligible for a discretionary \u00a7 212(c) waiver because he had received such relief previously was erroneous and deprived him of substantive due process. \u201cThe analysis of any claim to a substantive due process right should begin with \u2018a careful description of the asserted fundamental liberty interest.\u2019\u201d <em>Tinker v. Beasley, </em>429 F.3d 1324, 1327 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Washington v. Glucksberg, </em>521 U.S. 702, 117 S.Ct. 2258, 2268, 138 L.Ed.2d 772 (1997)). We have concluded \u201cthat the failure to receive discretionary relief in the immigration context does not deprive an alien of a constitutionally protected liberty interest.\u201d <em>Tefel v. Reno, </em>180 F.3d 1286, 1300 (11th Cir.1999). Because \u201can alien has no constitutionally-protected right to discretionary relief or to be eligible for discretionary relief,\u201d and because the IJ denied Guerrero-Bermudez a \u00a7 212(c) waiver as a matter of discretion, his due process claim fails. <em>Oguejiofor v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>277 F.3d 1305, 1309 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">Guerrero-Bermudez next argues that the IJ\u2019s decision denying him a \u00a7 212(c) waiver violated his right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Again, the IJ\u2019s decision denying Guerrero-Bermudez a \u00a7 212(c) waiver was discretionary; and we discern no equal protection violation in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-11\">Finally, Guerrero-Bermudez argues that the IJ committed a double jeopardy violation in not dismissing violations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>of the law listed in this notice to appear because these violations already had been adjudicated. Because we have concluded that \u201cthe double jeopardy clause applies only to proceedings that are essentially criminal and deportation is purely civil,\u201d we reject Guerrero-Bermudez\u2019s double jeopardy claim. <em>Cadet v. Bulger, </em>377 F.3d 1173, 1196 (11th Cir.2004) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b928-21\">. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\"IIRIRA\u201d) repealed \u00a7 212(c), which provided that \"[alliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation, and who are returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years, may be admitted in the <em>discretion </em>of the Attorney General ....\u201d (emphasis added). <em>See Savoury v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>449 F.3d 1307, 1312 (11th Cir.2006) (discussing repeal of \u00a7 212(c)). The Supreme Court has explained, however, that provisions of the IIRIRA that repealed discretionary relief from deportation under \u00a7 212(c) do not apply retroactively to aliens, such as Guerrero-Bermudez, who entered into a plea agreement before amendment of \u00a7 212(c) and who would have been eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief when entering into their plea. <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 2291-93, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b929-7\">. To the extent that Guerrero-Bermudez also asserts that the BIA erred as a matter of law in adopting the IJ\u2019s decision denying him a \u00a7 212(c) waiver, we reject this argument because the IJ acted within his discretion. In reviewing Guerrero-Bermudez\u2019s application for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver, the IJ considered several factors, including Guerrero-Bermudez\u2019s evasive testimony, that he committed additional crimes after previously receiving a \u00a7 212(c) waiver, the time he spent in the United States, his family ties to the United States, his work history, and his lack of recent criminal history. <em>See Coboume v. INS, </em>779 F.2d 1564, 1567 (11th Cir.1986) (concluding that, in reviewing an application for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver, the IJ properly balanced \u201cadverse factors including [petitioner\u2019s] criminal record and lack of evidence of rehabilitation against the favorable factors including his family ties\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b929-13\">. The Fourteenth Amendment does not apply to this federal-action case. But \"we assume [Guerrero-Bermudez is] seeking relief under the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment's due process clause, which provides protection coterminous with that of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s equal protection clause.\u201d <em>Rodriguez-Padron v. INS, </em>13 F.3d 1455, 1458 n. 7 (11th Cir.1994) (citing <em>Johnson v. Robison, </em>415 U.S. 361, 94 S.Ct. 1160, 1164 n. 4, 39 L.Ed.2d 389 (1974)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
