No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-21\">Jose argues that his sentence was unreasonable under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He contends that, in determining his sentence, the district court should have considered the small role he played in the offense, his lack of prior criminal history, and his family background. Jose also asserts that the district court did not make sufficient factual findings to support its decision to sentence him above the Guideline imprisonment range of 60-71 months.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b930-22\">Jose was sentenced after the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Booker; </em>so we review his sentence for reasonableness in the light of the factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244-46 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-23\">We conclude that Jose\u2019s sentence was reasonable. His 80-month sentence was well below the 40-year statutory maximum. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). In addition, in sentencing Jose, the district court recognized that the Sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>Guidelines were advisory and noted the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, commenting in particular on Jose\u2019s family situation and the destructive nature of methamphetamine use. The court also considered that Jose had been selling methamphetamine since 2000. The district court properly fulfilled its role in considering the Guidelines; but the court concluded that Jose\u2019s Guideline range was inadequate to accomplish the statutory goals set out in \u00a7 3553(a). Nothing in the record convinces us that Jose\u2019s sentence was unreasonable in the light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b930-16\">. Jose acknowledges that the district court properly calculated his Guideline imprisonment range.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b930-17\">. Jose's plea agreement contained two sentence appeal waiver provisions. First, the agreement stated that Jose waived \u201chis right to appeal his conviction and sentence ... so long as that sentence is within the advisory guideline range, as that range is determined by the Court.\u201d Second, the agreement provided that Jose waived his right to appeal \"any sentence or restitution the court might impose upon me except for a sentence that exceeds the statutory maximum,\u201d which is subject to the limitation of \"[ajny punishment that constitutes an upward departure from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>the advisory guideline range, as that range is determined by the court at the time sentence is imposed.\u201d Both Jose and the government agree that the instant appeal may proceed because the district court sentenced Jose to 80 months\u2019 imprisonment after applying an upward departure. Although the district court stated, after sentencing Jose, that it \"did not depart from the Guidelines,\u201d but \"took them as advisory and then determined what a reasonable sentence was,\u201d we will address the merits of Jose\u2019s appeal because the government does not argue that dismissal is warranted as a result of the appeal waiver in Jose\u2019s plea agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
