We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the magistrate judge and the district court. <em>Wagner v. Charleston County Jail, </em>No. 3:05-cv-01435-GRA (D.S.C. filed Jan. 9, 2006 &amp; entered Jan. 10, 2006; filed Feb. 2, 2006 &amp; entered Feb. 3, 2006). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
