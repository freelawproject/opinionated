Fitch appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to defendant-appellee Reliant Pharmaceuticals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-17\">Texas is an employment-at-will state.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Texas Supreme Court carved a \u201cnarrow\u201d exception to the employment-at-will doctrine in <em>Sabine Pilot v. Hauck. </em>There, the Texas Supreme Court held that a terminated employee can recover damages against the former employer if the terminated employee can show that the \u201csole cause\u201d of her termination was her refusal to perform an illegal act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, \u201cAn employer who discharges an employee both for refusing to perform an illegal act and for a legitimate reason or reasons cannot be liable for wrongful discharge.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-18\">Fitch claims she was terminated for refusal to violate the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (\u201cPDMA\u201d). Assuming without deciding that Fitch was asked to violate the PDMA, she has failed to create a fact issue on whether such refusal was the \u201csole\u201d cause of her termination. Reliant submitted the affidavit of Doug Tate, one of Fitch\u2019s supervisors at Reliant. Tate averred that an internal audit revealed inconsistencies in Fitch\u2019s call reports, that he received complaints from doctors that Fitch failed to show up for scheduled appointments, that doctors refused to schedule appointments with Fitch, and that Fitch submitted inconsistent expense reports. Fitch\u2019s responded by pointing to deposition testimony in which she testified that she could not recall whether she had missed any appointments. These equivo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>cal statements are insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact sufficient to survive summary judgment. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b327-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
