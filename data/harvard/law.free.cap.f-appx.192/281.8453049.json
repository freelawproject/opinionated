Appellant also claims injuries resulting from intentional infliction of emotional distress under Texas law. Appellee filed an answer, denying all charges, and after conducting discovery on Appellant\u2019s claims, Appellee moved for summary judgment on each of the causes of action asserted by Appellant. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Appellee as to all claims asserted under Title VII, finding that Appellant failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation and failed to produce evidence showing that Appellee\u2019s non-discriminatory basis for terminating his employment was a pretext for unlawful retaliation. The district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Appellant\u2019s state law claims. Appellant timely appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-18\">We have carefully reviewed the briefs, the record excerpts, and relevant portions of the record. We affirm the judgment of the district court granting summary judgment in favor of Appellee on all of Appellant\u2019s Title VII claims and dismissing without prejudice Appellant\u2019s state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b305-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
