The plaintiff sues for the balance which it claims is due.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-14\">The yacht was built in 1934 by the Craig Shipbuilding Company. The approximate cost was $120,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-15\">Plaintiff purchased the yacht from the original owner in 19\u00cd38 at a cost of $60,000. It added by way of improvements, equipment and replacements items totaling $8,-452.65; thus the toal cost to plaintiff was $68,452,65.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-16\">While there was a market for vessels of this type prior to Pearl Harbor, the restrictions which the Government placed on the use of waters after December 7, 1941, were such that there were practically no commercial sales after that time and therefore no well-established market.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-17\">In arriving at the fair and-reasonable value of the Geoanna on February 1, 1942, we must take into consideration the conditions that prevailed and the intrinsic value of the vessel. Illinois Pure Aluminum Co. v. United States, Ct. Cl., 67 F.Supp. 955.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-18\">We find the fair and reasonable value of the vessel on that date to be $30,000. This is in accord with the testimony of those witnesses who were more experienced and were in a position to be best informed on such facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-19\">If the Government had not requisitioned the vessel it would have been compelled to remain largely in a lay-up status during the period of the war. While she was in this status a skeleton crew at a cost of $575 a month would have been required to care for the vessel. Then, too, it was necessary to incur painting and other upkeep expense, and there would necessarily have been some depreciation. Anyone purchasing her would have been compelled to take these facts into consideration. If, therefore, we were to accept the testimony of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses as to the market value just prior to December 7, 1941, anyone purchasing her would have necessarily subtracted the crew cost of maintaining the vessel for the probable war period, plus replacements, upkeep and depreciation. This course would arrive at substantially the same result.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-20\">We find that plaintiff is entitled to recover the sum of $15,000 with interest at the rate of 4 percent per annum from February 1, 1942, not as interest but as a part of just compensation, together with interest on $15,000 from February 1, 1942, to January 27, 1943, the date when the original $15,000 was paid. A. D. Walker &amp; Co. v. United States, 105 Ct. Cl. 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-21\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-22\">MADDEN, WHITAKER, and LITTLE-TON, Judges, concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-23\">WHALEY, Chief Justice, took no part in the decision of this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
