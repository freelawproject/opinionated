We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-16\">The following facts are either supported by the record or undisputed by the parties. On October 23, 1998, the defendant was arraigned in Littleton District Court on misdemeanor charges of simple assault and criminal threatening. <em>See </em>RSA 631:2-a, 1(a) (1996), :4, 1(d) (Supp. 1999). The defendant requested appointed counsel, and trial was scheduled for November 6, 1998. On November 2, Attorney Carl Olson of the public defender\u2019s office was notified of his appointment to represent the defendant. Attorney Olson mailed a discovery request to the police, in response to which the prosecuting officer, Lisbon Police Officer Talatinian, hand-delivered the discovery material on November 5. At that time, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>discussion regarding a continuance of the case took place between Attorney Olson and Officer Talatinian.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">On November 6, the date scheduled for trial, Attorney Olson filed a motion to dismiss the charges arguing that he could not effectively represent the defendant on such short notice and that the defendant was therefore impermissibly faced with having to choose between his constitutional rights to effective assistance of counsel and a speedy trial. The defendant\u2019s motion represented that Officer Talatinian had indicated, in his prior conversation with Attorney Olson, that he would not concur in a motion by the defendant to continue the trial. At a hearing on the motion, the trial judge questioned Officer Talatinian about his conversation with Attorney Olson. The court had some difficulty, however, eliciting answers from Officer Talatinian. Finally, the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">THE COURT: Let\u2019s not split hairs. Did you tell him that you were ready to go forward today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-7\">OFFICER TALATINIAN: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-8\">THE COURT: And isn\u2019t the obvious impression [created] by that statement . . . that you were not agreeable to a continuance?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-9\">OFFICER TALATINIAN: Not in my opinion, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-10\">THE COURT: Well, it is in mine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">The trial court granted the motion without further explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">Based on the merits of defendant\u2019s speedy trial claim, the State moved for reconsideration. After a hearing, at which the State was represented by Assistant County Attorney George Waldron, Jr., the trial court denied the motion and clarified its prior ruling as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-13\">Motion denied. For purposes of clarification at the hearing on the original motion, the State repeatedly failed to respond directly to certain question[s] posed by this Court as to matters pertinent to the underlying issues. The State repeatedly gave evasive and nonresponsive answers to direct questions posed by this Court. This Court finds and so found that the State was acting in bad faith.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-14\">On appeal, the State argues that dismissal of the charges against the defendant as a sanction for perceived misconduct by Officer Talatinian was an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion under the principles we announced in <em>State v. Cotell, </em>143 N.H. 275, 722 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>507 (1998). Specifically, the-State argues that the' trial court abused its supervisory authority by dismissing the charges absent a finding that Officer Talatinian\u2019s alleged misconduct prejudiced the defendant and by failing to consider the imposition of less extreme sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Before addressing the trial court\u2019s order, we must first consider the defendant\u2019s arguments that the State has not preserved this issue for our review. The defendant first contends that the State cannot argue on appeal that the trial court abused its supervisory authority because the State invited that error at the hearing on the motion to reconsider. Specifically, the defendant argues that \u201cthe State did not dispute the [trial] court\u2019s view of the scope of its [supervisory] piowers,\u201d in that the assistant county attorney acknowledged at argument on the motion to reconsider that \u201c[i]f the [court\u2019s] decision was made based on prosecutorial misconduct, that would be a different matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">\u201cUnder the \u2018invited error\u2019 doctrine, a party may not avail himself of error into which he has led the trial court, intentionally or unintentionally.\u201d <em>State v. Goodale, </em>144 N.H. 224, 227, 740 A.2d 1026, 1029 (1999) (quotations and brackets omitted). Our reading of the record, however, does not support the defendant\u2019s invited error argument. The record indicates that the assistant county attorney was pointing out to the court that the reason- for the dismissal as then clarified by the court, <em>i.e., </em>prosecutorial misconduct, did not appear in the court\u2019s original order, thereby leaving the assistant county attorney, who had not been present at the original hearing, at a disadvantage in arguing the motion for reconsideration. We do not conclude that the prosecutor conceded the propriety of dismissal if the court found prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">The defendant\u2019s second preservation argument asserts that the State did not present the same argument to the trial court as it now makes on appeal in that its motion for reconsideration addressed only the alleged speedy trial violation, and not the propriety of dismissing the case for prosecutorial misconduct. It is well established that \u201cthis court will not consider issues raised on appeal that were not presented in the lower court.\u201d <em>State v. Baird, </em>133 N.H. 637, 640, 581 A.2d 1313, 1315 (1990) (quotations omitted). The preservation requirement recognizes that generally, trial courts \u201cshould have an opportunity to rule on issues and to correct errors before they are presented to the appellate court.\u201d <em>State v. McMinn, </em>141 N.H. 636, 642, 690 A.2d 1017, 1021 (1997) (quotations omitted). We look to this rationale in determining whether an issue has been preserved for our review. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>The record reveals that the trial court did not explicitly state the basis for its original ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion. The court merely stated, \u201cMotion to dismiss granted,\u201d and noted the same in its order. It was therefore not unreasonable for the State to assume, as it apparently did, that the court had granted the defendant\u2019s motion for the reasons argued therein, and therefore to address its motion for reconsideration to the merits of the defendant\u2019s asserted grounds for dismissal. In response, defense counsel argued that the court dismissed the case for the State\u2019s misconduct after Officer Talatinian \u201cplayed word games\u201d in response to the court\u2019s questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The trial court confirmed that assessment during the State\u2019s rebuttal argument, asking the assistant county attorney, \u201cWell, Mr. Waldron, how do you deal with when a Court tries to get to the bottom of something, and they ask a representative of the State a direct question, and the Court never gets a direct answer?\u201d The following exchange then took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">MR. WALDRON: Well, your Honor, if you\u2019re not getting a \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">THE COURT: Repeatedly does not get a direct answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-8\">MR. WALDRON: I understand that, your Honor. I think the remedy is \u2014 is to order \u2014-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-9\">THE COURT: It\u2019s a clear indication to me of the State acting in bad faith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-10\">MR. WALDRON: I think that the Court has the authority to order the person to \u2014 to answer the questions directly or to be held in contempt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">We conclude that although the assistant county attorney did not explicitly inform the trial court that it was required to consider lesser alternative sanctions, he did argue that other, less extreme sanctions would have been more appropriate under the circumstances. The assistant county attorney also pointed out that dismissal is a drastic sanction, as it frustrates the public\u2019s and the victim\u2019s interests in prosecuting the crime, in contrast to a sanction that punishes the person actually committing the misconduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-12\">MR. WALDRON: Your Honor, I think with respect to your administrative powers, you have \u2014 you have the authority to hold the person in contempt if they\u2019re not giving you \u2014 giving you straight answers, or if you feel that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>they\u2019re misleading you, or lying to you. But in this particular case, it\u2019s the State of New Hampshire, as well as the victim in this matter, the fact that a person representing the State may be misleading the Court ... or lying to the Court, the Court has the authority to sanction the person or hold him in contempt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Similarly, while the assistant county attorney did not directly argue that the absence of prejudice to the defendant precluded dismissal under the court\u2019s supervisory authority, he did argue, in the context of defendant\u2019s speedy trial claim, that the defendant had not been prejudiced by the pre-trial delay, that the defendant would not have been prejudiced by a sixty-day continuance, and that the court could have continued the case over the State\u2019s objection. <em>See State v. Judkins, </em>128 N.H. 223, 224-25, 512 A.2d 427, 428 (1986) (reasons for counsel\u2019s objection, though not clearly articulated, were suggested in his statements to trial court). Thus, the assistant county attorney\u2019s argument indicated implicitly that Officer Talatinian\u2019s alleged failure to directly answer whether or not he had objected to a continuance could not have obstructed the proceeding to the defendant\u2019s prejudice because the court had the power to continue the trial notwithstanding the State\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">We review the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the case for prosecutorial misconduct for abuse of discretion. <em>See Cotell, </em>142 N.H. at 279, 722 A.2d at 511. In <em>Cotell </em>we noted that \u201cthe sanction of dismissal with prejudice is . . . reserved for extraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 281, 722 A.2d at 512. Accordingly, we held that \u201cthe supervisory authority of the trial court includes the power to impose the extreme sanction of dismissal with prejudice only in extraordinary situations and only where the government\u2019s misconduct has prejudiced the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 279, 722 A.2d at 511 (quotation and brackets omitted). We also recognized that \u201c[a] trial court exceeds the proper bounds of its supervisory power to order dismissal of an indictment with prejudice when it fails to consider whether less extreme sanctions might maintain the integrity of the court without punishing the State for a prosecutor\u2019s misconduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 281, 722 A.2d at 512 (quotation and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The trial court made no finding that the defendant was prejudiced by Officer Talatinian\u2019s alleged misconduct, nor, for reasons addressed above, could such a finding be made on this record. The defendant argues that the prejudice requirement of <em>Cotell </em>is not applicable because <em>Cotell </em>dealt with prosecutorial nonfeasance as opposed to the prosecutorial malfeasance indicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>here by the trial court\u2019s finding that the State acted in bad faith. We disagree. The principles set forth in <em>Cotell </em>\u201cdo not . . . [suggest] that if the [defendant] had shown some measure of governmental bad faith a mistrial or dismissal would automatically follow.\u201d <em>United States v. </em>Rossetti, 768 F.2d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 1985). Rather, we noted in <em>Cotell </em>that the \u201crequisite level of prejudice may vary with the nature of [the] government\u2019s misconduct.\u201d <em>Cotell, </em>143 N.H. at 279, 722 A.2d at 511. While we acknowledge the trial court\u2019s finding of bad faith, and we do not condone misleading or evasive responses by a prosecutor to the court, we conclude that Officer Talatinian\u2019s conduct did not rise to the level of impeding the trial court\u2019s ability to administer justice because the court could have ruled on the motion without the officer\u2019s answers. We therefore hold that under the circumstances of this case, the court was required to find prejudice before dismissing the charges as a sanction for prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The trial court also made no finding that a lesser sanction would fail to have the intended punitive effect. In fact, there is no indication in the record that the court even considered lesser sanctions. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in dismissing the charges against the defendant for prosecutorial misconduct. The trial court is free, however, to consider other appropriate sanctions on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Finally, the defendant contends that dismissal of the case was not granted solely for the purpose of punishing prosecutorial misconduct. Rather, the defendant asserts that \u201cOfficer Talatinian\u2019s bad faith refusal to truthfully provide the court with pertinent information\u201d left the court without a basis on which to decide the motion on its merits. The defendant advances two arguments based on this premise. First, the defendant argues that a lesser sanction such as contempt would not have adequately remedied the misconduct because \u201c[h]olding Officer Talatinian in contempt would not have enabled the court to decide the merits of the issue before it.\u201d Second, the defendant contends that the trial court had no choice but to treat the motion as unopposed and grant the requested relief on the merits argued therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">We reject these arguments. First, as discussed above, the information sought by the court was not necessary for it to decide whether to continue the trial. Thus, the court was not left without a basis upon which to decide the motion before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Second, a trial court is not required to grant an unopposed motion. <em>See State v. Watson, </em>120 N.H. 950, 952, 424 A.2d 417, 418 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>(1980). Furthermore, the defendant\u2019s motion requested dismissal on the flawed premise that the defendant was faced with an impermissible choice between constitutional rights. The defendant was not required to make such a choice. \u201cThe period of delay considered for purposes of analyzing a defendant\u2019s speedy trial claim begins to run when he is arrested or charged, whichever comes first.\u201d <em>Humphrey v. Cunningham, Warden, </em>133 N.H. 727, 734, 584 A.2d 763, 767 (1990). Although the record does not disclose the date of the defendant\u2019s arrest, the defendant does not dispute the State\u2019s representation that forty-seven days elapsed between his arrest and the date set for trial. Where a defendant charged with a misdemeanor is not in jail, we do not consider a pretrial delay of fewer than six months to be presumptively prejudicial. <em>Cf. </em>Super. Ct. R. App. (Superior Court Speedy Trial Policy). The defendant, who the State represents without objection was not incarcerated, could have requested a continuance of up to approximately four months without reaching the point at which the delay would have become presumptively prejudicial. Thus, neither the defendant nor the trial court was required to choose between the defendant\u2019s right to effective assistance of counsel and his right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">We vacate the trial court\u2019s order dismissing the charges and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">\n<em>Vacated and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b404-7\">Brock, C.J., and Broderick, J., concurred; Batchelder, J., retired, specially assigned under RSA 490:3, concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
