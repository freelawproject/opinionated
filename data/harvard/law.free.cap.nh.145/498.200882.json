We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">We must first unwind a tangled fact pattern and procedural history. On July 5, 1992, Hampton Police Chief Robert Mark went to the residence of the plaintiffs, Roger and Adele Martin, to respond to a party situation. While there, Mark was allegedly struck, choked, and injured by Keith Lovett.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">In June 1995, the Marks filed a suit against both Lovett and the Martins. They alleged that Lovett \u201cviolently strfuck] Robert E. Mark in the back of the head and grabbled] [him] around the neck, choking him and causing him to fall into a porch area; [and] that as a result of the foregoing willful, wanton and reckless conduct\u201d Mark suffered injuries. The Marks\u2019 writ also alleged that the Martins were negligent because they owned the house where Lovett\u2019s actions took place. In October 1996, the Marks amended their writ to incorporate \u201cclaims sounding in negligence and intentional conduct\u201d against Lovett.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">As part of the underlying tort action, the Martins initiated a contribution claim against their co-defendant, Lovett. Lovett asked Maine Mutual, his parents\u2019 homeowner\u2019s insurance company, to defend and indemnify him in the underlying tort action. Maine Mutual informed Lovett that the allegations in the underlying tort action were not covered by the policy\u2019s liability coverage, and therefore refused to indemnify or defend him.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Maine Mutual\u2019s policy provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-9\">If a claim is made or a suit is brought against an insured for damages because of bodily injury or property damage caused by an occurrence ... , we will: (1) pay up to our limit of liability for the damages for which the insured is legally liable; and (2) provide a defense at our expense by counsel of our choice ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">The policy defines \u201coccurrence\u201d as an accident. It also contains a coverage exclusion for suits alleging \u201cbodily injury or property damage, which is expected or intended by the insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Following Maine Mutual\u2019s decision to deny coverage, the Martins filed a petition for declaratory relief, in which the Marks intervened, seeking to secure coverage under Lovett\u2019s insurance policy. Maine Mutual moved for summary judgment, arguing that its insurance policy did not apply because the pleadings in the underlying tort action did not allege an \u201caccident\u201d within the meaning of the policy. The trial court granted this motion, and the Marks appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">The Marks argue that their writ of summons contains sufficient allegations to trigger Maine Mutual\u2019s duty to defend and indemnify Lovett. Specifically, they contend that an exclusion for \u201cbodily injury expected or intended by the insured\u201d applies only when the insured intended the particular result to occur. Here, they contend that \u201cChief Mark\u2019s falling onto a porch and injuring himself was hot anywhere near expected nor intended to occur as a result of his being choked\u201d and thus is a covered \u201caccident.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">In reviewing the grant of summary judgment, we consider the affidavits and pleadings in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. If there is no genuine issue of material fact and if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, the grant of summary judgment is affirmed. <em>See Weaver v. Royal Ins. Co. of America, </em>140 N.H. 780, 781, 674 A.2d 975, 977 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">\u201cThe interpretation of insurance policy language is ultimately a question of law for this court to decide.\u201d <em>Allen v. Sentry Insurance, </em>137 N.H. 579, 580, 630 A.2d 780, 781 (1993). Insurance companies can limit their liability through clear and unambiguous policy language. <em>See Weeks v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>140 N.H. 641, 643, 673 A.2d 772, 774 (1996). Further, \u201c[i]t is well-settled law in New Hampshire that an insurer\u2019s obligation to defend its insured is determined by whether the cause of action against the insured alleges sufficient facts in the pleadings to bring it within the express terms of the policy . . . .\u201d <em>Green Mt. Ins. Co. v. Foreman, </em>138 N.H. 440, <em>441-42, </em>641 A.2d 230, 232 (1994) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">\u201cAccident\u201d is not defined in the policy. We have repeatedly held, however, that \u201caccident\u201d reasonably means \u201can undesigned contingency, ... a happening by chance, something out of the usual course of things, unusual, fortuitous, not anticipated, and not naturally to be expected.\u201d <em>Vermont Mut. Ins. Co. v. Malcolm, </em>128 N.H. 521, 523, 517 A.2d 800, 802 (1986) (quotations omitted). We recognize that accidents are not exclusive of intentional acts, and that the latter may have unforeseen, unintended, or \u201caccidental\u201d consequences. <em>See Providence Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Scanlon, </em>138 N.H. 301, 305, 638 A.2d 1246, 1248 (1994). Nevertheless, we do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>require insurers to cover liability resulting from their insured\u2019s intentional acts that are inherently injurious and are \u201ccertain to result in <em>some </em>injury, although not necessarily the particular alleged injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 306, 638 A.2d at 1249.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Thus, the essential inquiry is whether Lovett\u2019s actions were inherently injurious. The actions alleged by the Marks in the amended pleadings included Lovett \u201cviolently striking\u201d Mark, \u201cgrabbing\u201d him \u201caround the neck, choking him and causing him to fall into a porch area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">We have found \u201cinherently injurious\u201d conduct in circumstances virtually identical to the circumstances of this case. <em>See Green Mt. Ins. Co., </em>138 N.H. at 441, 641 A.2d at 231. In that case, the insured punched another and caused that person to fall backwards off a porch. We concluded that such actions were inherently injurious. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">The superior court noted that it was a \u201cmatter of common sense\u201d to conclude that the alleged actions here were inherently injurious. The intervenors misconstrue this language as the trial court applying an incorrect standard. The trial court properly applied the facts to our articulated definition of \u201cinherently injurious,\u201d and correctly concluded that, as a matter of law, Maine Mutual was entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">The Marks argue that, unlike the pleadings in <em>Green Mt. Ins. Co., </em>their pleadings allege sufficient facts to establish a negligence claim. We are wary of the \u201cpleading strategies, whims, and vagaries of third party claimants [attempting] to control the rights of parties to an insurance contract.\u201d <em>M. Mooney Corp. v. U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>136 N.H. 463, 469, 618 A.2d 793, 797 (1992). The Marks\u2019 amended writ merely adds conclusions of negligence alongside the allegations of the \u201cwillful, wanton, and reckless conduct\u201d in the preceding count. The amended pleadings contain no more than bald conclusions of negligence with no accompanying allegations of fact and are insufficient to trigger a duty to defend and or indemnify. <em>See Green Mt. Ins. Co., </em>138 N.H. at 443, 641 A.2d at 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">The Marks also argue that our decision in <em>Binda v. Royal Insurance Co., </em>144 N.H. 613, 744 A.2d 634 (2000), forecloses us from affirming the superior court. There, in dicta, we stated that the amended pleadings in that case included \u201cfactual allegations [that] arguably constitutefd] unintentional conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 619-20, 744 A.2d at 639. In <em>Binda,, </em>unlike here, the trial court had not previously reviewed the amended pleadings to determine if the negligence claims triggered coverage because the court had refused to allow the plaintiff to file a declaratory judgment petition. Our limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>holding in <em>Binda </em>answered the procedural question whether a party is entitled to file a petition for declaratory judgment six months following amendments to a writ, which allege an accidental occurrence. <em>Binda </em>required the superior court to make a determination whether the amended proceedings were sufficient to trigger the insurance company\u2019s duties to indemnify and defend. Nothing in that opinion undercuts the superior court\u2019s conclusions that in the pleadings of this case, Lovett\u2019s actions were inherently injurious and that Maine Mutual is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b532-5\">BRODERICK and DALIANIS, JJ., concurred; HORTON, J., retired and GROFF, j., superior court justice, specially assigned under RSA 490:3, concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
