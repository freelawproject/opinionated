The plaintiffs cross-appeal the trial court\u2019s denial of their motion for attorney\u2019s fees. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">The parties do not dispute the following facts. The plaintiffs own and operate a camp in Derry containing a private nine-hole golf course. In 1997, they sought site plan approval to add an additional nine holes and to open the course to the public. The planning board approved the plan, contingent upon payment of $7,500 for off-site improvements necessitated by increased traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">The plaintiffs appealed to the superior court challenging the planning board\u2019s requirement that they pay for off-site improvements. The town moved to dismiss, arguing that the petition was not \u201cduly verified,\u201d <em>see </em>RSA 677:15, I (1996), and thus the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">Thereafter, the plaintiffs moved for summary judgment, arguing that because the town had not enacted an impact fee ordinance, the town lacked authority to require payment for off-site improvements. <em>See </em>RSA 674:16, II, :21 (1996). The trial court granted the motion, finding \u201cno facts in dispute which affect the fact that no impact fee ordinance has been adopted.\u201d The court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 subsequent motion for attorney\u2019s fees. This appeal and cross-appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">The town first argues that the trial court erred by not dismissing the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. RSA 677:15 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-12\">I. Any persons aggrieved by any decision of the planning board concerning a plat or subdivision may present to the superior court a petition, <em>duly verified, </em>setting forth that such decision is illegal or unreasonable in whole or in part and specifying the grounds upon which the same is claimed to be illegal or unreasonable. Such petition shall be pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>sented to the court within 30 days after the decision of the planning board has been filed and first becomes available for public inspection in the office of the planning board or of its clerk or secretary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">(Emphasis added.) We have held that compliance with the thirty-day filing period is a jurisdictional prerequisite to an appeal under RSA 677:15. <em>See Dermody v. Town of Gilford, </em>137 N.H. 294, 296, 627 A.2d 570, 571 (1993). Thus, the town argues that the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to file a petition that was \u201cduly verified\u201d within the thirty-day filing period \u201cdivested the Superior Court of jurisdiction to hear this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">In ascertaining legislative intent, we look first to the words of the statute, ascribing to them their plain meaning wherever possible. <em>See State v. Cobb, </em>143 N.H. 638, 643-44, 732 A.2d 425, 431 (1999). The term \u201cverify\u201d is commonly understood to mean \u201c[t]o confirm or substantiate by oath or affidavit.\u201d BLACK\u2019S LAW DICTIONARY 1561 (6th ed. 1990). Within the context of pleading requirements, a statutorily required verification assures that allegations of a party are made in good faith. <em>See Federated Mortg. and Inv. Co. v. Jones, </em>798 S.W.2d 719, 721 (Mo. 1990) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Ordinarily, however, the verification does not \u201cconstitute a part of the pleading itself but, rather, goes to the form of the pleading.\u201d Id.; <em>see also In re Interest of L.D., </em>398 N.W.2d 91, 98 (Neb. 1986). <em>See generally </em>61B AM. JUR. 2D <em>Pleading </em>\u00a7 888 (1999). Accordingly, other jurisdictions liberally permit an improperly verified pleading to be amended, even beyond the jurisdictional time frame within which to file the pleading. <em>See, e.g., Drury Displays v. Board of Adjustment, </em>760 S.W.2d 112, 114 (Mo. 1988) (en banc); <em>In re Estate of Shaffer, </em>454 P.2d 1, 4-6 (Kan. 1969); <em>People v. Miller, </em>24 N.E.2d 722, 723-24 (N.Y. 1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">Our legislature has likewise provided that trial courts may liberally allow parties to amend pleadings that contain technical defects. <em>See </em>RSA 514:8 (1997); <em>Nat\u2019l Marine Underwriters v. McCormack, </em>138 N.H. 6, 8, 634 A.2d 1008, 1010 (1993). We decline, therefore, to construe the verification requirement in RSA 677:15 as a jurisdictional prerequisite. \u201c[S]ince the requirement of verification is a procedural formality designed as a deterrent to frivolous allegations, the failure to verify a petition does not divest the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d <em>In re L.M., </em>563 N.E.2d 999, 1002 (Ill. App. Ct. 1990); <em>see also In re Interest of L.D., </em>398 N.W.2d at 98. Although proper verification is required by RSA 677:15, <em>cf. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number><em>Miller, </em>24 N.E.2d at 723, the town argued only that the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to verify the petition divested the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction. Accordingly, we conclude that the court did not err in denying the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The town next challenges the grant of summary judgment based upon the town\u2019s failure to enact an \u201cimpact fee\u201d ordinance pursuant to RSA 674:21. \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Farm Family Mut. Ins. Co. v. Peck, </em>143 N.H. 603, 605, 731 A.2d 996, 997 (1999); <em>see </em>RSA 491:8-a, III (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">RSA 674:21 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-7\">I. Innovative land use controls may include, but are not limited to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-8\">(m) Impact fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-9\"><em>V. </em>As used in this section \u201cimpact fee\u201d means a fee or assessment imposed upon development, including subdivision, building construction or other land use change, in order to help meet the needs occasioned by that development for the construction or improvement of capital facilities owned or operated by the municipality ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-10\">(i) Neither the adoption of an impact fee ordinance, <em>nor the failure to adopt such an ordinance, shall be deemed to affect existing authority of a planning board over subdivision or site plan review, </em>except to the extent expressly stated in such an ordinance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">The parties do not dispute that the town has not enacted an impact fee ordinance pursuant to RSA 674:21, or that the assessment of $7,500 for off-site improvements would meet the definition of \u201cimpact fee\u201d under RSA 674:21, <em>V. </em>Rather, at issue is whether RSA 674:21 represents the <em>sole </em>authority for conditioning the approval of a site plan upon the applicant\u2019s payment of money for off-site improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">\u201cMunicipalities have only powers that are <em>expressly granted </em>to them by the legislature and such as are <em>necessarily </em>implied or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>incidental thereto. In turn, a municipality may not delegate to a municipal board more' power than the municipality has.\u201d <em>Board of Water Comm\u2019rs, Laconia Water Works v. Mooney, </em>139 N.H. 621, 625, 660 A.2d 1121, 1124 (1995) (quotation, brackets, and citations omitted). Prior to the 1991 enactment of RSA 674:21, <em>V, </em>we held that planning boards ha.d the authority pursuant to RSA 674:43 and :44 (1996) to condition the approval of a site plan upon payment for off-site road improvements. <em>See N.E. Brickmaster v. Town of Salem, </em>133 N.H. 655, 663-64, 582 A.2d 601, 606 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">/.The town argues that the provision in RSA 674:21, V(i) that failure to adopt an impact fee ordinance does not affect \u201cexisting authority of a planning board over . . . site plan review,\u201d preserves its authority under <em>N.E. Brickmaster </em>to condition the approval of the plaintiffs\u2019 site plan upon the payment of a fee for off-site road improvements necessitated by the proposed development. The .plaintiffs counter that RSA 674:21 replaced the framework established by <em>\u00d1.E. Brickmaster </em>for assessing a fee for off-site improvements. The language of RSA 674:21, V(i), according to the plaintiffs, preserves only the authority of planning boards to require \u201cMon-impact fee off-site improvements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">\u25a0 \u201cIn matters \u25a0 of statutory interpretation, this court is the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as expressed in' the words of a statute considered as a whole.\u201d <em>State v. Halt, </em>144 N.H. 246, 247, 740 A.2d 1037, 1038 (1999) (quotation omitted). While we first look to the plain meaning of words to interpret statutes, \u201cit is one of the surest indexes of a mature and developed jurisprudence not to make a fortress out of the dictionary; but to remember that statutes always have some purpose or object to accomplish.\u201d <em>Appeal of Ashland Elec. Dept., </em>141 N.H. 336, 341, 682 A.2d 710, 713 (1996) (quotation omitted). Where more than one interpretation of statutory language is reasonable, we consider legislative history to assist in our analysis. <em>See Appeal of Routhier, </em>143 N.H. 404, 406, 725 A.2d 665, 666 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Considering the words of the statute as a whole, we conclude that RSA 674:21, V(i) does not preserve the \u201cexisting authority\u201d of a planning board under RSA 674:44 to condition the approval of a site plan upon the applicant\u2019s payment of money for off-site improvements. While the statute authorizes municipalities to impose impact fees, it comprehensively regulates the municipality\u2019s implementation of such fees. For example, the statute regulates the amount and uses of stich fees, <em>see </em>RSA 674:21, V(a), specifies procedures for assessing and collecting such fees, <em>see </em>RSA 674:21, V(d), and provides for both an appeal process, <em>see </em>RSA 674:21, V(f), and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>waiver process, <em>see </em>RSA 674:21, V(g). The statute\u2019s scope suggests that the legislature intended to preempt the common law rule set out in <em>N.E. Brickmaster. See </em>15A AM. JUR. 2D <em>Common Law </em>\u00a7 15 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The 1991 amendment\u2019s legislative history is consistent with our construction of RSA 674:21, V(i). During the debate in the senate, Senator Currier, on behalf of the executive departments committee, introduced the amendment by stating that it \u201cis basically enabling legislation which would allow the towns, after the adoption of an ordinance, to impose impact fees.\u201d N.H.S. JOUR. 1494 (1991). He further noted that because some communities currently charge impact fees, the amendment is needed to create a \u201clevel playing field\u201d for developers in the different communities. <em>Id. </em>He reiterated the importance of uniformity in response to a question challenging the necessity of the amendment, given that communities were already charging impact fees and the supreme court was affirming such fees. <em>Id. </em>at 1499.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">In light of these comments, we conclude that a construction of the statute permitting municipalities to charge impact fees without adopting an impact fee ordinance, and thus perpetuating the lack of uniformity, would be illogical. <em>See Appeal of Dell, </em>140 N.H. 484, 491, 668 A.2d 1024, 1031 (1995). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err by granting summary judgment on the basis that the town had not enacted an impact fee ordinance pursuant to RSA 674:16, II and :21.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">We note, however, that RSA 674:21 does preserve a planning board\u2019s authority to impose conditions on site plan or subdivision approval that require expenditures to improve some aspect of the applicant\u2019s own property</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">Finally, we reject the plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeal of the trial coui\u2019t\u2019s denial of attorney\u2019s fees. In reviewing a trial court\u2019s denial of a request for attorney\u2019s fees, we give \u201ctremendous deference to the court\u2019s decision,\u201d reversing only if the trial court\u2019s discretion was \u201cexercised for reasons clearly untenable or to an extent clearly unreasonable to the prejudice of the objecting party.\u201d <em>Glick v. Naess, </em>143 N.H. 172, 175, 722 A.2d 453, 455 (1998) (quotations and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">The plaintiffs argue that the trial court\u2019s failure to follow <em>Board of Water Comm\u2019rs, </em>139 N.H. at 629, 660 A.2d at 1126-27, in which we affirmed a trial court\u2019s decision to grant attorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing party on the basis that the party had \u201cconferred a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>substantial benefit on the citizens and taxpayers of Laconia by successfully defending this action,\u201d was clearly unreasonable. We disagree. While <em>Board of Water Comm\u2019rs </em>affirmed the trial court\u2019s <em>discretion </em>to award attorney\u2019s fees in that particular circumstance, it did not <em>mandate </em>such an award. Furthermore, the trial court found the plaintiffs did not confer a substantial benefit on the citizens. Accordingly, we do not find that the trial court erred in denying the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b418-6\">BROCK, C.J., and HORTON, BRODERICK, and DALIANIS, JJ., concurred; NADEAU and DALIANIS, JJ., took part in the final vote by consent of the parties.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
