We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-17\">The following facts are undisputed. On December 10, 1993, the defendant, the plaintiff\u2019s physician, delivered the plaintiff\u2019s second child. Following the delivery, the plaintiff began to hemorrhage. After examining the plaintiff\u2019s uterus, the defendant determined that the placenta had partially separated from the uterus and that the hemorrhaging came from the placental insertion site on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>uterine wall. With the assistance of Pitocin and uterine massage, the plaintiff delivered the placenta. The defendant examined it and determined that there were no \u201cmajor breaks or tears or anything that looked like it was a missing piece.\u201d The placenta was sent to pathology for examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">On December 14, two days after she was discharged from the hospital, the plaintiff visited the hospital\u2019s emergency room. An emergency room doctor placed her on antibiotics to treat a suspected kidney infection. When the plaintiff failed to improve, an ultrasound was done, which indicated that there were possible retained products of conception (i.e., pieces of the placenta). The defendant discussed various options with the plaintiff, including either waiting for the retained materials to pass or doing a dilation and curettage (D&amp;C). The plaintiff had a D&amp;C. A few days later, because the plaintiff continued to bleed and have pain, another doctor performed a second D&amp;C. The second D&amp;C perforated the plaintiff\u2019s uterus. Follow-up testing revealed an infection requiring the removal of one of the plaintiff\u2019s fallopian tubes.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">The plaintiff sued the defendant, alleging that because of his negligence, products of conception remained in her uterus, leading to infection and the removal of a fallopian tube. At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, the defendant moved for a directed verdict. The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion and denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">On appeal, the plaintiff argues that the trial court\u2019s directed verdict ruling was in error. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">A motion for directed verdict \u201cshould be granted only when the sole reasonable inference that may be drawn from the evidence, which must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, is so overwhelmingly in favor of the moving party that no contrary verdict could stand.\u201d <em>Bronson v. The Hitchcock Clinic, </em>140 N.H. 798, 800, 677 A.2d 665, 667-68 (1996) (quotation omitted). \u201cThe trial court cannot weigh the evidence or judge the credibility of the witnesses, and, if the evidence is conflicting or several reasonable inferences may be drawn, the motion for a directed verdict should be denied.\u201d <em>Arthur v. Holy Rosary Credit Union, </em>139 N.H. 463, 465, 656 A.2d 830, 832 (1995) (quotation and brackets omitted). \u201cIn addition, the trial judge\u2019s discretion to remove questions of fact from the jury is very limited.\u201d <em>Young v. Clogston, </em>127 N.H. 340, 342, 499 A.2d 1007, 1009 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">\u201cThis court will uphold a trial court\u2019s decision to grant a motion for a directed verdict unless the trial judge abused his or her discretion in determining that no rational juror could find for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>party against whom the motion is filed.\u201d <em>Holy Rosary Credit Union, </em>139 N.H. at 465, 656 A.2d at 832.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s burden of proof in a medical negligence action is defined by statute, RSA 507-E:2, I (1997), which</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-6\">requires the plaintiff to prove by competent expert testimony the standard of care required of the defendant at the time the medical care was rendered, that the defendant failed to act in accordance with such standard, and that as a proximate result, [the plaintiff] suffered injuries which she would not otherwise have sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-7\"><em>Bissett v. Renna, </em>142 N.H. 788, 792, 710 A.2d 404, 406 (1998). Accordingly, we must determine whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, she met her burden of producing sufficient expert medical testimony from which a reasonable juror could conclude that the defendant breached the relevant standard of care and that his breach proximately caused her injuries. <em>See Bronson, </em>140 N.H. at 801, 677 A.2d at 668.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">We first examine the plaintiff\u2019s evidence of the relevant standard of care and of the defendant\u2019s breach of that standard. The plaintiff presented one expert to meet her burden who, on direct examination, testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-9\">Q. Now, after the placenta\u2019s been delivered, what is the standard \u2014 general standard of reasonable medical practice pertaining to the examination of the placenta? And I want you to tell me whether or not that standard was different in 1993 from what it is today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-10\">A. Sure. I don\u2019t \u2014 first of all, the standard has been not different for as long as I can remember. The placenta, delivery of the placenta, is an old thing that\u2019s gone on ever since people have been born, and we\u2019ve known for a long time that the placenta can cause some trouble if it isn\u2019t delivered intact. So once the placenta has been delivered or born, if you will, the obstetrician or the physician doing the delivery has the obligation to make sure that it\u2019s all there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-11\">So to complete a delivery the doctor who does that . . . has to be certain that the entire placenta has been totally expelled from the mother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>Q. Do you have an opinion, Doctor, based upon your background and experience, your review of the record and what you just expressed concerning whether [the defendant\u2019s] examination of the placenta was a deviation from the standard reasonable medical practice for a family physician under these circumstances and at this time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-5\">A. Well, I can\u2019t \u2014 I can\u2019t speak to exactly what his examination consisted of because 1 don\u2019t know that. I didn\u2019t read his deposition. But it\u2019s clear that there was a piece left.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-6\">I think that speaks for itself to know that there were retained products. And so clearly, whatever examination he did was inadequate because he missed a piece. That\u2019s as much as I can say about that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">On cross-examination, the expert testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-8\">Q. Now, you\u2019re not saying every time that there \u2014 you have confirmed the presence of retained products by ultrasound that that means you must have negligently failed to observe in the first instance that there was missing placental tissue when you inspected the placenta, are you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-9\">A. No. f think just missing it, you know, it depends on how it was inspected, how it was examined. Negligence has not to do with not finding it. It\u2019s got to do with how you did it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-10\">Q. Well, so one could do a perfectly reasonable and careful exam and still fail to detect missing placental tissue in the absence of negligence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-11\">A. It\u2019s possible. It\u2019s possible. Not probable I must say. Most of the time it\u2019s because it was an inadequate exam.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">The defendant contends, and the trial court agreed, that because the expert testified that the standard of care is determined by the method of inspecting the placenta, and he did not know how the defendant examined the placenta, no reasonable jury could find that the standard of care was breached.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-13\">We do not agree that this is the sole reasonable inference to be drawn from the expert\u2019s entire testimony. On direct, the expert testified that the standard of care requires a doctor to make sure that the placenta is completely expelled from the mother and that the defendant breached this standard because he \u201cmissed a piece.\u201d On cross-examination, the expert reiterated that \u201cmost of the time,\u201d the failure to detect missing placental tissue is due to negligence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>While we do not presume negligence, as a matter of law, from the fact that the plaintiff\u2019s uterus retained placental tissue, the expert testified, as a matter of fact, that the standard of care requires this presumption. Given this testimony, which was sufficient to satisfy the plaintiff\u2019s burden under RSA 507-E.-2, I, a reasonable juror could conclude that the defendant breached the relevant standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">While it may appear that the expert articulated two contradictory standards of care, one that requires a physician not to miss any retained products of conception and another that depends upon how the physician examines the placenta, it was for the jury to resolve any such conflict. \u201cThe jury may accept some parts and reject other parts of testimony, and adopt one or the other of inconsistent statements by witnesses. The defendant\u2019s argument that the case should have been taken from the jury because of alleged inconsistency in [the expert\u2019s] testimony is without merit.\u201d <em>Morrill v. Tilney, </em>128 N.H. 773, 778, 519 A.2d 293, 296 (1986) (citation omitted). We conclude, therefore, that the inferences that may be drawn from the expert\u2019s testimony are not \u201cso overwhelmingly in favor of the defendant that no contrary verdict could stand.\u201d <em>Bronson, </em>140 N.H. at 804, 677 A.2d at 670 (quotation and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">We next turn to the question of causation. The trial court ruled that the plaintiff did not offer sufficient expert testimony that the defendant\u2019s failure to diagnose retained products of conception caused her infection. This conclusion was also erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">\u201c[I]f competent expert medical testimony is adduced' from which the jury can fairly and reasonably conclude that but for a defendant\u2019s negligence an injury probably would not have occurred, the plaintiff has met [her] burden.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the expert testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-8\">Q. Based upon your diagnosis, review and analysis of the record, background and experience, Doctor, do you have an opinion based upon reasonable medical probability whether [the defendant]^ failure to recognize that there were products of conception retained in [the plaintiff\u2019s] uterus caused [her] condition?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-9\">A. I think that\u2019s so, yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">The expert also opined that the plaintiff\u2019s infection \u201cwas instigated and started by the retained tissue\u201d and that \u201cthe presence of retained tissue was the result of not recognizing that it was retained initially and not removing it. . . [b]y [the defendant], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>who delivered the placenta.\u201d This was sufficient testimony from which reasonable jurors could find or infer that the defendant\u2019s negligence caused the plaintiff\u2019s infection. The plaintiff thus established \u201cthe quantum of expert testimony necessary to survive a motion for a directed verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 802, 677 A.2d at 669 (brackets and quotation omitted). The emergency room doctor\u2019s failure to detect retained products two days after delivery arguably may have contributed to the plaintiff\u2019s injuries, but did not extinguish the defendant\u2019s role. <em>See Pridham v. Cash &amp; Carry Bldg. Center, Inc., </em>116 N.H. 292, 297, 359 A.2d 193, 197 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">The plaintiff also argues that the defendant breached the standard of care in two other ways: (1) by giving her the options of having a D&amp;C or waiting to see if the retained products passed; and (2) by failing to remove all of the retained products during the first D&amp;C. In light of our ruling above, we need not address these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b655-6\">HORTON, J., sat for oral argument but retired prior to the final vote; THAYER, J., sat for oral argument but resigned prior to the final vote; BROCK, C.J., and BRODERICK and NADEAU, JJ., concurred; NADEAU and DALIAN IS, JJ., took part in the final vote by consent of the parties.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
