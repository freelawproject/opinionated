(Merchants), appeals from the Superior Court\u2019s <em>(McGuire, </em>J.) grant of the defendant\u2019s, Arbella Protection Insurance Company, Inc. (Arbella), motion for summary judgment. The issue on appeal is whether a large rental vehicle is a \u201cvan\u201d covered by the \u201cnon-owned auto\u201d provisions of a personal automobile insurance policy. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-13\">The following facts were undisputed in the trial court. On May 27, 1997, Merchants rented a large motor vehicle to James Bottomley. The rented vehicle had an enclosed cargo area resembling a large box and a gross vehicle weight of 10,000 pounds. While driving the vehicle, Bottomley struck a tree and damaged the vehicle\u2019s cargo area. Bottomley had a personal automobile insurance policy with Arbella and after the accident he assigned his rights under the policy to Merchants.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-14\">Arbella refused to pay for the damage to the rented vehicle, and Merchants filed suit in superior court. Both parties moved for summary judgment. Arbella alleged that the damaged vehicle was not among the vehicle types covered by the terms of Bottomley\u2019s insurance policy. Merchants argued that the vehicle was covered under the policy. It further argued that, to the extent the policy did not clearly cover the damaged vehicle, the policy was ambiguous and should be construed against Arbella. The superior court granted Arbella\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied Merchant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>In reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we look at the . . . evidence, and all inferences properly drawn therefrom, in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. If our review of that evidence discloses no genuine issue of material fact, and if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, we will affirm the grant of summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><em>Del Norte, Inc. v. Provencher, </em>142 N.H. 535, 537, 703 A.2d 890, 892 (1997) (citations and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Bottomley\u2019s insurance policy provides that Arbella will pay for direct and accidental loss to \u201cyour covered auto\u201d or to any \u201cnon-owned auto.\u201d \u201cNon-owned auto\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-6\">Any private passenger auto, pickup, van or \u201ctrailer\u201d not owned by or furnished or available for the regular use of you ... .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">\u201cYour covered auto\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-8\">1. Any vehicle shown in the declarations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-9\">2. Any of the following types of vehicles on the date you became the owner:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-10\">a. a private passenger auto; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-11\">b. a pickup or van that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-12\">(1) has a gross vehicle weight of less than 10,000 lbs.; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-13\">(2) is not used for the delivery or transportation of goods and materials</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-14\">c. Any \u201ctrailer\u201d you own.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-15\">There was no dispute that the vehicle in question was not a private passenger auto, a pickup, or a \u201ctrailer.\u201d The only issue was whether the vehicle was a \u201cvan\u201d within the \u201cnon-owned auto\u201d section of the policy. Presumably concluding that the weight and use restrictions referred to in the \u201cyour covered auto\u201d section also apply to the \u201cnon-owned auto\u201d section, the trial court found that the vehicle was not a \u201cvan\u201d because the vehicle weighed 10,000 pounds and was used for the \u201ctransportation of goods and materials.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-16\">We conclude, however, that the weight and use restrictions that apply to \u201cvan\u201d under \u201cyour covered auto\u201d do <em>not </em>apply to a \u201cvan\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>under \u201cnon-owned auto.\u201d The common definition of \u201cvan\u201d includes \u201cuse[] for transportation of goods WEBSTER\u2019S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 2531 (unabridged ed. 1961). Thus, the unqualified use of the term \u201cvan\u201d in the \u201cnon-owned auto\u201d section includes vehicles that may be used for transportation of goods. Furthermore, the fact that the \u201cyour covered auto\u201d section limits liability to vans of a certain weight and use indicates that the unqualified use of the term \u201cvan\u201d in the \u201cnon-owned auto\u201d section could encompass a broader range of vehicle\u2014 <em>i.e., </em>vehicles with a gross weight of 10,000 pounds or more and vehicles used for the delivery or transportation of goods and materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Because the weight and use restrictions contained in the \u201cyour covered auto\u201d section do not apply to the \u201cnon-owned auto\u201d section, we conclude that the trial court erred by ruling that the vehicle at issue in this case was not a \u201cvan\u201d within the policy because the vehicle weighed 10,000 pounds and was used for the transportation of goods and materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Accordingly, because Bottomley\u2019s policy clearly provides coverage for the vehicle at issue, we reverse the trial court\u2019s order granting Arbella\u2019s motion for summary judgment and remand for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b452-9\">DALIANIS, J., concurred; GROFF and MOHL, JJ., superior court justices, specially assigned under RSA 490:3, concurred; DUNN, J., retired superior court justice, sat for oral argument by special assignment under RSA 490:3 but did not take part in the final vote.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
