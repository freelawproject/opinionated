For the reasons that follow, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-12\">On September 9, 1998, Officer Jeffrey T. Williams of the Haverhill Police Department was called to the scene of a motor vehicle stop. The driver of the vehicle could not produce identification, and he asked the defendant, a passenger, to go to the apartment they shared to obtain some form of identification. Because the defendant did not have a driver\u2019s license and the weather was inclement, Williams offered to escort her to the apartment in his police cruiser.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-13\">Upon reaching the defendant\u2019s apartment building, Williams followed the defendant inside. Once inside, he followed her up a set of stairs, unaware that the stairs were part of her apartment. At the top of the stairs, when he realized that he had entered the defendant\u2019s apartment, he stopped and waited for the defendant. Williams had not asked to enter the apartment, nor had the defendant invited him to enter. While waiting, he observed a handgun in plain view. Williams confiscated the handgun, which formed the basis of several subsequent searches and ultimately led to charges against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-14\">The defendant moved to suppress all evidence obtained following Williams\u2019 entry into her apartment, arguing that Williams\u2019 failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>obtain her \u201cmanifest consent\u201d to enter the premises was a violation of her State and federal constitutional rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. <em>See </em>N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 19; U.S. Const. amend. IV</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">The trial court ruled that \u201c[t]he constitutional protections relied upon by the defendant[] only apply to police investigative activities that are properly classified as \u2018searches.\u2019\u201d The court concluded that because Williams was not engaged in a search when he was in the defendant\u2019s apartment, the evidence obtained as a result of his presence should not be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">On appeal, we look first to our State Constitution, using decisions of the United States Supreme Court and other jurisdictions only as aids in our analysis. <em>See State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226, 231-33, 471 A.2d 347, 350-52 (1983); <em>Michigan v. Long, </em>463 U.S. 1032, 1040-41 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">Contrary to the trial court\u2019s ruling, Part I, Article 19 of our State Constitution protects individuals from warrantless police entries as well as warrantless searches. <em>See State v. Ricci, </em>144 N.H. 241, 243, 739 A.2d 404, 406 (1999). In fact, because the protections provided by Part I, Article 19 \u201care never in sharper focus than when viewed in the protection of one\u2019s dwelling,\u201d the warrant requirement is- \u201cparticularly stringent\u201d when entry into the defendant\u2019s home is at issue. <em>State v. Thompson, </em>132 N.H. 730, 733-34, 571 A.2d 266, 268-69 (1990); <em>Ricci, </em>144 N.H. at 243, 739 A.2d at 406. Thus, the trial court erred in concluding that Williams\u2019 conduct did not trigger the defendant\u2019s State and federal constitutional protections.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">The trial court did not address whether the defendant\u2019s conduct constituted consent for Williams to enter the apartment. \u201cWe ordinarily would remand this unresolved issue; however, when a lower tribunal has not addressed a factual issue, but the record reveals that a reasonable fact finder necessarily would reach a certain conclusion, we may decide that issue as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Appeal of Cote, </em>139 N.H. 575, 580, 660 A.2d 1090, 1094 (1995). Because the parties fully litigated this issue below, and because the essential facts are not in dispute, we will consider whether a reasonable fact finder could conclude that the defendant\u2019s conduct constituted consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">Warrantless police entries are <em>per se </em>unreasonable and thus illegal unless made pursuant to a judicially created exception. <em>See Ricci, </em>144 N.H. at 243, 739 A.2d at 406; <em>State v. MacDonald, </em>129 N.H. 13, 20, 523 A.2d 35, 39 (1986). When, as here, consent is the proffered justification for the warrantless entry, the State bears the burden of establishing, based upon the totality of the circumstances, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>that the consent was free, knowing, and voluntary. <em>See State v. Diaz, </em>134 N.H. 662, 664, 596 A.2d 725, 727 (1991); <em>State v. Jones, </em>131 N.H. 726, 728, 560 A.2d 1159, 1160 (1989). The State must establish consent by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See Diaz, </em>134 N.H. at 664, 596 A.2d at 727.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The State agrees that the defendant did not explicitly consent to the officer\u2019s entry into her apartment. Rather, the State argues that the totality of the circumstances supports a conclusion that the defendant consented to the officer\u2019s entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Although we consider the totality of the circumstances when determining whether consent to enter is given freely, knowingly, and voluntarily, where consent is not explicitly given, the surrounding circumstances must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant\u2019s implied consent to permit entry was unambiguous. Absent an explicit invitation to enter or a grant of permission in response to a request to enter, a warrantless entry based on consent implied from the defendant\u2019s <em>conduct </em>will be subject to stringent review.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Such a rule is consistent with our prior decision in <em>State v. Diaz, </em>134 N.H. 662, 596 A.2d 725 (1991). In <em>Diaz, </em>we suggested that the defendant\u2019s acquiescence to the officer\u2019s statement, \u201clet\u2019s go back to your [motel] room and get [your identification],\u201d constituted consent for the officer to accompany the defendant back to his motel room. <em>Id. </em>at 664-65, 596 A.2d at 726-27. There, the officer explicitly asked to return to the defendant\u2019s room, and the defendant unambiguously responded, \u201cno problem.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 664, 596 A.2d at 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">Illustrating the stringency with which we evaluate consent to enter a dwelling, we ultimately concluded in <em>Diaz </em>that the defendant\u2019s consent to \u201cgo back to\u201d the motel room did not unambiguously authorize the officer to enter the room, noting that \u201c[accepting an invitation to return to one\u2019s residence in order to produce identification sufficient to answer an officer\u2019s questions is significantly different from inviting the police to enter a private area and observe all subsequent activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 665, 596 A.2d at 727.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">The State argues that, judging the existence of consent by an objective standard, it was reasonable for Williams to infer consent from the defendant\u2019s conduct. The State relies on a prior case in which we held that the scope of a defendant\u2019s consent to search should be judged by an objective standard. <em>See State v. Baroudi, </em>137 N.H. 62, 64-65, 623 A.2d 750, 751-52 (1993). While we agree that a determination of the existence of consent should be judged by an objective rather than subjective standard, the threshold issue when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>considering a defendant\u2019s non-explicit consent to enter a dwelling remains whether the defendant\u2019s conduct unambiguously manifested consent to enter.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">The State emphasizes that Williams and the defendant were engaged in conversation as they walked up to and entered the apartment. That conversation included a discussion about what kind of identification the defendant needed to produce. It is undisputed that the defendant neither explicitly invited Williams to enter her apartment, nor explicitly granted him permission in response to a request to enter. She simply entered the apartment and Williams followed her.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Admittedly, we can conceive of circumstances in which a homeowner\u2019s conduct at the threshold of a dwelling might constitute unambiguous manifestation of consent to enter despite the absence of an explicit invitation. For example, a homeowner who holds the door ajar and physically indicates to an officer that he or she may enter to conduct a home safety survey may be found to have unambiguously consented to the officer\u2019s entry. The defendant\u2019s conduct in this case, however \u2014 entering her apartment while engaged in conversation with the officer and failing to instruct him not to enter \u2014 can hardly be described as manifesting unambiguous consent for Williams to enter the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">We hold that no reasonable fact finder could conclude that the State met its burden to establish the defendant\u2019s consent by a preponderance of the evidence. Therefore, Williams\u2019 presence in the defendant\u2019s apartment violated Part I, Article 19 of our State Constitution, and the trial court erred by refusing to suppress the handgun and all fruits that flowed therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b738-9\">BROCK, C.J., and BRODERICK and DALIANIS, JJ., concurred; HORTON, J., retired, specially assigned under RSA 490:3, concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
