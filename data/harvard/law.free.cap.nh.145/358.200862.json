We grant the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">In July 1998, the petitioner was tried before a jury in Superior Court <em>{Smith, </em>J.) for felonious sexual assault and aggravated felonious sexual assault. <em>See </em>RSA 632-A:2, :3 (1996 &amp; Supp. 1999). On July 24, the trial court notified counsel in chambers that the jury appeared to be deadlocked eleven to one in favor of acquittal. The court explained that one female juror \u201chad some type of early-in-life personal experience of a sexual nature,\u201d and that \u201cwhoever that person is\u201d had been overheard outside the jury room to say, \u201cI don\u2019t care what the rest of you people say. I\u2019m not changing my mind.\u201d When defense counsel asked whether the woman had failed to reveal the experience on her juror questionnaire, the court answered, \u201cIt must be, because I have reviewed all the questionnaires. There was a sexual assault on one of the men.\u201d After the court indicated that it might declare a mistrial, defense counsel moved for a mistrial. The trial court stated that it would not grant the motion at that time, but would call the jury into the courtroom, and if the foreperson indicated her belief that the jury was \u201chopelessly deadlocked,\u201d the motion would be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">Thereafter, the jury was called into the courtroom. The following bench conference ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-11\">[THE DEFENSE]: Your Honor, upon exiting, I was wondering about arguing a motion to have the juror excused and proceeding with an eleven-person panel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-12\">THE COURT: I can\u2019t do that, because I don\u2019t know who the juror is, and I don\u2019t have the right to inquire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-13\">[THE DEFENSE]: I guess my concern is . . . that the individual, whoever it is, fabricated or misled on the [juror] questionnaire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-14\">THE COURT: That\u2019s an assumption on your part, at this point in time. You remember the cases that have come <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>down from the Supreme Court as it relates to interfering with jury deliberations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-5\">[THE DEFENSE]: I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">THE COURT: The information that you were given by me is not information that you can use in any way, shape, manner or form.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">[THE DEFENSE]: I just \u2014 I expected a ruling, but I wanted at least to make an effort, under <em>State v. King, </em>[131 N.H. 173, 551 A.2d 973 (1988),] to go forward with a depleted panel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-9\">THE COURT: I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-10\">[THE DEFENSE]: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">The court inquired whether the jury foreperson believed the jury to be hopelessly deadlocked. When she answered affirmatively, the court excused the jury from the courtroom and announced without objection: \u201cAt the request of the defendant, this Court declares a mistrial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">The petitioner subsequently filed a motion for a directed verdict, which we construe as a motion to dismiss, on the basis that further prosecution was barred by double jeopardy. The trial court denied the motion and a subsequent request for an interlocutory appeal. This petition followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-13\">The petitioner argues that the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the United States and New Hampshire Constitutions, <em>see </em>U.S. Const. amend. V; N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 16, prohibit a retrial because the trial court declared the mistrial without \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d and without his consent. We address the petitioner\u2019s State constitutional claim first, referencing federal case law only as an analytical aid. <em>See State v. Cannuli, </em>143 N.H. 149, 151, 722 A.2d 450, 451 (1998). Because we find protection under the New Hampshire Constitution, we do not engage in a separate federal analysis. <em>See State v. Goodnow, </em>140 N.H. 38, 40, 662 A.2d 950, 951 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-14\">The Double Jeopardy Clause of the New Hampshire Constitution prohibits the State from placing a criminal defendant in jeopardy more than once for the same offense, thereby preserving the defendant\u2019s \u2018\u201cvalued right\u2019 to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal.\u201d <em>State v. Gould, </em>144 N.H. 415, 416, 743 A.2d 300, 302 (1999). Thus, the State may ordinarily retry the defendant after a declaration of mistrial over the defendant\u2019s objection \u201conly if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>there is a manifest necessity for the act, or the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated.\u201d <em>State v. Paquin, </em>140 N.H. 525, 528, 668 A.2d 47, 49 (1995) (quotation omitted). Where, however, the defendant has consented to the declaration, retrial is not barred unless the \u201cdefendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial is the result of judicial or prosecutorial impropriety that was intended to provoke the defendant into filing the motion.\u201d <em>Earnest v. Dorsey, </em>87 F.3d 1123, 1129 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 1016 (1996); <em>see State v. Duhamel, </em>128 N.H. 199, 202-03, 512 A.2d 420, 422 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">We need not decide whether the petitioner consented to the mistrial in this case because even if we were to conclude that he consented, retrial is barred under the peculiar circumstances of this case. The petitioner contends that the trial court possessed information suggesting that the holdout juror was not truthful on her questionnaire, that she was not deliberating with impartiality, and that the \u201capparent juror misconduct\u201d was affecting the jury deadlock. Therefore, the petitioner argues, the court had an obligation to address the misconduct while the jury was empaneled \u201cto protect . . . [the petitioner\u2019s] right to have his trial completed by a single tribunal.\u201d Because the court did not attempt to remedy the situation, but instead \u201cprohibit[ed] the defendant from using the information about the misconduct to pursue alternative remedies,\u201d the petitioner argues that a retrial would be unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">\u201cIt is a fundamental precept of our system of justice that a defendant has the right to be tried by a fair and impartial jury.\u201d <em>State v. Weir, </em>138 N.H. 671, 673, 645 A.2d 56, 57 (1994) (quotation omitted). \u201cAccordingly, a juror found to be disqualified at any time before or during the trial should be removed from further service.\u201d <em>State v. Rideout, </em>143 N.H. 363, 365, 725 A.2d 8, 9 (1999); <em>see also </em>RSA 500-A:12, II (1997) (\u201cIf it appears that any juror is not indifferent, he shall be set aside on that trial.\u201d). Where a juror\u2019s qualifications are called into doubt during trial, the trial judge \u201cshould carefully investigate every source which would be calculated to throw any light upon the competency of a juror, and if the judge is not entirely satisfied of the competency of the juror, such juror should be excused.\u201d <em>Weir, </em>138 N.H. at 678, 645 A.2d at 60 (quotation omitted); <em>see also United States v. Gaston-Brito, </em>64 F.3d 11, 12 (1st Cir. 1995) (court must undertake an adequate inquiry when it is apprised of potential juror bias during trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Once the trial court became aware that a juror may have failed to reveal information on her juror questionnaire that could have been grounds for her disqualification, the court had an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>independent obligation to <em>voir dire </em>the jurors individually and determine which, if any, had failed to disclose information that would justify her disqualification. <em>Cf. State v. Wong, </em>138 N.H. 56, 66, 635 A.2d 470, 477 (1993). We disagree with the State that such an inquiry would have required the court to interfere with the deliberative process by asking jurors the reasons for their votes. Rather, because the court knew that a female juror had made the reported comment, it simply needed to ask the female jurors individually whether any personal experiences biased their deliberations. If the court determined that a juror should have been disqualified, it could have excused that juror and, if it \u201cobtain[ed] a stipulation by the parties to proceed with fewer than twelve jurors,\u201d proceeded with an eleven-person panel. <em>State v. Dushame, </em>136 N.H. 309, 315, 616 A.2d 469, 472 (1992). Had the excused juror been the holdout juror, the deadlock would have been resolved. Although we cannot know whether these alternatives would have resolved the deadlock, the trial court had a duty to explore them. <em>Cf. Weir, </em>138 N.H. at 678, 645 A.2d at 60. Because the trial court did not elect to explore these alternatives, we conclude that under the unique circumstances of this case, it would be unfair to subject the defendant to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">\n<em>Petition granted.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b392-6\">JOHNSON, J., sat for oral argument but retired prior to the final vote; THAYER, j., sat for oral argument but resigned prior to the final vote; HORTON and BRODERICK, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
