The jury had returned a verdict for the defendant, Violet M. Joy. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-16\">This suit arose from a collision between an automobile driven by the defendant and a bicycle ridden by Mullin. The plaintiffs brought suit, and the jury returned a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiffs moved to set aside the verdict and for a new trial, <em>see </em>Super. Ct. R. 73, <em>arguing </em>that the jury\u2019s verdict was \u201cconclusively against the weight of the evidence\u201d and \u201c[flew] in the face of the law [and] the evidence.\u201d The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-17\">On appeal, the plaintiffs argue that the accident could not have occurred but for the defendant\u2019s negligence in failing to observe Mullin on his bicycle, only ten feet away.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-18\">\u201cA jury verdict may be set aside if it is conclusively against the weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>Broderick v. Watts, </em>136 N.H. 153, 162, 614 A.2d 600, 606 (1992). \u201cConclusively against the weight of the evidence should be interpreted to mean that the verdict was one no reasonable jury could return.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and brackets omit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>ted). We will uphold the trial court\u2019s decision on a motion to set aside a verdict unless the decision was made without evidence or the court abused its discretion. <em>See Eichel v. Payeur, </em>107 N.H. 194, 196, 219 A.2d 287, 288 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The plaintiffs assert that the uncontroverted evidence showed that Mullin had the right-of-way as he approached the defendant\u2019s automobile, the defendant failed to yield, and the collision occurred in Mullin\u2019s travel lane. Therefore, they argue that no reasonable jury could have found that the defendant did not violate RSA 259:91 (1993) and that she was not legally at fault. The plaintiffs further assert that the defendant\u2019s claim that the sun blinded her vision compelled her to exercise greater care by taking precautions to compensate for her lack of vision.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Mullin, as a bicyclist, had \u201call of the rights and [was] subject to all the duties applicable to the driver of any other vehicle under the rules of the road.\u201d RSA 265:143 (1993). One such right was the right-of-way, as RSA 259:91 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-7\">\u201cRight-of-way\u201d shall mean the right of one vehicle or pedestrian to proceed in a lawful manner in preference to another vehicle or pedestrian approaching under such circumstances of direction, speed or proximity as to give rise to the danger of collision unless one grants precedence to the other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">\u201cTraffic rules controlling rights of way . . . are designed to prevent accidents . . . .\u201d <em>Cusson v. Beauregard, </em>143 N.H. 410, 412, 727 A.2d 979, 981 (1999). We have held that \u201cone should not be relieved from responsibility for injuries resulting from his negligence where such negligence consists of the violation of a statute or ordinance designed to promote safety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">The evidence unequivocally established that the defendant failed to yield the right-of-way to Mullin and violated her statutory duty to yield to all oncoming traffic. <em>See </em>RSA 259:91. Mullin was injured in a collision with the defendant\u2019s automobile, precisely the type of accident the statute was intended to prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">The defendant testified that at about 3:00 p.m. on September 10, 1994, she was driving out of a gas station on Main Street in Salem. She testified that the traffic around the gas station was \u201cmoderate\u201d and that the road was fiat and straight. She brought her car to a stop at the end of the gas station\u2019s driveway and before the sidewalk. She testified that she looked twice in both directions for oncoming traffic, but that her vision was impaired when she looked left because \u201cthe sun was really bad.\u201d When she looked left for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>second time, even though her vision was impaired by the sun, the defendant was able to.see.an oncoming car, a fire station on the same side of the street as the gas station, and a blinking light near the fire station in the distance, but she \u201c[n]ever saw [Mullin] at all,\u201d who was approximately ten feet away.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">As the defendant checked for traffic, Mullin approached the defendant\u2019s automobile on his bicycle, traveling close to the white traffic line on the edge of the street. By his testimony, he was traveling between eighteen and twenty miles per hour. Mullin noticed the defendant\u2019s automobile stopped at the gas station when he was approximately one hundred feet away.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The defendant, despite being partially blinded by the sun, concluded it was safe and began to proceed into the roadway. Mullin testified that \u201c[rjight before I was to pass in front of her car to go by her, the car pulled out.\u201d He stated that he had \u201cno reaction time whatsoever\u201d as he was \u201cten or eight feet, less than ten feet\u201d from the defendant\u2019s car. when she pulled out into his travel lane. Mullin hit the defendant\u2019s vehicle, assumes that he went over the hood, and landed in the middle of the road beyond the car. The defendant \u201cstarted to proceed out,' and all of a sudden I heard a bump. And I saw \u2014 I saw the bike go, but I never saw the boy . . . .\u201d The defendant testified that she stopped her car immediately, \u201cright in the middle of the road.\u201d When asked by counsel what she meant by \u201cmiddle of the road,\u201d she testified, \u201cWell, I probably proceeded a little bit over. I mean, I stopped immediately. I can\u2019t say that I was directly just on my side. I probably was a little bit. But I was \u2014 I was blocking traffic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">In its jury charge, the trial court quoted RSA 259:91 and instructed: \u201cIf you find that there was a violation of that statute and that caused or contributed to cause the injuries to the plaintiff, that amounts to a legal fault.\u201d It also stated that \u201c[a] violation of the provisions of a statute, if you find that violation caused or contributed to cause the injury or damage suffered by the plaintiff, amounts to legal fault.\u201d The jury returned a verdict for the defendant, and the trial court subsequently denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to set aside the verdict and for a new trial, determining that the verdict was not conclusively against the weight of the evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Given the evidence at trial, the jury\u2019s verdict that the defendant was not legally at fault for the collision does not conform with the jury instruction on the duty to yield the right-of-way. The instruction stated that a failure to yield amounts to a legal fault. There can be no question here that the defendant violated that duty by failing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>to yield. <em>See </em>RSA 259:91. By her own admission, the defendant pulled into Mullin\u2019s travel lane and he struck her automobile. The defendant violated her duty to avoid injuring one who might be using the street while she was partially blinded by the sun. <em>See id.; cf. Hartigan v. </em>Robertson, 409 N.E.2d 366, 369 (Ill. App. Ct. 1980) (proceeding without vision has been described as negligence as matter of law). The collision would not have happened had the defendant seen Mullin and yielded to his right-of-way.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The defendant contends that a reasonable jury could have found her not negligent because evidence was presented that she was as careful as she could have been under the circumstances, and that the collision occurred despite her best efforts. <em>See generally Hackett v. Perron, </em>119 N.H. 419, 422, 402 A.2d 193, 195 (1979) (occurrence of accident does not require finding of fault). Although we have held that \u201ca motorist is not an insurer against all accidents involving injuries to [minors],\u201d <em>Ross v. Express Co., </em>100 N.H. 98, 100, 120 A.2d 335, 336 (1956), in this case the record is devoid of evidence that the defendant took any steps whatsoever to compensate for her lack of clear vision. The only excuse raised for not seeing the bicycle was that the \u201csun was real bad.\u201d At trial, the defendant did not present any evidence that she attempted to compensate for her lack of vision, such as raising her hand to block the sun, using a sun visor, sounding her horn before proceeding, inching out, or finding an alternative exit. In fact, she conceded that she was wearing her regular glasses and not sunglasses or clip-ons. Additionally, counsel conceded at oral argument that it was reasonably foreseeable that a bicycle might be on the road. She simply looked in both directions twice, thought that she could go, and pulled into Mullin\u2019s travel lane when she knew that she could not see clearly to her left. We agree with the court in <em>Tapp v. Blackmore Ranch, Inc., </em>575 N.W.2d 341, 348 (Neb. 1998), that sunlight \u201cis a condition that requires drivers to exercise a degree of care commensurate with the circumstances.\u201d The defendant took no such action. <em>See Addison v. Travelers Insurance Company, </em>281 So. 2d 805, 810 (La. Ct. App. 1973) (providing that driver blinded by sun has duty to reduce speed); <em>Barth v. Reichert, </em>181 N.E.2d 609, 612 (Ill. App. Ct. 1962) (driver may not be able to avoid being blinded by sunlight, but question is what driver does after being blinded).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Based on the evidence presented at trial, we conclude that no reasonable jury could conclude that the defendant did not fail to yield the right-of-way and was not at fault for the injuries to the plaintiffs. Accordingly, the trial court erred in denying the plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>motion to set aside the verdict and for a new trial. The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b130-6\">NADEAU, J., did not sit; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
