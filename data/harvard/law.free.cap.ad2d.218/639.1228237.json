The allegation is not that Elton Cunningham suffered lead poisoning but that as a result of his exposure to lead he was injured <em>(see, German v Federal Home Loan Mtge. Corp., </em>885 F Supp 537). Therefore, the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment was properly denied <em>(see, Alvarez v Prospect Hosp., </em>68 NY2d 320).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">The defendants\u2019 remaining contentions are without merit. O\u2019Brien, J. P., Joy, Goldstein and Florio, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
