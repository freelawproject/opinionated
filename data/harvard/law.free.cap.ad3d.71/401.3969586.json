Although defendant does not make any factual assertions outside the record, \u201c[w]ithout the benefit of additional facts that might have been developed after an appropriate postconviction motion, we cannot conclude that counsel\u2019s actions lacked any strategic or other legitimate explanation\u201d <em>(People v Denny, </em>95 NY2d 921, 923 [2000]). This is not one of the rare cases where the trial record itself permits review of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim challenging counsel\u2019s strategy <em>(see People v Brown, </em>45 NY2d 852 [1978]).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">We perceive no basis for reducing the sentence.
