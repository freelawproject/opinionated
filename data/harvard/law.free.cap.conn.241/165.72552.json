The issues in this certified appeal are: (1) whether Connecticut should adopt as the standard for the admissibility of scientific evidence the standard set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1993); and (2) whether Connecticut should abandon its traditional per se rule that polygraph evidence is inadmissible at trial. The defendant, Russell C. Hunter, appeals from the judgment of the Appellate Court affirming his conviction for robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Prior to trial, the defendant had moved to admit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>the results of an exculpatory polygraph examination. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion and, on the defendant\u2019s postconviction appeal, the Appellate Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>37 Conn. App. 907, 655 A.2d 291 (1995). This certified appeal followed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">The defendant claims that: (1) the Appellate Court incorrectly concluded that the trial court properly denied his request for an evidentiary hearing regarding the admissibility of polygraph evidence; and (2) in light of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision <em>in Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>supra, 509 U.S. 579, this court should reconsider its test for determining the admissibility of scientific evidence, which is currently based on <em>Frye </em>v. <em>United States, </em>293 F. 1013 (D.C. Cir. 1923), and should conclude that polygraph evidence is admissible under the <em>Daubert </em>test. We address these precise claims in <em>State </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 57, and for the reasons explained therein, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">In this opinion CALLAHAN, C. J., and NORCOTT, KATZ, PALMER and MCDONALD, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 provides in pertinent part: \u201cRobbery in the first degree: Class B felony, (a) A person is guilty of robbery in tire first degree when, in the course of the commission of the crime of robbery as defined in section 53a-133 or of immediate flight therefrom, he or another participant in the crime ... (4) displays or threatens the use of what he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>represents by his words or conduct to be a pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun, machine gun or other firearm . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b189-11\"> We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to appeal from the Appellate Court, limited to the following issues: \u201cUnder the circumstances of this case: 1. Did the Appellate Court properly conclude that the trial court was correct in denying the defendant\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing regarding 1he admissibility of the defendant\u2019s polygraph evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b189-12\">\u201c2. Should this court reconsider the applicability of the test for determining the admissibility of scientific evidence set forth in <em>Frye </em>v. <em>United States, </em>293 F. 1013 (D.C.

This appeal presents the same issue that was decided today in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>companion case of <em>State </em>v. <em>Porter, 241 </em>Conn. 57, 698 A.2d 739 (1997), pertaining to the standard for the admissibility of scientific evidence and the right to a hearing in order for a trial court to determine the admissibility of polygraph evidence. The defendant, Russell Hunter, an. African-American, was convicted of robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4). He was sentenced to sixteen years imprisonment, execution suspended after nine years.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The sole issue at trial was the identification of the defendant<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as the person who committed the robbery. On April 14, 1993, the defendant submitted to a polygraph test administered by Victor C. Kaufman, a polygraphist and chief examiner with New York Lie Detection Laboratories. Kaufman is a charter member of the American Polygraph Examiners of New York State, the Empire State Polygraphy Society, the Virginia Polygraph Association, the Association of Police Polygraphists and the American Polygraph Association, and he has conducted more than 10,000 polygraph examinations since 1958. Kaufman administered a \u201cfour pen Lafayette polygraph procedure\u201d to register changes in the blood pressure, rate and strength of pulse beat, galvanic skin response, and respiratory pattern of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">The pertinent questions asked during the defendant\u2019s polygraph examination, and the indicated answers, were as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">\u201cOn December 6, 1992 [the day of the robbery], did you take any money out of Morcey\u2019s Restaurant, 572 Watertown Avenue [the place of the robbery]?</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">\u201cNo.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>\u201cOn December 6, 1992, did you rob Morcey\u2019s Restaurant, 572 Watertown Avenue?</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">\u201cNo.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">\u201cOn December 6, 1992, were you inside Morcey\u2019s Restaurant, 572 Watertown Avenue?</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">In his report, based upon the polygraph examination, Kaufman concluded: \u201cNo deception was indicated in this examinee\u2019s recorded responses to the above relevant questions and it is this polygraphist\u2019s opinion that Russell Hunter answered all these questions truthfully.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">Several days before the defendant\u2019s trial, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to admit the polygraph results into evidence and held that the defendant was not entitled to a full hearing on the motion. The defendant subsequently testified at his trial that he did not participate in the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">As I indicated in my concurring and dissenting opinion in <em>State </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 145-47, upon adopting the standard set forth in <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 592-95, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1993), for the admissibility of scientific evidence, the trial court should be the court to determine whether the polygraph evidence is admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">In my view, the majority, by adopting its per se rule, which denies the defendant a right to a hearing on the admissibility of exculpatory polygraph evidence, violates his due process rights and his right to present a defense under the federal and state constitutions. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 161 <em>(Berdon, J., </em>concurring and dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-13\">Accordingly, I dissent with respect to the issue of the admissibility of polygraph evidence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b190-10\"> See footnote 4 of my concurring and dissenting opinion in <em>State </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 138-39 n.4, with respect to the inherent unreliability of cross-racial identification.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
