The plaintiffs, Frederick J. Loulis and Margaret, Loulis,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeal, upon our grant of certification, from the judgment of the Appellate Court affirming the trial court\u2019s judgment of dismissal of their action on the ground that the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiffs sought an injunction against the defendants, Bart Center, Inc., and Vernon Bartosik and Dean B. Parrott,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> barring the use of certain property as a package store in the town of Monroe. In their complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that the proposed use of the property would violate the Monroe zoning regulations. On appeal to this court, the plaintiffs claim that the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies does not apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>to the circumstances of this case and that the Appellate Court improperly affirmed the trial <em>court\u2019s </em>judgment of dismissal. We agree and reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The facts and procedural history relevant to this appeai are undisputed. The plaintiffs initially brought an action by way of an application for a temporary and permanent injunction, and an order to show cause, dated February 13, 1995, and returnable on March 28, 1995. In their amended complaint, the factual allegations of which must be taken as true for the purpose of review of the judgment of dismissal; <em>Antinerella </em>v. <em>Rioux, </em>229 Conn. 479, 489, 493, 642 A.2d 699 (1994); the plaintiffs alleged the following. The plaintiffs are residents and taxpayers of Monroe. Bart Center, Inc., owns the property in question, which is located at 600 Main Street, Monroe. The property is located in a design business No. 1 zoning district under the Monroe zoning regulations. There was a permitted package store on that property, encompassing 1200 square feet within a larger building and operated by a tenant. On February 11, 1979, the zoning regulations were amended to permit package stores in design business No. 2 zoning districts only. Any package store operating in a design business No. 1 zoning district as of that date was a nonconforming use. By virtue of this amendment of the zoning regulations, the package store at that location became a nonconforming use.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint further alleged that in February, 1980, the defendants entered into a new lease with the package store tenant under which the tenant relinquished occupancy of the original 1200 square feet and occupied 2380 square feet located in another part of the building. The defendants entered into this new lease without the town\u2019s zoning approval and without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>obtaining a certificate of zoning compliance. The plaintiffs alleged that the relocation of the package store violated the zoning regulations because the operation of a package store in a different location was neither a permitted nor a nonconforming use. In their complaint, the plaintiffs further alleged that pursuant to the applicable zoning regulations, the right to a nonconforming use of the original 1200 square foot portion of the premises expired one year after the use had been abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">In June, 1984, the plaintiffs, unaware of the ongoing zoning violations, leased the relocated package store from the defendants. Upon the expiration of the lease, the defendants evicted the plaintiffs from the property. Thereafter, the plaintiffs obtained approval from the state liquor control commission to move their package store permit to a new location at 630 Main Street, where they are presently operating a package store.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">In 1987, the defendants enlarged the package store on the property from 2380 square feet to 3600 square feet, which included the original 1200 square feet. The enlargement itself was allegedly another violation of the zoning regulations because no certificate of zoning compliance had been obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">In May, 1994, the defendants leased the 3600 square foot package store to Parrott. The lease was conditioned on Parrott\u2019s obtaining a package store permit from the liquor control commission.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On May 4, 1994, Parrott, as required by General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>\u00a7 30-39,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> requested certification from the town that the location of the proposed 3600 square foot package store complied with the Monroe zoning regulations. The town planning administrator certified Parrott\u2019s application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>(May, 1994 zoning certificate), which Parrott had submitted to the liquor control commission. The plaintiffs alleged that the May, 1994 zoning certificate was erroneously issued because: (1) the nonconforming use that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>would have allowed part of the property to be used as a package store had been abandoned; (2) the remainder of the premises had never been approved for the sale of liquor; and (3) the location is within 1500 feet of another package store, namely, the plaintiffs\u2019 store, in violation of applicable zoning regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The plaintiffs further alleged that, on January 12, 1995, the liquor control commission, relying on the erroneously issued May, 1994 zoning certificate, approved Parrott\u2019s package store permit. Although the plaintiffs appealed from the approval by the liquor control commission to the Superior Court, the plaintiffs alleged that Parrott could nonetheless commence business under the permit before the appeal is decided. Thus, in summary, the plaintiffs alleged that the town failed and refused to enforce its zoning regulations against the proposed illegal use of the property, and that unless the zoning regulations were enforced by way of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>injunction, the plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm for which there is no adequate legal remedy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">The defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 injunction action on the ground, among others, that the plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. Specifically, the defendants pointed to the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to appeal, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-6 and 8-7,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to the Monroe zoning board of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>appeals (board) from the certification by the planning administrator that Parrott\u2019s proposed use of the property would be in compliance with zoning regulations. At the evidentiary portion of the hearing on the motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>to dismiss, held on May 15, 1995, it was established that while this action was pending Parrott had applied to the town zoning enforcement officer for a permanent certificate of zoning compliance in order to obtain a building permit. It was also established that on March 27, 1995, the zoning enforcement officer had issued Parrott a permanent certificate (March, 1995 zoning certificate), that on April 26, 1995, the plaintiffs had appealed from that action to the board, and that the appeal to the board was pending at the time of the May, 1995 hearing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It was fuither established that in May, 1994, the then zoning enforcement officer had issued a certificate of zoning compliance regarding the property for purposes of certifying such compliance to the liquor control commission, and that with regard to both the May, 1994 and the March, 1995 certificates of zoning compliance, no notice by publication was required or made, and no actual notice was required or given to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Thereafter, the defendants filed a supplemental motion to dismiss the injunction action, claiming that the plaintiffs\u2019 pending appeal to the board from the March, 1995 zoning certificate afforded them access to an administrative remedy that the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust. The trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, finding that the plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies, based on the pendency of the plaintiffs\u2019 April 26, 1995 appeal from the March 27, 1995 action of the zoning enforcement officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The plaintiffs appealed from the judgment of dismissal to the Appellate Court. The Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of dismissal, but on grounds different from those on which the trial court had relied. The Appellate Court held that the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to appeal, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 8-6 and 8-7, to the board from the issuance of the May, 1994 zoning certificate constituted a failure to exhaust their administrative remedies. <em>Loulis </em>v. <em>Parrott, </em>42 Conn. App. 272, 283, 679 A.2d 967 (1996). This certified appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">We first consider the reasoning of the Appellate Court, which is endorsed by the defendants, that the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to appeal to the board from the May, 1994 certification by the zoning enforcement officer deprived the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction over this injunction action, because such an appeal was an available administrative remedy that the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust. We disagree with the Appellate Court and the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">There is no dispute that, as a general matter, the failure of a party to exhaust an available administrative remedy is a subject matter jurisdictional bar to a plenary action in court to test the same issue that the administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>live remedy was designed to test. <em>Bauer </em>v. <em>Waste Management of Connecticut, Inc., </em>234 Conn. 221, 231, 662 A.2d 1179 (1995); <em>Country Lands, Inc. </em>v. <em>Swinnerton, </em>151 Conn. 27, 33-34, 193 A.2d 483 (1963). The two part rationale for the exhaustion doctrine is: (1) to effectuate the legislative intent that the issue in question \u201c \u2018be handled in the first instance by local administrative officials in order to provide aggrieved persons with full and adequate administrative relief, and to give the reviewing court the benefit of the local board\u2019s judgment\u2019 \u201d; <em>Simko </em>v. <em>Ervin, </em>234 Conn. 498, 504, 661 A.2d 1018 (1995); and (2) to relieve \u201c \u2018courts of the burden of prematurely deciding questions\u2019 \u201d that may be resolved satisfactorily through the administrative process. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">It is also beyond dispute, however, that \u201c[t]he right of appeal, if it is to have any value, must necessarily contemplate that the person who is to exercise the right be given the opportunity of knowing that there is a decision to appeal from and of forming an opinion as to whether that decision presents an appealable issue.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Keeney </em>v. <em>Old Saybrook, </em>237 Conn. 135, 155-56, 676 A.2d 795 (1996). \u201cUntil the prospective appellant has either actual or constructive notice that a decision has been reached, the right of appeal is meaningless.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bridgeport Bowl-O-Rama, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>195 Conn. 276, 281, 487 A.2d 559 (1985); <em>Hubbard </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>151 Conn. 269, 272, 196 A.2d 760 (1963). The Appellate Court\u2019s reasoning founders on this principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">In the present case, the plaintiffs had no actual or constructive notice of the issuance of the May, 1994 zoning certificate to Parrott by the zoning enforcement officer, and there was no provision in the zoning regulations for such notice. For this reason alone, the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>cannot be deemed to have failed to exhaust the administrative appellate process by which that issuance might have been challenged. The legislature could not possibly have intended that the plaintiffs be required to exhaust an administrative process of which they neither had notice nor even had any right to notice. We see no justification in our zoning statutes for inferring such an intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The defendants rely on <em>Astarita v. Liquor Control Commission, </em>165 Conn. 185, 190, 332 A.2d 106 (1973), for the proposition that the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to appeal to the board constituted a failure to exhaust their administrative remedies. That reliance is misplaced. In <em>Astarita, </em>the local zoning enforcement officer denied the plaintiffs application for a certification that the local zoning regulations did not prohibit a grocery store beer permit at the plaintiffs grocery store premises. Id., 186-87. The plaintiff, instead of appealing that decision to the zoning board of appeals, as provided in the local zoning regulations and \u00a7 8-6, filed an application for a permit with the liquor control commission. Id., 187. The commission denied the plaintiffs application on the ground that it would be in violation of the local zoning regulations, and the plaintiff appealed from that decision to the trial court. Id. This court held that the plaintiffs failure, in those circumstances, to appeal from the zoning enforcement officer\u2019s decision to the zoning board of appeals constituted a failure to exhaust an available administrative remedy, depriving the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs subsequent administrative appeal. Id., 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\"><em>Astarita </em>does not support the defendants\u2019 position in the present case. The plaintiff in <em>Astarita </em>had full notice of the denial of his application by the zoning enforcement officer and, therefore, of the availability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>of a timely appeal to the zoning board of appeals. Thus, it was wholly consistent with the rationale of the exhaustion doctrine to require the plaintiff to exhaust the administrative process that he had initiated. It would be wholly inconsistent with that rationale, however, to apply it to a third party to that process who had no notice of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The defendants also rely on the Appellate Court\u2019s decision in <em>Koepke </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>30 Conn. App. 395, 620 A.2d 811 (1993), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 230 Conn. 452, 645 A.2d 983 (1994), for the proposition that the plaintiffs\u2019 lack of notice of the issuance of the May, 1994 zoning certificate in the present case does not excuse their failure to appeal to the board from that certification. We agree that the Appellate Court has so held. In <em>Koepke, </em>the court stated: \u201cWhile it is true that an aggrieved person has the right to take issue with the granting of a zoning permit, the legislature has not required that notice of the granting of a permit be given nor would it seem practical to give such notice for the literally thousands of such zoning and building permits that are issued on an almost daily basis across the state. We therefore conclude that [the abutting defendant\u2019s thirty day] time to appeal began to ran at the time of the initial issuance of the permit; whether she received actual or constructive notice is irrelevant.\u201d Id., 402-403; see also <em>Bosley </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>30 Conn. App. 797, 800, 622 A.2d 1020 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">We disagree with that reasoning, however, and disavow it as a valid statement of the law. It is trae that the legislature has not required notice to be given regarding an administrative action such as a zoning or building permit. That does not necessarily mean, however, that the legislature also intended to bar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>aggrieved persons from the courts based on their failure to exhaust an administrative remedy when they seek to challenge the issuance of a permit of which they had no notice. Inferring such an intent would be contrary to the fundamental principle that, without notice that a decision has been reached, the right to appeal from that decision is meaningless. <em>Bridgeport Bowl-O-Rama, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 195 Conn. 281. We will not infer legislative intent to dispense with such a fundamental principle in the absence of a clear indication of such an intent. Cf. <em>In re Daniel H., </em>237 Conn. 364, 376, 678 A.2d 462 (1996). There is no such indication in \u00a7\u00a7 8-6 and 8-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Furthermore, the fact that many such permits may be issued does not mean that such a permit is free from subsequent challenge by a party who is aggrieved by it but was ignorant of, and not entitled to notice of, its issuance. The legal benefits of such a permit, however many are issued, do not include a fundamentally unfair immunity from challenge by a party who is so aggrieved. Indeed, it is only proper to allow such an aggrieved party to challenge the permit\u2019s validity in an appropriate judicial forum, given the lack of notice and consequent lack of meaningful opportunity to pursue an administrative appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">The defendants also claim that the plaintiffs\u2019 lack of notice of the issuance of the May, 1994 zoning certificate was cured by the notice that Parrott was required to give, pursuant to \u00a7 30-39 (b) (3), in connection with his subsequent application to the liquor control commission. See footnote 5 of this opinion. Thus, the defendants argue that, although the plaintiffs did not have actual notice of the zoning certification, \u201cthey had constructive notice of the certification of zoning compliance by virtue of the newspaper publication of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>notice of the application for the liquor permit, and the physical posting of notice at the site, required of the defendant Parrott.\u201d This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Even if we were to assume without deciding that constructive, rather than actual, notice of the type provided by \u00a7 30-39 (b) (3) would be sufficient to satisfy the principle that the right to appeal must be preceded by adequate notice; <em>Keeney </em>v. <em>Old Saybrook, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 155-56; the notice provided for under \u00a7 30-39 (b) (3) is insufficient to invoke the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies so as to bar the plaintiffs in the present case. First, that notice is given pursuant to a different statutory scheme from the zoning statutes. The plaintiffs\u2019 purported appeal rights, on which the defendants rely, arose, if at all, under \u00a7 8-7. See footnote 7 of this opinion. Under that statute, the appeal is to be taken \u201cwithin thirty days\u201d of the action appealed from. The record does not disclose that the constructive notice afforded by \u00a7 30-39 (b) (3), posted with regard to Parrott\u2019s application for a liquor permit, was given within thirty days of the granting of the certification of zoning compliance so as to afford the plaintiffs a realistic opportunity to appeal to the board under \u00a7 8-7. Second, the constructive notice afforded by \u00a7 30-39 (b) (3), by newspaper publication and by posting of a placard, extends only to the name and residence of the proposed permittee, the type of permit applied for, the location of lire place of business, and the type of live entertainment to be provided. Thus, it does not, except by implication,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> give constructive notice that the local zoning official has certified that the premises are approved for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>a liquor license under the local zoning regulations. Such an implication, drawn from a constructive notice to begin with, would have been insufficient to notify the plaintiffs of the May, 1994 zoning certificate by the zoning enforcement officer so as to invoke the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Having concluded that the Appellate Court\u2019s reasoning was flawed, we turn to the defendants\u2019 proposed alternate ground on which to affirm that judgment. The defendants claim that the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine bars the plaintiffs from bringing this action because of the March and April, 1995 proceedings, in which the defendants, while this action was pending, had successfully applied to the zoning enforcement officer for a permanent certificate of compliance. The plaintiffs, upon learning of the March, 1995 zoning certificate, had appealed to the board from the zoning enforcement officer\u2019s grant of the certificate. The defendants assert that this action, which the plaintiffs had instituted before those administrative proceedings, \u201cimproperly preempted\u201d the defendants\u2019 application for a permanent certificate of zoning compliance from the local zoning enforcement officer. Thus, the defendants contend that the plaintiffs \u201ccannot avoid a required zoning procedure by prematurely filing a civil suit and requesting injunctive relief under the guise of a \u2018private zoning enforcement action\u2019 prior to [the defendants\u2019] requesting necessary zoning or planning approvals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">In effect, then, the defendants claim that the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine prevents \u201cimproper\u201d preemptive strikes: it precludes one party from bringing a civil action to challenge an alleged zoning violation by another party, where that <em>other </em>party will be required to undertake, but has not yet undertaken, administrative proceedings concerning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>conduct underlying the alleged violation, and it thus operates as an absolute shield against such an action. Under the defendants\u2019 view, if one party brings such an action, administrative proceedings subsequently initiated by the other party divest the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction over the action. We disagree with this application of the exhaustion doctrine in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">First, we have never applied the doctrine in such a manner, and the defendants cite no cases in support of such an application. Traditionally, the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine has been applied where the administrative proceedings were available to be invoked before the institution of the action, and the decision to invoke or forgo the administrative remedy at issue was within the control of the party against whom the doctrine was applied. See, e.g., <em>Simko </em>v. <em>Ervin, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 503 (plaintiff whose request for cease and desist order was denied barred from bringing subsequent injunction action because of failure to appeal from such denial to zoning board of appeals); <em>Greenwich </em>v. <em>Kristoff, </em>180 Conn. 575, 578, 430 A.2d 1294 (1980) (defendant who had not appealed from cease and desist order against him barred, in subsequent zoning enforcement action by zoning enforcement officer, from raising defense of nonconforming use). In the present case, however, the defendants seek the application of the exhaustion doctrine where the administrative proceedings postdate the institution of the action and the decision to invoke or forgo the administrative process lay, not in the control of the plaintiffs, against whom the doctrine is sought to be applied, but in the control of the defendants, who seek to benefit from its application.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">We see no sound reason to extend the exhaustion doctrine to this situation. It is one thing to require a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>party, who has the power to invoke or forgo the administrative process, to invoke it before resorting to the courts. It is quite another to require a third party to refrain from invoking his or her right to proceed to court simply because a party has an administrative process available to him or her, over which the third party has no control and with regard to which that third party may or may not be an actual party.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Furthermore, to the extent that the defendants seek to invoke the exhaustion doctrine based on the administrative proceedings that they initiated subsequent to the bringing of this action, their position must fail. In effect, the defendants argue that those subsequently initiated proceedings divested the court of its subject matter jurisdiction over this action. That argument is simply contrary to settled law. \u201cAs a general rule, jurisdiction once acquired is not lost or divested by subsequent events.\u201d <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Mars, </em>138 Conn. 593, 601, 87 A.2d 388 (1952); <em>States v. One 1976 Chevrolet Van, </em>19 Conn. App. 195, 199, 562 A.2d 62 (1989).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, just as the exhaustion doctrine does not bar the plaintiffs from bringing this action, the exhaustion doctrine does not serve to divest the court of its jurisdiction over the action itself.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to reverse the judgment of the trial court and to remand the case to that court for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b203-10\"> Initially, there were four additional plaintiffs in the action for an injunction, including Mary Riga, Seraphina Cascella, Robert Riga and Corrine Riga.

The department may, at its discretion, conduct an investigation to determine whether apermit shall be issued to an applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">\"(2) The applicant shall pay to the department a nonrefundable application fee, which fee shall be in addition to the fees prescribed in this chapter for the permit sought. An application fee shall not be charged for an application to renew a permit. The application fee shall be in the amount of ten dollars for the filing of each application for a permit by a charitable organization, including a nonprofit public television corporation, a nonprofit golf tournament permit, a temporary permit or a special club permit; and for all other permits in the amount of one hundred dollars for the filing of an initial application.

Notice of any such change shall be given to the department and the permit shall be endorsed to show correct ownership.

No such board shall be required to hear any application for the same variance or substantially the same variance for a period of six months after a decision by the board or by a court on an earlier such application.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">\u201c(b) Any variance granted by a zoning board of appeals shall run with the land and shall not be personal in nature to the person who applied for and received the variance. A variance shall not be extinguished solely because of the transfer of title to the property or the invalidity of any condition attached to the variance that would affect the transfer of the property from the person who initially applied for and received the variance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">General Statutes \u00a7 8-7 provides: \u201cAppeals to board. Hearings. Effective date of exceptions or variances; filing requirements. The concurring vote of four members of the zoning board of appeals shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement or decision of the official charged with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>enforcement of the zoning regulations or to decide in favor of the applicant any matter upon which it is required to pass under any bylaw, ordinance, rule or regulation or to vary the application of the zoning bylaw, ordinance, rule or regulation. An appeal may be taken to the zoning board of appeals by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, board or bureau of any municipality aggrieved and shall be taken within such time as is prescribed by a rule adopted by said board, or, if no such rule is adopted by the board, within thirty days, by filing with the zoning commission or the officer from whom the appeal has been taken and with said board a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The officer from whom the appeal has been taken shall forthwith transmit to said board all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. An appeal shall not stay any such order, requirement or decision which prohibits further construction or expansion of a use in violation of such zoning regulations except to such extent that the board grants a stay thereof. An appeal from any other order, requirement or decision shall stay all proceedings in the action appealed from unless the zoning commission or the officer from whom the appeal has been taken certifies to the zoning board of appeals after the notice of appeal has been filed that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case proceedings shall not be stayed, except by a restraining order which may be granted by a court of record on application, on notice to the zoning commission or the officer from whom the appeal has been taken and on due cause shown. Such board shall, within the period of time permitted under section 8-7d, hear such appeal and give due notice thereof to the parties. Notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be published in a newspaper having a substantial circulation in such municipality at least twice at intervals of not less than two days, the first not more than fifteen days, nor less than ten days, and the last not less than two days before such hearing. In addition to such notice, such board may, by regulation, provide for notice by mail to persons who are owners of land which is adjacent to the land which is the subject of the hearing. At such hearing any party may appear in person and may be represented by agent or by attorney. Such board may reverse or affirm wholly or partly or may modify any order, requirement or decision appealed from and shall make such order, requirement or decision as in its opinion should be made in the premises and shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal has been taken but only in accordance with the provisions of this section. Whenever a zoning board of appeals grants or denies any special exception or variance in the zoning regulations applicable to any property or sustains or reverses wholly or partly any order, requirement or decision appealed from, it shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>state upon its records the reason for its decision and the zoning bylaw, ordinance or regulation which is varied in its application or to which an exception is granted and, when a variance is granted, describe specifically the exceptional difficulty or unusual hardship on which its decision is based. Notice of the decision of the board shall be published in a newspaper having a substantial circulation in the municipality and addressed by certified mail to any person who appeals to the board, by its secretary or clerk, under his signature in any written, printed, typewritten or stamped form, within fifteen days after such decision has been rendered. In any case in which such notice is not published within such fifteen-day period, the person who requested or applied for such special exception or variance or took such appeal may provide for the publication of such notice within ten days thereafter. Such exception or variance shall become effective upon the filing of a copy thereof (1) in the office of the town, city or borough clerk, as the case may be, but, in the case of a district, in the offices of both the district clerk and the town clerk of the town in which such district is located and (2) in the land records of the town in which the affected premises are located, in accordance with the provisions of section 8-3d.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b211-7\"> Although no notice of the March 27, 1995 action of the zoning enforcement officer had been given to the plaintiffs, they assert that they learned of the action while taking the defendants\u2019 deposition in this case. The defendants do not contest this assertion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b217-7\"> The implication would arise from the fact that, under \u00a7 30-39 (b) (1); see footnote 5 of this opinion; the application must establish that the local zoning regulations do not prohibit the liquor license that is the subject of the application. The notice required by \u00a7 30-39 (b) (3), however, does not include that information.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b220-7\"> Indeed, in this case the plaintiffs were not involved in or given notice of the defendants\u2019 March, 1995 application for apermanent zoning certificate, and only learned of it when they took the defendants\u2019 deposition in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b220-8\"> An exception to this rule, however, is that subsequent events that render a case moot will result in a loss of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Ayala </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>236 Conn. 89, 93-94, 671 A.2d 345 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b220-9\"> The plaintiffs also contend that the exhaustion doctrine does not apply in this case because \u201c[u]nder a long line of cases, neighbors and opponents do not have to exhaust administrative remedies by appealing zoning permits and certificates of compliance issued to the property owner, and can bring directly an injunction action for private zoning enforcement to eliminate a zoning violation.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Tripp, </em>204 Conn. 67, 75, 527 A.2d 230 (1987); <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Soffer, </em>183 Conn. 67, 69-72, 438 A.2d 1163 (1981); <em>Blum </em>v. <em>Lisbon Leasing Corp., Inc., </em>173 Conn. 175, 179-80, 377 A.2d 280 (1977); <em>Scoville </em>v. <em>Ronalter, </em>162 Conn. 67, 74, 291 A.2d 222 (1971). The defendants contend, to the contrary, that the line of cases on which the plaintiffs rely has a narrower scope than the plaintiffs\u2019 formulation, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>the \u201ccases relied upon by [the] plaintiffs for this proposition are, in fact, cases of nuisance, or claims that the plaintiffs suffered special and peculiar injuries.\u201d The defendants contend, accordingly, that the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint does not fall within this line of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-13\">We need not decide this issue in this appeal. The cases cited by the plaintiffs and sought to be distinguished by the defendants involved a determination by this court that the exhaustion doctrine did not bar the particular injunctive and other relief sought therein. We have decided in the present case that there was no administrative remedy that the plaintiffs were required to exhaust before bringing their complaint. Our task is therefore at an end. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief on the allegations of their complaint and the proof adduced thereunder has never been addressed, either by the trial court or the Appellate Court, and is thus beyond the scope of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
