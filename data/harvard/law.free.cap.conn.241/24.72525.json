In 1987, the plaintiff, the Connecticut National Bank, brought this action against the defendants, Julius and Dora Rytman (Rytmans),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to foreclose on certain mortgaged property. Thereafter, the Rytmans filed a substitute counterclaim against the plaintiff. In addition, the Rytmans cited in, and filed an amended cross complaint against, the third party defendants, Kofkoff Egg Farm Limited Partnership (Kofkoff Egg Farm), Fitchville Realty, Inc. (Fitch-ville Realty), Samuel Kofkoff, Robert Kofkoff, Joseph Fortin, Norwich Savings Society (Norwich Savings), Milton Jacobson, Glenn Gordon, and the law firm of Brown, Jacobson, Jewett and Laudone, P.C. (Brown, Jacobson).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff and the third party defendants then filed a motion for summary judgment on the substitute counterclaim and amended cross complaint, respectively. The trial court, <em>Silbert, J., </em>granted summary judgment as to the substitute counterclaim in its entirety and as to certain counts of the amended cross complaint. The Rytmans appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">The following facts can be gleaned from the pleadings and various motions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Beginning in the 1960s and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>extending into the late 1980s, the Rytmans, owners and operators of an egg and grain business in Connecticut, entered into a series of loan agreements with the plaintiff. The loans were secured by the Rytmans\u2019 real and personal property. Norwich Savings, one of the third party defendants, participated in one of these loan agreements. Also during the late 1970s and the 1980s, the Rytmans entered into a series of egg sales and distribution agreements with Kofkoff Egg Farm and Colchester Foods, Inc. (Colchester Foods), entities owned by Samuel Kofkoff, Robert Kofkoff and Fortin, also third party defendants. In conjunction with these agreements, Colchester Foods lent approximately $500,000 to the Rytmans.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">In part as a result of the failure of the egg sales and distribution agreements, the Rytmans were not able to make payments on their loans to the plaintiff, to Norwich Savings, or to Colchester Foods. Consequently, the plaintiff assumed control over the financial management of the Rytmans\u2019 business, and Colchester Foods assumed control over its day-to-day operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">In October, 1987, the plaintiff and the Rytmans entered into a work-out agreement in order to satisfy the Rytmans\u2019 debts through a distribution of assets. Also participating in this work-out agreement were Colchester Foods, Kofkoff Egg Farm, Fitchville Realty, Samuel Kofkoff, Robert Kofkoff, Fortin and Norwich Savings. The Rytmans entered into this agreement on the advice of their counsel, Jacobson, Gordon and Brown, Jacobson. In accordance with the agreement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>the plaintiff immediately instituted these foreclosure proceedings on the Rytmans\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">The Rytmans do not deny having entered into the work-out agreement, but they challenge its validity as the culmination of a collective effort on the part of the plaintiff and third party defendants to drive them out of business and to seize their assets. Advised by new counsel, they opposed the plaintiffs foreclosure proceedings and filed a nineteen count substitute counterclaim (counterclaim) alleging, inter alia, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of a covenant of good faith and fair dealing, economic duress, fraud, conspiracy, tortious interference, and infliction of emotional distress.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although the Rytmans sought to try the counterclaim to a jury, the trial court, <em>Hendel, J., </em>struck the foreclosure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>proceeding, and with it the counterclaim, from the jury list.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">The Rytmans also cited in, and filed a cross complaint against, the third party defendants. As amended, the cross complaint contained twenty-eight separate counts<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and alleged causes of action based on common-law and statutory grounds similar to those raised in the counterclaim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In addition, the cross complaint alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>legal malpractice on the part of Jacobson, Gordon and Brown, Jacobson. The trial court, <em>Hendel, J., </em>severed the action on the cross complaint from the underlying foreclosure proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">While this foreclosure action, including its counterclaim and cross complaint, was still pending, the Rytmans instituted a separate action against the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>and third party defendants together. Relying on essentially the same operative facts that underlay their counterclaim and cross complaint, the Rytmans alleged in that separate action that the conduct of the plaintiff and third party defendants had violated RICO. Shortly thereafter, Norwich Savings, with the consent of the other third party defendants, and over the objection of the Rytmans, removed the RICO action to the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">In the District Court, the plaintiff and all third party defendants, with the exception of Norwich Savings, filed motions to dismiss the RICO action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12 (b) (6).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Norwich Savings independently filed a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 (b).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The District Court granted the motions to dismiss and the motion for summary judgment. <em>Rytman </em>v. <em>Kofkoff Egg Farm Ltd. Partnership, </em>United States District Court, Docket No. 2:91CV01146 (PCD) (D. Conn. September 3, 1992). On the Rytmans\u2019 appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, that court affirmed the judgment of the District Court. <em>Rytman </em>v. <em>Kofkoff Egg Farm Ltd. Partnership, </em>United States Court of Appeals, Docket Nos. 93-7061, 93-7177 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>(2d Cir. June 21,1993). The Court of Appeals concluded that the Rytmans had failed to state a claim under RICO and had failed to adduce any material facts to demonstrate a violation thereof. Id. The United States Supreme Court denied the Rytmans\u2019 petition for certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Thereafter, the plaintiff and third party defendants filed separate motions for summary judgment in this state court action, contending that, under the doctrine of res judicata, the federal court disposition of the RICO action precluded the Rytmans from pursuit of their state court counterclaim and cross complaint. The trial court, <em>Silbert, J., </em>granted these motions, with respect to the counterclaim and all but five counts of the cross complaint, not on the basis of res judicata but on the basis of collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">On appeal, the parties primarily dispute the propriety of the summary judgment. The Rytmans contend that although the trial court, <em>Silbert, J., </em>properly refused to apply the doctrine of res judicata, it improperly determined that the legal issues raised in the RICO action were sufficiently identical to those raised in the counterclaim and cross complaint to warrant the application of collateral estoppel. The plaintiff and third party defendants, on the other hand, although supporting the trial court\u2019s use of collateral estoppel, contend, in the alternative, that the doctrine of res judicata also bar\u2019s the state court litigation in its entirety. In addition, the Rytmans contend that the trial court, <em>Hendel, J., </em>improperly struck the foreclosure action from the jury list and also improperly severed their cross complaint from the underlying foreclosure proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">Before considering the merits of the Rytmans\u2019 claims, we must first determine whether the trial court\u2019s partial summary judgment on the cross complaint constitutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>a reviewable final judgment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The trial court, <em>Silbert, J., </em>granted summary judgment on the cross complaint with respect to counts four through twenty-one and twenty-three through twenty-seven, but denied summary judgment with respect to counts one, two, three, twenty-two and twenty-eight. See footnote 7 of this opinion. The plaintiff and third party defendant Norwich Savings contend that the court\u2019s denial of summary judgment on these five counts renders nonfinal and nonappealable the entire summary judgment on the rest of the cross complaint. See Practice Book \u00a7 4000. We disagree and conclude that, under Practice Book \u00a7 4002B,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the partial summary judgment decision is final with respect to those parties not named in the five outstanding counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">It is well established that appellate courts in this state do not have jurisdiction to entertain appeals not taken from final judgments. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-263; <em>State </em>v. Curdo, 191 Conn. 27, 30, 463 A.2d 566 (1983). The lack of a final judgment is a jurisdictional defect that mandates dismissal. See, e.g., <em>Stroiney </em>v. <em>Crescent Lake Tax </em>District, 197 Conn. 82, 86, 495 A.2d 1063 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Although the denial of a motion for summary judgment does not ordinarily constitute an appealable final judgment, Practice Book \u00a7 4002B recognizes that an appeal from a summary judgment on less than all counts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>of a cross complaint is permissible to the extent that the judgment \u201cdisposes of all causes of action . . . brought . . . against a particular party or parties.\u201d See <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra, 191 Conn. 31 (final judgment occurs where action concludes rights of party such that further proceedings cannot affect them). In this case, the five counts not disposed of by summary judgment were directed against Colchester Foods (counts one and three), Robert Kofkoff and Fortin (count two), and Jacobson, Gordon and Brown, Jacobson (counts twenty-two and twenty-eight). Accordingly, the summary judgment did not conclude the Rytmans\u2019 action against these six third party defendants and does not constitute a final judgment with respect thereto. Practice Book \u00a7 4002B. With respect to the trial court\u2019s summary judgment on the other twenty-three counts, however, that judgment is final and reviewable to the extent that those counts are directed against the remaining third party defendants against whom no other claims for relief are pending.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>228 Conn. 640, 644 n.3, 638 A.2d 1 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The fact that the same six parties against whom the Rytmans have pending claims are also named in some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>of the other twenty-three counts does not undermine the conclusion that there is a final judgment with respect to the remaining parties. In applying \u00a7 4002B, an appellate court focuses not on the allegations of each count in the cross complaint, a variable easily manipulated by the cross complainant, but rather on those parties against whom a cross complainant has no remaining causes of action. Once the interest of any one party has been so concluded, that judgment has attained finality with respect to that party. See Practice Book \u00a7 4002B, official commentary (judgment is appeal-able when \u201cdisposing of counts pleaded against parties against whom no other relief is sought in the counts that remain pending\u201d); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Curdo, </em>supra, 191 Conn. 31.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">We turn next to the crux of the parties\u2019 dispute: the trial court\u2019s application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel. The Rytmans contend that, because the RICO action involved only federal criminal issues, its dismissal does not bar the common law and statutory causes of action alleged in their counterclaim and cross complaint in the state court. We agree.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Whatever the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>burdens of this protracted litigation on the judicial branch, it cannot be resolved on the basis of either collateral estoppel or res judicata.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">The standard of review of a trial court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment is well established. \u201c [ W] e must decide whether the trial court erred in determining that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. </em>v. Jones, 220 Conn. 285, 292, 596 A.2d 414 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">In this case, the Rytmans do not contend that the trial court disregarded issues of material fact. Nor do they question the general proposition that a prior federal decision that satisfies either the doctrine of collateral estoppel or that of res judicata may have a preclusive effect on subsequent state litigation. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number><em>Virgo </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>209 Conn. 497, 510, 551 A.2d 1243 (1989). Rather, they maintain that, under the circumstances of this case, the plaintiff and third party defendants were not entitled to a judgment as a matter of law on the basis of collateral estoppel.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">\u201cCollateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, prohibits the relitigation of an issue when that issue was actually litigated and necessarily determined in a prior action. . . . For an issue to be subject to collateral estoppel, it must have been fully and fairly litigated in the first action.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 296. \u201cIn order for collateral estoppel to apply, [moreover], there must be an identity of issues, that is, the prior litigation must have resolved the same legal or factual issue that is present in the second litigation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Upjohn Co. </em>v. <em>Plan</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number><em>ning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>224 Conn. 82, 93-94, 616 A.2d 786 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">In this case, the trial court determined that the federal court decision satisfied the requirements of collateral estoppel. Focusing almost exclusively on the District Court opinion, the trial court held that the adverse disposition of the Rytmans\u2019 RICO action precluded further litigation regarding either the intentional or negligent misconduct alleged against the plaintiff or third party defendants. With respect to the common law and statutory claims made in the counterclaim, the trial court determined that \u201c[e]ach and every one of the legal issues . . . [was] in fact decided adversely to the Rytmans in the federal courts.\u201d Similarly, the trial court determined that, of the twenty-eight counts in the cross complaint, twenty-three involved issues that were \u201cactually decided adversely\u201d to the Rytmans in the federal courts. Having concluded that the issues necessarily resolved by the federal courts were essentially similar to those raised in the state court pleadings, the trial court granted summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">We disagree both with the trial court\u2019s heavy reliance on the opinion of the District Court and with its ultimate assessment of the relevant claims under the law of collateral estoppel. As a procedural matter, once the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit made its own assessment of the Rytmans\u2019 RICO claims and undertook independently to explain its reasoning, which was not identical with that of the District Court, the relevant decision for purposes of issue or claim preclusion necessarily became that of the Second Circuit.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Cf. 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Restatement (Second), Judgments \u00a7 27, comment (o), p. 263 (1982).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> As a substantive matter, our analysis of the opinion of the Second Circuit persuades us that the issues actually decided by that court are not so identical to those raised in the state court pleadings as to warrant the application of collateral estoppel. See <em>Upjohn Co. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning </em>Commission, supra, 224 Conn. 93-94 (identity of issues required for collateral estoppel).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The Second Circuit, after describing the seven requirements for establishing a valid claim under RICO,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> held that the Rytmans\u2019 allegations did not meet these requirements. Two substantive determinations were central to this holding: (1) with respect to the motion to dismiss under rule 12 (b) (6), the Rytmans had failed to plead extortion within the prohibitions of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951;<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and (2) with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>to Norwich Savings\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the Rytmans had failed to adduce evidence showing that Norwich Savings had \u201cattempted to acquire or maintain an interest in the Rytmans\u2019 enterprise in an unlawful manner\u201d as required under RICO.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Neither of these determinations resolved an issue identical to those advanced in the state court pleadings. With respect to the first, the Rytmans do not allege anywhere in their counterclaim or cross complaint that the actions of either the plaintiff or the third party defendants constituted criminal extortion of any sort under the Hobbs Act. Although failure to make such an allegation was fatal to their RICO claim, its absence has no preclusive effect, for purposes of collateral estoppel, on further litigation of their common-law and statutory claims, which need not allege either extortion or criminality. Cf. <em>DeLaurentis </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>220 Conn. 225, 240, 597 A.2d 807 (1991) (failure to state federal constitutional claim did not collaterally estop subsequent state court litigation). With respect to the second, the federal court\u2019s affirmance of a summary judgment in favor of Norwich Savings, although phrased in general terminology, must be construed in light of the RICO statute that the court was asked to apply. A decision that, for RICO purposes, the Rytmans had failed to present evidence showing an unlawful attempt by Norwich Savings to acquire an interest in their enterprise does not collaterally estop the Rytmans from pursuit of their unrelated claims of misconduct on the part of Noiwich Savings.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">At bottom, our conclusion that collateral estoppel was improperly applied in this case is a recognition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>that the RICO action arose under, and was resolved on the basis of, a complex federal criminal statute around which a specialized body of law and procedural limitations has developed. See, e.g., <em>National Organization for Women, Inc. </em>v. <em>Scheidler, </em>510 U.S. 249, 114 S. Ct. 798, 127 L. Ed. 2d 99 (1994); <em>Reves </em>v. <em>Ernst &amp; Young, </em>507 U.S. 170, 113 S. Ct. 1163, 122 L. Ed. 2d 525 (1993); <em>H. J., Inc. </em>v. <em>Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., </em>492 U.S. 229, 109 S. Ct. 2893, 106 L. Ed. 2d 195 (1989); see also G. Joseph, Civil RICO: A Definitive Guide (1992) \u00a7 23, p. 127 (\u201c[t]he complexity of the RICO statute demands precision in pleading\u201d). Under the circumstances of this case, such a disposition does not collaterally estop pending state court claims that are based on quite different legal theories arising under civil statutes and common law. See <em>DeLaurentis </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 240; <em>Wight </em>v. <em>Southington, </em>43 Conn. App. 654, 659, 685 A.2d 686 (1996) (\u201c[t]he issues involved in a zoning appeal are separate and distinct from those involved in a civil rights action under the federal statute\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">In the alternative, the plaintiff and third party defendants claim that the doctrine of res judicata precludes the Rytmans\u2019 state court litigation. They contend that, because the same set of facts underlies both the RICO and the state court actions, the Rytmans were required to raise all legal theories supportable by these facts in one proceeding. They argue that the Rytmans\u2019 failure to do so in federal court, after removal of the RICO litigation to that forum, now precludes the Rytmans from pursuing separate state court litigation. The trial court rejected this argument. It concluded that, once the District Court had disposed of the RICO action over which it had had original jurisdiction, it would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>declined to exercise pendent jurisdiction<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> over the remaining state law claims. In the absence of pendent jurisdiction, the Rytmans\u2019 common-law claims could not have been adjudicated in the federal forum. We agree with the trial court.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Although the doctrines of collateral estoppel and res judicata are conceptually related, in practice their application may yield distinct results. Unlike collateral estoppel, under which preclusion occurs only if a claim actually has been litigated, \u201c[u]nder the doctrine of res judicata, or claim preclusion, a former judgment on a claim, if rendered on the merits, is an absolute bar to a subsequent action on the same claim ... [or any claim based on the same operative facts that] <em>might have been made. . . . </em>[T]he appropriate inquiry with respect to [claim] preclusion is whether the party had an <em>adequate opportunity to litigate the matter in the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number><em>earlier </em>proceeding. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Joe\u2019s Pizza, Inc. </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>236 Conn. 863, 871-72, 675 A.2d 441 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">For the purposes of claim preclusion in this case, the central issue is not whether the operative facts underlying the Rytmans\u2019 state court action are effectively the same as those underlying their RICO action. See <em>Delahunty </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>supra, 236 Conn. 590 (applying transactional test for purposes of determining identity of underlying facts). There is little question on this score.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Rather, the central issue is whether, with respect to these operative facts, the Rytmans had an adequate opportunity to litigate all of their claims, RICO and otherwise, in the federal proceeding. We agree with the trial court that, in determining whether the Rytmans had such an opportunity, we should apply the test set forth in the Restatement (Second) of Judgments, \u00a7 25, comment (e). Under this test, \u201c[w]hen the plaintiff brings an action on [a] claim in a court, either state or federal, in which there is no jurisdictional obstacle to his advancing both theories or grounds, but he presents only one of them, and judgment is entered with respect to it, he may not maintain a second action in which he tenders the other theory or ground. If however, the court in the first action <em>would clearly not have had jurisdiction </em>to entertain the omitted theory or ground (or, having jurisdiction, <em>would clearly have declined to exercise it as a matter of </em>discretion), then a second action in a competent court presenting the omitted theory or ground should not be precluded.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 1 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 25, comment (e), p. 213. This test has been followed by numerous courts throughout the country. See, e.g., <em>Federated Dept. Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Moitie, </em>452 U.S. 394, 404, 101 S. Ct. 2424, 69 L. Ed. 2d 103 (1981) (Blackmun, J., concurring) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>(citing to tentative draft of Restatement); <em>Merry </em>v. <em>Coast Community College District, </em>97 Cal. App. 3d 214, 229-30, 158 Cal. Rptr. 603 (4th Dist. 1979); <em>Puckett </em>v. <em>Emmett, </em>113 Idaho 639, 643, 747 P.2d 48 (1987); <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Phoenix Investment Counsel of Boston, Inc., </em>387 Mass. 444, 450, 440 N.E.2d 1164 (1982); <em>Buchanan </em>v. <em>Dain Bosworth, Inc., </em>469 N.W.2d 508, 510 (Minn. App. 1991). Applied to the circumstances of this case, the Restatement test requires us to decide whether the federal court, clearly vested with jurisdiction over the Rytmans\u2019 RICO claim, would clearly have had no pendent jurisdiction, or clearly would have declined to exercise pendent jurisdiction, over the Rytmans\u2019 common-law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The plaintiff and the third party defendants argue, however, that it is improper for this court to speculate on what the federal court might have done, because the Rytmans in this case failed to avail themselves of the opportunity to resolve this question by invoking the federal court\u2019s pendent jurisdiction. According to the plaintiff and third party defendants, after removal of the RICO claim, the applicable principles of res judicata required the Rytmans to attempt to resolve this entire action in a single proceeding in the federal court. See <em>Gilles </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>615 A.2d 533, 540-41 (D.C. App. 1992) (party opposing res judicata should invoke the federal court\u2019s pendent jurisdiction). For two reasons, we disagree. First, the Restatement test contains no such requirement. Although a party concerned with the possible application of res judicata may find it useful to obtain a definitive federal court ruling, the Restatement does not impose a ritualistic duty of formal pleading upon a party willing to shoulder the juridical risk of persuasion with respect to what the federal court <em>clearly </em>would have done.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Second, the rule of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>Restatement is particularly appropriate in a case such as this one, in which the Rytmans, from the outset, <em>opposed </em>the removal of their RICO action. The plaintiff and third party defendants have brought to our attention no case law in which a party whose federal action was involuntarily removed was required either to litigate its state court action in the federal court or else to face automatic claim preclusion. Under the circumstances of this case, \u201c[w]e decline to require the [Rytmans] to grasp, at their peril, either horn of this dilemma.\u201d <em>Orselet </em>v. <em>DeMatteo, </em>206 Conn. 542, 548, 539 A.2d 95 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">We turn then to determining whether, pursuant to the Restatement test, the District Court in this case \u201cwould clearly not have had [pendent] jurisdiction\u201d or, if it would have had such jurisdiction, whether it \u201cwould clearly have declined to exercise it as a matter of discretion . . . .\u201d The answer to this inquiry turns on the scope of pendent jurisdiction in federal courts in general and the Second Circuit in particular. See 2 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 87, p. 314 (\u201c[federal law determines the effects under the rules of res judicata of a judgment of a federal court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">The modem doctrine governing the exercise of pendent jurisdiction in federal courts stems from the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United Mine Workers of America </em>v. <em>Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715, 86 S. Ct. 1130, 16 L. Ed. 2d 218 (1966). See <em>Carnegie-Mellon University </em>v. <em>Cohill, </em>484 U.S. 343, 348, 108 S. Ct. 614, 98 L. Ed. 2d 720 (1988). \u201cIn <em>Gibbs, </em>the Court responded to [past confusion regarding the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction] by establishing a new yardstick for deciding whether a federal court has jurisdiction over a state-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>law claim brought in a case that also involves a federal question. The Court stated that a federal court has jurisdiction over an entire action, including state-law claims, whenever the federal-law claims and state-law claims in the case \u2018derive from a common nucleus of operative fact\u2019 and are \u2018such that [a plaintiff] would ordinarily be expected to try them all in one judicial proceeding.\u2019 <em>[United Mine Workers of America </em>v. <em>Gibbs, </em>supra, 383 U.S. 725], The Court intended this standard not only to clarify, but also to broaden, the scope of federal pendent jurisdiction. . . . According to <em>Gibbs, </em>\u2018considerations of judicial economy, convenience and fairness to litigants\u2019 support, a wide-ranging power in the federal courts to decide state-law claims in cases that also present federal questions.\u2019 Id., [726],</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">\u201cAt the same time, however, <em>Gibbs </em>drew a distinction between the power of a federal court to hear state-law claims and the discretionary exercise of that power. The <em>Gibbs </em>Court recognized that a federal court\u2019s determination of state-law claims could conflict with the principle of comity to the States and with the promotion of justice between the litigating parties. For this reason, <em>Gibbs </em>emphasized that \u2018pendent jurisdiction is a doctrine of discretion, not of plaintiffs right.\u2019 [Id.] Under <em>Gibbs, </em>a federal court should consider and weigh in each case, and at every stage of the litigation, the values of judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and comity in order to decide whether to exercise jurisdiction over a case brought in that court involving pendent state-law claims. When the balance of these factors indicates that a case properly belongs in state court, <em>as when the federal-law claims have dropped out of the lawsuit in its early stages and only stale-law claims remain, </em>the federal court <em>should </em>decline the exercise of jurisdiction by dismissing the case without prejudice. Id., [726-27], As articulated by <em>Gibbs, </em>the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction thus is a doctrine of flexibility, designed to allow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>courts to deal with cases involving pendent claims in the manner that most sensibly accommodates a range of concerns and values.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis added.) <em>Carnegie-Mellon University </em>v. <em>Cohill, </em>supra, 484 U.S. 349-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">In 1990, Congress codified the law of pendent jurisdiction.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Subsection (a) of \u00a7 1367 sets out the constitutional limits of a district court\u2019s power to exercise pendent jurisdiction first articulated in <em>Gibbs. </em>See 13B C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure (2d Ed. 1984) \u00a7 3567.1, supplement, p. 24. A district court may entertain a pen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>dent claim only if it is \u201cso related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that [it forms] part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution. . . .\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367 (a). Subsection (c) enumerates those situations identified in <em>Gibbs </em>in which a district court may decline to exercise pendent jurisdiction even when it has the power to do so. In particular, under \u00a7 1367 (c) (3) a district court may refuse pendent jurisdiction when the court \u201chas dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction . . . .\u201d See <em>United Mine Workers of America </em>v. <em>Gibbs, </em>supra, 383 U.S. 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Thus, the federal law governing pendent jurisdiction identified in <em>Gibbs </em>and codified in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367 focuses on two key and distinct elements. These elements are: (1) the constitutional <em>power </em>of a district court to entertain pendent claims; and (2) its judicial <em>discretion </em>to decline to entertain those claims which it otherwise has the power to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">In this case, the parties do not dispute that the District Court had the <em>power </em>to have appended the Rytmans\u2019 counterclaim and cross complaint to the RICO action. Indeed, both sets of claims arose from a \u201ccommon nucleus of operative fact\u201d; <em>United Mine Workers of America </em>v. <em>Gibbs, </em>supra, 383 U.S. 725; and form \u201cpart of the same case or controversy.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367. Accordingly, we conclude that, under these circumstances, the District Court \u201cwould clearly . . . have had jurisdiction\u201d to entertain the counterclaim and cross complaint. See 13B C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; E. Cooper, supra, \u00a7 3567.1, p. 117 (loose factual connection sufficient to empower court to assume pendent jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">The parties do, however, dispute whether the District Court, in its discretion, \u201cwould clearly have declined\u201d to entertain the counterclaim and cross complaint after having disposed of the RICO action. This dispute must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>be analyzed in light of decisions in the Second Circuit that substantially limit a district court\u2019s exercise of discretion to entertain pending claims. \u201cThe Second Circuit has held that \u2018absent exceptional circumstances,\u2019 where federal claims are disposed of [prior to trial], courts should \u2018abstain from exercising pendent jurisdiction.\u2019 <em>Drexel Burnham Lambert </em>v. <em>Saxony Heights Realty, 111 </em>F. Sup. 228, 240 (S.D.N.Y. 1991) (quoting <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Time Life Films, Inc., </em>784 F.2d 44, 53 [2d Cir.], cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1159, 106 S. Ct. 2278, 90 L. Ed. 2d 721 [1986]). \u2018Factors to be considered by the court include (1) the length of time the matter has been pending before the federal court; (2) the proximity of the trial date; and (3) the predominance of issues of federal, as opposed to local concern.\u2019 <em>Drexel Burnham Lambert, </em>supra, [240]. \u2018In the usual case in which all federal law claims are eliminated before trial, the balance of factors . . . will point toward declining to exercise jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims.\u2019 <em>Morse </em>v. <em>University of Vermont, </em>973 F.2d 122, 127-128 (2d Cir. 1992).\u201d <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Mercy Hospital, </em>861 F. Sup. 214, 224 (W.D.N.Y. 1994); see also <em>Rounseville </em>v. <em>Zahl, </em>13 F.3d 625, 631 (2d Cir. 1994); <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Keeling, </em>996 F.2d 1485, 1490 (2d Cir. 1993); <em>West Hartford </em>v. <em>Operation Rescue, </em>915 F.2d 92, 104 (2d Cir. 1990) (\u201c \u2018if the federal claims are dismissed before trial . . . the state claims should be dismissed as well,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>United Mine Workers of America </em>v. <em>Gibbs, </em>supra, 383 U.S. 726). \u201cIn exercising [its] discretion, a district court is required to \u2018consider and weigh in each case, and at every stage of the litigation, the values of judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and comity in order to decide whether to exercise jurisdiction. . . .\u2019\u201d <em>Block </em>v. <em>First Blood Associates, </em>988 F.2d 344, 351 (2d Cir. 1993), quoting <em>Carnegie-Mellon University </em>v. <em>Cohill, </em>supra, 484 U.S. 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Thus, binding Second Circuit precedents evince a strong policy against the exercise of pendent jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>tion in situations in which the underlying federal claim has been eliminated prior to trial. Each of the factors identified in these cases supports our conclusion that this policy would have applied in the present case. See <em>Drexel Burnham Lambert </em>v. <em>Saxony Heights Realty, </em>supra, 777 F. Sup. 240. First, the RICO action had been pending before the federal court for only a fraction of the time the foreclosure dispute had occupied the state courts.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Second, given the complexity of the case and the litigiousness of the parties, the District Court had little reason to believe then, as we have little reason to believe now, that an actual trial on the merits of the counterclaim or cross complaint lay in close temporal proximity. Third, the predominant issues addressed in this litigation are of little federal concern and, with the exception of the RICO action, focus almost exclusively on state common law and civil statutes.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Finally, once the jurisdictionally sufficient RICO claims were eliminated in the earlier pleading stages, the values of judicial economy and comity militated against federal adjudication of lengthy state claims based on a complicated set of alleged facts and centered on a state foreclosure action. See American Law Institute, Study of the Division of Jurisdiction Between State and Federal Courts (1969) \u00a7 1313 (c), p. 213 (\u201c[i]f the federal element that is the basis for jurisdiction is disposed of early in the case, as on the pleadings, it smacks of the tail wagging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>the dog to continue with a federal hearing of the state claim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">We recognize that we cannot decide, with absolute certainty, that the District Court would have declined to exercise jurisdiction in this case. The test we have adopted, however, does not demand a showing of absolute certainty. On the basis of Second Circuit case law and under the facts of this case, we conclude that the District Court \u201cwould <em>clearly </em>have declined to exercise [jurisdiction] as a matter of discretion . . . .\u2019\u2019(Emphasis added.) 1 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 25, comment (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that the Rytmans did not have an \u201cadequate opportunity\u201d to litigate all their claims in the federal forum; see <em>Joe\u2019s Pizza, Inc. </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>supra, 236 Conn. 872; and should not, under principles of res judicata, be precluded from pursuing a state court resolution of their counterclaim and cross complaint. The trial court\u2019s ruling granting the motion for summary judgment cannot, therefore, be sustained on grounds of res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">The Rytmans have presented two final, procedural issues for our review.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> They claim that the trial court, <em>Hendel, J., </em>improperly struck from the jury list their counterclaim in the foreclosure action and improperly severed the cross complaint from the foreclosure action. We will address each claim in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">With respect to the first issue, we have recently restated the principles that govern the authority of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>trial court, in the context of a foreclosure action, to strike a counterclaim from the jury list. See <em>Northeast Savings, F.A. </em>v. <em>Plymouth Commons Realty Corp., </em>229 Conn. 634, 642 A.2d 1194 (1994). When \u201cincidental issues of fact are presented in an action essentially equitable, the court may determine them without a jury in the exercise of its equitable powers. . . . Where, however, the essential basis of the action is such that the issues presented would be properly cognizable in an action of law, either party has a right to have the legal issues tried to the jury .... Because a counterclaim is an independent action . . . the question presented is whether the . . . counterclaim is essentially legal or essentially equitable. . . . This analysis must be performed in the context of the [counterclaim] when read as a whole.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 641-42; see also <em>United States Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Bohart, </em>197 Conn. 34, 45, 495 A.2d 1034 (1985). If, upon proper analysis, the trial court determines that the counterclaim is primarily legal, the defendant who asserts it is entitled, as a matter of constitutional right, to a jury trial on the counterclaim. <em>Northeast Savings, F.A. </em>v. <em>Plymouth Commons Realty Corp., </em>supra, 642. A defendant\u2019s election to raise legal claims in the form of a counterclaim, rather than in a separate suit, does not signify a waiver of his light to a jury trial on such claims. Id., 642 n.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">In this case, the trial court made two crucial determinations with respect to the Rytmans\u2019 counterclaim. First, the court determined that \u201c[t]here\u2019s no question that [the Rytmans\u2019 counterclaim] is legal in nature . . . .\u201d We concur in this determination. See footnote 5 of this opinion. Second, the trial court, determined that, upon consideration of the legal issues raised in the counterclaim <em>viewed together </em>with the equitable issues raised in the foreclosure complaint, the court had the authority to deny the Rytmans\u2019 request for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>jury trial because, on balance, the relevant issues were primarily equitable. This determination was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Once the trial court determined that the counterclaim was primarily legal, the trial court had no authority to strike it from the jury list.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Because a counterclaim is an independent action; <em>Northeast Savings, F.A. </em>v. <em>Plymouth Commons Realty Corp., </em>supra, 229 Conn. 641; the right to a jury trial associated with a counterclaim stating issues of law cannot properly be balanced against the equitable nature of a foreclosure action.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">On remand, however, the trial court is not compelled to leave both the plaintiffs foreclosure action and the Rytmans\u2019 counterclaim on the jury list. In the interests of preserving both the Rytmans\u2019 right to a jury trial on the counterclaim and the plaintiffs right to expeditious resolution of the foreclosure action, the trial court has discretion to retain the foreclosure portion of the case on the court side list, while placing the counterclaim on the jury list. See <em>New Milford Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Roina, </em>38 Conn. App. 240, 242, 659 A.2d 1226, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 915, 665 A.2d 609 (1995); but see footnote 16. In exercising that discretion, the trial court will necessarily have to weigh the possible preclusive consequences that may attach to a decision on the merits of the foreclosure action in advance of a jury trial on the counterclaim. The balancing of these various concerns is a matter for full consideration on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">As their second procedural issue, the Rytmans claim that the trial court improperly severed their cross complaint from the foreclosure action. They contend that the trial court\u2019s severance decision was predicated on its decision to strike the counterclaim from the jury list and that, because the decision to strike was improper, so too was the severance order. Although we are persuaded that the trial court\u2019s decision was based, at least in part, on independent reasons of judicial economy, as well as on the resolution of the jury issue, we agree with the Rytmans that our decision that they are entitled to a jury trial on their counterclaim requires a plenary reconsideration by the trial court of the motion to sever.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">The record demonstrates that, in issuing its severance order, the trial court was attempting to address multiple conflicting interests raised by the parties. To the extent that the order to sever and the order to strike from the jury list were interrelated, the trial court was concerned that if, <em>as the Rytmans </em>wanted, the counterclaim in the foreclosure action was retained on the jury list, trying both the cross complaint and the foreclosure action before one jury panel might give rise to difficult evidentiary problems. The trial court envisioned the possibility that jurors might have difficulty in coming to a proper appraisal of hearsay evidence admissible against only one of the parties if cases involving all of the parties were heard together.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> See footnote 16 of this opinion. Thus, the trial court was concerned that <em>retaining </em>the counterclaim portion of the foreclosure action on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>jury list, rather than striking that portion, would also have necessitated severing the cross complaint.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The trial court was also persuaded that severance was appropriate in the interests of judicial economy. At the time of the severance decision, the four year old foreclosure action was in a state of preparedness that the action on the cross complaint was not: pleadings on the former were nearly closed and discovery nearly complete. The trial court had reason to be optimistic that severing the cross complaint, and the multiple parties it entailed, from the foreclosure action would both render the foreclosure action less complicated and accelerate its resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Were we not reversing the trial court\u2019s decision on the jury trial issue, we would be persuaded that the trial court\u2019s decision on the severance issue was well within its discretion. See <em>Rode </em>v. <em>Adley Express Co., </em>130 Conn. 274, 277, 33 A.2d 329 (1943); <em>Alpha Crane Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Capitol Crane Co., </em>6 Conn. App. 60, 68, 504 A.2d 1376, cert. denied, 199 Conn. 807, 508 A.2d 769 (1986). Nonetheless, we are now persuaded that the balancing of interests undertaken by the trial court must be revisited in light of our decision that the Rytmans are entitled to a jury trial of the legal issues raised in their counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b47-6\"> Subsequent to the commencement of the foreclosure action, certain entities in which Julius and Dora Rytman had an interest successfully moved to be added as parties defendant.

We decline to decide this issue. Even if <em>Convalescent Center of Bloomfield, Inc., </em>would permit these six third party defendants to appeal from the denial of their motions, they have failed to file a cross appeal within ten days after the filing of the Rytmans\u2019 appeal; see Practice Book \u00a7 4005; have failed to raise this issue in a preliminary statement of issues; see Practice Book \u00a7 4013 (a) (1) (B); and have failed to obtain certification to appeal. See Practice Book \u00a7 4002C (certificat ion from trial court and chief justice or chief judge required before party can appeal judgment rendered on some, but not all, causes of action). Moreover, in view of our conclusion that summary judgment improperly was granted on the remaining counts of the cross complaint and that this matter must, therefore, be remanded to the trial court, reviewing the partial denial of summary judgment at this stage in the proceedings would not further the interest of judicial economy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b56-6\"> Hereinafter, all references to the cross complaint are to those portions properly before us on appeal.

We disagree. The plaintiff and third party defendants did plead the doctrine of res judicata, which, as the trial court recognized, bears a close affinity to collateral estoppel. See <em>Advest, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wachtel, </em>235 Conn. 559, 565, 668 A.2d 367 (1995) (\u201c[t]he term \u2018res judicata\u2019 is often employed to refer to the related doctrines of claim preclusion and issue preclusion\u201d); <em>Delahunty </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>236 Conn. 582, 589, 674 A.2d 1290 (1996) (res judicata and collateral estoppel are \u201cfirst cousins\u201d). More importantly, the Rytmans have failed to demonstrate how the trial court in any way prejudiced them by considering the collateral estoppel issue. Indeed, the trial court was attentive to the Rytmans\u2019 due process concerns and invited them to submit a supplemental brief on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>this issue. See <em>Maguire </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>222 Conn. 32, 42 n.10, 608 A.2d 79 (1992) (no prejudice where supplemental brief allowed). Under these circumstances, we conclude that the collateral estoppel issue was properly before the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b57-8\"> This is not to say that Connecticut courts are powerless to prevent abuse of parties and of the courts. As the trial court observed, the Rytmans\u2019 eighty-nine page counterclaim and seventy-two page cross complaint are marked by \u201calmost mind numbing prolixity.\u201d If, on remand, the trial court were to determine that this prolixity, in coqjunction with the duplicative nature of the Rytmans\u2019 other pending lawsuits; see footnote 8 of this opinion; is indicative not of legitimate litigation strategy, but of an intent to delay further these decade old foreclosure proceedings, the trial court would have the authority to fashion an effective and appropriate remedy. \u201cCourts have an inherent power to disregard sham or frivolous pleadings which have been interposed for the purpose of thwarting the orderly progress of a case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Friedlander </em>v. <em>Friedlander, </em>191 Conn. 81, 91, 463 A.2d 587 (1983); <em>Burritt Mutual Savings Bank of New Britain </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>183 Conn. 369, 373, 439 A.2d 396 (1981); see also <em>In re MartinTrigona, </em>763 F.2d 140, 142 (2d Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1061, 106 S.

In support, the Rytmans cite to <em>DeLaurentis </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>220 Conn. 225, 597 A.2d 807 (1991). <em>DeLaurentis, </em>however, does not carry the weight of the Rytmans\u2019 argument. In that case, we held that the disposition of a federal civil rights action brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 did not serve as collateral estoppel in subsequently instituted state court proceedings. Id., 240-41. We based this decision on a number of factors, including our observation that a federal dismissal under rule 12 (b) (6) cannot serve as \u201cfact preclusion\u201d because, in granting such a motion, the federal corut must assume facts as pleaded. Id., 239-40. Unlike <em>DeLaurentis, </em>the parties who in this case filed a motion to dismiss under rule 12 (b) (6) do not contend that the federal dismissal serves to preclude any \u201cfacts\u201d asserted in the state court pleadings. Rather, they contend that the dismissal precludes relitigation of any identical <em>issues </em>predicated upon those facts. We agree. To the extent that a federal dismissal under rule 12 (b) (6) actually and necessarily decides issues identical to those advanced in state court litigation, we conclude that the federal dismissal may serve collaterally to estop that state litigation. See 5A C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure (2d Ed. 1990) \u00a7 1357, p. 369 (\u201ca dismissal under [r]ule 12 (b) (6) is determinative as to the legal sufficiency of a particular claim presented in the complaint\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b59-7\"> <em>Upjohn Co. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 82, cited by ihe plaintiff and third party defendants, is not to the contrary. In <em>Upjohn Co., </em>we relied on the opinions of both the District Court and the Second Circuit in determining that a prior federal court litigation collaterally estopped later state court proceedings. Id., 94. Unlike the present case, however, <em>Upjohn </em>Co.involved a District Court judgment, that was affirmed, per curiam, by the Circuit Court in an opinion that relied \u201csubstantially [on] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>the reasons stated\u201d by the District Court. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission </em>v. <em>Upjohn Co., </em>921 F.2d 27, 28 (2d Cir. 1990).

Such is not the case here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b60-7\"> In view of our decision that the trial court improperly relied on the District Court opinion, we do not address the Rytmans\u2019 claim that the District Court opinion cannot serve as collateral estoppel because it was based on alternative grounds, any one of which was sufficient to support its decision.

There is no comparable pleading requirement for proving fraud in Connecticut courts. Accordingly, to the extent that the issues identified in the Rytmans\u2019 state court fraud allegations are similar to those in the allegations of mail and wire fraud made in the RICO action, the procedural limitations placed on the Rytmans\u2019 claims by rule 9 (b) render the doctrine of collateral estoppel inapplicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b63-6\"> Pendent jurisdiction \u201cpermits a plaintiff, in appropriate circumstances, to join with his federal claim a related state claim over which the court has no independent basis of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Corporacion Venezolana de Fomento </em>v. <em>Vintero Sales Corp., </em>477 F.

App. 565, 567-68, 574 A.2d 1323 (1990), when one party simultaneously maintains separate causes of action on the same claim and the adverse party fails to object, the adverse party thereby acquiesces in the splitting. See also 1 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 26 (1) (a) and comment (a), pp. 233-35. The trial court determined, however, that \u201c[t]he conduct of the [plaintiff and third party defendants] in this case, by immediately seeking removal of the RICO complaint to [federal [c]ourt and, once there, immediately and successfully seeking its dismissal, is not an acquiescence in the Rytmans\u2019 decision to split [their] cause of action.\u201d We agree with the trial court.
