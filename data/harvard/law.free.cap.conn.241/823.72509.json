Ct. 1017, 98 L. Ed. 2d 982 (1988), and General Statutes \u00a7 54-86g,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to order that a child witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>be examined by an expert witness for the defense before deciding whether to grant the state\u2019s motion for videotaped testimony pursuant to \u00a7 54-86g (a). We conclude that the trial court has the discretion to order such an examination and that the trial court in this case properly exercised that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">The following facts are relevant to this appeal. The defendant was charged in a long form information with one count of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (2)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and one count of risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53-21.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The alleged victim was the defendant\u2019s daughter, R, who, at the time of the alleged acts, was four years old. On July 7, 1993, the state filed a motion for permission to videotape R\u2019s testimony outside the defendant\u2019s presence, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>accordance with <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarzbek, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 683, and \u00a7 54-86g. The trial court, <em>Mia\u00f1o, J., </em>heard the motion and, on July 30, 1993, denied it without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">On February 1, 1994, at a hearing before the trial court, <em>Corrigan, J., </em>over the defendant\u2019s objection, the state renewed its motion, asserting that R was unable to testify in the presence of the defendant and that the denial of the state\u2019s motion would preclude it from producing her as a witness. At that time, the state indicated that it had no objection to the defendant having his own expert, Albert J. Solnit, a child psychiatrist, examine R. Soon thereafter, the defendant sought a court order authorizing such an examination. The state withdrew its consent for Solnit to examine R and filed a memorandum in opposition to the defendant\u2019s motion. The defendant then renewed his objection to a second hearing on the state\u2019s motion for videotaped testimony, claiming that the state had no new evidence of R\u2019s inability to testify in the presence of the defendant. The trial court ruled that it would allow a new hearing on the motion, based upon its understanding that the court that originally heard the state\u2019s motion had denied it without prejudice so that the motion could be reheard by the court conducting the trial. Regarding the defendant\u2019s request that Solnit be allowed to examine R, the trial court indicated that such an examination was neither expressly permitted nor prohibited by \u00a7 54-86g, but that the rules of practice gave the trial court the \u201cright ... to order discovery and disclosure where it appears to be fair.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court indicated that it would rule on the defendant\u2019s motion after the close of the state\u2019s evidence in the <em>Jarzbek </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>On February 10, 1994, the state completed its evidence regarding the proposed videotaping of R\u2019s testimony and the defendant again requested that the trial court deny the state\u2019s motion. The trial court responded that it believed that the state had established a prima facie case for videotaping, but the court also granted the defendant\u2019s request to have Solnit examine R so that Solnit might offer his opinion as to the need for videotaped testimony. After a short recess, the state advised the court that neither the state nor R\u2019s guardian ad litem wanted R to be examined. The state further indicated that although R\u2019s mother had reservations about allowing an examination by Solnit, she was not opposed to it. Despite the opinion of R\u2019s mother, the state objected to making R available for an examination by Solnit and requested that the court rule on its pending motion to permit the videotaping of R\u2019s testimony. In response to the state\u2019s request, the trial court denied the motion. Both parties then moved for dismissal. The trial court dismissed the information and granted the state permission to appeal pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-96.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">On appeal to the Appellate Court, the state claimed that the trial court improperly had: (1) determined that the defendant was entitled to have his psychiatric expert examine R before the court could grant the state\u2019s motion; and (2) denied the state\u2019s motion without exercising its statutory discretion pursuant to \u00a7 54-86g. <em>State </em>v. <em>Marquis, </em>36 Conn. App. 803, 653 A.2d 833 (1995). The Appellate Court declined to review the issues raised by the state, concluding that the record was inadequate for review. Id. That court concluded that the factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>and legal bases of the trial court\u2019s ruling were unclear and that, in light of the state\u2019s failure to request an articulation, it read an ambiguous record to support, rather than to undermine, the judgment. Id., 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">This court granted the state\u2019s petition for certification to appeal, limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment dismissing the information on the ground that it was impossible to ascertain from the record the basis on which the trial court denied the state\u2019s motion to videotape the victim\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>State v. Marquis, </em>233 Conn. 902, 657 A.2d 641 (1995). We subsequently reversed the judgment of the Appellate Court as to the sufficiency of the record, concluding that the record was unambiguous and that \u201ca reasonable reading of the record disclose [d] that the trial court refused to permit videotaping of the child solely because the defendant\u2019s psychiatrist was not permitted to examine the child.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Marquis, </em>235 Conn. 659, 663, 668 A.2d 710 (1995). We then remanded the case to the Appellate Court for its consideration of the merits of the trial court\u2019s ruling. Id. On remand, the Appellate Court determined that the trial court had improperly ordered an examination of the child by a defense expert as quid pro <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>quo to its granting of the state\u2019s motion for videotaped testimony pursuant to \u00a7 54-86g, and had failed to exercise its discretion under <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarzbek, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 683, when it denied the state\u2019s motion. Consequently, the Appellate Court reversed the judgment of the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Marquis, </em>42 Conn. App. 186, 200, 679 A.2d 386 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">Subsequently, the defendant filed a petition for certification to appeal, which we granted limited to the following issue: \u201cMay a trial court, in exercising its discretion under <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarzbek, </em>[supra, 204 Conn. 683], and General Statutes \u00a7 54-86g, take into account the fact that the state\u2019s motion is supported by expert testimony and, therefore, order the child witness to be examined by the defendant\u2019s expert?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Marquis, </em>239 Conn. 934, 684 A.2d 709 (1996). We conclude that because the Appellate Court misinterpreted the basis upon which the trial court had granted the defendant\u2019s request for the expert examination and denied the state\u2019s motion for videotaped testimony, the Appellate Court incorrectly construed the nature of the trial court\u2019s actions and its authority to take such actions. Accordingly, we answer the certified question in the affirmative and reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court. Further facts will be provided as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">The defendant argues that the trial court had the authority to order an examination of R by Solnit before deciding whether to grant the state\u2019s motion for videotaped testimony. Specifically, the defendant contends that, because the state presented as evidence the testimony of an expert witness regarding the psychological impact the defendant\u2019s presence would have on R, fundamental fairness required that the defendant be allowed to have his own expert examine her. The state argues in response that the trial court has no authority, discretionary or otherwise, to order an examination of a child whose videotaped testimony the state seeks to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>elicit, and that even if the trial court in this case <em>did </em>have discretionary authority, it abused that discretion by failing to exercise it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">The following facts are necessary for the resolution of this claim. On February 8, 1994, after the state had refused to give its permission for Solnit to interview R, the defendant moved that the court order the examination. The state objected to such an order, claiming that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>it was beyond the authority of the court. In response to the state\u2019s motion for a second <em>Jarzbek </em>hearing, and the defendant\u2019s motion for a court-ordered examination, the court stated: \u201cIt would be my intention to hear the evidence that [Edward Narus, Assistant State\u2019s Attorney] has, and for the purpose of counsel, the court can\u2019t agree with everything Mr. Narus has indicated. <em>There\u2019s nothing in the statute that either permits or prohibits the defense from having an examination. There is in the practice rules the right of the court to order discovery and disclosure where it appears to be fair. </em>There\u2019s nothing in the case law that appears to prevent the defense from having such a discovery, but I think it\u2019s obvious to the court at this point that we should go on with the evidence you have for a determination as to what procedure should be followed . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">On February 10, 1994, after the state had presented its evidence in support of videotaping, the defendant once again moved the court to deny the state\u2019s motion, claiming that the state had not met its burden of proof. The court inquired whether the defendant wanted to offer evidence, and the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">\u201cThe Court: The state has produced a prima facie case. You have evidence to present?</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">\u201c[Matthew Collins, Defense Counsel]: I do have evidence, but I would also ask, as part \u2014 I would ask that I be allowed to have the child examined as part of this hearing also.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">\u201cThe Court: That\u2019s the order I get. I just have given the order <em>on that motion </em>to have the child examined by Dr. Solnit <em>as a matter of this motion.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">After a short recess, the state renewed its opposition to the court-ordered examination:</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>\u201cMr. Collins: Your Honor, I\u2019m ready to proceed, but apparently Mr. Narus has something he\u2019d like to address to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">\u201cMr. Narus: That\u2019s correct, Your Honor. As I understand Your Honor\u2019s comments prior to the recess, you are, in fact, or have indicated that the child victim here, the case must be turned over to the defense expert, Mr. Solnit, for examination of her at 2 o\u2019clock. Is that \u2014 that\u2019s as I understand that.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">\u201cThe Court: That\u2019s what I had said and ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">\u201cMr. Narus: Okay. And in that case, the state obviously had made a motion to oppose that request by the defense counsel, and I would ask the court to make a ruling on that motion to deny that request of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">\u201cThe Court: I thought that was the answer to the motion. I held a decision in reservation until I heard the state\u2019s case, and I\u2019m satisfied that the state has given a prima facie case. <em>So at this point of time, I grant the defense motion to have the child examined by their expert, which I believe is Dr. Solnit, and that comes as a matter of Practice Book rules of discovery </em>or the state of mind as offered to limit confrontation or for any other purpose. The other \u2014 adverse side has an opportunity of examining for that state of mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">\u201cIn this particular matter, if the state is going to succeed in videotaping the child\u2019s testimony out of the presence of the defendant and/or out of the presence of the jury, the defense is entitled <em>in that hearing </em>to determine whether or not such a procedure is necessary. So at this point in time, I have sufficient evidence that the state has produced a prima facie case, and the defense <em>at this time </em>is entitled to examination of the child.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b854-11\">At that point, the state informed the court that it, as well as the child\u2019s guardian ad litem, objected to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>examination and would not allow Solnit access to R. The state then moved for a ruling on its motion for videotaping:</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">\u201cMr. Narus: Okay, okay. Then with respect to the state\u2019s motion for videotaping, in light of the state\u2019s refusal to \u2014 or I shouldn\u2019t say refusal, but the state\u2019s objection to undergoing the process by which the court ordered the state to turn the child over to the defense, I would then ask for a ruling on the motion for videotaping at this point in time.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">\u201cThe Court: On the refusal of the state to permit the child to be examined by the defense psychiatrist, then the court does have to deny the motion for videotaping.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">The Appellate Court apparently understood these colloquies to mean that the trial court had ordered the defense examination of R as a quid pro quo for granting the state\u2019s motion to videotape her testimony. We conclude that this interpretation is incorrect. The trial court was not establishing quid pro quo, but, rather, was ensuring that the defendant be given the meaningful <em>Jarzbek </em>hearing to which he was entitled under the United States and Connecticut constitutions. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarzbek, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 704-705. In this case, a meaningful hearing required that Solnit be allowed to examine R in order to form his own conclusions as to R\u2019s ability to testify in the presence of the defendant and to advise the court of the necessity for videotaped testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-9\">\u201c[I]n criminal prosecutions involving the alleged sexual abuse of children of tender years, the practice of videotaping the testimony of a minor victim outside the physical presence of the defendant is, in appropriate circumstances, constitutionally permissible. [The] holding that appropriate circumstances may warrant a departure from strict compliance with confrontation requirements does not, however, signal a relaxation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>the underlying evidentiary requirement that appropriate circumstances be proven to exist. . . . There is no constitutional justification for automatically depriving all criminal defendants of the right of physical confrontation during the videotaping of a minor victim\u2019s testimony. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">\u201c[A] trial court must determine, at an evidentiary hearing, whether the state has demonstrated a compelling need for excluding the defendant from the witness room during the videotaping of a minor victim\u2019s testimony. In order to satisfy its burden of proving compelling need, the state must show that the minor victim would be so intimidated, or otherwise inhibited, by the physical presence of the defendant that the trustworthiness of the victim\u2019s testimony would be seriously called into question. Furthermore, the state bears the burden of proving such compelling need by clear and convincing evidence. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>388 U.S. 218, 240, 87 S. Ct. 1926, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1149 (1967) (application of clear and convincing standard to questions of admissibility involving constitutional requirements going to the reliability of evidence); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thevis, </em>[665 F.2d 616, 631 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 1008, 102 S. Ct. 2300, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1303 (1982)] (application of clear and convincing standard to determine whether defendant waived right of confrontation by reason of his own misconduct). . . . [I]n light of the constitutional right of confrontation at stake here, the primary focus of the trial court\u2019s inquiry must be on the reliability of the minor victim\u2019s testimony . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarzbek, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 704-705.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>The state concedes that a <em>Jarzbek </em>hearing, by its very nature, requires that the trial court exercise discretion in reviewing the evidence regarding a child witness\u2019 ability to testify reliably in the presence of the defendant. <em>\u201cJarzbek </em>requires an individualized, case-by-case assessment of the need to resort to the videotaping of the complaining minor witness\u2019 testimony outside the physical presence of the accused.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bonello, </em>210 Conn. 51, 58-59, 554 A.2d 277, cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1082, 109 S. Ct. 3268, 106 L. Ed. 2d 612 (1989). The state nevertheless contends that the trial court had no authority to order that Solnit be allowed to examine R in order to give testimony at that hearing. In support of its argument, the state relies in part on General Statutes \u00a7 54-86h,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> companion legislation to \u00a7 54-86g that precludes pro forma competency hearings for child witnesses. The state claims that \u00a7 54-86h demonstrates a legislative intent to shield child victims from examinations by defense experts. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>211 Conn. 555, 563-65, 560 A.2d 426 (1989), we compared \u00a7 54-86h to rule 601 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which provides in relevant part that \u201c[e]very person is competent to be a witness . . . .\u201d We noted that \u201c[t]his rule \u2018reflects the philosophy that few persons are inherently incapable of testifying in a useful manner.\u2019 Comment, \u2018The Competency Requirement for the Child Victim of Sexual Abuse: Must We Abandon It?\u2019, 40 U. Miami L. Rev. 245, 252 (1985).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>supra, 563. We also noted, however, that \u201c [r]ule 601 has not been construed to remove wholly the traditional control a judge may exercise to ensure that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>evidence presented to a jury has at least a minimum degree of reliability and relevance.\u201d Id., 564. The trial court maintains the authority to admit or exclude the testimony of a child based on the court\u2019s assessment of the child\u2019s ability to offer relevant and rehable evidence. By requesting permission to videotape R\u2019s testimony outside the presence of the defendant, the state cahed into question R\u2019s ability to testify reliably in a formal courtroom setting and in the presence of the defendant. In such a situation, the trial court has the authority to take those measures it considers necessary to determine that ability. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">\u201cThe [ability] of a witness [to testify reliably] is a matter peculiarly within the discretion of the trial court and its ruling will be disturbed only in a clear case of abuse or of some error in law. <em>State </em>v. <em>Orlando, </em>115 Conn. 672, 675, 163 A. 256 [1932].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>162 Conn. 112, 115, 291 A.2d 750 (1971). In the present case, the trial court concluded that the defendant was entitled to have Solnit examine R for the purpose of testifying at the <em>Jarzbek </em>hearing, thereby providing the court with information that the trial court considered critical, under the facts of this case, to make an informed decision. In ordering that the examination take place, the trial court implicitly acknowledged that, although the state had established a prima facie case for videotaping, <em>the court\u2019s own assessment needs </em>and fundamental fairness to the defendant required that Solnit be allowed to examine R.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">\u201c[T]he ends of justice will best be served by a system . . . [that] gives both parties the maximum possible amount of information with which to prepare their cases and thereby reduces the possibility of surprise at trial. See, e.g., Brennan, \u2018The Criminal Prosecution: Sporting Event or Quest for Truth?,\u2019 1963 Wash. U.L.Q. 279; American Bar Association Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Discovery and Procedure Before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>Trial 23-43 (Approved Draft 1970); Goldstein, \u2018The State and the Accused: Balance of Advantage in Criminal Procedure,\u2019 69 Yale L.J. 1149 (1960).\u201d <em>Wardius </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>412 U.S. 470, 473-74, 93 S. Ct. 2208, 37 L. Ed. 2d 82 (1973). \u201c[I]n the absence of a strong showing of state interests to the contrary, discovery must be a two-way street.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Id., 475. In the present case, the state moved for a procedure that called into question R\u2019s ability to testify in the presence of the defendant, yet denied the defendant the opportunity to obtain evidence in opposition to the motion, evidence that the trial court deemed necessary to make a fully informed decision. For the state to take such a position is antithetical to the constitutional underpinnings of a <em>Jarzbek </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">We cannot say that the trial court\u2019s conclusion, following the state\u2019s evidence, which included expert testimony, was clearly erroneous or a clear abuse of discretion. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>supra, 162 Conn. 115. If the defendant is entitled to a hearing on the state\u2019s motion for videotaped testimony, he is entitled to have the trial court ensure that such a hearing is meaningful because, as we recognized in <em>Jarzbek, </em>the hearing on the motion serves to protect \u201cthe right of an accused to confront witnesses against him as guaranteed by the confrontation clause of both the federal and state constitutions. U.S. Const., amends. VI, XIV; Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 318, 94 S. Ct. 1105, 39 L.

It necessarily follows that, when the state refused to produce the child for the court-ordered examination or to allow her to testify in open court, the court properly denied the state\u2019s motion for videotaped testimony. Because the state had made it clear that R would not testily in open court, and had further admitted that without R\u2019s testimony it would be unable to proceed with the prosecution of its case against the defendant, the court properly granted the parties\u2019 motions for dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b846-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-86g provides inpertinentpart: \u201cTestimony of victim of child abuse.

Only the judge, the defendant, the attorneys for the defendant and for the state, persons necessary to operate the equipment and any person who would contribute to the welfare and well-being of the child may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>be present in the room with the child (luring his testimony, except that the court may order the defendant excluded from the room or screened from the sight and hearing of the child only if the state proves, by clear and convincing evidence, that the child would be so intimidated, or otherwise inhibited, by the physical presence of the defendant that a compelling need exists to take the testimony of the child outside the physical presence of the defendant in order to insure the reliability of such testimony. If the defendant is excluded from the room or screened from the sight and hearing of the child, the court shall ensure that the defendant is able to observe and hear the testimony of the child, but that the child cannot see or hear the defendant. The defendant shall be able to consult privately with his attorney at all times during the taking of the testimony. The attorneys and the judge may question the child.

Appeals from the rulings and decisions of the Superior Court, upon all questions of law arising on the trial of criminal cases, may be taken by the state, with the permission of the presiding judge, to the Supreme Court or to the Appellate Court, in the same manner and to the same effect as if made by the accused.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b850-7\"> We note that the language of our holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Marquis, </em>235 Conn. 659, 663, 668 A.2d 710 (1995), may be read to indicate that we agree with the state\u2019s position that the trial court had ordered the defense examination of R as a quid pro quo for the videotaped testimony. Although neither parly has called our attention to this language, in answering the certified question and reacquainting ourselves with the record, we conclude that our prior holding was incomplete. We were correct that the record was sufficient for review, and that the trial court\u2019s denial of the state\u2019s motion for videotaped testimony was <em>a result of </em>the state\u2019s refusal, in defiance of a court order, to allow Solnit to interview R. What we left unclear, however, as we explain in the text of this opinion, was that, in the context of the trial court\u2019s dialogue with the state and the defendant, the examination was not a quid pro quo to the granting of the state\u2019s motion, but, rather, was ordered by the court so that it would have the information it needed to make an informed decision regarding the state\u2019s request.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b852-7\"> As a preliminary matter, the state argues that this court should dismiss the defendant\u2019s appeal on the ground that certification was improvidently granted. Specifically, the state claims that the defendant, in his petition for certification, misrepresented the holding of the Appellate Court by stating that the Appellate Court had decided that the trial court lacked discretion to order an examination of the child by a defense expert. The state contends that it is clear from the Appellate Court\u2019s decision that that court determined that the trial court had such discretion but failed to exercise it.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">A close reading of the Appellate Court\u2019s opinion reveals that its actual conclusions were: (1) the defendant was not <em>automatically </em>entitled to an examination of the child by a defense expert as a quid pro quo to the trial court\u2019s granting of the state\u2019s motion for videotaped testimony; and (2) the trial court failed to exercise properly its discretionary authority under <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarzbek, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 683, when it denied the state\u2019s motion without making the proper evidentiary findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-9\">The Appellate Court did not rule as to whether the trial court had the discretion to allow the defendant\u2019s expert to examine the child, but indicated, in dicta, that the trial court had no such discretion, when it stated: \u201c[U]nder the <em>previous </em>system . . . the trial court was entitled, although not mandated, to order a psychiatric examination of the child if it deemed such an examination necessary. . . . [General Statutes \u00a7] 54-86h effected a substantial change in the procedure for establishing whether child victims are to be considered competent to testify. That procedure does not provide for a psychiatric examination by a defense expert prior to the granting of a motion to videotape the child\u2019s testimony pursuant to \u00a7 54-86g. ... By enacting \u00a7\u00a7 54-86g and 54-86h as part of the same public act [see Public Acts 1985, No. 85-587, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2] and in light of the case law existing at the time of enactment, the legislature clearly intended to create an updated and consistent body of law regulating the testimony of child victims of assault, sexual assault or abuse.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Marquis, </em>supra, 42 Conn. App. 197. This passage fairly can be read to support the question as presented by the defendant, i.e., whether the Appellate Court was incorrect regarding the trial court\u2019s discretionary authority, and, accordingly, we conclude that the question as certified properly incorporates the issues raised by the Appellate Court in its decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b856-7\"> Although the trial court in <em>Jarzbek </em>was not acting pursuant to \u00a7 54-86g, which did not become effective until after the initiation of that action, \u201cthe videotaping [approved by the trial court was] essentially the same procedure . . . prescribed by \u00a7 54-86g.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarzbek, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 686. Those cases that were initiated after the enactment of the statute, however, have continued to rely on the <em>Jarzbek </em>analysis; cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bonello, </em>210 Conn. 51, 554 A.2d 277, cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1082, 109 S. Ct. 3268, 106 L. Ed. 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>612 (1989); and, therefore, insofar as it applies to the issue raised by the present appeal, we need not analyze the statute separately.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b857-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-86h provides: \u201cNo witness shall be automatically adjudged incompetent to testify because of age and any child who is a victim of assault, sexual assault or abuse shall be competent to testify without prior qualification.

The state was unable to offer any such precedent, and our own research has revealed none.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
