(Dresser). The plaintiffs claim that they were injured in the course of their employment as shipyard workers at the General Dynamics Corporation Electric Boat facility (Electric Boat) in Groton as a result of using pneumatic hand tools manufactured by the defendants. Specifically, the plaintiffs allege that the tools were defectively designed because they exposed the plaintiffs to excessive vibration, and because the defendants failed to provide adequate warnings with respect to the potential danger presented by excessive vibration.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The defendants appeal from the judgment rendered on jury verdicts in favor of the plaintiffs, claiming: (1) the interrogatories and accompanying instructions submitted to the jury were fundamentally prejudicial to the defendants; (2) the trial court improperly refused to direct a verdict for the defendants even though the jury\u2019s initial interrogatory responses demonstrated that several elements of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims had not been proven; (3) the trial court, as a result of inconsistencies in the jury\u2019s interrogatory responses, improperly submitted the case to the jury for reconsideration along with accompanying instructions that effectively directed the jury to return verdicts for the plaintiffs; (4) the trial court improperly instructed the jury that the defendants\u2019 state of the art defense applied only to the failure to warn claim and not to the design defect claim; (5) the trial court\u2019s instruction with respect to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>alteration or modification defense improperly shifted to the defendants the burden of disproving an essential element of the plaintiffs\u2019 case; (6) the trial court improperly instructed the jury that the alterations to the tools by the plaintiffs\u2019 employer would bar the defendants\u2019 liability only if these alterations had been the sole proximate cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries; and (7) the trial court should have rendered judgment for the defendants notwithstanding the verdicts because (a) there was insufficient evidence that the tools were defective in that the plaintiffs had presented no evidence of a feasible alternative design, and (b) there was insufficient evidence that the defendants\u2019 tools reached the plaintiffs without a substantial change in condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">In their cross appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court: (1) unfairly prejudiced the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for punitive damages by excluding evidence, based on a misinterpretation of the parties\u2019 stipulation, of the number of other persons who allegedly had been injured by the defendants\u2019 tools; (2) improperly refused to issue a curative instruction after defense counsel suggested during closing argument that the plaintiffs had failed to produce an expert witness to testify that the tools were defective, although the trial court had granted the defendants\u2019 motion in limine precluding the plaintiffs from offering expert opinion evidence on that issue; (3) improperly permitted the jury to view irrelevant and prejudicial videotapes of the defendants\u2019 manufacturing process, which included narration concerning the defendants\u2019 quality control measures and safety testing procedures; and (4) improperly allowed the defendants to present evidence with respect to Electric Boat\u2019s safety practices. We transferred the appeal and the cross appeal from the Appellate Court to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We agree with the defendants that the trial court\u2019s instruction with respect to the alteration or mod<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>ification defense improperly shifted to the defendants the burden of disproving an essential element of the plaintiffs\u2019 case. We therefore reverse the judgment of the trial court and order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The trial record reveals the following facts, which are undisputed for purposes of this appeal. The plaintiffs were employed at Electric Boat as \u201cgrinders,\u201d positions which required use of pneumatic hand tools to smooth welds and metal surfaces.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the course of their employment, the plaintiffs used various pneumatic hand tools, including chipping and grinding tools, which were manufactured and sold by the defendants. The plaintiffs\u2019 use of the defendants\u2019 tools at Electric Boat spanned approximately twenty-five years, from the mid-1960s until 1987. The plaintiffs suffer from permanent vascular and neurological impairment of their hands, which has caused blanching of their fingers, pain, numbness, tingling, reduction of grip strength, intolerance of cold and clumsiness from restricted blood flow. As a result, the plaintiffs have been unable to continue their employment as grinders and their performance of other activities has been restricted. The plaintiffs\u2019 symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of hand arm vibration syndrome. Expert testimony confirmed that exposure to vibration is a significant contributing factor to the development of hand arm vibration syndrome, and that a clear relationship exists between the level of vibration exposure and the risk of developing the syndrome.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">In addition to these undisputed facts, the following evidence, taken in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict, was presented. Ronald Guameri, an industrial hygienist at Elec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>trie Boat, testified that he had conducted extensive testing of tools used at the shipyard in order to identify occupational hazards. This testing revealed that a large number of the defendants\u2019 tools violated the limits for vibration exposure established by the American National Standards Institute (institute), and exceeded the threshold limit promulgated by the American Conference of Governmental and Industrial Hygienists (conference).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Richard Alexander, a mechanical engineering professor at Texas A &amp; M University, testified that because machinery vibration has harmful effects on machines and on people, engineers routinely research ways to reduce or to eliminate the amount of vibration that a machine produces when operated. Alexander discussed various methods available to control vibration, including isolation (the use of springs or mass to isolate vibration), dampening (adding weights to dampen vibrational effects), and balancing (adding weights to counterbalance machine imbalances that cause vibration). Alexander testified that each of these methods has been available to manufacturers for at least thirty-five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Alexander also stated that, in 1983, he had been engaged by another pneumatic tool manufacturer to perform testing of methods by which to reduce the level of vibration in its three horsepower vertical grinder. The vertical grinder had a live handle, which contained hardware for the air power, and a dead handle, which vibrated significantly more than the live handle because it weighed less. Alexander modified the design by inserting rubber isolation mounts between the handles and the housing, and by adding an aluminum rod to the dead handle to match the weight of the two handles. As a result of these modifications, which were published in 1987, Alexander achieved a threefold reduction in vibration levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>The plaintiffs also presented the testimony of Charles Suggs, a research engineer at North Carolina State University, who has been investigating machinery vibration reduction since the 1960s. In 1968, Suggs published the first of several papers in which he discussed his success in reducing vibration hazards in chain saws by inserting rubber mounts between the handle and chain saw body. In the 1970s, he also published a series of articles reporting how he had reduced vibration by 70 percent in tools without handles by wrapping the tools with a resilient foam rubber material and a metal sleeve. Additionally, in 1988, Suggs tested the defendants\u2019 die grinders and, by applying the same technique, reduced the levels of vibration by between 35 and 60 percent. Additional facts will be presented as warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">After a six week trial, the trial court rendered judgment on jury verdicts in favor of the plaintiffs. Finding that the defendants\u2019 tools had been defectively designed so as to render them unreasonably dangerous, the jury awarded the plaintiffs compensatory damages.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The jury also concluded that the manufacturers had provided inadequate warnings. Because the plaintiffs failed to prove that adequate warnings would have prevented their injuries, the jury did not award damages on that claim. Finally, the jury declined to award the plaintiffs punitive damages. This appeal and cross appeal followed. Additional facts will be provided as warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">We first address the defendants\u2019 argument that the trial court improperly failed to render judgment for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>defendants notwithstanding the verdicts because there was insufficient evidence for the jury to have found that the tools had been defectively designed. Specifically, the defendants claim that, in order to establish a prima facie design defect case, the plaintiffs were required to prove that there was a feasible alternative design available at the time that the defendants put their tools into the stream of commerce. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">In order properly to evaluate the parties\u2019 arguments, we begin our analysis with a review of the development of strict tort liability, focusing specifically on design defect liability. At common law, a person injured by a product had no cause of action against the manufacturer of the product unless that person was in privity of contract with the manufacturer. This rule, established in <em>Winterbottom </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>152 Eng. Rep. 402 (1842), made privity a condition precedent to actions against manufacturers grounded in negligence. American courts widely adopted this rule and, for the next one-half century, the privity requirement remained steadfast in American jurisprudence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 1 M. Madden, Products Liability (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 1.2, p. 8; see <em>Bragdon </em>v. <em>Perkins-Campbell Co., 87 </em>F. 109, 110 (3d Cir. 1898) (outlining rule that vendor of products generally not liable to third parties); <em>Goodlander Mill Co. </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co., </em>63 F. 400, 402 (7th Cir. 1894) (articulating general rule that liability does not attach to manufacturers absent contractual relationship).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The evolution of modern products liability law began with the landmark case of <em>MacPherson </em>v. <em>Buick Motor </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number><em>Co., </em>217 N.Y. 382, 111 N.E. 1050 (1916), in which the New York Court of Appeals extended the manufacturer\u2019s duty to all persons in fact harmed by products that were reasonably certain to cause injury when negligently made. As Justice Cardozo wrote in <em>MacPherson, </em>\u201c[i]f the nature of a thing is such that it is reasonably certain to place life and limb in peril when negligently made, it is then a thing of danger. Its nature gives warning of the consequences to be expected. If to the element of danger there is added knowledge that the thing will be used by persons other than the purchaser, and used without new tests, then, irrespective of contract, the manufacturer of this thing of danger is under a duty to make it carefully.\u201d Id., 389. The <em>MacPherson </em>reasoning eventually was accepted by nearly all American courts. See J. Wade, \u201cStrict Tort Liability of Manufacturers,\u201d 19 Sw. L.J. 5 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Similarly, the New Jersey Supreme Court in <em>Henningsen v. Bloomfield Motors, Inc., </em>32 N.J. 358, 161 A.2d 69 (1960), imposed \u201cstrict liability\u201d upon the manufacturer of a defective product, but on a warranty basis. Discarding the antiquated notions of privity of contract, the court imposed upon the manufacturer an implied warranty of merchantability to a third party. Id., 373, 384. The <em>Henningsen </em>court stated: \u201cWe are convinced that the cause of justice in this area of the law can be served only by recognizing that [the third party] is such a person who, in the reasonable contemplation of the parties to the warranty, might be expected to become a user of the [product]. Accordingly, [the third party\u2019s] lack of privity does not stand in the way of prosecution of the injury suit against the [manufacturer].\u201d Id., 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The next major development in products liability law did not attempt to modify the negligence rule any further, but, rather, urged its replacement. In <em>Escola </em>v. <em>Coca Cola Bottling Co. of Fresno, </em>24 Cal. 2d 453, 461, 150 P.2d 436 (1944), Justice Roger Traynor, in a now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>famous concurring opinion, first suggested that courts should hold manufacturers liable without fault when defective products cause personal injury. Justice Traynor asserted that strict liability would serve several policy justifications: (1) manufacturers could readily absorb or pass on the cost of liability to consumers as a cost of doing business; (2) manufacturers would be deterred from marketing defective products; and (3) injured persons, who lack familiarity with the manufacturing process, would no longer shoulder the burden of proving negligence. Id., 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Although Justice Traynor\u2019s argument did not prevail in <em>Escola, </em>nearly twenty years later he wrote for the majority in <em>Greenman </em>v. <em>Yuba Power Products, Inc., </em>59 Cal. 2d 57, 62, 377 P.2d 897, 27 Cal. Rptr. 697 (1963), holding a manufacturer strictly liable because its defective product caused injury to the plaintiff. The <em>Greenman </em>court stated that \u201c[a] manufacturer is strictly liable in tort when an article he places on the market, knowing that it is to be used without inspection for defects, proves to have a defect that causes injury to a human being.\u201d Id. The court explained that the purpose of this rule \u201cis to insure that the costs of injuries resulting from defective products are borne by the manufacturers that put such products on the market rather than by the injured persons who are powerless to protect themselves.\u201d Id., 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Two years later, \u00a7 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts adopted, with slight variation,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the doctrine of strict tort liability espoused in <em>Greenman. </em>Section 402A provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>\u201c(1) One who sells any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer or to his property is subject to liability for physical harm thereby caused to the ultimate user or consumer, or to his property, if</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">\u201c(a) the seller is engaged in the business of selling such a product, and</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">\u201c(b) it is expected to and does reach the user or consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it is sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">\u201c(2) The rule stated in Subsection (1) applies although</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">\u201c(a) the seller has exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of his product, and</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">\u201c(b) the user or consumer has not bought the product from or entered into any contractual relation with the seller.\u201d 2 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 402A (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">Products liability law has thus evolved to hold manufacturers<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> strictly liable for unreasonably dangerous products that cause injury to ultimate users. Nevertheless, strict tort liability does not transform manufacturers into insurers, nor does it impose absolute liability. See R. Traynor, \u201cThe Ways and Meanings of Defective Products and Strict Liability,\u201d 32 Tenn. L. Rev. 363, 366-67 (1965) (emphasizing that manufacturers are not insurers for all injuries caused by products). As the Wisconsin Supreme Court has pointed out, \u201c[f]rom the plaintiffs point of view the most beneficial aspect of the rule is that it relieves him of proving specific acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>of negligence and protects him from the defenses of notice of breach, disclaimer, and lack of privity in the implied warranty concepts of sales and contracts.\u201d <em>Dippel v. Sciano, </em>37 Wis. 2d 443, 460, 155 N.W.2d 55 (1967). Strict tort liability merely relieves the plaintiff from proving that the manufacturer was negligent and allows the plaintiff to establish instead the defective condition of the product as the principal basis of liability. See <em>Morningstar </em>v. <em>Black &amp; Decker Mfg. Co., </em>162 W. Va. 857, 883, 253 S.E.2d 666 (1979); W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, Torts (5th Ed. 1984) \u00a7 99, p. 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Although courts have widely accepted the concept of strict tort liability, some of the specifics of strict tort liability remain in question. In particular, courts have sharply disagreed over the appropriate definition of defectiveness in design cases.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As the Alaska Supreme Court has stated: \u201cDesign defects present the most perplexing problems in the field of strict products liability because there is no readily ascertainable external measure of defectiveness. While manufacturing flaws can be evaluated against the intended design of the product, no such objective standard exists in the design defect context.\u201d <em>Caterpillar Tractor Co. </em>v. <em>Beck, </em>593 P.2d 871, 880 (Alaska 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Section 402A imposes liability only for those defective products that are \u201cunreasonably dangerous\u201d to \u201cthe ordinary consumer who purchases it, with the ordinary knowledge common to the community as to its characteristics.\u201d 2 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 402A, comment (i). Under this formulation, known as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>\u201cconsumer expectation\u201d test, a manufacturer is strictly liable for any condition not contemplated by the ultimate consumer that will be unreasonably dangerous to the consumer. See <em>Rojas </em>v. <em>Lindsay Mfg. </em>Co., 108 Idaho 590, 592, 701 P.2d 210 (1985); <em>Ritter </em>v. <em>Narragansett Electric Co., </em>109 R.I. 176, 190-91, 283 A.2d 255 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Some courts, however, have refused to adopt the \u201cunreasonably dangerous\u201d definition, determining that it injects a concept of foreseeability into strict tort liability, which is inappropriate in such cases because the manufacturer\u2019s liability is not based upon negligence. See <em>Caterpillar Tractor Co. v. Beck, </em>supra, 593 P.2d 882-83 (articulating that \u201cunreasonably dangerous\u201d narrows scope of recovery and unduly increases plaintiffs burden); <em>Cronin </em>v. <em>J.B.E. Olson Corp., </em>8 Cal. 3d 121, 133, 501 P.2d 1153, 104 Cal. Rptr. 433 (1972) (\u201c[w]e think that a requirement that a plaintiff also prove that the defect made the product \u2018unreasonably dangerous\u2019 places upon him a significantly increased burden and represents a step backward\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">In <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Lull Engineering Co., </em>20 Cal. 3d 413, 435, 573 P.2d 443, 143 Cal. Rptr. 225 (1978), the California Supreme Court established two alternative tests for determining design defect liability: (1) the consumer expectation analysis; and (2) a balancing test that inquires whether aproduct\u2019s risks outweigh its benefits. Under the latter, otherwise known as the \u201crisk-utility,\u201d test, the manufacturer bears the burden of proving that the product\u2019s utility is not outweighed by its risks in light of various factors.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Three other jurisdictions have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>subsequently adopted California\u2019s two-pronged test, including the burden-shifting risk-utility inquiry.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Caterpillar Tractor Co. </em>v. <em>Beck, </em>supra, 593 P.2d 884; <em>Ontai </em>v. <em>Straub Clinic &amp; Hospital, Inc., </em>66 Haw. 237, 243, 650 P.2d 734 (1983); <em>Lamkin </em>v. <em>Towner, </em>138 Ill. 2d 510, 529, 563 N.E.2d 449 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Other jurisdictions apply only a risk-utility test in determining whether a manufacturer is liable for a design defect. See, e.g., <em>Armentrout </em>v. <em>FMC Corp., </em>842 P.2d 175, 183 (Colo. 1992); <em>Radiation Technology, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ware Construction Co., </em>445 So. 2d 329, 331 (Fla. 1983); <em>Thibault </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>118 N.H. 802, 807-809, 395 A.2d 843 (1978). To assist the jury in evaluating the product\u2019s risks and utility, these courts have set forth a list of nonexclusive factors to consider when deciding whether a product has been defectively designed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>With this history in mind, we turn to the development of strict products liability law in Connecticut. In <em>Garthwait </em>v. <em>Burgio, </em>153 Conn. 284, 289-90, 216 A.2d 189 (1965), this court recognized a products liability cause of action sounding in tort and became one of the first jurisdictions to adopt the rule provided in \u00a7 402A. See J. Beasley, Products Liability and the Unreasonably Dangerous Requirement (1981) pp. 21, 201. In <em>Garthwait, </em>the court stated: \u201cWhere the liability is fundamentally founded on tort rather than contract there appears no sound reason why the manufacturer should escape liability simply because the injured user, a party in the normal chain of distribution, was not in contractual privity with it by purchase and sale.\u201d <em>Garthwait </em>v. <em>Burgio, </em>supra, 289. This court has further held that \u201c[i]n order to recover under the doctrine of strict liability in tort the plaintiff must prove that: (1) the defendant was engaged in the business of selling the product; (2) the product was in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the consumer or user; (3) the defect caused the injury for which compensation was sought; (4) the defect existed at the time of the sale; and (5) the product was expected to and did reach the consumer without substantial change in condition. [2 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 402A]; see <em>Rossignol </em>v. <em>Danbury School of Aeronautics, Inc., </em>154 Conn. 549, 562, 227 A.2d 418 [1967].\u201d <em>Giglio </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., 180 </em>Conn. 230, 234, 429 A.2d 486 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">This court has long held that in order to prevail in a design defect claim, \u201c[t]he plaintiff must prove that the product is unreasonably dangerous.\u201d Id. We have derived our definition of \u201cunreasonably dangerous\u201d from comment (i) to \u00a7 402A, which provides that \u201cthe article sold must be dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>sumer who purchases it, with the ordinary knowledge common to the community as to its characteristics.\u201d 2 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 402A, comment (i). This \u201cconsumer expectation\u201d standard is now well established in Connecticut strict products liability decisions. See, e.g., <em>Giglio </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>supra, 180 Conn. 234; <em>Slepski </em>v. <em>Williams Ford, Inc., </em>170 Conn. 18, 23, 364 A.2d 175 (1976); <em>Wachtel </em>v. <em>Rosol, </em>159 Conn. 496, 500, 271 A.2d 84 (1970); <em>Rossignol </em>v. <em>Danbury School of Aeronautics, Inc., </em>supra, 154 Conn. 562; <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>35 Conn. Sup. 687, 690-91, 407 A.2d 1254 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The defendants propose that it is time for this court to abandon the consumer expectation standard and adopt the requirement that the plaintiff must prove the existence of a reasonable alternative design in order to prevail on a design defect claim. We decline to accept the defendants\u2019 invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">In support of their position, the defendants point to the second tentative draft of the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability (1995) (Draft Restatement [Third]), which provides that, as part of a plaintiffs prima facie case, the plaintiff must establish the availability of a reasonable alternative design. Specifically, \u00a7 2 (b) of the Draft Restatement (Third) provides: \u201c[A] product is defective in design when the foreseeable risks of harm posed by the product could have been reduced or avoided by the adoption of a reasonable alternative design by the seller or other distributor, or a predecessor in the commercial chain of distribution, and the omission of the alternative design renders the product not reasonably safe.\u201d The reporters to the Draft Restatement (Third) state that \u201c[v]ery substantial authority supports the proposition that [the] plaintiff must establish a reasonable alternative design in order for a product to be adjudged defective in design.\u201d Draft <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Restatement (Third), supra, \u00a7 2, reporters\u2019 note to comment (c), p. 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">We point out that this provision of the Draft Restatement (Third) has been a source of substantial controversy among commentators. See, e.g., J. Vargo, \u201cThe Emperor\u2019s New Clothes: The American Law Institute Adorns a \u2018New Cloth\u2019 for Section 402A Products Liability Design Defects \u2014 A Survey of the States Reveals a Different Weave,\u201d 26 U. Mem. L. Rev. 493, 501 (1996) (challenging reporters\u2019 claim that Draft Restatement (Third)\u2019s reasonable alternative design requirement constitutes \u201cconsensus\u201d among jurisdictions); P.

Rev. 1407, 1428 (1994) (\u201cThe centerpiece of the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability is the requirement that the plaintiff present evidence of a reasonable alternative design as part of her prima facie case. This requirement is not supported by the majority of the jurisdictions that have considered the question.\u201d). Contrary to the rule promulgated in the Draft Restatement (Third), our independent review of the prevailing common law reveals that the majority of jurisdictions <em>do not </em>impose upon plaintiffs an absolute requirement <em>to prove </em>a feasible alternative design.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>In our view, the feasible alternative design requirement imposes an undue burden on plaintiffs that might preclude otherwise valid claims from jury consideration.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Such a rule would require plaintiffs to retain an expert witness even in cases in which lay jurors can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>infer a design defect from circumstantial evidence. Connecticut courts, however, have consistently stated that a jury may, under appropriate circumstances, infer a defect from the evidence without the necessity of expert testimony. See, e.g., <em>Standard Structural Steel Co. </em>v. <em>Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>597 F. Sup. 164, 183 (D. Conn. 1984) (recognizing Connecticut law permits fact finder to draw inference of defect from circumstantial evidence); <em>Living &amp; Learning Centre, Inc. </em>v. <em>Griese Custom Signs, Inc., </em>3 Conn. App. 661, 664, 491 A.2d 433 (1985) (\u201cIt is not necessary that the plaintiff in a strict tort action establish a specific defect as long as there is evidence of some unspecified dangerous condition. In the absence of other identifiable causes, evidence of malfunction is sufficient evidence of a defect under \u00a7 402A of the Second Restatement of Torts.\u201d); <em>Kileen </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>36 Conn.

In such instances, the manufacturer may be strictly liable for a design defect notwithstanding the fact that there are no safer alternative designs in existence. See, e.g., <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Muskin Corp., </em>94 N.J. 169, 184, 463 A.2d 298 (1983) (\u201cother products, including some for which no alternative exists, are so dangerous and of such little use that ... a manufacturer would bear the cost of liability of harm to others\u201d); <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Piper Aircraft </em>Corp., 282 Or. 61, 71 n.5, 577 P.2d 1322 (1978) (\u201cOur holding should not be interpreted as a requirement that [the practicability of a safer alternative design] must in all cases weigh in [the] plaintiffs favor before the case can be submitted to the jury. There might be cases in which the jury would be permitted to hold the defendant liable on account of a dangerous design feature even though no safer design was feasible (or there was no evidence of a safer practicable alternative).\u201d); <em>Sumnicht v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc., </em>121 Wis. 2d 338, 371, 360 N.W.2d 2 (1984) (\u201c[a] product may be defective and unreasonably dangerous even though there are no alternative, safer designs available\u201d). Accordingly, we decline to adopt the requirement that a plaintiff must prove a feasible alternative design as a sine qua non to establishing a prima facie case of design defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Although today we continue to adhere to our longstanding rule that a product\u2019s defectiveness is to be determined by the expectations of an ordinary consumer, we nevertheless recognize that there may be instances involving complex product designs in which an ordinary consumer may not be able to form expectations of safety. See 1 M. Madden, supra, \u00a7 6.7, p. 209 (noting difficulty in \u201cdetermining in particular instances the reasonable expectation of the consumer\u201d); W. Pro-</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>sser &amp; W. Keeton, supra, \u00a7 99, pp. 698-99 (discussing ambiguity of consumer expectation test and shortcomings in its application). In such cases, a consumer\u2019s expectations may be viewed in light of various factors that balance the utility of the product\u2019s design with the magnitude of its risks. We find persuasive the reasoning of those jurisdictions that have modified their formulation of the consumer expectation test by incorporating risk-utility factors into the ordinary consumer expectation analysis. See, e.g., <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Tiffen Motor Homes, Inc., </em>697 F.2d 1192, 1196-97 (4th Cir. 1982) (applying South Carolina law); <em>Koske </em>v. <em>Townsend Engineering Co., </em>551 N.E.2d 437, 440-41 (Ind. 1990); Aller v. <em>Rodgers Machinery Mfg. Co., </em>268 N.W.2d 830, 835 (Iowa 1978); <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Amchem Products, Inc., </em>256 Kan. 602, 636, 886 P.2d 869 (1994), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 820, 116 S. Ct. 80, 133 L. Ed. 2d 38 (1995); <em>Seattle-First National Bank </em>v. <em>Tabert, </em>86 Wash. 2d 145, 154, 542 P.2d 774 (1975). Thus, the modified consumer expectation test provides the jury with the product\u2019s risks and utility and then inquires whether a reasonable consumer would consider the product unreasonably dangerous. As the Supreme Court of Washington stated in <em>Seattle-First National Bank </em>v. <em>Tabert, </em>supra, 154, \u201c[i]n determining the reasonable expectations of the ordinary consumer, a number of factors must be considered. The relative cost of the product, the gravity of the potential harm from the claimed defect and the cost and feasibility of eliminating or minimizing the risk may be relevant in a particular case. In other instances the nature of the product or the nature of the claimed defect may make other factors relevant to the issue. \u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Accordingly, under this modified formulation, the consumer expectation test would establish the product\u2019s risks and utility, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>the inquiry would then be whether a reasonable consumer would consider the product design unreasonably dangerous.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">In our view, the relevant factors that a jury <em>may </em>consider include, but are not limited to, the usefulness of the product, the likelihood and severity of the danger posed by the design, the feasibility of an alternative design, the financial cost of an improved design, the ability to reduce the product\u2019s danger without impairing its usefulness or making it too expensive, and the feasibility of spreading the loss by increasing the product\u2019s price. See <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Lull Engineering Co., </em>supra, 20 Cal. 3d 431; <em>Banks </em>v. <em>ICI Americas, Inc., </em>264 Ga. 732, 736 n.6, 450 S.E.2d 671 (1994); J. Wade, \u201cOn the Nature of Strict Tort Liability for Products,\u201d 44 Miss. L.J. 825, 837-38 (1973). The availability of a feasible alternative design is a factor that the plaintiff may, rather than must, prove in order to establish that a product\u2019s risks outweigh its utility. See, e.g., <em>French </em>v. <em>Grove Mfg. Co., </em>656 F.2d 295, 297 (8th Cir. 1981); <em>Armentrout </em>v. <em>FMC Corp., </em>supra, 842 P.2d 185; <em>Sumnicht </em>v. <em>Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc., </em>supra, 121 Wis. 2d 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Furthermore, we emphasize that our adoption of a risk-utility balancing component to our consumer expectation test does not signal a retreat from strict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>tort liability. In weighing a product\u2019s risks against its utility, the focus of the jury should be on the product itself, and not on the conduct of the manufacturer.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>Dart </em>v. <em>Wiebe Mfg., Inc., </em>147 Ariz. 242, 246, 709 P.2d 876 (1985); <em>Alter </em>v. <em>Rodgers Machinery Mfg. Co., </em>supra, 268 N.W.2d 835.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Although today we adopt a modified formulation of the consumer expectation test, we emphasize that we do not require a plaintiff to present evidence relating to the product\u2019s risks and utility in every case. As the California Court of Appeals has stated: \u201cThere are certain kinds of accidents \u2014 even where fairly complex machinery is involved \u2014 [that] are so bizarre that the average juror, upon hearing the particulars, might reasonably think: \u2018Whatever the user may have expected from that contraption, it certainly wasn\u2019t that.\u2019 \u201d <em>Akers </em>v. <em>Kelley Co., </em>173 Cal. App. 3d 633, 651, 219 Cal. Rptr. 513 (1985). Accordingly, the ordinary consumer expectation test is appropriate when the everyday experience of the particular product\u2019s users permits the inference that the product did not meet minimum safety expectations. See <em>Soule </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>8 Cal. 4th 548, 567, 882 P.2d 298, 34 Cal. Rptr. 2d 607 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Conversely, the jury should engage in the risk-utility balancing required by our modified consumer expectation test when the particular facts do not reasonably permit the inference that the product did not meet the safety expectations of the ordinary consumer. See id., 568. Furthermore, instructions based on the ordinary consumer expectation test would not be appropriate when, as a matter of law, there is insufficient evidence to support a jury verdict under that test. See id. In such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>circumstances, the jury should be instructed solely on the modified consumer expectation test we have articulated today.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">In this respect, it is the function of the trial court to determine whether an instruction based on the ordinary consumer expectation test or the modified consumer expectation test, or both, is appropriate in light of the evidence presented. In making this determination, the trial court must ascertain whether, under each test, there is sufficient evidence as a matter of law to warrant the respective instruction. See <em>Wassell </em>v. <em>Hamblin, </em>196 Conn. 463, 470-71, 493 A.2d 870 (1985) (trial court may not instruct jury on issue that is unsupported by evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">With these principles in mind, we now consider whether, in the present case, the trial court properly instructed the jury with respect to the definition of design defect for the purposes of strict tort liability. The trial court instructed the jury that a manufacturer may be strictly liable if the plaintiffs prove, among other elements, that the product in question was in a defective condition, unreasonably dangerous to the ultimate user.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The court further instructed the jury that, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>determining whether the tools were unreasonably dangerous, it may draw its conclusions based on the reasonable expectations of an ordinary user of the defendants\u2019 tools. Because there was sufficient evidence as a matter of law to support the determination that the tools were unreasonably dangerous based on the ordinary consumer expectation test, we conclude that this instruction was appropriately given to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">\u201cEvidence is sufficient to sustain a verdict where it induces in the mind of the [trier] that it is more probable than otherwise that the fact in issue is true. . . . It is the province of the trier of fact to weigh the evidence presented and determine the credibility and effect to be given the evidence. . . . On appellate review, therefore, we will give the evidence the most favorable reasonable construction in support of the verdict to which it is entitled. ... In analyzing a sufficiency of the evidence claim, the test that we employ is whether, on the basis of the evidence before the jury, a reasonable and properly motivated jury could return the verdict that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>did.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Baker v. Cordisco, </em>37 Conn.

[T]he jury can draw their own reasonable conclusions as to the expectations of the ordinary consumer and the knowledge common in the community at large.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Giglio </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>supra, 180 Conn. 235. Furthermore, \u201c[i]t is not necessary that the plaintiff in a strict tort action establish a specific defect as long as there is evidence of some unspecified dangerous condition.\u201d <em>Living &amp; Learning Centre, Inc. </em>v. <em>Griese Custom Signs, Inc., </em>supra, 3 Conn. App. 664; see <em>Elliot </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>30 Conn. App. 664, 672-73, 621 A.2d 1371 (1993), aff'd, 229 Conn. 500, 642 A.2d 709 (1994). The jury heard testimony that Guarneri, Electric Boat\u2019s industrial hygienist, had performed extensive testing of tools used at the shipyard, which tests revealed that a large number of the defendants\u2019 tools violated the institute\u2019s limits for vibration exposure and exceeded the conference\u2019s threshold limit. The jury also heard substantial testimony with respect to various methods, including isolation, dampening and balancing, available to reduce the deleterious effects of vibration caused by the defendants\u2019 tools. Moreover, there was expert testimony that exposure to vibration is a significant contributing factor to the development of hand arm vibration syndrome and that a clear relationship exists between the level of vibration exposure and the risk of developing the syndrome. Viewing the evidence in a light favorable to supporting the jury\u2019s verdicts, as we must, we conclude that the jury properly determined that the defendants\u2019 tools had been defectively designed.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">We next consider the defendants\u2019 claims relating to substantial modification. Specifically, the defendants argue that: (1) the trial court improperly instructed the jury that Electric Boat\u2019s alterations to the tools would bar the defendants\u2019 liability only if the defendants proved that the alterations had been the sole proximate cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries and, furthermore, that the charge regarding alterations improperly shifted the burden of proving causation to the defendants;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and (2) there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s conclusion that the defendants\u2019 tools had reached the plaintiffs without a substantial change in condition. We agree that the trial court\u2019s instruction improperly shifted to the defendants the burden of proving causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The following additional facts are relevant to the resolution of this issue. Roger Mainville, Electric Boat\u2019s tool crib attendant responsible for tool repair and maintenance, testified that he followed a regular maintenance program that involved a daily inspection of tools. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Specifically, Mainville stated that he was responsible for ensuring that the tools were properly oiled, that no parts were loose, and that the tools were in correct working order. If the tools were not in proper working order, Mainville would not allow the workers to use them in the shipyard. He testified that these tools were used by Electric Boat employees for an average period of two to three years before being discarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">With respect to repairs, Mainville testified that 98 percent of the replacement parts purchased by Electric Boat were bought directly from Chicago Pneumatic. Rotor blades and ball bearings for the tools, however, were purchased from outside vendors. Mainville stated that these replacement parts bought from outside vendors were of good quality and conformed to the defendants\u2019 specifications. In fact, Stanley Works and Dresser both purchased ball bearings from one of Electric Boat\u2019s outside vendors. Furthermore, the defendants\u2019 agents knew that Electric Boat repaired the tools with replacement parts provided by outside vendors and even complimented Mainville on Electric Boat\u2019s tool repair operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Additionally, Mainville testified that Electric Boat purchased chucks, which hold the grinding implement, the burr, in place, from outside vendors. Mainville stated that only quality chucks were installed in the tools because imperfect chucks would cause the tool to vibrate excessively. Occasionally, three and four piece factory installed chucks would be replaced by two piece chucks bought from outside vendors. The two piece chuck installed by Electric Boat was found to be safer by workers because it held the burr more securely.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">There was also testimony, however, that in order to make the tools more convenient for particular uses, Electric Boat periodically removed certain safety features, including wheel guards and throttle speed gover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>nors. John Strenkowski, a professor of mechanical aerospace engineering at North Carolina State University, testified on behalf of the defendants that the resulting reduction in mass from the absence of the wheel guards would cause increased vibration. Additionally, Electric Boat used six inch burr attachments on tools designed to use two inch burr attachments in order to reach compact areas. Strenkowski testified that the use of longer burr attachments also created the likelihood of increased vibration.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">We begin with the defendants\u2019 claim with respect to the trial court\u2019s instruction regarding substantial alteration or modification.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The defendants argue that the trial court\u2019s instruction improperly shifted to them the burden of disproving an essential element of the plaintiffs\u2019 case. The defendants also claim that the trial court\u2019s instruction was incorrect as a matter of law because it stated that Electric Boat\u2019s alteration of the tools constituted a special defense to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims that would prevent liability <em>only if </em>the defendants proved that the alterations had been the sole proximate cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. Furthermore, they argue that the trial court\u2019s alteration or modification instruction improperly focused on causation, rather than on the significance of the product alteration. Although the defendants\u2019 claims can be viewed as distinct and separate, our consideration of one necessarily implicates the others and, consequently, we discuss the claims together. Although we agree that the trial court\u2019s instruction improperly shifted to the defendants the burden of disproving an element of the plaintiffs\u2019 case, we disagree that the use of the sole proximate cause standard was incorrect as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>We begin with General Statutes \u00a7 52-572p,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> which governs allegations of alteration or modification. Section 52-572p provides that a manufacturer is not liable for harm that would not have occurred but for a third party\u2019s alteration or modification of the product in question. The defense, however, does not apply if the alteration or modification: (1) was in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions or specifications; (2) was made with the manufacturer\u2019s consent; or (3) was the result of conduct that the manufacturer reasonably should have anticipated. According to \u00a7 52-572p (b), \u201calteration or modification includes changes in the design, formula, function or use of the product from that originally designed, tested or intended by the product seller.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">This court has previously considered the relationship between \u00a7 52-572p and the common-law requirement that a plaintiff must prove that the product arrived without a substantial change in condition. \u201cPrior to the enactment of the [Product Liability Act (act); General Statutes \u00a7 52-572m et seq.], we adopted a cause of action in strict tort liability based on the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402A. <em>Rossignol </em>v. <em>Danbury School of Aeronautics, Inc., </em>[supra, 154 Conn. 559-60], Section 402A shields defendants from liability for products altered or modified by providing that the product seller can be liable only when the seller\u2019s product \u2018was expected to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>and did <em>reach the user or consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it was sold.\u2019 . . . Prokolkin v. General Motors Corp., </em>170 Conn. 289, 299, 365 A.2d 1180 (1976); <em>Rossignol </em>v. <em>Danbury School of Aeronautics, Inc., </em>supra, 559. In other words, the defendant would be absolved of liability under \u00a7 402A if the plaintiffs injury was the result of an alteration or modification to the product made by a third party. See 2 Restatement (Second), [supra, \u00a7 402A, comment (g)]. \u2018In determining whether or not a statute abrogates or modifies a common-law rule the construction must be strict, and the operation of a statute in derogation of the common law is to be limited to matters clearly brought within its scope.\u2019 <em>Willoughby </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>123 Conn. 446, 454, 197 A. 85 (1937).\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Elliot </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>229 Conn. 500, 512-13, 642 A.2d 709 (1994). Accordingly, we read \u00a7 52-572p as being consistent with the common-law requirement that the plaintiff must prove that the product arrived without a substantial change in condition. In other words, \u00a7 52-572p is to be read not as an affirmative defense, but as a part of the plaintiffs prima facie case. We next decide how the subsequent alteration or modification of the product operates within the chain of causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Section 52-572p was enacted as part of the act, which, as this court has pointed out, was based on the Draft Uniform Product Liability Law (draft act); 44 Fed. Reg. 2996-3019 (1979); proposed by the United States Department of Commerce. <em>Elliot </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>supra, 229 Conn. 505. Because \u00a7 52-572p adopted the language of \u00a7 110 of the draft act nearly verbatim,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>we look to the commentary to the draft act for guidance. See <em>Maloney </em>v. <em>Pac, </em>183 Conn. 313, 326-27, 439 A.2d 349 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The commentary provides that \u201c[t]his section deals with the situation where a third party \u2014 one other than the product seller or the claimant \u2014 has altered or modified the product and this has led to [the] claimant\u2019s harm. A few courts have imposed liability on the product seller in this situation provided that the third party\u2019s conduct was in some manner \u2018foreseeable.\u2019 . . . Decisions that hold the original product seller responsible in these instances border on absolute liability. Thus, insurers appear to have a just concern about broad-scale imposition of liability where third party intervention has been the principal cause of the accident.\u201d (Citation omitted.) 44 Fed. Reg. 3010 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The commentary, however, makes it clear that the section\u2019s liability limitation is narrow. \u201cSection 110 takes account of the hardship that can result from an overly broad liability limitation on product modification or alteration; the provision is very narrowly drawn. First, a product seller may avoid liability for a defective product <em>only </em>where the harm would not have occurred \u2018but for\u2019 the alteration or modification. In contrast, the \u2018Restatement\u2019 and the recently enacted state statutes cited above would shield the manufacturer whenever the third party\u2019s conduct was a \u2018substantial cause.\u2019 A rule of this type, however, invites litigation over what is \u2018substantial,\u2019 and also may diminish a product seller\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>responsibility for otherwise culpable conduct. Cases in accord with the approach taken in Section 110 include <em>Temple </em>v. <em>Wean United, Inc., </em>50 Ohio St. 2d 317, 362 N.E.2d 267 (1977); <em>Santiago </em>v. <em>Package Machinery Co., </em>123 Ill. App. 2d 305, 260 N.E.2d 89 [1970]; <em>St. Pierre </em>v. <em>Gabel, </em>351 So. 2d 821 (La. App. 1977).\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) 44 Fed. Reg. 3010-11 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Our research reveals that Connecticut\u2019s alteration or modification defense statute, \u00a7 52-572p, is the only statute based on the language of the draft act. Although other statutes provide a defense if an alteration or modification was aprox\u00edmate cause<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> or a substantial cause,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> \u00a7 52-572p is the only statute framed in \u201cbut for\u201d language. We recognize that we have previously stated that this language, known as \u201ccausation in fact,\u201d does not necessarily mean the sole cause of the resulting harm because there may indeed be several causes in fact. See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Manheimer, </em>212 Conn. 748, 757, 563 A.2d 699 (1989) (\u201c [t]he proximate cause requirement tempers the expansive view of causation [in fact]\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). \u201cThe test for cause in fact is, simply, would the injury have occurred were it not for the actor\u2019s conduct.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Notwithstanding this court\u2019s prior pronouncements with respect to causation in fact, the commentary to \u00a7 110 of the draft act clarifies that, in using the \u201cbut for\u201d language, the section limits a manufacturer\u2019s liability if a subsequent alteration or modification was solely responsible for the resulting harm. See 44 Fed. Reg. 3011 (1979). Indeed, the cases to which the commentary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>cites as supportive of its approach limit a manufacturer\u2019s liability if the subsequent alteration or modification was the sole proximate cause or a superseding cause leading to the plaintiffs injury. See <em>Santiago </em>v. <em>Package Machinery Co., </em>supra, 123 Ill. App. 2d 312 (considering wheth<em>er sole </em>proximate cause of the injury was the conduct of another\u201d [emphasis in original]); <em>St. Pierre </em>v. <em>Gabel, </em>supra, 351 So. 2d 824 (\u201ca manufacturer cannot be held liable for injuries caused by a defective product where the defect was created by an alteration which amounts to an intervening or superseding cause\u201d); <em>Temple </em>v. <em>Wean United, Inc., </em>supra, 50 Ohio St. 2d 327 (focusing on whether alteration constituted \u201csole responsible cause\u201d of plaintiffs injury). This type of analysis is consistent with Connecticut case law with respect to intervening causation. For instance, in <em>D\u2019Arcy </em>v. <em>Shugrue, </em>5 Conn. App. 12, 24-25, 496 A.2d 967, cert. denied, 197 Conn. 817, 500 A.2d 1336 (1985), the Appellate Court stated in the context of a negligence action: \u201cIf the third person\u2019s negligence is determined to be a superseding cause of the plaintiffs injury, that negligence, rather than the negligence of the party attempting to invoke the doctrine of superseding cause, is said to be the sole proximate cause of the injury. <em>Virelli </em>v. <em>Benhattie, Inc., </em>146 Conn. 203, 209, 148 A.2d 760 (1959); see also <em>Miranti </em>v. <em>Brookside Shopping Center, Inc., </em>159 Conn. 24, 29, 266 A.2d 370 (1969); <em>Corey </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>[126 Conn. 246, 254-56, 10 A.2d 370 (1939)].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Thus, a manufacturer\u2019s liability is limited only if the subsequent alteration or modification breaks the chain of causation, akin to an intervening superseding cause in negligence law. <em>Southwire Co. </em>v. <em>Beloit Eastern Corp., </em>370 F. Sup. 842, 857 n.21 (E.D. Pa. 1974). In other words, a manufacturer \u201ccould still be liable because the original defect, although not the sole cause of the accident, would constitute a contributing or concurrent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>proximate cause in conjunction with the subsequent alteration.\u201d <em>Soler </em>v. <em>Castmaster, Division of H.P.M. Corp., </em>98 N.J. 137, 150, 484 A.2d 1225 (1984). In our view, this construction is consistent with the draft act\u2019s intent that \u201cthe provision is very narrowly drawn.\u201d 44 Fed. Reg. 3010-11 (1979).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Accordingly, \u00a7 52-572p acts to limit a manufacturer\u2019s liability if the alteration or modification was the sole proximate cause of a plaintiffs injury.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Furthermore, our conclusion is consistent with the policy rationales supporting the imposition of strict products liability. The justification for strict liability is \u201c[1] that the seller, by marketing his product for use and consumption, has undertaken and assumed a special responsibility toward any member of the consuming public who may be injured by it; [2] that the public has the right to and does expect, in the case of products <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>which it needs and for which it is forced to rely upon the seller, that reputable sellers will stand behind their goods; [3] that public policy demands that the burden of accidental injuries caused by products intended for consumption be placed upon those who market them, and be treated as a cost of production against which liability insurance can be obtained; and [4] that the consumer of such products is entitled to the maximum of protection at the hands of someone, and the proper persons to afford protection are those who market the products.\u201d 2 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 402A, comment (c). In our view, these policy rationales would be undermined if a manufacturer were able to escape liability because a subsequent alteration or modification was a concurrent cause, together with the original defect, resulting in the plaintiffs injury. As one commentator has stated, \u201c[t]o allow any alteration less than the sole cause of the harm to supersede the manufacturer\u2019s liability is incongruous with the purpose of strict liability. A manufacturer should not escape responsibility for an accident-causing defect \u2014 no matter how small a role it played in the actual injury \u2014 simply because some alteration was a contributing factor. If a causal connection exists between the injury and a defect present when the product left the manufacturer\u2019s hands, [the manufacturer] should be liable.\u201d Comment, \u201cSubstantial Change: Alteration of a Product as a Bar to a Manufacturer\u2019s Strict Liability,\u201d 80 Dick. L. Rev. 245, 252-53 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Because this court previously has not had the opportunity to address the evidentiary framework established by \u00a7 52-572p, we now set forth the respective parties\u2019 appropriate burdens of proof.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We begin by recognizing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>that, as part of its prima facie case, the plaintiff must establish that the product in question was intended to and did reach the ultimate consumer without substantial change in condition. <em>Rossignol </em>v. <em>Danbury School of Aeronautics, Inc., </em>supra, 154 Conn. 559-60; see also <em>Guglielmo </em>v. <em>Klausner Supply Co., </em>158 Conn. 308, 315-16, 259 A.2d 608 (1969) (plaintiff must allege and prove product was expected to and did reach user without substantial change in condition).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> It is then incumbent upon the defendant to assert the alteration or modification defense. Under \u00a7 52-572p (a), the defendant bears the burden of producing evidence of a substantial change \u2014 that is, specifying a modification or alteration that was the sole proximate cause, and not merely a substantial contributing factor, of the plaintiffs harm. See 44 Fed. Reg. 3011 (1979). If this defense is invoked, then the plaintiff must disprove the alleged substantial change. <em>Southwire Co. </em>v. <em>Beloit Eastern Corp., </em>supra, 370 F. Sup. 857. The plaintiff, however, need not rebut every possible alteration or modification, but only those that the defendant has produced. See <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>141 Ill. App. 3d 876, 881, 491 N.E.2d 33 (1986). In order to rebut the defendant\u2019s allegations of substantial change, the plaintiff must prove that the harm would have occurred notwithstanding the alteration or modification. See <em>Kuhnke </em>v. <em>Textron, Inc., </em>140 Ariz. 587, 590, 684 P.2d 159 (1984). Alternatively, the plaintiff must establish that the alteration or modification: (1) was in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions or specifications; (2) was made with the manufacturer\u2019s consent; or (3) was the result of conduct that the manufacturer reasonably should have anticipated. General Statutes \u00a7 52-572p (a). At all times, however, the ultimate burden of persuasion (or, put another way, the risk of nonpersuasion) that the product reached the ultimate consumer without substantial change remains with the plaintiff. <em>C &amp; S Fuel, Inc. </em>v. <em>Clark Equipment Co., </em>552 F. Sup. 340, 345-46 (E.D. Ky. 1982); <em>Southwire Co. </em>v. <em>Beloit Eastern Corp., </em>supra, 857-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">This construction of the parties\u2019 respective burdens of proof is consistent with the policies underlying strict products liability. As the court in <em>Southwire Co. </em>stated: \u201cWhile \u00a7 402A is meant to require manufacturers and sellers to bear much of the responsibility and cost of injuries to consumers resulting from their defective products, it is not meant to impose upon each manufacturer and seller an absolute liability as insurer for all injuries to consumers, regardless of the relation of plaintiffs injuries to the particular defendant\u2019s product.\u201d <em>Southwire Co. </em>v. <em>Beloit Eastern Corp., </em>supra, 370 F. Sup. 858.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Furthermore, we note that the burden-shifting analysis we set forth today has been adopted by the majority of courts that have considered the allocation of burden of proof in cases involving the alteration or modification defense. See, e.g., <em>Page </em>v. <em>Barko Hydraulics, </em>673 F.2d 134, 138 (5th Cir. 1982); <em>C &amp; S Fuel, Inc. </em>v. <em>Clark Equip-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number><em>merit Co., </em>supra, 552 F. Sup. 345-46; <em>Southwire Co. </em>v. <em>Beloit Eastern Corp., </em>supra, 370 F. Sup. 857-58; <em>Kuhnke </em>v. <em>Textron, Inc., </em>supra, 140 Ariz. 590; <em>Navarro </em>v. <em>George Koch &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>211 N.J. Super. 558, 572-74, 512 A.2d 507, cert. denied, 107 N.J. 48, 526 A.2d 138 (1986); <em>Seeborg v. General Motors Corp., </em>284 Or. 695, 700-701, 588 P.2d 1100 (1978); see also 3 American Law of Products Liability (3d. Ed. 1987) \u00a7 43:14.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In our view, this evidentiary frameworkbest comports with our common-law requirement that the plaintiff bears the burden of proving that the product reached the ultimate consumer without substantial modification. This framework also recognizes that the alteration or modification defense in \u00a7 52-572p is narrowly drawn \u2014 the manufacturer must produce evidence that the plaintiffs harm occurred solely due to the third party\u2019s alteration or modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Mindful of these principles, we turn to the trial court\u2019s instruction with respect to \u00a7 52-572p.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> \u201cIn assessing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>adequacy of a charge to the jury, we consider the charge in its entirety, and judge it by its total effect rather than by its individual component parts. <em>Van Steensburg </em>v. <em>Lawrence &amp; Memorial Hospitals, </em>194 Conn. 500, 507, 481 A.2d 750 (1984). We consider whether the instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>tions are sufficiently correct in law, adapted to the issues and ample for the guidance of the jury. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>213 Conn. 446, 482, 569 A.2d 10 (1990); <em>Grecki </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>174 Conn. 200, 203, 384 A.2d 372 (1978); <em>Mack </em>v. <em>Perzanowski, </em>172 Conn. 310, 313, 374 A.2d 236 (1977); <em>Nally </em>v. <em>Charbonneau, </em>169 Conn. 50, 55-56, 362 A.2d 494 (1975). The charge must give the jurors a clear comprehension of the issues presented for their determination under the pleadings and upon the evidence, and must be suited to guide them in the determination of those issues. <em>Champagne </em>v. <em>Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., </em>212 Conn. 509, 566, 562 A.2d 1100 (1989); <em>Nally </em>v. <em>Charbonneau, </em>supra [55-56]. The test is whether the charge as a whole fairly presented the case to the jury so that no injustice was done under established rules of law. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra [482]; <em>Van Steensburg </em>v. <em>Lawrence &amp; Memorial Hospitals, </em>supra [507].\u201d <em>Goodmaster </em>v. <em>Houser, </em>225 Conn. 637, 644-45, 625 A.2d 1366 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">In the present case, the trial court correctly stated that the plaintiffs were required to prove that the defendants\u2019 tools reached the plaintiffs without a substantial change. Moreover, the trial court correctly stated that Electric Boat\u2019s actions in altering or modifying the tools must have been the sole proximate cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. The entire alteration or modification defense instruction, however, was given in the context of the defendants\u2019 special defenses. In fact, the trial court prefaced the instruction by stating that \u201cthe defendants must prove certain affirmative defenses which they\u2019ve made.\u201d Indeed, the special interrogatory form that the trial court submitted to the jury provided that, with respect to the alteration or modification defense, \u201c[t]he defendants have the duty to prove the allegations of the special defense.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Furthermore, with respect to the three exceptions delineated in \u00a7 52-572p, the trial court clearly placed the burden of persuasion on the defendants. Specifically, the trial court required the defendants to prove that Electric Boat\u2019s alterations or modifications: (1) were in violation of the defendants\u2019 instructions or specifications; (2) were made without the defendants\u2019 consent; or (3) were not reasonably foreseeable by the defendants. In other words, the trial court diminished the plaintiffs\u2019 burden of proof by instructing the jury that the defendants were required to disprove elements that the plaintiffs rightfully should have proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\u201cAn improper instruction on the burden of proof may so mislead the jury as to be potentially harmful to one of the parties and therefore may amount to reversible error. See <em>Alaimo </em>v. Royer, 188 Conn. 36, 40, 448 A.2d 207 (1982); <em>Potts </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>97 Conn. 174, 178, 115 A. 726 (1922); see also <em>LeCount </em>v. <em>Farrand, </em>118 Conn. 210, 213, 171 A.2d 623 (1934).\u201d <em>Goodmaster </em>v. <em>Houser, </em>supra, 225 Conn. 645. In the present case, the trial court imposed a more rigorous standard of proof on the defendants than is required by law and, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>potentially prejudiced their defense to the design defect claim. See id., 647 (concluding that trial court imposed more rigorous standard on plaintiff in proving damages, and potentially prejudiced plaintiffs right to recover lawful damages); cf. <em>Alaimo </em>v. Royer, supra, 39-40 (ordering new trial because trial court failed to instruct jury that heightened burden of proof applied in fraud actions). In other words, the jury charge was potentially prejudicial to the defendants because the plaintiffs may not have been able to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries would have occurred notwithstanding the subsequent alterations or modifications, or that the alterations or modifications: (1) were in compliance with the defendants\u2019 instructions or specifications; (2) were made with the defendants\u2019 consent; or (3) were reasonably foreseeable by the defendants. Because we conclude that the trial court\u2019s instruction relating to the parties\u2019 respective burdens of proof under \u00a7 52-572p constituted harmful error, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Although we have concluded that a new trial is necessary, we address the defendants\u2019 final claim because it is likely to arise on retriaLThe defendants argue that the trial court improperly instructed the jury that the \u201cstate-of-the-art defense\u201d was restricted to the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to warn claim.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendants assert that the trial court improperly prevented the jury from considering the state-of-the-art defense in the context of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim of defective design. In response, the plaintiffs argue that the state-of-the-art defense has no place in a strict products liability action because it improperly diverts the jury\u2019s attention from the product\u2019s condition to the manufacturer\u2019s conduct. The plaintiffs further assert that even if the trial court improperly declined to provide the instruction with respect to the design defect claim, the defendants have failed to prove that it constituted harmful error. Although we agree with the defendants that state-of-the-art evidence applies to design defect claims as well as to failure to warn claims, we disagree that such evidence constitutes an affirmative defense to the plaintiffs\u2019 design defect claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The following additional facts are relevant to this issue. The defendants presented testimony that they produced the safest and highest quality tools that they were able to design. Robert Marelli, superintendent of tools and equipment at Electric Boat, testified that the defendants\u2019 tools were the best for Electric Boat\u2019s purposes and that Electric Boat would be in a \u201ctough situation\u201d if faced with the prospect of having to replace them.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>Conversely, the plaintiffs presented evidence that a chipping hammer manufactured by Atlas Copco, which had a reduced vibration design, was available in 1976. A Chicago Pneumatic interoffice memorandum dated October, 1974, provided that, \u201c[u]nless we at least keep pace with the technological developments of major competitors like Atlas Copco, we certainly face a prospect of loss of market share.\u201d The plaintiffs also presented another Chicago Pneumatic interoffice memorandum dated May, 1974, which outlined various devices designed to isolate vibration developed by Chicago Pneumatic in conjunction with Caterpillar Tractor Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The trial court instructed the jury that \u201cstate of the art is defined as the level of scientific and technological knowledge existing at the time the product in question was designed for manufacture.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The court also instructed the jury that a manufacturer cannot be held to standards that exceed the limit of scientific advances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>and technology existing at the time of manufacture and, therefore, the defendants could not be found liable if they had proven compliance with the state of the art. The trial court, however, limited the applicability of the state-of-the-art defense solely to the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to warn claims. The defendants took timely exception to the court\u2019s limitation of the state-of-the-art defense to only the failure to warn claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">In <em>Tomer </em>v. <em>American Home Products Corp., </em>170 Conn. 681, 687, 368 A.2d 35 (1976), this court recognized the applicability of state-of-the-art evidence to failure to warn claims, stating that \u201c[sjince the defendants could not be held to standards which exceeded the limits of scientific advances existing at the time of their allegedly tortious conduct, expert testimony tending to show the scope of duties owed could have been properly limited to scientific knowledge existing at that time.\u201d The question of whether state-of-the-art evidence similarly applies to design defect claims, however, is a matter of first impression for this court.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">We begin our analysis of this issue by recognizing that the term \u201cstate of the art\u201d has been the source <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>of substantial confusion. See J. Beasley, supra, p. 393 (\u201c[t]he status of \u2018the state of the art\u2019 in strict tort liability actions and the treatment and weight accorded evidence of the state of the art have been obscured by a lack of precision in definition and function\u201d); G. Robb, \u201cA Practical Approach to Use of State of the Art Evidence in Strict Products Liability Cases,\u201d 77 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1, 3 (1982) (\u201c[m]uch of the confusion in the use of \u2018state of the art\u2019 evidence can be attributed to the uncertain meaning of the term\u201d). Several courts have defined state-of-the-art evidence in terms of industry custom; see, e.g., <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Minster Machine Co., </em>669 F.2d 628, 633 (10th Cir. 1982) (viewing proper meaning of \u201cstate of the art ... to mean simply the custom and practice in an industry\u201d); <em>Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Day, </em>594 P.2d 38, 44 (Alaska 1979), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 894,102 S.

See, e.g., <em>Frazier </em>v. <em>Kysor Industrial Corp., </em>43 Colo.

Several courts have concluded that such evidence is inadmissible in design defect claims because it improperly focuses on the reasonableness of the manufacturer\u2019s conduct, which is irrelevant in a strict products liability action. See, e.g., <em>Habecker </em>v. <em>Clark Equipment Co., </em>36 F.3d 278, 285-86 (3d Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>1994), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1003, 115 S. Ct. 1313, 131 L. Ed. 2d 195 (1995) (applying Pennsylvania law, characterizing state-of-the-art evidence as \u201cabsolutely irrelevant\u201d in strict liability action); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>RaybestosManhattan, Inc., </em>69 Haw. 287, 288-89, 740 P.2d 548 (1987) (\u201c[although highly relevant to a <em>negligence </em>action, [state-of-the-art evidence] has absolutely no bearing on the elements of a strict products liability claim\u201d [emphasis in original]); <em>Elmore </em>v. <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc., </em>673 S.W.2d 434, 438 (Mo. 1984) (\u201c[t]he manufacturer\u2019s standard of care is irrelevant because it relates to the reasonableness of the manufacturer\u2019s design choice; fault is an irrelevant consideration on the issue of liability in the strict liability context\u201d). Conversely, other courts, in construing relevant state tort reform statutes, have stated that a manufacturer\u2019s proof of state-of-the-art evidence constitutes a complete defense to a design defect claim. See, e.g., <em>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Gregg, </em>supra, 554 N.E.2d 1155 (defining parameters of state of the art for purposes of affirmative defense statute); <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Massey-Ferguson, Inc., </em>522 N.W.2d 294, 295-96 (Iowa 1994) (setting forth quantum of state-of-the-art evidence necessary for defendant to avoid liability); <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Rich Foods, Inc., </em>139 N.J. 365, 377-78, 654 A.2d 1365 (1995) (stating defendant must establish state-of-the-art evidence by preponderance of evidence in order to prevail).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Nevertheless, the overwhelming majority of courts have held that, in design defect cases, state-of-the-art evidence is relevant to determining the adequacy of the product\u2019s design. See, e.g., <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Audi NSU Auto Union, </em>739 F.2d 1481, 1485-86 (10th Cir. 1984) (\u201c[j]ust as [the] plaintiff could use state-of-the-art evidence to try to show the feasibility of other safer alternatives, [the] defendant could use state-of-the-art evidence to attempt to establish the expectations of a reasonable consumer\u201d); <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Tiffin Motor Homes, Inc., </em>supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>697 F.2d 1197 (\u201cadmission of state of the art evidence, while only a factor to consider, is both necessary and probative on the issue of \u2018unreasonably dangerous\u2019 \u201d); <em>Fibreboard Corp. </em>v. <em>Fenton, </em>845 P.2d 1168, 1174 (Colo. 1993) (\u201c[s]tate-of-the-art evidence is clearly admissible and is a factor to consider in determining whether a product is defective and unreasonably dangerous due to a defective design\u201d); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Salem, Corp., </em>97 N.J. 78, 88, 477 A.2d 1246 (1984) (\u201c[s]tate-of-the-art is a relevant factor in considering the adequacy of the design of the product under the risk-utility analysis, including particularly design features relating to safety\u201d); <em>Lancaster Silo &amp; Block Co. </em>v. <em>Northern Propane Gas Co., </em>75 App. Div. 2d 55, 66, 427 N.Y.S.2d 1009 (1980) (concluding that state-of-the-art evidence is relevant because \u201cstate of the art sets the parameters of feasibility\u201d); <em>Boatland of Houston, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>supra, 609 S.W.2d 748 (finding state-of-the-art evidence \u201cis important in determining whether a safer design was feasible\u201d); <em>Crittenden </em>v. <em>Fibreboard Corp., </em>58 Wash. App. 649, 658-59, 794 P.2d 554 (1990) (concluding state-of-the-art evidence is admissible in either risk-utility or consumer expectation analysis); see also 2 American Law of Products Liability, supra, \u00a7 30:50, p. 30-79 (\u201c[t]he majority of courts have found . . . that in design defect cases, state of the ait evidence is relevant to show the reasonableness of the design or the fact that the product was dangerous beyond the expectations of the ordinary consumer\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The plaintiffs assert that state-of-the-art evidence has no place in a strict products liability action because it improperly focuses the jury\u2019s attention on the manufacturer\u2019s conduct. We disagree. We adopt the majority view and hold that such evidence is relevant and assists the jury in determining whether a product is defective and unreasonably dangerous. See <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Tiffin Motor Homes, Inc., </em>supra, 697 F.2d 1197 (\u201cadmission of state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>of the art evidence, while only a factor to consider, is both necessary and probative on the issue of \u2018unreasonably dangerous\u2019 \u201d); see also J. Beasley, supra, p. 406 (\u201c[t]he majority position is that state of the art evidence is mere evidence, which can be rejected or accepted in jury deliberations on the ultimate fact of defectiveness as easily as other types of evidence\u201d). In other words, \u201cstate of the art relates to the condition of the product and the possibility that it could have been made safer.\u201d 1 M. Madden, supra, \u00a7 8.3, p. 301. Accordingly, we conclude that state of the art is a relevant factor in considering the adequacy of the design of a product and whether it is in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the ordinary consumer. In defining the term state of the art, we adhere to our precedent in <em>Tomer </em>and to the majority view, which characterize state of the art as the level of relevant scientific, technological and safety knowledge existing and reasonably feasible at the time of design. See <em>Tomer </em>v. <em>American Home Products Corp., </em>supra, 170 Conn. 686-87; see also <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Massey-Ferguson, Inc., </em>supra, 716 F.2d 347; <em>Gosewisch </em>v. <em>American Honda Motor Co., </em>supra, 153 Ariz. 394; <em>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Gregg, </em>supra, 554 N.E.2d 1155-56; <em>Boatland of Houston, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>supra, 609 S.W.2d 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Furthermore, we point out that state of the art refers to what is technologically feasible, rather than merely industry custom. <em>Chown </em>v. <em>USM Corp., </em>supra, 297 N.W.2d 221 (\u201c[c]ustom refers to what was being done in the industry; state of the art refers to what feasibly could have been done\u201d). \u201cAlthough customs of an industry may be relevant . . . because those customs may lag behind technological development, they are not identical with the state-of-the-art.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>O'Brien v. Muskin Corp., </em>supra, 94 N.J. 182. \u201cObviously, the inaction of all the manufacturers in an area should not be the standard by which the state of the art should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>be determined.\u201d <em>Hancock </em>v. <em>Paccar, Inc., </em>204 Neb. 468, 479-80, 283 N.W.2d 25 (1979); see also <em>T.J. Hooper, </em>60 F.2d 737, 740 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 287 U.S. 662, 53 S. Ct. 220, 77 L. Ed. 571 (1932) (\u201c[i]ndeed in most cases reasonable prudence is in fact common prudence; but strictly it is never its measure; a whole calling may have unduly lagged in the adoption of new and available devices\u201d). Accordingly, \u201c[a] manufacturer may have a duty to make products pursuant to a safer design even if the custom of the industry is not to use that alternative. \u201d <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Muskin Corp., </em>supra, 182-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">We now apply these principles to the standards for determining design defectiveness that we have addressed in part I of this opinion. Under the ordinary consumer expectation standard, state-of-the-art evidence \u201chelps to determine the expectation of the ordinary consumer.\u201d <em>Bruce </em>v. <em>Martin-Marietta Corp., </em>544 F.2d 442, 447 (10th Cir. 1976); see <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Audi NSU Auto Union, </em>supra, 739 F.2d 1486 (\u201cdefendant could use state-of-the-art evidence to attempt to establish the expectations of a reasonable consumer\u201d); <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Melody Homes Manufacturer, </em>121 Ariz. 253, 260, 589 P.2d 896 (App. 1978) (finding state-of-the-art evidence relevant to determining consumer expectations); <em>Crittenden </em>v. <em>Fibreboard Corp., </em>supra, 58 Wash. App. 658-59 (concluding state-of-the-art evidence admissible as factor in both consumer expectation and risk-utility analyses).<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> For example, in approving the trial court\u2019s admission of state-of-the-art evidence, the court in <em>Bruce </em>stated: \u201cA consumer would not expect a Model T to have the safety features which are incorporated in automobiles made today. The same expectation applies to airplanes. [The plaintiffs have not shown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>that the ordinary consumer would expect a plane made in 1952 to have the safety features of one made in 1970.\u201d <em>Bruce </em>v. <em>Martin-Marietta Corp., </em>supra, 447. In other words, state-of-the-art evidence supplies the jury with a relevant basis on which to determine what the ordinary consumer would expect with respect to safety features available at the time of manufacture.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Furthermore, under the modified consumer expectations standard we have set forth today, such evidence would be admissible as a factor properly to be considered as part of the risk-utility calculus. See <em>Norton </em>v. <em>Snapper Power Equipment, </em>806 F.2d 1545, 1549 (11th Cir. 1987) (state-of-the-art evidence is relevant factor in risk-utility analysis); <em>Fibreboard Corp. </em>v. <em>Fenton, </em>supra, 845 P.2d 1174 (\u201c[s]tate-of-the-art evidence is clearly admissible and is a factor to consider in determining whether a product is defective and unreasonably dangerous due to a defective design\u201d); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Salem Corp., </em>supra, 97 N.J. 88 (\u201c[s]tate-of-the-art is a relevant factor in considering the adequacy of the design of the product under the risk-utility analysis, including particularly design features relating to safety\u201d); <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Ravens-Metal Products, Inc., </em>72 Ohio App. 3d 216, 229, 594 N.E.2d 153 (1991) (\u201cstate of the art is a factor which a jury may properly consider in determining the issue of whether a product is defective under the risk/benefit standard\u201d). Because state-of-the-art evidence is relevant to set \u201cthe parameters of feasibility\u201d; <em>Lancaster Silo &amp; Block Co. </em>v. <em>Northern Propane Gas Co., </em>supra, 75 App. Div. 2d 66; the jury is provided with an objective standard by which to gauge the product\u2019s risks and utility. In this respect, such evidence is a relevant factor on both sides of the risk-utility equation: the risks that the product presents to consumers in light of the availability of other safety measures, and the utility of the product in comparison to feasible design alternatives. See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Salem Corp., </em>supra, 97 N.J. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>88-89 (analyzing relevance of state-of-the-art evidence to risk-utility analysis). Accordingly, state-of-the-art evidence constitutes one of several relevant factors to assist the jury in determining whether a reasonable consumer would consider the product design unreasonably dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">In summary, we agree with the defendants insofar as they argue that the trial court improperly limited the applicability of state-of-the-art evidence to the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to warn claims. In our view, state-of-the-art evidence is relevant to the determination of whether a particular product design is unreasonably dangerous. We disagree with the defendants\u2019 contention, however, that proof of compliance with the state of the art constitutes an affirmative defense to a design defect claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">We emphasize that although state-of-the-art evidence may be dispositive on the facts of a particular case, such evidence does not constitute an affirmative defense that, if proven, would absolve the defendant from liability. <em>Crispin </em>v. <em>Volkswagenwerk AG, </em>248 N.J. Super. 540, 554, 591 A.2d 966 (1991); see <em>Boatland of Houston, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>supra, 609 S.W.2d 749 n.3 (\u201c[t]his opinion, insofar as it holds that certain evidence of the state of the art is admissible on the issue of defectiveness in product design cases, is not intended to suggest that such evidence constitutes a defense, such as do misuse and assumption of the risk\u201d). In other words, compliance with state of the art would not, as a matter of law, warrant a judgment for a defendant. <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Muskin Corp., </em>supra, 94 N.J. 183-84. For this reason, we believe that state-of-the-art evidence is \u201cbetter characterized as rebuttal evidence than as a defense.\u201d <em>Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. </em>v. <em>Caldwell, </em>818 S.W.2d 749, 752 (Tex. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">We therefore conclude that state-of-the-art evidence is merely one factor for the jury to consider under either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>the ordinary or modified consumer expectation test. Accordingly, if on remand the trial court concludes that sufficient evidence has been produced to warrant an instruction, the jury may properly consider the state of the art in determining whether the defendants! tools were defectively designed and unreasonably dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">rv</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">We also address two issues that the plaintiffs have raised in their cross appeal that are likely to arise on retrial.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The plaintiffs argue that the trial court: (1) unfairly prejudiced their claim for punitive damages by excluding evidence, based on a misrepresentation of the parties\u2019 stipulation, of the number of other persons who allegedly had been injured by the defendants\u2019 tools; and (2) improperly permitted the jury to view irrelevant and prejudicial videotapes of the defendants\u2019 manufacturing process, which included narration concerning the defendants\u2019 quality control measures and safety testing procedures.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">We begin with the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the trial court unfairly prejudiced their claim for punitive damages by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>excluding evidence, based on a misrepresentation of the parties\u2019 stipulation, of the number of other persons who allegedly had been injured by the defendants\u2019 tools. The defendants argue that the trial court properly excluded the evidence based upon its interpretation of the stipulation, which did not address whether the plaintiffs would be permitted to elicit testimony with respect to the specific number of persons allegedly injured by the defendants\u2019 tools.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> We agree with the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The following additional facts are relevant to this issue. Prior to trial, the parties entered into a stipulation with respect to the admissibility of certain evidence. The stipulation provides in relevant part: \u201c(1) The plaintiff, Joseph Gladu, shall not make any reference to the fact that there are 228 other plaintiffs with lawsuits pending against Chicago Pneumatic Tool Company, Dresser Industries, Inc., and Stanley [Works].</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">\u201c(2) The plaintiff, Joseph Gladu, shall be permitted to elicit testimony from his treating physicians and medical experts that they have examined or treated other-individuals with symptoms similar to Joseph Gladu\u2019s, some of whom work or have worked at the Electric Boat facility in Groton, Connecticut.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">The plaintiffs presented the testimony of Martin Cherniack, a faculty member of Yale School of Medicine and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>director of the Occupational Health Clinic in Groton. During an in limine hearing before the trial court, the plaintiffs sought to present evidence that, based on epidemiological studies Chemiack had performed in 1987, there was a 70 percent incidence rate of hand arm vibration syndrome at Electric Boat. The defendants argued that such testimony was not within the scope of the parties\u2019 stipulation. The trial court ruled: \u201cI still think you should stick to your stipulation that he did treat other individuals with symptoms similar to Joseph Gladu, some of whom work or have worked at Electric Boat and just leave it at that, not get into any percentages or any numbers or anything else.\u201d The trial court further stated, \u201cthat\u2019s a well worded stipulation and you ought to abide by it literally and I think it will be fair to everybody.\u201d The plaintiffs properly objected to the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">During direct examination of Chemiack, the court, upon objection by the defendants, excluded evidence of epidemiological surveys of hand arm vibration syndrome performed by Chemiack based on the individuals he had examined from Electric Boat and other employers.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>The plaintiffs asserted that the defendants\u2019 reading of the stipulation was not in accordance with their agreement. The trial court instructed Chemiack that he could testify that he had \u201clooked at a number of other people without mentioning how many.\u201d Subsequently, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Chemiack commented on cross-examination that, \u201cafter looking at some 600 of these tests, there\u2019s certain patterns that come out.\u201d Outside the presence of the jury, the trial court cautioned Chemiack that he may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>testify that he had \u201clooked at a number of other people without mentioning how many.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\u201cIt is well established that [t]he trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility [and relevancy] of evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>202 Conn. 463, 482, 522 A.2d 249 (1987). The trial court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Avis, </em>209 Conn. 290, 298, 551 A.2d 26 (1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1097, 109 S. Ct. 1570, 103 L.

One fact is relevant to another if in the common course of events the existence of one, alone or with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>other facts, renders the existence of the other either more certain or more probable. . . . Evidence is irrelevant or too remote if there is such a want of open and visible connection between the evidentiary and principal facts that, all things considered, the former is not worthy or safe to be admitted in the proof of the latter. . . . Evidence is not rendered inadmissible because it is not conclusive. All that is required is that the evidence tend to support a relevant fact even to a slight degree, so long as it is not prejudicial or merely cumulative.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>235 Conn. 274, 305-306, 664 A.2d 743 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The admissibility of the evidence at issue is governed by the parties\u2019 trial stipulation. The standard for interpreting atrial stipulation is well settled. \u201c[A] stipulation . . . must be construed according to the intention of the parties as expressed in the language used in the document itself, rather than according to the intention which may have existed in the mind of either of the parties.\u201d <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Foley, </em>149 Conn. 469, 471, 181 A.2d 607 (1962); see <em>Rosenfield </em>v. <em>Metals Selling Corp., </em>229 Conn. 771, 780, 643 A.2d 1253 (1994). When the \u201cintent of the parties is clear in the stipulation, intent is a matter of law, rather than a question of fact. See <em>Zadravecz </em>v. <em>Zadravecz, </em>39 Conn. App. 28, 31, 664 A.2d 303 (1995).\u201d <em>Legg </em>v. <em>Legg, </em>44 Conn. App. 303, 306, 688 A.2d 1354 (1997). \u201cAbsent a clearly expressed intention of the parties, the construction of a stipulation is a question of fact committed to the sound discretion of the trial court. See <em>Central Connecticut Teachers Federal Credit Union </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>27 Conn. App. 435, 437, 606 A.2d 729 (1992).\u201d <em>Rosenfield </em>v. <em>Metals Selling Corp., </em>supra, 780.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">In our view, the parties\u2019 intent was clearly expressed as a matter of law, and the trial court abused its discretion in excluding Chemiack\u2019s testimony regarding the number of persons with symptoms similar to those of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>the plaintiffs. The parties stipulated that the plaintiffs could not make reference to the fact that numerous other individuals had actions pending against the defendants. The parties further stipulated that \u201c[t]he plaintiff, Joseph Gladu, <em>shall be permitted </em>to elicit testimony from his treating physicians and medical experts that they have examined or treated <em>other individuals </em>with symptoms similar to Joseph Gladu\u2019s . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) We conclude that the language of the parties\u2019 stipulation is plain and unambiguous. Although the stipulation precludes the plaintiffs from referring to the number of individuals who were bringing actions against the defendants, it allowed the plaintiffs to present evidence with respect to the number of persons with similar symptoms. Accordingly, because we find that the intent of the parties is clear as evidenced by the language of the stipulation, we conclude that the trial court incorrectly interpreted its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Having determined that the trial court misinterpreted the parties\u2019 stipulation as a matter of law, we next determine whether the evidence at issue was relevant. As part of the punitive damages claim, the plaintiffs raised the issue of the defendants\u2019 reckless disregard for the safety of the plaintiffs and others. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-240b (\u201c[pjunitive damages may be awarded if the claimant proves that the harm suffered was the result of the product seller\u2019s reckless disregard for the safety of product users, consumers or others who were injured by the product\u201d). In our view, evidence of the number of persons injured by the defendants\u2019 tools was relevant to the plaintiffs\u2019 punitive damage claim. We therefore conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in prohibiting the plaintiffs from placing evidence of the number of persons injured by the defendants\u2019 tools before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">We note that, in light of the trial court\u2019s misinterpretation of the parties\u2019 stipulation, the court never had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>opportunity to balance the probative value of the evidence against its prejudicial effect. On remand, if the trial court concludes that the probative value of the evidence is not outweighed by its prejudicial effect; <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Loiseau, </em>223 Conn. 786, 804, 614 A.2d 414 (1992); the trial court may properly admit the evidence for consideration by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 final claim is that the trial court improperly permitted the jury to view irrelevant and prejudicial videotapes of the defendants\u2019 manufacturing process, which included narration concerning the defendants\u2019 quality control measures and safety testing procedures. In response, the defendants assert that the evidence relating to the defendants\u2019 safety practices rebutted the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the defendants had acted with reckless disregard in supplying the tools to the plaintiffs. We agree with the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">The following facts are relevant to the resolution of this issue. The defendants presented a videotape regarding Dresser\u2019s manufacturing process and safety practices, which was accompanied by in-court narration by Tom Hurst, president of Dresser\u2019s industrial tool division. Dresser employs vibration testing to comply with engineering specifications, including balance and concentricity of the parts. The videotape also displayed Dresser\u2019s metallurgical lab, in which the tools are tested for heat treating and engineering specifications, as well as the inspection department, which tests all tools for quality certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">The defendants also presented a videotape of Stanley Works\u2019 manufacturing process, which demonstrated the use of computer engineering to develop design specifications. The videotape showed that Stanley Works manufactures tool parts by computer aided machining sequences in order to meet specifications. The tool <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>parts are subsequently subjected to heat treating and cooling. Furthermore, the process includes quality control inspections to ensure that the overall tolerances meet specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The jury also viewed a videotape concerning Chicago Pneumatic\u2019s manufacturing process, which begins with the use of computer aided design systems. Metallurgists test the microstructure and chemical composition of metals to ensure compliance with specifications. The videotape demonstrated that tool parts are machined to exact specifications and then heat treated to achieve the desired level of hardness. Micrometers and other devices are used to test lot dimensions and conformity to design requirements. In order to ensure a perfect fit, the parts are then subjected to a final cleaning by immersing the parts into a special tank that uses sonic waves to agitate the cleaning solvent. The videotape also showed that the parts are hand assembled and then undergo operational tests and final inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Contending that the videotapes were irrelevant and prejudicial, the plaintiffs filed a motion in limine to exclude the videotape presentations. Finding that the videotapes were relevant to the plaintiffs\u2019 punitive damages claim, the trial court denied the motion. The trial court stated: \u201cI\u2019m going to allow it. I think when you get into . . . the claims of intentional misrepresentation, fraudulent concealment, and the wilful, wanton, malicious manner, et cetera, it opens up the door to almost anything by way of defense.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>\u201cThe rules for determining the admissibility of evidence are well settled. The trial court has broad discretion to determine both the relevancy and remoteness of evidence. . . . Only upon a showing of a clear abuse of discretion will this court set aside on appeal rulings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>on evidentiary matters. ... In considering the relevancy of evidence, we ask whether it tends to establish the existence of a material fact or to corroborate other direct evidence in the case. . . . Because there is no precise and universal test of relevancy, however, the question must ultimately be addressed on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the teachings of reason and judicial experience.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dunham </em>v.

We have identified at least four circumstances where the prejudicial effect of otherwise admissible evidence may outweigh its probative value: (1) where the facts offered may unduly arouse the jury\u2019s emotions, hostility or sympathy, (2) where the proof and answering evidence it provokes may create a side issue that will unduly distract the jury from the main issues, (3) where the evidence offered and the counterproof will consume an undue amount of time, and (4) where the [party against whom the evidence has been offered], having no reasonable ground to anticipate the evidence, is unfairly surprised and unprepared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>to meet it. <em>State </em>v. <em>DeMatteo, </em>186 Conn. 696, 702-703, 443 A.2d 915 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>209 Conn. 458, 478-79, 551 A.2d 1231 (1988).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Grayson </em>v. <em>Wofsey, Rosen, Kweskin &amp; Kuriansky, </em>231 Conn. 168, 193, 646 A.2d 195 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">With these principles in mind, we proceed to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. Although we are mindful of the trial court\u2019s broad discretion in determining the admissibility of evidence; <em>Dunham </em>v. <em>Dunham, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 324; we nevertheless conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the videotapes into evidence. Here, the plaintiffs\u2019 punitive damages claim alleges that the defendants acted with reckless disregard in providing the tools that the plaintiffs had used between 1976 and 1987. In order to rebut the claim of reckless disregard, the defendants offered videotapes that were produced in 1992. Because the videotapes depict the defendants\u2019 manufacturing processes and safety practices years after the time period in question, absent a showing by the defendants that these processes and practices were substantially the same as those employed between 1976 and 1987, we conclude that they are irrelevant to the issue of whether the defendants acted with reckless disregard in selling the tools used by the plaintiffs between 1976 and 1987. See <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>213 Conn. 446, 464, 569 A.2d 10 (1990) (concluding that trial court properly excluded postaccident photograph because it was irrelevant to plaintiffs claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Additionally, the videotapes highlight the defendants\u2019 manufacturing processes, which are completely irrelevant to the plaintiffs\u2019 design defect claim. We agree with the Oregon Court of Appeals, which recently addressed this precise issue in <em>Lakin </em>v. <em>Senco Products, Inc., </em>144 Or. App. 52, 70, 925 P.2d 107 (1996), in which the defendant attempted to present a videotape of its manufacturing process to rebut a claim of reckless disregard in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>selling defectively designed products. In <em>Lakin, </em>the court stated: \u201cWhether [the] defendant showed care in the manufacturing process and tested completed [products] to determine that they operated as designed was irrelevant to [the] plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of defective design and inadequate design-related research and testing, which, ultimately, underlay their claim of \u2018wanton disregard.\u2019 \u201d Id., 71. Similarly, in this case, the videotapes\u2019 focus on the defendants\u2019 manufacturing processes is not relevant to rebutting the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the defendants acted with reckless disregard in selling defectively designed tools.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Furthermore, even if we were to find that the videotapes were marginally relevant, their probative value nevertheless is outweighed by their prejudicial effect. See <em>Grayson </em>v. <em>Wofsey, Rosen, Kweskin &amp; Kuriansky, </em>supra, 231 Conn. 193. The videotapes\u2019 extensive discussion of the defendants\u2019 concern for unrelated safety issues, including sound testing, heat treating and corrosion resistance, creates \u201cside issuefs] that will unduly distract the jury from the main issues.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. We therefore conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the videotape evidence of the defendants\u2019 manufacturing processes and safety practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">In summary, on the defendants\u2019 appeal, we conclude that: (1) the plaintiffs need not prove a feasible alternative design as an absolute requirement to establishing a design defect claim; (2) with respect to the defendants\u2019 alteration/modification defense, the trial court improperly imposed a more rigorous standard of proof on the defendants than is required by law; and (3) the trial court improperly limited the admissibility of state-of-the-art evidence to the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to warn claim. On the plaintiffs\u2019 cross appeal relating to the punitive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>damages claim, we conclude that the trial court: (1) misinterpreted, as a matter of law, the parties\u2019 stipulation relating to evidence of the number of persons with symptoms similar to those of the plaintiffs; and (2) improperly allowed the defendants to present irrelevant videotapes of their manufacturing processes.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial on the design defect claim and the punitive damages claim in connection with the design defect claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">In this opinion BORDEN, NORCOTT and PALMER, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b224-7\"> For purposes of this opinion, the plaintiffs are Joseph Gladu, David Thompson, Roy Tutt, Thomas Brayman and Jaime Irizarry.

Therefore, the mere happening of an injury does not create legal responsibility on the part of a manufacturer. The law does not require the manufacturer to produce a product which is accident free or foolproof. A manufacturer\u2019s duty is to produce a product which is reasonably safe.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">\u201cNow, under the doctrine of strict liability, the plaintiff must establish each of the following five elements by a fair preponderance of the evidence: One, that the defendant engaged in the business of selling the product. Now, that is not in dispute, so you don\u2019t have to concern yourselves with that. That\u2019s been acknowledged. Second, that the product was in a defective condition, unreasonably dangerous to the user. Third, that the defect caused the injuries for which compensation is sought. Fourth, that the defect existed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>at the time of the sale.

You must next determine whether the product was in a defective condition. A product is in a defective condition if it leaves the seller\u2019s hand in a condition that will be unreasonably dangerous to the ultimate consumer or user. Accordingly, a product may be defective even though it was manufactured in the way it was intended to be manufactured and even though it was perfectly made according to the manufacturer\u2019s own standards and tolerances, as long as the product is unreasonably dangerous when used for its intended and foreseeable purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">* ** *</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\"><em>\u201cIt is for you to draw your own conclusions as to the reasonable expectations of an ordinary user of the defendants\u2019products and as to the knowledge common to the community at large regarding these products. </em>It is the unreasonably dangerous condition of the product that makes the product defective, not whether the manufacturer or supplier knew the product was unreasonably dangerous. Therefore, the plaintiffs [do] not need to show that the seller knew the product was defective.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b248-7\"> Specifically, the defendants argue, \u201cunder the trial court\u2019s sole proximate cause theory, there are no circumstances under which the alteration or modification of a product could prevent liability. As instructed by the court, in order for the plaintiffs to recover, the jury was required to find that the plaintiffs had proved, inter alia, that the defendants\u2019 tools were defective and that \u2018if there was a defect which made the tools unreasonably dangerous, that such defect was the proximate cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries.\u2019 . . . If the jury found that the tools were defective and that such defect(s) were a proximate cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 ii\\juries, the jury could not conclude that alteration or modification was the sole proximate cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries even if they found that the tools were substantially altered or modified. Under the trial court\u2019s theory, therefore, the jury could return a plaintiffs\u2019 verdict even though the plaintiffs had failed to prove that the products had reached them without substantial change in their condition. On the other hand, a finding that any defect was not a proximate cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries would necessitate a defendants\u2019 verdict, thereby eliminating the necessity of considering the issue of alteration or modification altogether.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b250-6\"> We recognize that we generally begin our analysis with the sufficiency of the evidence claim because it may result in an outright reversal.

Section 112 (D) (2) of the model act provides in relevant part: \u201cWhen the product seller proves, by a preponderance of the evidence, that an alteration or modification of the product by the claimant, or by a party other than the claimant or the product seller, has caused the claimant\u2019s harm, the claimant\u2019s damages shall be subject to reduction or apportionment to the extent that the alteration or modification was a cause of the harm. Under this Subsection, the trier of fact may determine that the harm arose solely because of the product alteration or modification.\u201d Id., 62,737.

Id., 62,739.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b256-7\"> We point out that a jury\u2019s determination that a subsequent alteration or modification constituted the sole proximate cause of a plaintiffs harm is not the end of the inquiry. Section 52-572p (a) provides that a manufacturer may still be strictly liable if the alteration or modification: (1) was in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions or specifications; (2) was made with the manufacturer\u2019s consent; or (3) was the result of conduct that the manufacturer reasonably should have anticipated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b257-6\"> \u201cThe phrase \u2018burden of proof is used in two ways. First, to refer to the burden of persuading the jury that a fact exists, and second, to refer to the burden of producing sufficient evidence to persuade the judge to allow the case or issue to go to the jury, viz., that a prima facie case exists. <em>Sorlito </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins.

The burden of persuasion creates a risk of an adverse decision on the merits by the jury, whereas the burden of going forward or producing evidence creates a risk that the judge will withdraw the case or an issue from the jury.\u201d C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 4.1.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b258-6\"> We note that a plaintiff may establish that the product in question was intended to and did reach the consumer without substantial change in condition merely by making such an allegation in the plaintiffs complaint and by adducing sufficient evidence to warrant the inference that the product did, in fact, reach the consumer without substantial change in condition. See, e.g., <em>Prokolkin </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>supra, 170 Conn. 299-300; <em>Wachtel </em>v. <em>Rosol, </em>supra, 159 Conn. 501; <em>Coe-Park Donuts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Robertshaw Controls Co., </em>1 Conn. App. 84, 89, 468 A.2d 292 (1983). Where, however, the plaintiff is aware that there has been a substantial change to the product, the plaintiff should acknowledge the change in its complaint, but allege that it was not the sole proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury or, alternatively, that the change: (1) was made in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions or specifications; (2) was made with the manufacturer\u2019s consent; or (3) was the result of conduct that the manufacturer reasonably should have anticipated. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-572p.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b260-6\"> A minority of courts have concluded that substantial change is an affirmative defense that the defendant has the burden of proving. See <em>Cornette </em>v. <em>Searjeant Metal Products, Inc., </em>147 Ind. App. 46, 67, 258 N.E.2d 652 (1970) (Sharp, J., concurring); <em>Placencio </em>v. <em>Allied Industrial International, Inc., </em>724 S.W.2d 20, 22 (Tex. 1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b260-7\"> The trial court instructed the jury as follows: \u201cNow, another area I have to discuss with you is the claim of the defendants that the tools were altered or modified, and, again, that\u2019s something that is a defense if they were modified in a way not approved of or not anticipated by the defendants; and let me give you the rule in that regard. The alteration or modification of a product by a third parly, not the plaintiff, but someone other than the plaintiff \u2014 in this case, the Electric Boat \u2014 is a complete defense to a product liability claim if you find the following: One, the alleged injuries would not have occurred but for the alteration or modification; and two, if the alteration or modification was unintended and unforeseeable by the manufacturer. The law provides that the defendants are not liable for harm that occurred due to the fact that the product was altered or modified by a third party except under circumstances where, one, the alteration or modification was in accordance with the instructions or specifications of the product seller; two, the alteration or modification was made with the consent of the product seller; three, the alteration or modification was the result of conduct that reasonably should have been anticipated by the product seller. In regard to this issue, you may consider whether or not the conduct of the owner of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>the tools, Electric Boat, by its maintenance procedures and its practice of repairing tools and use of replacement parts, constitutes an alteration or modification of the tools.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">\u201cIf you find that Electric Boat did alter or modify the tools in a manner which was neither intended nor anticipated by the defendants, and that the alteration was the cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries, then the defendants are not liable and your verdict must be for the defendants. On the other hand, if you find that Electric Boat did not alter or modify the tools, or if they did and such alteration was not the cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries, then you must [find] in favor of the plaintiffs in regard to this issue. Again, with respect to actions of Electric Boat in altering or modifying the tools, their actions must be the sole proximate cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries and the defendants \u2014 if the defendants\u2019 product is modified or altered by a third party other than the plaintiff \u2014 [are] not liable for injuries which were solely caused by the fact that the product was altered or modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">\u201cUnder the law, the allegation of misuse applies to modification or alteration of the product by a third party, it does not apply to the conduct of the plaintiff. It also only relieves the product seller of liability if the alteration or modification by the third party is the sole proximate cause of the injuries to the plaintiffs. In order for the defendant to prove that a third party was solely responsible for the injury to the plaintiff, they must prove that any modifications or alterations were made in violation of the instructions or specifications of the seller and without the consent of the seller. They must also show that the alteration or modification of the product was not reasonably foreseeable by the seller. In other words, the defendants in this case can only be absolved from liability using a defense of alteration or modification by Electric Boat if, first, Electric Boat changed the tools without the consent of the defendants and in situations that were neither intended nor foreseeable by the defendants; and, second, if the harm suffered by the plaintiffs would not have occurred but for the modifications or alterations. You will thus need to consider whether there were any modifications or alterations made to the tools, and if so, whether the injuries to the plaintiffs were caused solely by any modifications or alterations, or whether the injuries would have occurred independent of any modifications or alterations. You must also consider the intended and anticipated and expected use of the tools in order to determine whether any modification or alterations were foreseeable. If the seller could have anticipated the modifications or alterations, then their failure to warn against that type of alteration or modification renders the tool defective. The general warnings against alterations or modifications is not sufficient.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b262-6\"> The special interrogatory form provided in relevant part: \u201cIf the jury has answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any one or more of the first four questions, you must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>now consider the special defenses raised by the defendants. The defendants have the duty to prove the allegations of the special defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">\u201cB. The defendants have claimed, by way of special defense, that the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries and damages were caused by their employer, Electric Boat. If you find that the special defense against Electric Boat was proven by the defendants as the <em>sole proximate cause </em>of the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries and damages your verdict must be for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">\u201cPlease indicate whether the special defense listed below was the <em>sole proximate cause </em>of the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">\u201c1.

Do you find that the defendants have proven this special defense?</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">Yes_No JL</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">\u201cIf your answer is \u2018Yes\u2019 to the above question your verdict must be for the defendants and you need not answer any further questions. If your answer is 'No,\u2019 proceed to the next series of questions under C.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b264-5\"> Although we generally evaluate the sufficiency of the evidence claim first because, were the defendants to prevail on that claim, the plaintiffs would not be entitled to a new trial; see C. Tait, Connecticut Appellate Practice and Procedure (2d Ed. 1993) \u00a7 <em>7.18 </em>(a); we need not do so in this case. In light of the evidentiary framework for assessing a claim of alteration/ modification defense that we have set forth today, we conclude that the jury reached its verdict based on an improper instruction concerning the parties\u2019 respective burdens of proof. Consequently, although the standard governing <em>our </em>review of sufficiency of the evidence is to evaluate the evidence construing it in the light most favorable to sustaining the facts expressly and impliedly found by the jury; <em>State v. </em>Joyner, 225 Conn. 450, 455, 625 A.2d 791 (1993); we cannot presume the sufficiency of the evidence on which the jury based its verdict in light of the improper instruction. Accordingly, we need not reach the defendants\u2019 argument that there was insufficient evidence to support the conclusion that the tools reached the plaintiffs without substantial change in condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Furthermore, in light of our reversal of the judgment on the basis of the trial court\u2019s alteration/modification instruction, we also need not reach the defendants\u2019 claims with respect to the special interrogatories and accompanying jury instructions, as well as the subsequent instructions when the case was submitted to the jury for reconsideration after the initial verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b265-7\"> The defendants and the trial court both use the term \u201cstate-of-the-art defense.\u201d Although we conclude later in this opinion that this term is a misnomer and that the preferable term is \u201cstate-of-the-art evidence,\u201d we use state-of-the-art defense for the purpose of characterizing the trial court\u2019s instruction and the defendants\u2019 argument on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b266-6\"> The trial court\u2019s instruction with respect to state-of-the-art evidence provided: \u201cAlso, the defendants must prove certain affirmative defenses which they\u2019ve made. The first of these is what\u2019s called state of the art. Now, basically, state of the art is defined as the level of scientific and technological knowledge existing at the time the product in question was designed for manufacture. In designing or producing a product, a manufacturer cannot be held to standards which exceed the limit of scientific [advances] and technology that exist at the time of manufacture. A manufacturer cannot be charged with the duty to incorporate technology that was not available at the time that it manufactured its product. State-of-the-art evidence is based on technology that existed at the time the product was placed on the market rather than at the time of the injury or at the time of trial. <em>State of the art is a valid defense to claims based on failure to warn. In this regard, the state-of-the-art defense applies only to the [plaintiffs\u2019] claims of failure to warn, not to anything else; so the law does not impose an obligation on the defendant to warn users of unknown risks.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">\u201cIf you find the defendants\u2019 tools were manufactured in accordance with the state of the art, then the tools are not defective due to lack of warning and you must find for the defendants on that claim. On the other hand, if you find that they had knowledge of problems and failed to use that knowledge, then they may be held liable with respect to the claim of failure to warn.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b267-7\"> We note that, subsequent to our decision in <em>Tomer </em>v. <em>American Home Products Corp., </em>supra, 170 Conn. 681, the legislature recognized the applicability of state-of-the-art evidence to failure to warn claims. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-572q (b) (trier of fact may consider, among other factors, \u201cthe technological feasibility and cost of warnings and instructions\u201d). We further note that, although the legislature rejected language that would have created an absolute defense for a manufacturer\u2019s compliance with the state of the art; see 21 S. Proc., Pt. 7, 1978 Sess., pp. 2685, 2696; nothing in the act or in its legislative history discusses whether such evidence may be a factor for the trier of fact to consider in determining the adequacy of a product design. In the absence of any language in the act inconsistent with the admissibility of state-of-the-art evidence in design defect claims, we do not construe the act\u2019s silence to predude consideration of the relevance of such evidence. See <em>LaMontagne </em>v. <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>41 F.3d 846, 856 (2d Cir. 1994) (because act does not delineate elements of claims that it consolidates, common law provides basis for theories of recovery); cf. <em>Kyrtatas </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop, Inc., </em>205 Conn. 694, 699, 535 A.2d 357 (1988) (concluding that common-law doctrine of indemnification is inconsistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>with act\u2019s provisions concerning comparative responsibility, award of damages and contribution). Indeed, the legislature made it clear that, although the act was intended to abolish various common-law causes of action and to consolidate them into one statutory claim, it was not intended to abolish all common-law considerations. See 22 S. Proc., Pt. 14, 1979 Sess., p. 4639; see also <em>LaMontagne </em>v. <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>supra, 855-56.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b273-6\"> But see <em>Morton </em>v. <em>Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., </em>33 Cal.

We note that this court overruled that precedent in <em>Santopietro </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>239 Conn. 207, 220-21, 682 A.2d 106 (1996). Because these issues were raised during trial; see footnote 38 of this opinion; they are proper for review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b276-10\"> The plaintiffs also argue that the trial court improperly refused to issue a curative instruction when, during closing argument, defense counsel suggested that the plaintiffs had failed to produce an expert witness to testify that the tools were defective, even though the trial court had granted the defendants\u2019 motion in limine precluding the plaintiffs from offering expert opinion evidence on that issue. Because this issue is unlikely to arise on retrial, we decline to address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">Additionally, the plaintiffs argue that the trial court improperly allowed the defendants to present irrelevant and prejudicial evidence with respect to Electric Boat\u2019s safety practices. We agree with the defendants, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>that this issue has not been properly preserved for review. Accordingly, we need not address that claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b277-10\"> The defendants further claim that the plaintiffs: (1) failed to brief this issue adequately; and (2) failed to preserve the record by making an offer of proof.

Furthermore, because the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel informed the trial court as to the nature and purpose of the testimony, which is amply disclosed in the record, we con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>clude that an offer of proof was unnecessary. <em>Hartmann </em>v. <em>Black &amp; Decker Mfg.

I have the stipulation. This says that the plaintii'f[s] shall be permitted to elicit testimony from treating physicians and medical experts that they have examined or treated other individuals with symptoms similar to Joseph Gladu\u2019s, some of whom work or have worked at the Electric Boat facility. Now, your question was what, again?</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">\u201c[Plaintiffs\u2019 Counsel]: I asked him simply how many such individuals. I wasn\u2019t asking where those individuals came from.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Judge, I thought we had a very specific understanding of that. There was a colloquy with the court on the record about that that we were not getting into numbers, we were not getting into percentages, and we were not getting into prevalences. Your Honor said there\u2019s a very well drafted understanding here and that that\u2019s what they should stick to. Now, he gives \u2014 [plaintiffs\u2019 counsel] asked a question where he clearly was going beyond the parameters of our agreement and this is a second effort to go beyond the parameters of the understanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">\u201cThe Court.: Would you repeat the question again.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Why don\u2019t we have it read back.

The focus of his work has been Electric Boat, so the inference of this question is that he has seen these people primarily from Electric Boat.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">\u201cThe Court: Would you answer the question, doctor.

He can suggest that he has treated other people. Once you start talking about 300 or 600 or that type of thing then we get into numbers. Clearly his primary work has been [at] Electric Boat. It doesn\u2019t take a jury a whole lot to understand that if he\u2019s treated 600 people, all of them or most of them' \u2014 I think the spirit of what we\u2019re trying to do and I think \u2014 thought we had an agreement and it is being violated, quite frankly. I think that it\u2019s clear by that kind of a question \u2014 something that\u2019s clear by that kind of a question that that\u2019s going to bring a percentage answer or number and is in violation of that stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">\u201c[Plaintiffs\u2019 Counsel]: The stipulation\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">\u201cThe Court: One at a time. You can tell him what to say but only one on direct.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: The difficulty this raises, judge, is then we have to explore all of these other cases if he\u2019s going to testify that he has all of this experience. The doctor has been clearly established and [plaintiffs\u2019 counsel] went through great length that he\u2019s had a lot of experience with a lot of people, he\u2019s established that the doctor is qualified to [render] opinions about the plaintiffs in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">\u201cIf we get into 600 people, we have to get into how do those people compare with these people, we get into all of those collateral matters. They are prejudicial to the defendants in this case inasmuch as we are only defending these five cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-12\">\u201cThe Court: Well, I\u2019m afraid the agreement doesn\u2019t specifically address the question of how many. It said he can testily he treated other individuals with symptoms similar to the plaintiffs, some of whom worked at Electric Boat. They didn\u2019t say whether he can or can\u2019t say how many.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-13\">\u201c[Plaintiffs\u2019 Counsel]: Well, judge, it says what it says.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-14\">\u201cThe Court: I know it doesn\u2019t answer \u2014 it doesn\u2019t address the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-15\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: The plaintiffs are limited to the industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-16\">\u201cThe Court: I\u2019m saying the agreement doesn\u2019t address the question of how many people. It says he can say \u2014 it doesn\u2019t say he can\u2019t say how many.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-17\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Judge, if we were going to permit them to elicit that type of testimony, then we would not have drafted the stipulation in this fashion. That\u2019s the sole purpose of this.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-18\">\u201cThe Court: Well, all right. Let me look. Paragraph two doesn\u2019t really address the question. However, maybe paragraph one will be of help; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>says that the plaintiff shall not make any reference to the fact that there are 228 other plaintiffs with lawsuits. All right. So, maybe paragraph one would suggest, that no numbers\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">\u2018\u25a0[Plaintiffs\u2019 Counsel]: That\u2019s a very specific one. That related specifically to the idea we could not put on evidence relating to other claims, which of course would open up an entirely different issue which is a collateral issue whether or not those cases were exactly the same as the cases that were on trial today.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">\u201cThat was my understanding that we would be entitled to ask the doctor general questions relating to his background including studies he performed in the shipyard. Your Honor read the stipulation to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">\u201cThe Court.: Paragraph two doesn\u2019t mention numbers. They examined \u2014 If I asked if he had seen other individuals, that would not be objectionable. If I asked how many\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: That\u2019s the basis of our\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b281-12\">\u201c[Plaintiffs\u2019 Counsel]: Provided I don\u2019t ask what percentage were in the shipyard.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-13\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: That puts the focus of his work in Groton, Connecticut since 1986, which has been the Groton Electric. Boat facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-14\">\u201cThe Court: Well, I think paragraph one answers the question which I think paragraph two maybe left a little ambiguous, so I think I would have to rule you can't ask him about any numbers and ask him did he treat other people with similar symptoms some of whom work or who have worked at Electric Boat, but not get into any numbers at. all. That\u2019s probably the spirit of this stipulation. You can never get anything perfect apparently.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b285-7\"> With respect to the admissibility of the videotapes, the following colloquy between counsel and the trial court took place:</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">\u201cThe Court: Now, and what is your claim? I\u2019ve read your brief. Basically, you seem to say first that the manufacturing quality and so on basically is not the issue. That you don\u2019t quarrel that they made a good tool. The quarrel is that they didn\u2019t put dampening devices on for vibration. Is that basically what you\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">\u201c[Plaintiffs\u2019 Counsel]: That is precisely what we are claiming, Your Honor. We don\u2019t dispute that these are well made tools, built to most tolerances. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>And this particular video does not have an audio portion. My understanding is that Mr. Hurst would supply a narration, but, I believe by having viewed the video that it shows the factory and the engineering and the computer aided design that goes into the design of the tools. And I don\u2019t believe that any of those are issues that are in dispute in the case. I think they just add a number of collateral issues and add nothing of probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\u201cThe Court: \u2014 Well, as I understand it and again from cases that you have cited and other cases that that is not an issue in a product liability case, that it was a well made product. The question is was it unreasonably dangerous or defective in design or unreasonably dangerous to the user are the only issues. But, I think I should hear from [defense counsel].</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, if I might, please, the allegations in this complaint and the testimony that we heard \u2014 first of all, if you can recall there was testimony on the Stanley [Works] tools and there was testimony while [Alexander] was on the stand concerning the cut away versions of those tools and how difficult it would be from a feasibility perspective to supply the kind of devices that are being talked about by [Alexander] and to some extent by [Suggs] with respect to the wraps and the sleeves over the top of the tool. So, I would suggest to the court, first of all, that the movie is nothing more than a walk through the plant to show the manufacturing sections, the engineering sections, and that type of thing. What I would make a claim for, Your Honor, is first of all, we intend to put on evidence that the devices suggested by these gentlemen are not feasible. That in a manufacturing and the engineering process of these tools that those kinds of devices are not feasible and that they are impractical in the work place. The manufacturing and the design of the tool, the testimony that will be elicited on that is necessary on that feasibility issue. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">\u201c [Plaintiffs\u2019 Counsel]: Thank you. Your Honor, all of the discussions regarding tools other than grinders all related to the vibration hazard. And that is the sense in which they are relevant, not in terms of any other safety feature regarding those tools.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">\u201cWith regard to the attitude of the companies, we are not raising any issue or making any claim regarding the attitude or conduct of these companies with regard to any safety hazard other than the vibration hazard. And what they may or may not have done with regard to other features of the tools are simply not relevant and are going to represent a waste of the court\u2019s time and introduce numerable \u2014 numerous collateral issues, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">\u201cWith regard to the video, to return to it a minute. I viewed the video and I heard [defense counsel's] comments. There is nothing in that video that relates to the dampening, isolation or weighted sleeve vibration reduction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>techniques which the plaintiffs\u2019 engineers have testified about. So, I still would argue, Your Honor, that the video is irrelevant to any of the issues that have been raised in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">\u201cThe Court: Well, I\u2019m going to allow it. I think when you get into the wilful, wanton, the claims of intentional misrepresentation, fraudulent concealment, and the wilful, wanton, malicious manner, et cetera, it opens up the door to almost anything by way of defense. And, of course, this is as [defense counsel] indicated preliminary for other testimony just to show the . . . manufacturing process. I think that in this case, it\u2019s \u2014 this is a little different than the ordinary case, I think, of a product liability because of these specific allegations made both in the first count and the second and third counts. So, I\u2019m going to allow it.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b290-7\">BERDON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ATd\">concurring. I write separately with respect to part I of the court\u2019s opinion regarding the test for determining whether a manufacturer is liable for a design defect. I would not depart from our longstanding rule that the <em>consumer expectation test </em>must be employed \u2014 that is, the product \u201cmust be dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer who purchases it, with the ordinary knowledge common to the community as to its characteristics.\u201d 2 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 402A, comment (i) (1965). Although the court today agrees that this test is to be applied to cases such as the present case, it adopts, by way of dicta, another test for \u201ccomplex product designs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">I am concerned about the court adopting a <em>risk-utility </em>test<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for complex product designs \u2014 that is, a test where the trier of fact considers \u201cthe product\u2019s risks and utility and then inquires whether a reasonable consumer would consider the product unreasonably dangerous.\u201d Adopting such a test in a factual vacuum without the predicate facts to address its full implications can lead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>us down a dangerous path.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> More importantly, adopting such a risk-utility test for \u201ccomplex product designs\u201d sounds dangerously close to requiring proof of the existence of \u201ca reasonable alternative design,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a standard of proof that the court properly rejects today.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Finally, because the court insists on addressing this issue that is not before us, I would at least sort out the burden of proof for the risk-utility test by adopting \u201ca presumption that danger outweighs utility if the product fails under circumstances when the ordinary purchaser or user would not have so expected.\u201d W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, Torts (5th Ed. 1984) \u00a7 99, p. 702. Adoption of this presumption would lessen the concern that the risk-utility test undermines one of the reasons that strict tort liability was adopted \u2014 \u201cthe difficulty of discovering evidence necessary to show that danger outweighs benefits.\u201d Id.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b290-9\"> This test is sometimes referred to as the \u201cdanger-utility test.\u201d See W.
