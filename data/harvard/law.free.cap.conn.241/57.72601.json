Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1993); and (2) whether Connecticut should abandon its traditional per se rule that polygraph evidence is inadmissible at trial. The defendant, Christian E. Porter, appeals from the judgment of the Appellate Court affirming his conviction for arson in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-111 (a) (4). The defendant claims that: (1) the Appellate Court incorrectly concluded that the trial court properly denied his request for an evidentiary hearing regarding the admissibility of polygraph evidence; and (2) in light of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>supra, 579, this court should reconsider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>its test for determining the admissibility of scientific evidence, which is currently based on <em>Frye </em>v. <em>United States, </em>293 F. 1013 (D.C. Cir. 1923), and should conclude that polygraph evidence is admissible under the <em>Daubert </em>test. We conclude that <em>Daubert </em>provides the proper threshold standard for the admissibility of scientific evidence in Connecticut. We also conclude, however, on the basis of our own independent examination of the extensive literature and case law regarding polygraph evidence, that polygraph evidence should remain per se inadmissible in Connecticut trials, and consequently that an evidentiary hearing was not necessary to evaluate the reliability of such evidence. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The following facts and procedural history are undisputed. The defendant\u2019s home in Norwich was destroyed by a fire on July 20, 1992. The defendant was subsequently charged with two counts of arson in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-111 (a) (3) and (4).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Before trial, the defendant retained Leighton Hammond, a polygrapher, to conduct a polygraph examination to determine whether the defendant was telling the truth when he claimed that he had no guilty knowledge of, and had not participated in, the burning of his home. The defendant did not give the state advance notification of the examination. The pertinent test questions asked of the defendant were: (1) \u201cDid you set fire to your home?\u201d; (2) \u201cDid you tell even one lie, in your statement to the Norwich Police?\u201d; and (3) \u201cDo you know for sure, if any person deliberately set fire to your <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>home?\u201d In the opinion of Hammond, the defendant was telling the truth when he answered \u201cno\u201d to each of these questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The defendant then moved that the trial court admit the results of the polygraph examination. After a hearing, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion, stating that it was not the place of a trial court to reconsider Connecticut\u2019s traditional per se ban on the admissibility of polygraph evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Following a jury trial, at which the defendant did not testify, he was convicted of arson in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-111 (a) (4).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant appealed from the judgment of conviction to the Appellate Court claiming, inter alia, that the trial court improperly had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>refused to admit the favorable results of his polygraph examination and further improperly had refused to allow him to make an evidentiary offer of proof on the polygraph results. <em>State </em>v. Porter, 39 Conn. App. 800, 801, 668 A.2d 725 (1995). The Appellate Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment, concluding that \u201c[t]he trial court, like this court, is bound by the Connecticut precedent which bars the admission of polygraph results. . . . Because an evidentiary hearing would have been a nugatory undertaking, the trial court was not required to grant the defendant\u2019s motion for an evidentiary offer of proof.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 803. This certified appeal followed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The <em>Daubert </em>Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">The defendant argues that Connecticut should adopt the federal test for the admissibility of scientific evidence, as set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, </em>Inc., supra, 509 U.S. 579.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We agree that, when read and applied correctly, <em>Daubert </em>provides the proper approach to the threshold admissibility of scientific evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">We begin with a general examination of the <em>Frye </em>and <em>Daubert </em>standards for the admission of scientific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>evidence. The standard enunciated in <em>Frye </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 293 F. 1013, was predominant in both state and federal courts for the seventy years from its formulation until the decision in <em>Daubert </em>in 1993. <em>Frye </em>itself was a lie detector case; indeed, it was the first appellate case in the United States to address the admissibility of lie detector examination results. In <em>Frye, </em>the defendant appealed from his murder conviction on the grounds that the trial court had improperly disallowed expert testimony that he had passed a \u201csystolic blood pressure deception test,\u201d the precursor of the modem polygraph examination.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See J. McCall, \u201cMisconceptions and Reevaluation \u2014 Polygraph Admissibility After <em>Rock </em>and <em>Daubert,\u201d </em>1996 U. Ill. L. Rev. 363, 367 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">In considering the defendant\u2019s claim in <em>Frye, </em>the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia first determined that \u201cgeneral acceptance\u201d in the scientific community was a precondition to the admissibility of any scientific evidence. <em>Frye </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 293 F. 1014. \u201cJust when a scientific principle or discovery crosses the line between the experimental and demonstrable stages is difficult to define. Somewhere in this twilight zone the evidential force of the principle must be recognized, and while courts will go a long way in admitting expert testimony deduced from a well-recognized scientific principle or discovery, the thing from which the deduction is made must be sufficiently established to have gained general acceptance in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>particular field in which it belongs.\u201d Id. The court affirmed the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the systolic blood pressure evidence because the blood pressure device had \u201cnot yet gained such standing and scientific recognition among physiological and psychological authorities as would justify the courts in admitting expert testimony deduced from the discovery, development, and experiments thus far made.\u201d Id. Subsequently, <em>Frye </em>and its \u201cgeneral acceptance\u201d standard were expressly adopted by a number of state and federal courts. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>526 F.2d 161 (8th Cir. 1975); <em>Pulakis </em>v. <em>State, </em>476 P.2d 474 (Alaska 1970); see generally P. Giannelli, \u201cThe Admissibility of Novel Scientific Evidence: <em>Frye </em>v. <em>United States, </em>a Half-Century Later,\u201d 80 Colum. L. Rev. 1197, 1205 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">In 1993, however, the federal standard for the admissibility of scientific evidence changed as a result of the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>supra, 509 U.S. 579. In <em>Daubert, </em>the court held that rule 702<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which was enacted in 1975, had superseded the <em>Frye </em>test. Id., 587. The court concluded that \u201c[njothing in the text of [rule 702] establishes \u2018general acceptance\u2019 as an absolute prerequisite to admissibility. . . . That austere standard, absent from, and incompatible with, the Federal Rules of Evidence, should not be applied in federal trials.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 588-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Instead, a federal trial court has a responsibility to determine, pursuant to rule 702, whether the proffered evidence will \u201cassist the trier of fact.\u201d Id., 589. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>entails a two part inquiry: \u201cwhether the reasoning or methodology underlying the [scientific theory or technique in question] is scientifically valid and . . . whether that reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue.\u201d Id., 592-93. In other words, before it may be admitted, the trial judge must find that the proffered scientific evidence is both reliable and relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">More specifically, the first requirement for scientific evidence to be admissible under rule 702 is that the subject of the testimony must be scientifically valid, meaning that it is scientific knowledge rooted \u201cin the methods and procedures of science\u201d; id., 590; and is \u201cmore than subjective belief or unsupported speculation.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Id. This requirement \u201cestablishes a standard of evidentiary reliability\u201d; id.; as, \u201c[i]n a case involving scientific evidence, <em>evidentiary reliability </em>will be based upon <em>scientific validity.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.) Id., 590-91 n.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">The court listed four nonexclusive factors for federal judges to consider in determining whether a particular theory or technique is based on scientific knowledge: (1) whether it can be, and has been, tested; (2) whether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer review and publication; (3) the known or potential rate of error, including the existence and maintenance of standards controlling the technique\u2019s operation; and (4) whether the technique is, in fact, generally accepted in the relevant scientific community. Id., 593-94. The court emphasized, however, that the inquiry is \u201ca flexible one. Its overarching subject is the scientific validity \u2014 and thus the evidentiary relevance and reliability \u2014 of the principles that underlie a proposed submission.\u201d Id., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>594-95. Indeed, the court explicitly noted that other factors \u201cmay well have merit . . . [t]o the extent that they focus on the reliability of evidence as ensured by the scientific validity of its underlying principles . . . .\u201d Id., 594-95 n.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The second condition that scientific evidence must satisfy in order to be admissible under rule 702 is that it must \u201cfit\u201d the case in which it is presented. Id., 591. In other words, proposed scientific testimony must be demonstrably relevant to the facts of the particular case in which it is offered, and not simply be valid in the abstract. \u201cThe study of the phases of the moon, for example, may provide valid scientific \u2018knowledge\u2019 about whether a certain night was dark, and if darkness is a fact in issue, the knowledge will assist the trier of fact. However (absent creditable grounds supporting such a link), evidence that the moon was full on a certain night will not assist the trier of fact in determining whether an individual was unusually likely to have behaved irrationally on that night.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Finally, the court emphasized that even if a scientific theory or technique satisfied both of the previous criteria and thus would be admissible under a rule 702 analysis, it can still be excluded for failure to satisfy some other federal rule of evidence. Id., 595. Most important, it can still be excluded for failure to satisfy rule 403, which allows for the exclusion of relevant evidence \u201c \u2018if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the juiy . . . ,\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">Because <em>Daubert </em>was premised on an interpretation of a federal rule of evidence, its rejection of <em>Frye </em>is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>binding authority on state courts. Nonetheless, subsequent to the <em>Daubert </em>decision, several states that had theretofore followed <em>Frye </em>reconsidered the issue and adopted the <em>Daubert </em>standard. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Alberico, </em>116 N.M. 156, 861 P.2d 192, 201-203 (1993) (\u201cThe <em>Frye </em>test. . . has been a part of New Mexico evidence law since 1952 .... [T]he critical issue is whether the <em>Frye </em>test is a legitimate means for determining what is and what is not scientific knowledge. We hold that it is not and that the <em>Frye </em>test should be rejected as an independent controlling standard of admissibility. . . . Several factors could be considered by a trial court in assessing the validity of a particular scientific technique to determine if it is scientific knowledge .... See <em>Daubert </em>[v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>supra, 509 U.S. 593-95] . . . .\u201d [Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">We now address the question of the proper standard for the threshold admissibility of scientific evidence in this state. We begin by noting that, at present, Connecticut nominally follows the <em>Frye </em>rule.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>v. <em>Sivri, </em>231 Conn. 115, 153-54, 646 A.2d 169 (1994) (restriction fragment length polymorphism procedure as part of DNA analysis \u201cgenerally accepted in the scientific community\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>John, </em>210 Conn. 652, 678, 557 A.2d 93, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 824, 110 S. Ct. 84, 107 L. Ed. 2d 50 (1989) (use of photographs by forensic entomologist to determine age of fly larvae found on body satisfied Frye); <em>State </em>v. <em>McClary, </em>207 Conn. 233, 245-48, 541 A.2d 96 (1988) (testimony on \u201cshaken baby syndrome\u201d admissible under <em>Frye); State </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>38 Conn. App. 371, 409, 662 A.2d 767, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 905, 665 A.2d 905 (1995) (\u201cConnecticut courts utilize the <em>Frye </em>standard in appraising the admissibility of evidence derived from innovative scientific techniques\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">A closer examination of our precedent, however, reveals that on many occasions we have declined to apply <em>Frye </em>when considering expert scientific testimony. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Hasan, </em>205 Conn. 485, 494, 534 A.2d 877 (1987) (admissibility of expert testimony by podiatrist that sneakers that left prints at crime scene belonged to defendant \u201cdid not depend on general acceptance of his theories in the scientific community\u201d). Indeed, we have specifically observed that \u201c[i]f a duly qualified expert testifies that in his opinion [a scientific] test or device is reliable, <em>but his opinion is not shared by the scientific community, </em>either because it is novel and experimental or because they disagree with its bases, <em>the court still has discretion to admit the evidence because competent proof is not rendered inadmissible merely by the fad that others take issue with it.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>198 Conn. 220, 227, 502 A.2d 400 (1985) (forensic odontologist\u2019s identification of person by bite mark on apple admissible).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">It is clear that we have been moving toward a validity standard for a number of years. We believe that it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>time to complete that process, and that \u201cthe <em>Daubert </em>[reliability] approach will provide structure and guidance to what has until now been a potentially confusing and sparsely defined area of legal analysis in our state jurisprudence.\u201d <em>Taylor v. State, </em>889 P.2d 319, 329 (Okla. Crim. App. 1995).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that the <em>Daubert </em>approach should govern the admissibility of scientific evidence in Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">We first discuss why a special standard for the admissibility of scientific evidence is required at all. Implicit in both <em>Frye </em>and <em>Daubert </em>is the notion that a trial judge should, by one method or another, serve as a \u201cgatekeeper\u201d and make a preliminary assessment of the validity of scientific testimony before allowing the fact finder even to consider it. A number of commentators, however, have suggested that the validity of proffered scientific evidence should go solely to its <em>weight, </em>not to its admissibility, and thus the fact finder should have a chance to consider all scientific evidence that is submitted. For example, the latest edition of Charles McCormick\u2019s treatise on evidence provides that in making <em>admissibility </em>determinations, \u201cthe traditional standards of relevancy and the need for expertise \u2014 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>nothing more\u2014should govern.\u201d 1 C. McCormick, Evidence (4th Ed. 1992) \u00a7 203, p. 874.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">Under this view, rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence should not be interpreted as requiring judges independently to assess the validity of proffered scientific evidence, or to make admissibility decisions therefrom. Instead, \u201ctrial courts [should only] insure that expert witnesses are trustworthy \u2014 capable of explaining their reasoning in a manner that permits the factfinder to assess the testimony effectively \u2014 and so knowledgeable in their subject area that the inferences they draw are helpful. Thus, a court faced with scientific proof offers should not do what the jury does \u2014 that is, decide whether the evidence can be believed and how much of it should be believed. Instead, the court should consider whether the factfinder has enough information at its disposal to decide these issues for itself.\u201d R. Dreyfuss, \u201cIs Science a Special Case? The Admissibility of Scientific Evidence After <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow\u201d </em>73 Tex. L. Rev. 1779, 1801 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">We disagree with the preceding analyses and conclude that the validity of the methodologies underlying proffered scientific evidence should be considered in determining the admissibility of such evidence, as well as in determining its weight. Accordingly, we also conclude that it is proper for a trial judge to serve a gatekeeper function.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">a</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">In this regard, we first note the concern expressed by many authorities that juries will be overwhelmed by complex scientific evidence and will give such evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>more weight than it deserves.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We acknowledge, however, that other commentators have specifically asserted that juries will <em>not </em>be overly impressed by such evidence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> At present, empirical data regarding the impact of scientific testimony on juries is almost entirely lacking. As a consequence, whether jurors will unduly credit scientific evidence is quite uncertain.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>Indeed, direct empirical evidence regarding the impact of scientific evidence on judges is also lacking.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Although the effect of scientific evidence with regard to both judges and juries is uncertain, we note that, purely as a procedural matter, a judge is in a much better position than a juror to assess accurately the fundamental validity of such evidence. This is due to the different roles each serves at trial and the concomitant powers each has. \u201c[T]he process of judicial decisionmaking, including the methods by which information is received and decisions are reviewed, is better suited than is the rather awkward process of juror decisionmaking for evaluation of evidence that is beyond at least the usual ken of laypeople, judges, and jurors alike.\u201d R. Friedman, \u201cThe Death and Transfiguration of <em>Frye\u201d </em>34 Jurimetrics J. 133, 144 (1994); see also B. Black, F. Ayala <em>&amp; </em>C. Saffran-Brinks, \u201cScience and the Law in the Wake of <em>Daubert: </em>A New Search for Scientific Knowledge,\u201d 72 Tex. L. Rev. 715, 787 (1994) (\u201cwe agree with Daubert's preference for preliminary judicial screening only because judges are in a better position than juries to acquire and consider the kind of information that bears on the resolution of [scientific evidence] disputes\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">For example, juries mainly have to rely on in-court testimony for their understanding of scientific evidence; that is, they are largely dependent upon the presentations of the parties and their experts. There is evidence, however, that expert presentations may often be mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>leading; J. Sanders, \u201cFrom Science to Evidence: The Testimony on Causation in the Bendectin Cases,\u201d 46 Stan. L. Rev. 1, 3 (1993); and, at the same time, that cross-examination of experts may often be difficult and ineffective in bringing out flaws in the expert\u2019s reasoning. B. Black, F. Ayala &amp; C. Saffran-Brinks, supra, 72 Tex. L. Rev. 789; S. Gross, \u201cExpert Evidence,\u201d 1991 Wis. L. Rev. 1113, 1172 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Judges, on the other hand, have the benefit of reviewing briefs and other documents. B. Black, F. Ayala &amp; C. Saffran-Brinks, supra, 72 Tex. L. Rev. 788. Indeed, a Connecticut trial judge has the power to request supplemental briefing on any issue that needs clarification, including issues surrounding proffered scientific evidence. Furthermore, Practice Book \u00a7 881 explicitly authorizes a judge presiding over a criminal case to appoint an independent expert when necessary.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Such an appointment could certainly be made to assist the judge in evaluating proposed scientific testimony. Cf. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 889 P.2d 342 (Lumpkin, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Moreover, \u201c[a]n important element in adjudication ... is the development of judicial expertise through repeated exposure to and familiarity with similar scientific issues.\u201d J. Kesan, \u201cAn Autopsy of Scientific Evidence in a <em>Post-Daubert </em>World,\u201d 84 Geo. L.J. 1985, 2038 (1996). Judges, on the one hand, are likely to gain familiarity with various common procedures, and with scientific techniques in general, by virtue of presiding over multiple cases involving such issues. \u201cOver time, most judges will probably develop at least some facility for understanding science beyond the typical juror\u2019s level of understanding.\u201d B. Black, F. Ayala &amp; C. Saffran-Brinks, supra, 72 Tex. L. Rev. 788. On the other hand, \u201c[t]aking the time required to educate jurors and to present them with similarly detailed information could easily overwhelm the other issues in a case.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Given this background, we conclude that a gatekeeping role for trial judges in relation to scientific evidence is appropriate. Although the extent to which juries give scientific evidence undue deference is uncertain, the potential risk can be greatly reduced simply by allowing the judge, as the participant in the judicial process with both the greater access and ability to gather relevant information, to exclude wholly invalid scientific testimony altogether. Moreover, a trial judge who does admit scientific evidence will be in a better position, by virtue of the knowledge gained during the preliminary assessment, to conduct the trial and instruct the jury in such a way as to minimize the risk that jurors will give that evidence undue deference.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>b</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">In addition, we believe it is proper for trial judges to serve as gatekeepers for scientific evidence because a relevance standard of admissibility inherently involves an assessment of the validity of the proffered evidence. More specifically, if scientific evidence has no grounding in scientific fact, but instead is based on conjecture and speculation, it cannot in any meaningful way be relevant to resolving a disputed issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">McCormick himself, although a proponent of the relevance standard for scientific evidence, initially recognized this fact. In the first edition of his treatise on evidence, McCormick rejected the <em>Frye </em>test in favor of a relevancy standard, in much the same maimer as that test is rejected in the fourth edition of his treatise. See C. McCormick, Evidence (1954) \u00a7 170, pp. 363-64. He went on to conclude, however, that such a standard would entail \u201cdeflating] the requirement [of general acceptance] to the normal standard which simply demands that the theory or device be <em>accepted by a substantial body of scientific opinion </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., \u00a7 174, pp. 371-72. McCormick thus implicitly acknowledged that some indication of scientific validity \u2014 accomplished here by a showing of \u201csubstantial\u201d acceptance \u2014 is necessaiy for scientific evidence even to be relevant. It is true that the previous passage was removed from subsequent editions of McCormick\u2019s treatise. See, e.g., C. McCormick, Evidence (2d Ed. 1972) \u00a7 207, pp. 506-507. Nonetheless, we believe that McCormick\u2019s original understanding was correct. See also P. Giannelli, supra, 80 Colum. L. Rev. 1233-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Having concluded that Connecticut judges should exercise a gatekeeper function with regard to scientific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>evidence, we now briefly explain our conclusion that the <em>Frye </em>\u201cgeneral acceptance\u201d standard is not adequate for this role. We note that even before the decision in <em>Daubert, </em>the <em>Frye </em>rule was widely criticized.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> \u201c[S]cholars have criticized the <em>Frye </em>approach for being unduly conservative and for abandoning the fundamental evidentiary [principle] of . . . probity.\u201d \u201cDevelopments in the Law \u2014 Confronting the New Challenges of Scientific Evidence\u201d (\u201cDevelopments in the Law\u201d), 108 Harv. L. Rev. 1481, 1486 (1995). These critics observe that scientific pioneers and dissenters are occasionally right. \u201c \u2018When photography was first introduced, it was seriously questioned whether pictures thus created could properly be introduced into evidence, but this method of proof, as well as by means of x-rays and the microscope, is now admitted without question.\u2019 <em>[People </em>v. <em>Jennings, </em>252 Ill. 534, 548, 96 N.E. 1077 (1911)]. As with most scientific phenomena, the passage of time can serve ... to demonstrate the reliability and acceptance of a once speculative and unproved premise.\u201d <em>State v. Bullard, </em>312 N.C. 129, 146, 322 S.E.2d 370 (1984). Excluding scientific views simply because they are not \u201cgenerally accepted,\u201d without <em>any </em>further consideration of their validity, thus contravenes \u201cthe liberal nature ... of modem evidentiary law.\u201d R. Friedman, supra, 34 Jurimetrics J. 133-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">We are persuaded by these criticisms of the <em>Frye </em>test. We conclude that an admissibility test for scientific evidence premised <em>solely </em>on its \u201cgeneral acceptance\u201d is conceptually flawed and therefore must be rejected. In doing so, we follow in the footsteps of the many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>jurisdictions that, both before<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and after<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the <em>Daubert </em>decision, have chosen to reject the <em>Frye </em>standard as an absolute prerequisite to the admissibility of scientific evidence.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Pennington, </em>327 N.C. 89, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>98, 393 S.E.2d 847 (1990) (admissibility of scientific evidence should be based on \u201cthe reliability of the scientific method rather than its popularity within a scientific community\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">We now turn to our reasons for concluding that the <em>Daubert </em>approach to the admissibility of scientific evidence is the proper approach for judges to follow in performing their gatekeeper role. In doing so, we are mindful of the fact that almost every other jurisdiction that has rejected <em>Frye </em>has also, either explicitly or effectively, adopted the <em>Daubert </em>multifactor \u201cvalidity\u201d approach to admissibility.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We agree with, and join in, this movement.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">Our reasons for adopting <em>Daubert </em>are based upon our understanding of that case. By its own terms, the opinion of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>supra, 509 U.S. 579, sets forth a conceptual <em>approach </em>to the admissibility of scientific evidence, and not a functional <em>test </em>therefor. As discussed previously, the essential holding of the Supreme Court is the general principle that, as a threshold matter, and subject still to the rules of evidence generally, scientific evidence should be admitted in court only upon some showing of its scientific validity. Id., 592-93; see generally part I A of this opinion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Although the court provides \u201cgeneral observations\u201d as to some factors that might be relevant to this determination, it explicitly states that \u201c[m]any factors will bear on the inquiry, <em>and we do not presume to set out a definitive checklist or test.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>supra, 593. <em>\u201cDaubert </em>does not purport to answer all questions or to resolve all problems associated with scientific testimony.\u201d L. Loevinger, \u201cScience as Evidence,\u201d 35 Jurimetrics J. 153, 179 (1995); see also \u201cDevelopments in the Law,\u201d supra, 108 Harv. L. Rev. 1513 <em>(Daubert </em>\u201coffer[s] little practical guidance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Critics of <em>Daubert </em>emphasize this indefiniteness. Chief Justice Rehnquist, in his concurring and dissenting opinion, for example, although agreeing that \u201cRule 702 confides to the judge some gatekeeping responsibility\u201d; <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>supra, 509 U.S. 600; commented that \u201c[questions arise simply from reading [the \u2018general observations\u2019] part of the Court\u2019s opinion, and countless more questions will surely arise when hundreds of district judges try to apply its teaching to particular offers of expert testimony.\u201d Id.; see also R. Dreyfuss, supra, 73 Tex. L. Rev. 1780 (Daubert's \u201creach is indeterminate, and the few specific guidelines announced in the opinion do not begin to cover the issues that judges who follow it must consider\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">We view Daubert's indefiniteness not as a flaw, but as a necessity. The term \u201cscientific evidence\u201d covers a large variety of subjects. The Federal Judicial Center, for example, included in its Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence essays on the broad topics of epidemiology, toxicology, survey research, DNA evidence, multiple regression, and estimation of economic losses in damages awards. See Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence, J. Moore, Federal Practice (1995). In addition to those subjects, courts have also treated as scientific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>evidence testimony on subjects ranging from the causation of a plaintiffs cataracts; <em>O\u2019Conner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth Edison Co., </em>13 F.3d 1090 (7th Cir. 1994); to an analysis of bloodstain patterns at a crime scene; <em>State </em>v. <em>Goode, </em>341 N.C. 513, 461 S.E.2d 631 (1995); to, of course, polygraph evidence; <em>State </em>v. <em>Beard, </em>194 W. Va. 740, 461 S.E.2d 486 (1995); and beyond.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that it is impossible to formulate a specific, clearly defined test that provides judges with a precise, complete list of factors to consider in evaluating the entire class of scientific evidence. No purely mechanical test based on a finite number of set considerations can, in and of itself, truly guide judges with regard to the admissibility of all of the varied and eclectic types of scientific evidence. Indeed, \u201c[e]ach factor may shed some light on the scientific merits of the evidence, but none illuminates much of the total picture. Without a conceptual framework, using [mechanical] multiple-factor tests to evaluate science is like trying to light up a ball park with a few misaimed spotlights.\u201d B. Black, F. Ayala &amp; C. Saffran-Brinks, supra, 72 Tex. L. Rev. 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">It is therefore no surprise that courts that do apply either <em>Frye </em>or <em>Daubert </em>in a purely mechanical manner \u2014 simply looking at whether certain, specified factors are met \u2014 do not reach consistent results across jurisdictions regarding the admissibility of particular types of scientific evidence. By reading the individual factors narrowly or broadly, courts can skew the analysis toward the end they desire.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> As a result, \u201ccourts purporting to apply the same . . . standard to essen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>tially the same problem frequently reach conflicting conclusions.\u201d \u201cDevelopments in the Law,\u201d supra, 108 Harv. L. Rev. 1494. Thus, for example, courts ostensibly applying <em>Frye </em>have both admitted and excluded voice-print evidence,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> as have courts ostensibly applying multifactor validity checklists. See generally B. Black, F. Ayala &amp; C. Saffran-Brinks, supra, 72 Tex. L. Rev. 735-39; \u201cDevelopments in the Law,\u201d supra, 1494-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Indeed, because a generic, mechanical standard is often inapposite to an understanding of the validity of a particular type of scientific evidence, such a specific standard frequently deflates into no standard at all. This is because \u201c[s]uperficially clear doctrinal standards that are in fact indeterminate nearly to the point of uselessness serve only to obstruct the rules that govern the system.\u201d \u201cDevelopments in the Law,\u201d supra, 108 Harv. L. Rev. 1497. That is, mechanical factor tests emphasize specific considerations that are often irrelevant or unduly narrow while simultaneously obscuring the underlying principles upon which a court <em>should </em>be focusing. As a result, such tests have \u201clittle analytical value [and] serve primarily as labels to justify a court\u2019s instinctive reaction.\u201d B. Black, F. Ayala &amp; C. Saffran-Brinks, supra, 72 Tex. L. Rev. 735. Thus, the reality under most mechanical tests for the admissibility of scientific evidence is that, beneath the illusion of a rigid standard, the court in fact has essentially unfettered discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">We conclude that a test embodying a general, overarching approach to the threshold admissibility of scientific evidence is required. Although such a standard is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>more vague on its surface, it will in fact discourage untrammeled discretion by giving trial courts a workable principle to follow. Moreover, we believe that Dauberts focus on scientific validity properly directs trial judges to the core issue that they should address as gatekeepers of scientific evidence. For, as explained previously, scientific evidence is likely neither relevant nor helpful to the fact finder if it does not meet some minimum standard of validity.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> See generally part I B 1 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">We now examine, pursuant to our conception of the <em>Daubert </em>approach, the mechanics and scope of <em>a, Daubert </em>assessment. Indeed, our reasons for adopting the <em>Daubert </em>approach at all are intertwined with, and dependent upon, our conception of how that approach should operate.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">We begin by noting the distinction under the <em>Daubert </em>approach between the methodologies underlying an expert\u2019s scientific testimony and the expert opinion itself. As the court in <em>Daubert </em>noted, the focus of a validity assessment \u201cmust be solely on principles and methodology, not on the conclusions that they generate.\u201d <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>supra, 509 U.S. 595. So long as the methodology underlying a scientific opinion has the requisite validity, the testimony derived from that methodology meets the <em>Daubert </em>threshold for admissibility, even if the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>disagrees with the ultimate opinion arising from that methodology, <em>and even if there are other methodologies that might lead to contrary conclusions. </em>Thus, a judge should admit scientific testimony when \u201cthere are good grounds for [the] expert\u2019s conclusion, even if the judge thinks that there are better grounds for some alternative conclusion. . . .\u201d <em>In re Paoli R. Yard PCS Litigation, </em>35 F.3d 717, 744 (3d Cir. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">For example,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> in <em>Cella </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 998 F.2d 418, 420 (7th Cir. 1993), the plaintiff claimed that his polymyositis \u2014 an inflammation of the muscles involving both the upper and lower extremities \u2014 was caused by certain events of physical and emotional trauma he suffered while working aboard a Navy vessel. The plaintiff presented the testimony of a single physician supporting his theory of liability, while the defendant presented several witnesses who testified that the cause of polymyositis is, in fact, unknown, and thus could not be attributed to the aforementioned traumas with any degree of certainty. Id., 421-22. After the court, in a bench trial, found in favor of the plaintiff, the defendant appealed, claiming, in part, that the testimony of the plaintiffs physician should not even have been admitted \u201cin light of the testimony of the defendant\u2019s medical experts and the abundance of medical literature stating that the etiology of polymyositis is unknown.\u201d Id., 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">After a thorough review of the bases upon which the plaintiffs physician had based his opinion, the court upheld the admission of his testimony. \u201cAlthough [the plaintiffs physician\u2019s] conclusion differs from those of the defendant\u2019s medical experts, he has utilized an accepted methodology in reaching his conclusion \u2014 namely, analysis of medical literature and case study comparison with the individual characteristics of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>the patient\u2019s case to determine etiology.\u201d Id., 426. Thus, although there was little support in the literature for the physician\u2019s specific <em>conclusion </em>regarding the cause of the plaintiffs injury, the court found that he had employed a proper and thorough diagnostic <em>methodology. </em>Accordingly, it was not error to admit the physician\u2019s testimony, because \u201c \u2018[a]s long as the expert\u2019s methodology is well founded, the nature of the expert\u2019s conclusion is generally irrelevant, even if it is controversial or unique.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Id. Once the methodology underlying an expert conclusion has been sufficiently established, the mere fact that controversy, or even substantial controversy, surrounds that conclusion goes only to the weight, and not to the admissibility, of such testimony.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Of course, even where a particular technique has been shown to satisfy <em>Daubert, </em>the proponent must also establish that the specific scientific testimony at issue is, in fact, <em>derived from </em>and based upon that methodology. The Supreme Court in <em>Daubert </em>referred to this concept as the \u201cfit\u201d requirement. <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>supra, 509 U.S. 591; see part I A of this opinion. \u201c[Ajlthough some conclusions can be reasonably inferred from the methodology employed, others cannot.\u201d J. Kesan, supra, 84 Geo. L.J. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>2022. \u201cWhen an expert\u2019s conclusions are not commensurate with the underlying methodology, they may be properly excluded under <em>Daubert </em>because they do not rely on scientific knowledge and are thus unhelpful <em>to </em>the jury.\u201d Id.; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Foret, </em>628 So. 2d 1116, 1124-27 (La. 1993) (expert testimony that victim of alleged molestation had, in fact, been abused should have been excluded when testimony was based on psychological methodology designed and intended solely to assist in treatment, and not as diagnostic tool).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">We now set forth some of the factors that various courts have considered in conducting a methodological analysis. We emphasize, however, that these factors are <em>not </em>exclusive. Some will not be relevant in particular cases; and some cases will call for considerations not discussed herein. \u201cThe factors a trial court will find helpful in determining whether the underlying theories and techniques of the proffered evidence are scientifically reliable will differ with each particular case.\u201d <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>923 S.W.2d 549, 557 (Tex. 1995); see also <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>supra, 509 U.S. 593; <em>In re Paoli R. Yard PCB Litigation, </em>supra, 35 F.3d 742. Indeed, as discussed previously; see generally part I B 3 of this opinion; a mechanical list of mandatory factors would frustrate the entire concept underlying the <em>Daubert </em>approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">Even under <em>Daubert, </em>courts should continue to consider whether a scientific principle has gained \u201cgeneral acceptance\u201d in making admissibility determinations. Although \u201cgeneral acceptance\u201d is no longer an absolute prerequisite to the admission of scientific evidence, it should, in fact, be an important factor in a trial judge\u2019s assessment. Indeed, \u201c[w]e suspect that general acceptance in the relevant scientific community will continue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>to be the significant, and often the only, issue.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lannigan, </em>419 Mass. 15, 26, 641 N.E.2d 1342 (1994). Thus, \u201c[a]lthough <em>Frye </em>may no longer be <em>the </em>standard for admissibility, general acceptance remains a part of the analysis, and in many cases its presence may alone be sufficient to admit the evidence.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) \u201cStandards and Procedures for Determining the Admissibility of Expert Evidence After Daubert,\u201d 157 F.R.D. 571, 574 (1995). That is, if a trial court determines that a scientific methodology <em>has </em>gained general acceptance, then the <em>Daubert </em>inquiry will generally end and the conclusions derived from that methodology will generally be admissible.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> If a principle has <em>not </em>gained general acceptance, however, we emphasize that \u201ca proponent of [the] scientific opinion . . . may [still] demonstrate the reliability or validity of the underlying scientific theory or process by some other means, that is, without establishing general acceptance.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lannigan, </em>supra, 26; see also <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>supra, 509 U.S. 588-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Several other factors may properly play a role in a court\u2019s assessment of the validity of a scientific methodology. The remaining factors listed in Daubert\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>whether that methodology has been tested and subjected to peer review, and the known or potential rate of error \u2014 are of course important. See <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>supra, 509 U.S. 592-94. Moreover, the prestige and background of the expert witness supporting the evidence can play a role in determining whether a novel technique employed by that individual is likely to have any scientific merit. <em>State </em>v. <em>Goode, </em>supra, 341 N.C. 527-28; <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>297 Or. 404, 417, 687 P.2d 751 (1984); M. Gottesman, \u201cAdmissibility of Expert Testimony After <em>Daubert: </em>The \u2018Prestige\u2019 Factor,\u201d 43 Emory L.J. 867, 878 (1994). The extent to which the scientific technique in question relies on subjective interpretations and judgments by the testifying expert, rather than on objectively verifiable criteria, can also be a factor. <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 417; <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 923 S.W.2d 557; \u201cDevelopments in the Law,\u201d supra, 108 Harv. L. Rev. 1498. In the same vein, courts have looked at whether a testifying expert can present and explain the data and methodology underlying his or her scientific testimony in such a manner that the fact finder can reasonably and realistically draw its own conclusions therefrom. <em>State </em>v. <em>Goode, </em>supra, 527-28; \u201cDevelopments in the Law,\u201d supra, 1502; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Hasan, </em>supra, 205 Conn. 491. Several courts have also considered whether the scientific technique underlying the proffered expert testimony was developed and implemented solely to develop evidence for in-court use, or whether the technique has been developed or used for extrajudicial purposes. <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>43 F.3d 1311, 1317 (9th Cir. 1995) (applying Supreme Court <em>Daubert </em>opinion on remand of case); <em>State </em>v. <em>Goode, </em>supra, 527-28; <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 417; <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">We appreciate that many of these factors lack precision, but this indefiniteness is unavoidable. The actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>operation of each factor, as is the determination of which factors should be considered at all, depends greatly on the specific context of each case in which each particular <em>Daubert </em>analysis is conducted. So long as trial judges remain focused on the underlying purpose behind the <em>Daubert </em>analysis \u2014 to establish whether a scientific methodology has sufficient validity to be helpful to the fact finder \u2014 we are confident that the previously mentioned uncertainties are not so overwhelming as to render <em>Daubert </em>functionally inoperative. Cf. R. Friedman, supra, 34 Jurimetrics J. 141 (ambiguities in <em>Daubert </em>factors \u201cwill probably be genuinely troublesome only if, contrary to the [Supreme] Court\u2019s stated intention, lower courts treat the criteria as checklist items, each of which must be satisfied for a proposition to be deemed scientific, rather than merely as factors to be weighed, along with others, into an overall balance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">We now turn to the threshold burden that a proponent of scientific testimony bears to establish that the testimony is admissible. \u201cOnce the party opposing the evidence objects, the proponent bears the burden of demonstrating its admissibility.\u201d <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 923 S.W.2d 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">In addressing the showing that a proponent of scientific evidence must make, we are largely guided by the fundamental tenets of the law of evidence regarding admissibility. \u201cEvidence is admissible when it tends to establish a fact in issue or to corroborate other direct evidence in the case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McClendon, </em>199 Conn. 5, 8, 505 A.2d 685 (1986). \u201cEvidence is not rendered inadmissible because it is not conclusive. All that is required is that evidence <em>lend </em>to support a relevant fact even to a slight degree, so long as it is not prejudicial or merely cumulative.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>(Emphasis in original.) C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 8.1.1, p. 226. Moreover, even evidence \u201csusceptible to different interpretations\u201d is admissible; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>221 Conn. 713, 725, 607 A.2d 391, cert. denied, 506 U.S. 872, 113 S. Ct. 207, 121 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1992); \u201c \u2018[s]o long as the evidence may reasonably be construed in such a manner that it would be relevant . . . .\u2019\u2019\u2019Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">These concepts are as applicable to scientific testimony as to other types of evidence. Thus, questions about the methodological validity of proffered scientific testimony will generally go to the <em>weight </em>of such evidence, not to its admissibility. Courts should exclude scientific evidence, however, when such concerns render the technique, and the resulting evidence, incapable of assisting the fact finder in a sufficiently meaningful way.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Moreover, in light of the traditional policy regard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>ing the admission of relevant evidence, \u201c[a] judge frequently should find an expert\u2019s methodology helpful [and thus admissible] even when the judge thinks that the expert\u2019s technique has flaws sufficient to render the [expert\u2019s] conclusions inaccurate. He or she will often still believe that hearing the expert\u2019s testimony and assessing its flaws was an important part of assessing what conclusion was correct and may certainly still believe that a jury attempting to reach an accurate result should consider the evidence.\u201d <em>In re Paoli R. Yard PCB Litigation, </em>supra, 35 F.3d 744-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">A trial judge should therefore deem scientific evidence inadmissible only when the methodology underlying such evidence is sufficiently invalid to render the evidence incapable of helping the fact finder determine a fact in dispute. We adopt the <em>Daubert </em>approach, however, specifically because we conclude that a sufficient showing of validity <em>is </em>necessary for scientific evidence to be helpful. See part IB 1 of this opinion. The interplay between these principles \u2014 a general policy in favor of admission of helpful evidence, and a specific policy of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>requiring a showing of a certain level of validity before scientific testimony can properly be presented to a fact finder \u2014 cannot be resolved by an absolute statement or rule. Instead, a case-by-case analysis will be necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">It is important to remember that <em>Daubert </em>only provides a <em>threshold </em>inquiry into the admissibility of scientific evidence. Even evidence that has met the <em>Daubert </em>inquiry into its methodological validity, and thus has been shown to have some probative value, may be excluded for failure to satisfy other evidentiary rules. In particular, scientific evidence, like all evidence, is properly excluded if its prejudicial impact outweighs its probative value, even if it is otherwise admissible. See, e.g., <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>supra, 509 U.S. 595; <em>State </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>235 Conn. 145, 162, 665 A.2d 63 (1995); C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, supra, \u00a7 8.1.3, p. 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Finally, we address the concern that, by requiring trial courts to conduct a <em>Daubert </em>validity assessment, we are improperly requiring them to become amateur scientists. According to some critics, a significant problem with the <em>Daubert </em>approach is that \u201cwe sorely underestimate the complexity of many scientific controversies, particularly those involving complex quantitative analysis, when we presume that nonscientist judges can master the technical issues to the point that they should feel comfortable deciding what is or is not good science in a particular case. Scientists who have spent the greater portions of their professional lives wrestling with the complexities and mysteries of their disciplines must be amazed at the law\u2019s hubris in thinking that nonscientist judges can \u2018get up to speed\u2019 on a scientific dispute and ultimately decide who has the better of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>argument.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> P. Milich, \u201cControversial Science in the Courtroom: <em>Daubert </em>and the Law\u2019s Hubris,\u201d 43 Emory L.J. 913, 919 (1994); see also <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>supra, 509 U.S. 600-601 (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); J. Kesan, supra, 84 Geo. L.J. 2000.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">We conclude that this concern is unfounded. Under <em>Daubert, </em>trial judges are not required to make a determination of the ultimate scientific validity of any scientific propositions. Instead, they need only make a much more limited inquiry: whether sufficient indicia of legitimacy exist to support the conclusion that evidence derived from the principle may be profitably considered by a fact finder at trial. It is true that answering even this question may require \u201ca deeper and more detailed preliminary review of scientific claims than most courts have heretofore undertaken.\u201d B. Black, F. Ayala &amp; C. Saffran-Brinks, supra, 72 Tex. L. Rev. 721. Nonetheless, we do not expect this process to burden our courts unduly. \u201cThough the details of science may be remote from common experience, nonscientists can under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>stand the fundamental characteristics that separate valid science from pale imitations.\u201d Id., 720; see also <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 923 S.W.2d 557-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Moreover, to the extent that our adoption of <em>Daubert </em>does \u201c[signal] that the time has come for courts and lawyers to learn the basic principles of science\u201d; L. Loevinger, supra, 35 Jurimetrics J. 179; we see this as an unavoidable necessity. As science and technology have advanced and become increasingly prevalent in our society, the number of cases, both civil and criminal, in which scientific testimony plays a role has also grown. See, e.g., id., 172 n.110. This number undoubtedly will continue to grow in the future. When such cases, with their attendant evidentiary issues, arise, it is indisputable that \u201c]j]udges will . . . face difficult issues that are beyond their background and training. But they should not respond by evading their responsibility to reach a carefully reasoned decision or by using superficial labels \u2018to justify [their] instinctive reaction.\u2019 Instead, judges should try to educate themselves about the proposed area of expertise . . . .\u201d \u201cDevelopments in the Law,\u201d supra, 108 Harv. L. Rev. 1517. Only by being knowledgeable, in at least a basic way, about the issues surrounding the scientific evidence before them, can judges discharge their duties properly. Accordingly, <em>Daubert, </em>at its most fundamental level, merely directs \u201ctrial judges consciously [to] do what is in reality a basic task of a trial judge \u2014 ensure the reliability and relevance of evidence without causing confusion, prejudice or mistake.\u201d \u201cStandards and Procedures for Determining the Admissibility of Expert Evidence After Daubert,\u201d supra, 157 F.R.D. 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">Admissibility of Polygraph Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">We now turn to the defendant\u2019s claim that Connecticut should abandon its traditional per se rule against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>the admission of polygraph evidence at trial. \u201cThis court has repeatedly held that neither the results of a polygraph test nor the willingness of a witness to take such a test is admissible in Connecticut courts.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>235 Conn. 802, 831, 670 A.2d 301 (1996). The defendant argues that this position is inconsistent with <em>Daubert.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Without deciding, we will assume, for the purposes of this opinion, that polygraph evidence satisfies the admissibility threshold established by <em>Daubert. </em>After reviewing the case law and the current, extensive literature on the polygraph test, however, we are convinced that the prejudicial impact of polygraph evidence greatly exceeds its probative value.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Accordingly, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>see no reason to abandon our well established rule of exclusion, and we conclude that polygraph evidence should remain per se inadmissible in all trial court proceedings in which the rules of evidence apply,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> and for all trial purposes,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> in Connecticut courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">We first explain our methodology in assessing, in the absence of an evidentiary hearing before the trial court, the likely probative value of polygraph evidence. In conducting such an assessment, an appellate court \u201cmay take judicial notice of the existence of a body of scientific literature.\u201d <em>Browning-Ferris Industries of South Jersey, Inc. </em>v. <em>Muszynski, </em>899 F.2d 151, 161 (2d Cir. 1990). To ensure consistency in the approach to scientific evidence, a court should examine the foundation evidence received, if any; the scientific literature; and other courts\u2019 analyses. <em>State </em>v. <em>Streich, </em>163 Vt. 331, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>343, 658 A.2d 38 (1995). Indeed, even when, as in this case, there has been no evidence introduced at the trial level, an appellate court may properly \u201canalyfze] . . . the issues . . . based [only] on consideration of the information gleaned from prior reported cases and published literature on the subject matter.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Foret, </em>supra, 628 So. 2d 1131. In the past, this court has taken notice of empirical, extralegal materials in determining that, as a matter of law, certain scientific evidence was, in the form in which it was offered, inadmissible at trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Skipper, </em>228 Conn. 610, 622-23, 637 A.2d 1101 (1994) (literature search revealed fact, not elicited at trial, that DNA test for determining paternity relied on mathematical formula that assumed prior probability of paternity inconsistent with presumption of innocence in criminal case); cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sivri, </em>supra, 231 Conn. 158-61 (directing trial court to take notice of new scientific report, issued while case on appeal, in making determination of validity and admissibility of DNA population frequency calculations).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">With this background in mind, we turn now to an assessment of the threshold validity, probative value, and prejudicial impact of polygraph evidence. In order to do so, it is necessary to understand some of the mechanics and theory behind the modem polygraph test.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">Modem polygraph theory rests on two assumptions: (1) there is a regular relationship between deception and certain emotional states; and (2) there is a regular relationship between those emotional states and certain physiological changes in the body that can be measured and recorded. J. Tarantino, Strategic Use of Scientific Evidence (1988) \u00a7 6.01, p. 205. These physiological changes include fluctuations in heart rate and blood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>pressure, rate of breathing, and flow of electrical current through the body, and they are measured by a cardiosphygmograph, a pneumograph and a galvanometer, respectively. Id. These instruments, bundled together, form the basis of most modem polygraphs.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">There is no question that a high quality polygraph is capable of accurately measuring the relevant physical characteristics. United States Congress, Office of Technology Assessment, \u201cScientific Validity of Polygraph Testing: A Review and Evaluation \u2014 A Technical Memorandum,\u201d OTA-TM-H-15 (1983) (OTA Memorandum), reprinted in 12 Polygraph 198, 201 (1983). Even polygraph advocates, however, acknowledge that \u201c[n]o known physiological response or pattern of responses is unique to deception.\u201d D. Raskin, \u201cThe Polygraph in 1986: Scientific, Professional and Legal Issues Surrounding Application and Acceptance of Polygraph Evidence,\u201d 1986 Utah L. Rev. 29, 31 (1986). Indeed, \u201cthere is no reason to believe that lying produces distinctive physiological changes that characterize it and only it. . . . [T]here is no set of responses \u2014 physiological or otherwise \u2014 that humans omit only when lying or that they produce only when telling the truth .... No doubt when we tell a lie many of us experience an inner turmoil, but we experience similar turmoil when we are falsely accused of a crime, when we are anxious about having to defend ourselves against accusations, when we are questioned about sensitive topics \u2014 and, for that matter, when we are elated or otherwise emotionally stirred.\u201d (Citation omitted.) B. Kleinmuntz &amp; J. Szucko, \u201cOn the Fallibility of Lie Detection,\u201d 17 Law &amp; Society Rev. 85, 87 (1982). Thus, while a polygraph machine can accurately gauge a subject\u2019s <em>physiological </em>profile, it cannot, on its own, determine the nature of the underlying <em>psychological </em>profile. \u201cThe instrument cannot itself detect deception.\u201d OTA Memorandum, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>supra, reprinted in 12 Polygraph 196, statement of John Gibbons, Director of Office of Technology Assessment.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The polygraph examiner, therefore, is responsible for transforming the output of a polygraph machine from physiological data into an assessment of truth or deception. See, e.g, P. Giannelli, \u201cForensic Science: Polygraph Evidence: Part I,\u201d 30 Crim. L. Bull. 262, 264 (1994). This mission actually involves two separate tasks. First, the examiner must design and implement a polygraph test in such a way that the physiological data produced is properly linked to a subject\u2019s deceptiveness, and not just to his nervousness or other unrelated emotional responses. Id, 263. Second, even if the data produced <em>is </em>linked to a subject\u2019s deception, the examiner must interpret the data, that is, grade the test, correctly. Id, 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">The \u201ccontrol question test\u201d is the polygraph method most commonly used in criminal cases to link physiological responses to deception.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> See, e.g, C. Honts &amp; M. Perry, \u201cPolygraph Admissibility: Changes and Challenges,\u201d 16 Law &amp; Hum. Behav. 357, 360 (1992). The control question test is based on the theory that fear of detection causes psychological stress.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Under that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>test, therefore, the \u201cpolygraph instrument is measuring the fear of detection <em>rather than deception per se.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) OTA Memorandum, supra, reprinted in 12 Polygraph 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">In the control question test procedure, the polygrapher first conducts a pretest interview with the subject wherein the accuracy and reliability of the polygraph are emphasized.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> This is done to aggravate the deceptive subject\u2019s fear of detection while calming the innocent subject, which is crucial given that the test\u2019s efficacy is based entirely on the subject\u2019s emotional state. All exam questions are then reviewed with the subject, in order to minimize the impact of surprise on the test results and to ensure that the subject understands the questions. The actual control question test consists of a sequence of ten to twelve questions, repeated several times. There are three categories of questions: neutral; relevant; and control. All questions are formulated by the polygrapher conducting the examination based on a review of the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">A neutral question is entirely nonconfrontational and is designed to allow the polygrapher to get a baseline reading on the subject\u2019s physiological responses. A neutral question addresses a subject\u2019s name, age, address, or similar topic.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>A relevant question is accusatory and directed specifically at the subject under investigation. \u201cFor example, in an assault investigation, a relevant question might be: \u2018On May 1, 1986, did you strike Mr. Jones (the alleged victim) with any part of your body?\u2019 \u201d J. Tarantino, supra, \u00a7 6.09, p. 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">A control question concerns \u201can act of wrongdoing of the same general nature as the main incident under investigation,\u201d and is designed to be \u201cone to which the subject, in all probability, will lie or to which his answer will be of dubious validity in his own mind.\u201d J. Rat &amp; F. Inbau, Truth and Deception (2d Ed. 1977) p. 28. Control questions \u201ccover many years in the prior life of the subject and are deliberately vague. Almost anyone would have difficulty answering them truthfully with a simple \u2018No.\u2019 \u201d D. Raskin, supra, 1986 Utah L. Rev. 34. In an assault case, a control question might be: \u201cDid you ever want to see anyone harmed?\u201d J. Tarantino, supra, \u00a7 6.09, p. 215. Although few people honestly could deny these control questions categorically, they are \u201cpresented to the subject in a manner designed to lead him to believe that admissions would negatively influence the examiner\u2019s opinion and that strong reactions to those questions during the test would produce a deceptive result.\u201d D. Raskin, supra, 1986 Utah L. Rev. 34.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">The theoiy behind the control question test is that \u201cthe truthful person will respond more to the control questions than to the relevant questions because they represent a greater threat to that person. For the same reason the deceptive person will respond more to the relevant questions than to the control questions.\u201d P. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Giannelli, supra, 30 Crim. L. Bull. 266-67. Thus, in order for the test to work properly, both truthful and deceptive examinees must have particular mind sets during the exam. \u201cThe innocent examinee [must fear] that the polygraph examiner will pick up his deception [on the control question] and incorrectly conclude that he is also being deceptive about the relevant question.\u201d J. Tarantino, supra, \u00a7 6.09, p. 216. As a result, the innocent subject\u2019s physiological responses to the control question, stemming from this fear, will be greater than those to the relevant question, which the subject can answer honestly. A guilty subject, however, will be more worried about having his crime and deception exposed by the relevant question than he is about any control question issues. Accordingly, his physiological responses \u2014 prompted by his fear of detection \u2014 will be greater with regard to the relevant question than to the control question.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Under the control question test, the absolute measure of the subject\u2019s physiological responses to each question is unimportant. For example, the mere fact that a subject has a strong response to a relevant question can simply be indicative of nervousness and does not, by itself, indicate deception. Instead, the polygrapher looks to the <em>relative </em>strength of the responses to the control and relevant questions in order to determine truth or deception.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The art of the polygrapher lies in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>composing control and relevant questions that elicit the appropriate relative responses from truthful and deceitful parties. See generally <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kwong, </em>69 F.3d 663, 668 (2d Cir. 1995) (polygraph results excluded because examiner failed to formulate questions properly); J. McCall, supra, 1996 U. Ill. L. Rev. 378; D. Raskin, supra, 1986 Utah L. Rev. 47-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">A control question exam ordinarily pairs relevant and control questions with some neutral questions interspersed. For example, a typical progression would be:</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">\u201c1. (Neutral) Do you understand that I will ask only the questions we have discussed?</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">\u201c2. (Pseudo-Relevant) Regarding whether you took that ring, do you intend to answer all of the questions truthfully?</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">\u201c3. (Neutral) Do you live in the United States?</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">\u201c4. (Control) During the first twenty-four years of your life, did you ever take something that did not belong to you?</p>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">\u201c5. (Relevant) Did you take a ring from the Behavioral Sciences Building on July 1, 1985?</p>\n<p id=\"b121-12\">\u201c6. (Neutral) Is your name Joanne?</p>\n<p id=\"b121-13\">\u201c7. (Control) Between the ages of ten and twenty-four, did you ever do anything dishonest or illegal?</p>\n<p id=\"b121-14\">\u201c8. (Relevant) Did you take that diamond ring from a desk in the Behavioral Sciences Building on July 1?</p>\n<p id=\"b121-15\">\u201c9. (Neutral) Were you bom in the month of February?</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>\u201c10. (Control) Before 1984 did you ever lie to get out of trouble or to cause a problem for someone else?</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">\u201c11. (Relevant) Were you in any way involved in the theft of that diamond ring from the Behavioral Sciences Building last July?\u201d D. Raskin, supra, 1986 Utah L. Rev. 36. The entire sequence is normally gone through three times, after which the examiner scores the result to attempt to reach a determination of truthfulness or deception.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">The most common technique for scoring polygraph charts is pure numerical grading. In the most prevalent numerical system, the polygrapher assigns a numerical value along the range of -3 to +3 to each pair of relevant and control questions. A score of +3 indicates a much stronger reaction to the control question than to the relevant question and, therefore, truthfulness; a score of -3 indicates a much stronger reaction to the relevant question and, therefore, deception; and a score of 0 indicates that there was no significant difference in response. The examiner considers only the polygraph chart in assigning these scores; no consideration is given to any subjective impressions regarding the subject\u2019s truthfulness that the examiner develops over the course of the exam. The scores for all question pairs in all three sequences are then totaled. If the sum is +6 or greater, the subject is classified as truthful; if the sum is -6 or lower, the subject is classified as deceptive; scores of -5 to +5 are deemed inconclusive. Computers are sometimes used to give more precise numerical scores to polygraph charts.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>If an analysis of the first three charts produces inconclusive results, the examiner will often repeat the question sequence twice more. After that, however, further repetitions are generally considered meritless, as the subject will have become habituated to the test questions and, therefore, will no longer have sufficiently strong emotional responses for polygraph purposes.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Id., 37-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>2</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">We now examine the validity of the results produced by the polygraph test.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> The word \u201cvalidity\u201d has two meanings in the polygraph context: for the purposes of this discussion, they will be labeled \u201caccuracy\u201d and \u201cpredictive value.\u201d Courts generally do not specify to which concept they are referring when they address polygraph issues. Maintaining this distinction is essential, however, if one is to evaluate fairly the validity of the polygraph test.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">a</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The \u201caccuracy\u201d of the polygraph test itself has two components: <em>sensitivity </em>and <em>specificity. </em>The polygraph\u2019s sensitivity is its ability to tell that a guilty person is, in fact, lying. If the polygraph test had a 90 percent sensitivity, then it would correctly label a deceptive subject as being deceptive 90 percent of the time. Thus, the test would incorrectly label a deceptive subject as being truthful 10 percent of the time; this mislabeling is called a \u201cfalse negative\u201d error. The polygraph\u2019s speci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>ficity is its ability to tell that an innocent person is, in fact, being truthful. If the polygraph test had an 80 percent specificity, then it would label a truthful subject as being truthful 80 percent of the time. The test would thus incorrectly label a truthful subject as being deceptive 20 percent of the time; this mislabeling is called a \u201cfalse positive\u201d error. It is generally agreed in the literature, by both advocates and critics, that polygraphs have greater sensitivity than specificity; that is, that false positives outnumber false negatives. See, e.g., C. Honts &amp; M. Perry, supra, 16 Law &amp; Hum. Behav. 362; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Galbreth, </em>908 F. Sup. 877, 885 (D.N.M. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">There is wide disagreement, however, as to what the sensitivity and specificity values actually are for a well run polygraph exam. See generally 1 C. McCormick, supra, \u00a7 206, pp. 907-17. Dozens of studies of polygraph accuracy have been conducted. Id. They fall into two basic types, namely, laboratory simulations of crimes<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> and field studies based on data from polygraph examinations in actual criminal cases.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> P. Giannelli, supra, 30 Crim. L. Bull. 270-73. The variance in expert opinion regarding polygraph accuracy arises from disagreements as to which methods and which studies within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>each method are methodologically valid. C. Honts &amp; M. Perry, supra, 16 Law &amp; Hum. Behav. 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Polygraph supporters base their accuracy estimates on both laboratory simulation and field studies. These advocates acknowledge that field studies are theoretically preferable for establishing the polygraph test\u2019s field accuracy, but they conclude that serious methodological difficulties inherent in such studies, such as establishing the actual guilt or <em>innocence </em>of the study subjects, make most of these studies unreliable. They think, however, that laboratory studies, when designed to approximate field conditions and when carefully conducted, <em>can </em>provide useful and valid data. See generally J. Kircher, S. Horowitz &amp; D. Raskin, \u201cMeta-analysis of Mock Crime Studies of the Control Question Polygraph Technique,\u201d 12 Law &amp; Hum. Behav. 79, 80 (1988); see also C. Honts &amp; M. Perry, supra, 16 Law &amp; Hum. Behav. 361. David Raskin, perhaps the foremost polygraph advocate in the United States, recently reviewed the literature on polygraph studies and concluded that eight laboratory studies and four field studies of the control question test polygraph technique were methodologically valid. D. Raskin, \u201cThe Scientific Status of Research on Polygraph Techniques,\u201d in West Companion to Scientific Evidence 2 (Faigman et al. eds., forthcoming 1996), cited in C. Honts &amp; B. Quick, \u201cThe Polygraph in 1995: Progress in Science and the Law,\u201d 71 N.D. L. Rev. 987, 995, 1018-19 (1995). The laboratory studies that Raskin cites, taken together, indicate that the polygraph test has an 89 percent sensitivity rate and a 91 percent specificity rate;<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> the field studies give an 87 percent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>sensitivity and a 59 percent specificity.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Id. Other studies indicate higher levels of accuracy. See generally P. Giannelli, supra, 30 Crim. L. Bull. 271-73; C. McCormick, supra, \u00a7 206, pp. 909-10. The United States Department of Defense, although acknowledging that more research needs to be done, concluded after a thorough review of the literature that there was no \u201cdata suggesting that the various polygraph techniques and applications . . . have high false positive or high false negative error rates.\u201d United States Department of Defense, The Accuracy and Utility of Polygraph Testing (1984) p. 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Critics, however, view the existing body of polygraph studies quite differently. First, although polygraph detractors agree with the advocates that most field studies are invalid due to methodological concerns, they disagree as to which tests <em>are </em>valid. David Lykken, a prominent polygraph critic, has concluded from the field tests he deems valid that the polygraph has a sensitivity of 84 percent and a specificity of only 53 percent. D. Lykken, \u201cThe Validity of Tests: Caveat Emptor,\u201d 27 Jurimetrics J. 263, 264 (1987).<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Another critic has concluded that reliable field studies indicate that there is \u201clittle or no case\u201d for using the polygraph, and that \u201cpolygraph lie detection adds nothing positive to conventional approaches to interrogation and assessment.\u201d D. Carroll, \u201cHow Accurate Is Polygraph Lie Detection?,\u201d in The Polygraph Test (A. Gale ed., 1988) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>pp. 19, 28. After its own thorough review of the polygraph field studies, the United States Office of Technology Assessment concluded that \u201cthe cumulative research evidence suggest that. . . the polygraph test detects deception better than chance, but with significant error rates.\u201d OTA Memorandum, supra, reprinted in 12 Polygraph 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Moreover, polygraph critics argue that laboratory simulation studies are almost completely invalid. They point out that, although the accuracy of the control question test turns entirely on the subject having the \u201cright\u201d emotional responses, the emotional stimuli in the laboratory are completely different from those in the field. D. Carroll, \u201cHow Accurate Is Polygraph Lie Detection?,\u201d supra, p. 24. \u201cIn the mock crime paradigm . . . it is likely that volunteer subjects regard the experience as a kind of interesting game. Those persons instructed to commit the mock crime and to he during the test no doubt feel a certain excitement, but not the guilt or fear of exposure that a real thief feels when tested for the police. Volunteers assigned to the innocent group have no reason at all to fear the relevant questions; they are not suspected of any wrongdoing and they will not be punished or defamed even if the test goes awry. On the other hand, the control questions used in laboratory studies . . . unlike the relevant questions, do refer to real-world events and, presumably, have the same embarrassing or disturbing effect on volunteer subjects that they have on criminal suspects. This is probably the reason why mock crime studies typically show a much lower rate of false positive errors than do studies of actual criminal interrogation in the field. Innocent suspects often fail police-administered tests . . . because they find the relevant questions more disturbing than the control questions, since they know they are in real jeopardy in respect to the accusations contained in the relevant questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>while the controls involve no comparable risk. For the volunteer laboratory subject, this balance is reversed.\u201d D. Lykken, \u201cThe Case Against Polygraph Testing,\u201d in The Polygraph Test (A. Gale ed., 1988) pp. 111, 114-15.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Raskin has admitted that these concerns with laboratory simulations are significant. J. Kircher, S. Horowitz &amp; D. Raskin, supra, 12 Law &amp; Hum. Behav. 80, 88-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Even if one accepts Raskin\u2019s field study estimates of accuracy over those of the polygraph critics, polygraph evidence is of questionable validity. Raskin\u2019s 87 percent sensitivity indicates a 13 percent false negative rate. In other words, 13 percent of those who are in fact deceptive will be labeled as truthful. Moreover, Raskin\u2019s 59 percent specificity indicates a 41 percent false positive rate. In other words, 41 percent of subjects who are, in fact, truthful will be labeled as deceptive.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">b</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">In the previous section, we demonstrated that the basic <em>accuracy </em>of the polygraph test is still open to considerable debate. The actual <em>probative value </em>of polygraph evidence as asignifier of guilt or innocence, more<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>over, is even more questionable. This is because sensitivity, for example, only tells how likely a polygraph is to label accurately a person as deceptive <em>given that </em>the person really is lying. At trial, however, we would not yet know that a subject is deceptive \u2014 indeed, making that determination may be the entire point of the trial. Knowing how accurately the polygraph test labels deceptive people as deceptive is not, therefore, directly helpful. We are instead interested in a related, but distinct, question: how likely is it that a person really is lying given that the polygraph labels the subject as deceptive? This is called the \u201cpredictive value positive.\u201d Similarly, at trial we are not directly interested in the polygraph test\u2019s specificity, but rather in its \u201cpredictive value negative\u201d: how likely is it that a subject really is truthful given that the polygraph labels the subject as not deceptive?</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Predictive value positive and predictive value negative depend on the sensitivity and specificity of the polygraph test, but also turn on the \u201cbase rate\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>deceptiveness among the people tested by the polygraph.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Unfortunately, no reliable measure of this base rate currently exists if, indeed, one is possible at all. Raskin has claimed, on the basis of an analysis of a United States Secret Service study and on the basis of his own empirical experience, that only about 40 to 60 percent of criminal defendants who are willing to sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>mit to polygraph tests are actually guilty. D. Raskin, supra, 1986 Utah L. Rev. 59-60. If a base rate of about 50 percent were correct, then, using Raskin\u2019s own field derived figures of 87 percent sensitivity and 59 percent specificity, the predictive value positive of the polygraph test would only be 68 percent and the predictive value negative would be 82 percent.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> That is, even if we were to agree with all of Raskin\u2019s figures, we should only be 68 percent confident that a subject really is lying if the subject fails a polygraph exam, and only 82 percent confident that the subject is being truthful if the subject passes. Therefore, although the probative value of the polygraph test may be greater than that of a coin toss, it is not significantly greater, especially for failed tests.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Furthermore, the 50 percent base rate that Raskin posits is far from universally accepted. \u201c[T]he figures for [the base rate] that [Raskin] pull[s] out of the hat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>should not be taken as firm.\u201d D. Kaye, \u201cThe Validity of Tests: Caveant Omnes,\u201d 27 Jurimetrics J. 349, 357 (1987). Lykken posits, albeit with as equally sparse evidence as Raskin, that the base rate of guilt among people volunteering for a polygraph exam is 80 percent. D. Lykken, supra, 27 Jurimetrics J. 268. Using this base rate, the polygraph test\u2019s predictive value positive is 89 percent and its predictive value negative is 53 percent. Lylcken\u2019s base rate, therefore, makes a failed test more probative than it is under Raskin\u2019s base rate, but makes a passed test much less probative.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The <em>specific </em>predictive value positive and predictive value negative figures generated by a particular set of assumptions, however, is not the significant point for the legal determination of whether to admit polygraph evidence. The point is that, given the complete absence of reliable data on base rates, we have no way of assessing the probative value of the polygraph test. Under one set of assumptions, a failed test has some significance, while a passed test does not; under another, the situation is reversed. The figures are further muddied when one recalls that the sensitivity and specificity of the polygraph are also hotly debated.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Countermeasures are also a concern with regard to polygraph validity. A countermeasure is any technique used by a deceptive subject to induce a false negative result and thereby pass the test. For a countermeasure to work on the control question test, all it must do is \u201cchange the direction of the differential reactivity between the relevant and control questions . . . .\u201d G. Gudjonsson, \u201cHow to Defeat the Polygraph Tests,\u201d in The Polygraph Test (A. Gale ed., 1988) pp. 126, 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">it may be true that \u201csubjects <em>without special training </em>in countermeasures are unable to beat the polygraph test, even if they have been provided with extensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>information and suggestions on how they might succeed . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> (Citation omitted; emphasis added.) D. Raskin, \u201cHofmann, Hypnosis, and the Polygraph,\u201d 3 Utah B.J. 7, 8 (1990); G. Gudjonsson, \u201cHow to Defeat the Polygraph Tests,\u201d supra, p. 135. Yet as one polygraph supporter, Charles Honts, concedes, \u201cstudies have indicated that [expert-conducted] training in specific point countermeasures designed to increase [physiological responses to control questions] is effective in producing a substantial number of false negative outcomes . . . .\u201d C. Honts &amp; B. Quick, supra, 71 N.D. L. Rev. 1001. Specifically, \u201c[s]ubjects in these studies were informed about the nature of the control question test and were trained to recognize control and relevant questions. Countermeasure subjects were then instructed to employ a countermeasure (e.g., bite their tongue, press their toes to the floor, or count backward by seven) during the control question zones of a control question test. In one study, none of the guilty subjects who received this brief training was correctly detected .... Across all of the studies more than 50 % of the decisions on countermeasures subjects were incorrect.\u201d (Citation omitted.) C. Honts &amp; M. Perry, supra, 16 Law &amp; Hum. Behav. 374. Although we share Honts\u2019 hope that \u201cthe required [expert] training is . . . difficult to obtain\u201d; C. Honts &amp; B. Quick, supra, 71 N.D. L. Rev. 1001; we question whether such is the case and whether it would remain the case if polygraph examination of witnesses became common, especially given the apparent brevity and simplicity of the training in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>3</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">With the foregoing information in mind, we will assume, without deciding, that polygraph evidence satisfies <em>Daubert. </em>Although the subjective nature and highly questionable predictive value of the polygraph test weigh heavily against admission, we assume that polygraph evidence may have enough demonstrated validity to pass the <em>Daubert </em>threshold for admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">We conclude, however, that admission of the polygraph test would be highly detrimental to the operation of Connecticut courts, both procedurally and substantively. Moreover, as illustrated in part II B 2 b of this opinion, the probative value of polygraph evidence is very low, even if it satisfies <em>Daubert. </em>Accordingly, we also conclude that any limited evidentiary value that polygraph evidence does have is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effects. We therefore reaffirm our per se rale against the use of polygraph evidence in Connecticut courts. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 297 Or. 438, 439-42 (polygraph evidence properly not admissible at trial, even though it \u201cmay possess some probative value and may, in some cases, be helpful to the trier of fact,\u201d because probative value substantially outweighed by prejudicial impact); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Black, </em>831 F. Sup. 120, 122-23 (E.D.N.Y. 1993) (\u201cThat the <em>Frye </em>test was displaced by the Rules of Evidence does not mean . . . that the Rules themselves place no limits on the admissibility of purportedly scientific evidence. Nor is the trial judge disabled from screening such evidence. . . . [N]othing in <em>Daubert . . . </em>disturb [s] the settled precedent that polygraph evidence is . . . [not] admissible . . . .\u201d [Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">a</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">The most significant, and fundamental, problem with allowing polygraph evidence in court is that it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>invade the fact-finding province of the jury.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> The jury has traditionally been the sole arbiter of witness credibility.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>237 Conn. 390, 438, 678 A.2d 1338 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Person, </em>236 Conn. 342, 347, 673 A.2d 463 (1996); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>169 Conn. 161, 170, 362 A.2d 808 (1975) (polygraph evidence excluded because \u201c[credibility as an issue is committed to the sole determination of the trier of fact\u201d). Indeed, an underlying premise of our legal system is that the jury is capable in this regard. Accordingly, we generally disallow expert testimony as to witness credibility when the subject matter of the testimony \u201cis within the knowledge of jurors and expert testimony [therefore] would not assist them . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>199 Conn. 473, 477, 507 A.2d 1387 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Boscarino, </em>204 Conn. 714, 733, 529 A.2d 1260 (1987) (expert testimony on reliability of eyewitness identifications properly excluded).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">A determination of whether a witness is telling the truth is well within the province of all jurors\u2019 understanding and abilities.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Indeed, one polygraph skeptic, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>after reviewing the literature, concluded that any observant person can assess witness truthfulness as well as a trained polygrapher: \u201c[I]t would appear that an observer, regarding the [polygraph examinee\u2019s] general behavior . . . does just as well as an experienced polygraph examiner . . . .\u201d D. Carroll, \u201cHow Accurate Is Polygraph Lie Detection?,\u201d supra, p. 28. Most scientific testimony is facially different from polygraph evidence, however, in that it involves matters that jurors <em>cannot </em>assess on their own. A juror cannot, for example, determine whether a blood stain contains DNA consistent with that of a particular individual without expert assistance and testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Very few studies have been done on the influence that polygraph evidence has over juries, and the cumulative results of those studies are inconclusive.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> In view of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>the importance of maintaining the role of the jury, this uncertainty alone justifies the continued exclusion of polygraph evidence. Moreover, polygraph evidence so directly abrogates the jury\u2019s function that its admission is offensive to our tradition of trial by jury. Indeed, the specter of polygraph evidence demonstrates why the traditional role of the jury in assessing credibility is so important and should be guarded so assiduously.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">A polygrapher can ascertain a witness\u2019 deception or truth only indirectly, through physical manifestations thereof. It is unfair, however, to label a person as truthful or a liar based solely on such indirect, secondary indicia as a polygraph provides. Although a juror also considers secondary indicia, like demeanor, in assessing a witness\u2019 credibility, the juror has access to the rest of the evidence in the case as well, giving the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>juror several points of reference on which to base an assessment.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> In this way, a witness is not wrongly condemned, or elevated, solely because his or her body does not act in the \u201cright\u201d way.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Moreover, we afford criminal defendants the right to trial by a panel of several jurors partly out of the recognition that, although one person may be misled when a witness gives the \u201cincorrect\u201d physical signals, the cumulative impressions of the group are likely to lead to the truth. It violates the premise of this entire system to allow a single person \u2014 the polygrapher \u2014 to label a witness as honest or as dishonest based solely on the same type of indirect evidence that we generally maintain takes an entire jury to evaluate.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">In this regard, we do not dispute that polygraphers may often reach a correct <em>conclusion </em>regarding a subject\u2019s guilt or innocence.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> We conclude, however, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>this fact, in and of itself, is irrelevant. As illustrated in part II B 2 of this opinion, the ability of the polygraph <em>technique </em>to tell whether a subject is lying or telling the truth is still highly questionable. Thus, one cannot say with any degree of certainty that a polygrapher\u2019s ultimate conclusion about a subject\u2019s veracity is in fact based upon the polygraph machine \u2014 that is, based upon science. It is just as likely, if not more likely, that a polygrapher\u2019s conclusion will be based either on chance or on his or her general impressions of the subject\u2019s credibility. An assessment of witness credibility based simply on chance or on intuition is not, however, admissible at trial. See generally C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, supra, \u00a7\u00a7 7.18 through 7.28 (credibility of witness can only be bolstered by certain methods, and only after credibility has been impeached). Indeed, forming impressions and intuitions regarding witnesses is the quintessential jury function; moreover, to the extent possible, luck should be excluded from the assessment process altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Accordingly, the fact that a polygrapher\u2019s ultimate assessment <em>happens to </em>be right does not mean that it should be admitted at trial. If that opinion was not arrived at objectively through scientific principles and proof, then it is immaterial whether it happens to be correct because it was not based on any information that the jury itself could not have gleaned through its own observations. Because one cannot say with a high degree of certainty that a polygrapher\u2019s conclusion is based firmly in objective, scientific truth, and because one therefore cannot say that polygraph evidence provides a better informed assessment of a witness\u2019 credibility than the personal observations of each juror, allowing polygraph testimony would be a direct invasion of the province of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">b</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Furthermore, admission of polygraph test results at trial would likely produce regular, and immensely time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>consuming, \u201cbattles of the experts.\u201d Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mendes, </em>406 Mass. 201, 202-203, 547 N.E.2d 35 (1989) (even after fifteen years of experience with polygraph evidence, evidentiary hearing consumed four days of court time). Admittedly, such a battle is common whenever scientific evidence is offered in court, and many types of scientific evidence are nonetheless routinely admitted at trials. In those instances, however, the probative value of the evidence is such that the delay attendant to the admission of the evidence is warranted. Because polygraph evidence is of such dubious probative value, however, the prejudicial impact of the likely delays weighs more heavily against admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Indeed, polygraph evidence is especially likely to cause disruptive conflicts between experts. Even polygraph advocates admit that \u201ca substantial proportion of those who conduct tests in the public and private sectors lack adequate training and competence.\u201d D. Raskin, supra, 1986 Utah L. Rev. 66-67; see also C. Honts &amp; B. Quick, supra, 71 N.D. L. Rev. 998-99. Although expert qualification is always an issue with regard to scientific evidence, it is of particular import in the polygraph case.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">With most types of scientific evidence, and especially with psychological tests, there are certain set procedures that are generally deemed to give accurate results. S. Blinkhom, \u201cLie Detection As a Psychometric Procedure,\u201d in The Polygraph Test (A. Gale ed., 1988) pp. 29, 30-31. The expert debate in the courtroom simply focuses on whether these generally accepted, fixed procedures were adequately observed. This process ensures a certain level of \u201cquality control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">There is, however, little standardization of polygraph test procedures. Id. With the polygraph test, each administration of a control question test is necessarily different, with appropriate control and relevant ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>tions chosen and formulated by each individual examiner. As a result, a battle of the experts over polygraph evidence cannot simply address whether \u201cthe\u201d test was properly administered. In the case of the control question test, for example, the experts will have to debate both whether the standardized control question test format was properly observed, <em>and </em>whether the <em>particular, nonstandardized </em>questions involved, <em>as chosen by the examiner, </em>were theoretically sound.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> The latter point will require an in-depth examination of the polygrapher\u2019s credentials. This additional layer of controversy will cause the qualification and questioning of experts to consume even more courtroom time than it ordinarily does.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Furthermore, the very nature of the polygraph test makes extensive expert battles inevitable. Many experts dispute that the polygraph has any value whatsoever. By contrast, much other scientific evidence is premised on tests and procedures that are generally accepted at least in the abstract, if not as performed in a particular case. For example, the \u201cbasic genetic theory underlying DNA profiling [restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis] essentially is undisputed.\u201d J. McKenna, J. Cecil &amp; P. Coukos, \u201cReference Guide on Forensic DNA Evidence,\u201d in Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence, J. Moore, Federal Practice (1995) pp. 273, 285. Because many experts doubt the entire physiological and emotional basis of the polygraph test,<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> many court<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>room skirmishes will be fought over the scientific validity of the entire polygraph procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Polygraph results are ripe for in-court expert controversy, moreover, because, as previously discussed, the polygraph measures deception only <em>indirectly, </em>by gauging a subject\u2019s physiological state. The examiner must formulate questions that will properly link actual deception to physiological responses and relate the responses to those questions back to truth or deception. Other types of scientific evidence <em>directly </em>address an objective fact. Ballistics evidence, for example, directly addresses whether a particular bullet could have come from a particular gun, based on directly relevant physical indicators. With the polygraph test, however, the physiological test results can be linked to truth or deception only through the polygrapher\u2019s interpretation. This nexus between polygraph chart and polygraph significance is easily attacked by competing experts, and is likely to consume significant court time. Cf. M. Abbell, \u201cPolygraph Evidence: The Case Against Admissibility in Federal Criminal Trials,\u201d 15 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 29, 41 (1977) (\u201ceven under optimal conditions, the results of polygraph examinations lack the reliability of the typical objective forensic tests which are admissible in evidence\u201d due to uniquely subjective manner in which polygraph exams are interpreted).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">Finally, there is a risk that, if polygraph evidence were admissible, juries would come to expect it with regard to <em>all </em>witnesses, a possibility that implicates both of the aforementioned concerns. Indeed, one wonders whether juries would draw adverse inferences against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>the witness whenever such evidence was not presented, or whether a <em>Secondino </em>instruction would be warranted.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> These admittedly minor issues would be less important if polygraph evidence had substantial probative value for the fact finder. As matters stand, however, this Pandora\u2019s box of subsidiary concerns further weighs against allowing the use of polygraph evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Our decision to maintain our per se rule of exclusion with regard to polygraph evidence is consistent with the conclusion of the majority of courts that have considered this issue. State appellate courts, for whom <em>Daubert </em>is not mandatory authority, largely agree with our assessment that the prejudicial impact of polygraph evidence outweighs its probative value. As a result, approximately one half of the states have an absolute rule barring admission of polygraph evidence in criminal cases. See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>169 Ill. 2d 472, 662 N.E.2d 1199, 1210 (1996).<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> Several of these courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>have specifically held that the <em>Daubert </em>standard does not require admission of polygraph evidence, in light of the polygraph\u2019s questionable reliability and prejudicial impact. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Beard, </em>supra, 194 W. Va. 746-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">The majority of the remaining states that have considered the issue admit polygraph evidence at trial only when its admission is stipulated to in advance by all parties.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Webber, </em>260 Kan. 263, 275-76, 918 P.2d 609 (1996).<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> Even the jurisdictions that allow polygraph evidence by stipulation, however, generally do not assert that the evidence is probative, or that it gains validity by means of the stipulation. Instead, the allowance is simply based on the parties\u2019 right to waive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>evidentiary objections. See, e.g., <em>Delap </em>v. State, 440 So. 2d 1242, 1247 (Fla. 1983). We are unpersuaded by this rationale. In our view, the limited reliability of polygraph evidence, taken together with its significant potential for prejudicial effect, compel the conclusion that such evidence should remain inadmissible even pursuant to a stipulation.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Of the states that do allow polygraph evidence without a stipulation, most allow it only in proceedings other than at trial. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Catanese, </em>368 So. 2d 975, 981-83 (La. 1979) (admissible in posttrial proceedings).<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> Only a very few states actually allow polygraph evidence that has not been stipulated to at the trial itself. See, e.g., <em>Conner v. State, </em>632 So. 2d 1239, 1257-59 (Miss. 1993) (evidence of willingness to take polygraph test admissible to rehabilitate impeached witness); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>117 N.M. 452, 872 P.2d 870, 877 (1994) (polygraph evidence authorized by local rule of evidence under supervision of trial court);<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number><em>Wright, </em>322 S.C. 253, 256, 471 S.E.2d 700 (1996) (polygraph admissibility at discretion of trial court, but should usually be excluded due to prejudicial effects). These states have concluded that, at least under certain circumstances, polygraph evidence is sufficiently more probative than prejudicial to warrant admission. For the reasons discussed in part II B of this opinion, however, we disagree, and instead conclude in agreement with the majority of states that such a balance in favor of admissibility is not, in fact, ever reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">In this regard, it is particularly instructive to note that several courts, after experimenting with polygraph admissibility for several years, rejected its admissibility and reinstated the traditional rule of inadmissibility. In each case, the court realized that its earlier assessment, namely, that the probative value of polygraph evidence outweighed its prejudicial impact, was mistaken. For example, in 1974 the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court decided to allow polygraph evidence for the limited purpose of corroborating or impeaching a defendant\u2019s trial testimony. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>365 Mass. 421, 425-26, 313 N.E.2d 120 (1974). The court concluded that \u201cpolygraph testing has advanced to the point where it could prove to be of significant value to the criminal trial process if its admissibility initially is limited to carefully defined circumstances designed to protect the proper and effective administration of criminal justice.\u201d Id., 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">In 1989, however, the court reconsidered its position. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mendes, </em>supra, 406 Mass. 201. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>noting that the polygraph evidentiary hearing in <em>Mendes </em>had \u201cconsumed four days\u201d of trial court time; id., 202; the court concluded that polygraph evidence continued to suffer from serious shortcomings, including the subjective nature of the polygraph method; the uncertain validity of polygraph evidence; the danger of proliferating a \u201cbattle of experts\u201d; the danger of confusing the jury; the danger of usurping the jury\u2019s role; and the burden placed on trial courts in conducting evidentiary hearings. Id., 211. The court concluded that \u201c[f]ifteen years has been more than enough time for examination and evaluation [of polygraph evidence]. . . . Further hope or expectation . . . is no longer warranted. . . . Accordingly, supported by the overwhelming authority throughout the country, we announce that polygraphic evidence, with or without pretest stipulation, is inadmissible in criminal trials in this Commonwealth . . . .\u201d Id., 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Similarly, after a seven year experiment with admitting polygraph evidence on stipulation, the Wisconsin Supreme Court reinstated its per se exclusionary rule, concluding that \u201cthe burden on the trial court to assess the reliability of stipulated polygraph evidence [outweighs] any probative value the evidence may have.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Dean, </em>103 Wis. 2d 228, 279, 307 N.W.2d 628 (1981). In 1974, the Wisconsin Supreme Court had decided to allow polygraph evidence to corroborate or impeach a defendant\u2019s testimony when: (1) all parties stipulated to admissibility; (2) the trial court had the discretion to reject such evidence notwithstanding the stipulation; (3) the party against whom such evidence was offered was allowed an opportunity for thorough cross-examination of the polygrapher; and (4) the jury was instructed that such evidence was only to be considered for corroborative purposes, and that they were free to determine what weight such evidence should be given. <em>State </em>v. <em>Stanislawski, </em>62 Wis. 2d 730, 742-43, 216 N.W.2d 8 (1974). As applied over the next several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>years, however, the <em>Stanislawski </em>rule created substantial practical problems in Wisconsin\u2019s trial courts. For example, it became unclear exactly what type of hearing, if any, the second <em>Stanislawski </em>prong required, and what standard appellate courts should use in reviewing a trial court\u2019s determination of polygraph reliability. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dean, </em>supra, 270. Under the third prong, it was unclear whether the party adversely affected by polygraph evidence could call its own experts to testify that polygraphs were unreliable. Id., 274-75. On account of these and similar problems, the Wisconsin Supreme Court in 1981 held polygraph evidence inadmissible in criminal trials. Id., 279. \u201cOur analysis of and our experience with the <em>Stanislawski </em>rule lead us ... to conclude that the <em>Stanislawski </em>conditions are not operating satisfactorily to enhance the reliability of the polygraph evidence and to protect the integrity of the trial process as they were intended to do.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">North Carolina and Oklahoma also allowed stipulated polygraph results for a brief time, then retreated to a per se rule of inadmissibility. <em>State </em>v. <em>Grier, </em>307 N.C. 628, 643, 300 S.E.2d 351 (1983) (\u201c[W]e are forced to conclude that the administration of justice simply cannot, and should not, tolerate the incredible burdens involved in the process of ensuring that a polygraph examination has been properly administered. If a trial court were to adequately police the reliability of stipulated results, the time required to explore the innumerable factors which could affect the accuracy of a particular test would be incalculable.\u201d); <em>Fulton </em>v. <em>State, </em>541 P.2d 871, 872 (Okla. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">In all, then, four states that at one time allowed polygraph evidence have subsequently, in light of their experiences, rethought and rejected this policy. Although not a decisive justification for our decision to retain our per se exclusionary rule, this pattern leads us to conclude that our concerns are, in fact, well founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Federal appellate courts generally grant trial judges more leeway to admit polygraph evidence than do their state counterparts, especially in the wake of <em>Daubert.</em><footnotemark><em>73</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Indeed, the majority of federal courts of appeals do not have a per se rule that polygraph evidence is inadmissible at trial. Nonetheless, most maintain that, although admission is within the discretion of the trial court, such evidence should, as a general policy, be excluded under rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has gone further than any other federal appellate court toward allowing polygraph evidence at trial in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>absence of a stipulation. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Piccinonna, </em>885 F.2d 1529 (11th Cir. 1989). In <em>Piccinonna, </em>the court summarily concluded that, while polygraphy is still \u201ca developing and inexact science,\u201d it is a sufficiently \u201cuseful and reliable scientific tool\u201d to justify its admission to impeach or corroborate the testimony of a witness at trial, even without a stipulation. Id., 1535-36. The court did emphasize, however, that \u201c[n] either of these two modifications to the per se exclusionary rule should be construed to preempt or limit in any way the trial court\u2019s discretion to exclude polygraph expert testimony on other grounds under the Federal Rules of Evidence.\u201d Id., 1536.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">District courts in the Eleventh Circuit were thus given broader license to admit polygraph evidence than were district courts in any other circuit. It is noteworthy, therefore, that they have almost unanimously declined to do so.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> In fact, only one reported district court opinion from the Eleventh Circuit has held polygraph evidence admissible at trial. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Padilla, </em>908 F. Sup. 923 (S.D. Fla. 1995). The court in <em>Padilla </em>conceded that \u201cthe polygraph examination at issue here does not have substantial probative value,\u201d but concluded nonetheless that polygraph evidence \u201cwill not disrupt the trial <em>enough </em>to conclude that its prejudicial effect substantially outweighs its probative value.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 929. Of particular note, however, is the court\u2019s acknowledgment that, butforthe existence of <em>Piccinonna, </em>it probably would have <em>excluded </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>the polygraph evidence. Id., 927 n.2. In other words, the court allowed the polygraph evidence to fulfill what it viewed as the mandate of <em>Piccinonna, </em>and not because its independent analysis was that such admission was wise or legally sound. Thus, even when presented with an opportunity to admit polygraph evidence, most district courts are decidedly reluctant to do so.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the right to compulsory process, as guaranteed under the sixth amendment to the United States constitution and as applied to the states through the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution, and also as accorded by article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution,<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> guarantees him the right to present a defense, and that the exclusion of favorable polygraph results violates that right. Consequently, the defendant asserts that, at the very least, he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing regarding the reliability of the polygraph examination. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Although an accused does, of course, have a federal constitutional right to present a defense, \u201cthe right to present relevant testimony is not without limitation.\u201d <em>Rock </em>v. <em>Arkansas, </em>483 U.S. 44, 55, 107 S.

The state presented testimony, which the jury was entitled to believe, that the damage to the defendant\u2019s house was caused by three independent and unconnected fires; that flammable liquid accelerants were present in all three locations; and that electricity did not cause any of the fires. Moreover, although not necessary in an arson prosecution, the state presented evidence of the defendant\u2019s financial motive for setting the fire. Specifically, the jury reasonably could have found that the defendant and his wife had falsified the amount and source of their income when applying for the mortgage loan to finance the purchase of the house, that the defendant\u2019s wife was unemployed and had stopped collecting unemployment benefits three months before the fire, and that the defendant and his wife had exhausted all of their savings by the time of the fire.

But see <em>Lattarulo </em>v. <em>State, </em>261 Ga. 124, 126, 401 S.E.2d 516 (1991) (even though Georgia lacks rule 702 analogue, test for admissibility of scientific evidence is \u201cwhether the procedure or technique \u2018has reached a scientific stage of verifiable certainty\u2019 \u201d); see generally J.

We note, however, that three of these states \u2014 Alabama, Illinois and Maryland \u2014 simply have not addressed the issue. See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>173 Ill. 2d 167, 670 N.E.2d 721, 731 n.3 (1996) (explicitly noting that <em>Daubert </em>issue has not yet been presented to court). Thus, only two of the states without a rule 702 analogue \u2014 New York and California \u2014 have expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>rejected <em>Daubert </em>and have retained <em>Frye. </em>See <em>People </em>v. <em>Leahy, </em>8 Cal. 4th 587, 595, 882 P.2d 321, 34 Cal.

Moreover, although California ostensibly still follows <em>Frye, </em>the California Supreme Court has implicitly recognized the imprudence of the strict \u201cgeneral acceptance\u201d standard by holding that \u201c \u2018general acceptance\u2019 does not require unanimity, a consensus of opinion, or even majority support by the scientific community.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Leahy, </em>supra, 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">In any event, we conclude that our reasons for rej ecting <em>Frye </em>and adopting a <em>Daubert </em>approach, as explained in this opinion, are valid independent of the existence of a codified rule 702 analogue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b97-11\"> See, e.g., footnotes 20 and 21 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b99-8\"> For example, commentators have argued that, depending on the desired outcome, courts applying <em>Frye </em>have \u201cdiffered on the issues of <em>who </em>constitutes the relevant community for acceptance, as well as <em>what </em>precisely that community must have approved in a given case.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) \u201cDevelopments in the Law,\u201d supra, 108 Harv.

Such testimony, even if it satisfies <em>Daubert, </em>is still subject to the requirements imposed on <em>all </em>evidence by the rules of evidence generally. In particular, scientific testimony, like all testimony, can be excluded if its prejudicial impact outweighs its probative value. See part I A and D of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b102-6\"> The examples cited throughout part I C 1 of this opinion are merely illustrative. We do not necessarily endorse the conclusions reached in these cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b103-7\"> We note that, although <em>Celia </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 998 F.2d 418, nominally applied the <em>Frye </em>standard, the court\u2019s analysis is actually more consistent with the <em>Daubert </em>multifactor approach. See id., 424-27. Indeed, <em>Celia </em>demonstrates, yet again, that the label that courts apply when assessing the admissibility of scientific evidence is often completely divorced from the substance of the analysis that they undertake.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b103-8\"> While the distinction between methodologies and conclusions is important, it is nonetheless true that the two are closely linked. It is plain that a judge\u2019s doubts about an expert\u2019s conclusions axe often based upon doubts regarding the expert\u2019s methodology. \u201cWhen a judge disagrees with the conclusions of an expert, it will generally be because he or she thinks that there is a mistake at some step in the investigative or reasoning process of that expert. If the judge thinks that the conclusions of some other expert are correct, it will likely be because the judge thinks that the methodology and reasoning process of the other expert are superior to those of the first expert.\u201d <em>In re Paoli R. Yard PCB Litigation, </em>supra, 35 F.3d 746.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b105-7\"> We also note that some scientific principles have become so well established that an explicit <em>Daubert </em>analysis is not necessary for admission of evidence thereunder. By this, we do not mean to reestablish the <em>Frye </em>general acceptance test. We do acknowledge, however, as did the Supreme Court in <em>Daubert., </em>that a very few scientific principles \u201care so firmly established as to have attained the status of scientific law, such as the laws of thermodynamics, [and that such principles] properly are subject to judicial notice . . . .\u201d <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>supra, 509 U.S. 592 n.11. Evidence derived from such principles would clearly withstand a <em>Daubert </em>analysis, and thus may be admitted simply on a showing of relevance. For example, the Supreme Court of Montana recently noted that a <em>Daubert </em>analysis would not be necessary for ordinary fingerprint identification evidence to be admissible. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cline, </em>275 Mont. 46, 55, 909 P.2d 1171 (1996). Of course, as with any other evidence, the weight that the fact finder should accord to such evidence may still be contested. Compare footnote 31 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b108-6\"> Once the validity of a scientific principle has been satisfactorily established, any remaining questions regarding the manner in which that technique was <em>applied </em>in a particular case is generally an issue of fact that goes to weight, and not admissibility. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. Porter, 618 A.2d 629, 636 (D.C. App. 1992) (\u201cany failure by the scientists to adhere to the appropriate procedure is, of course, a proper subject of inquiry,\u201d but does not bar admission of evidence); <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 889 P.2d 330 n.46 (\u201callegations of error in the testing process affect the weight of scientific . . . evidence but not its admissibility\u201d). Of course, even where questions about scientific evidence arise from concerns regarding application of a methodology, rather than the validity of the methodology itself, such evidence may still be excluded for failure to satisfy other of the rules of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Moreover, application of a methodology that is valid in the abstract can be so flawed that, in essence, a different, invalid methodology is being applied. Thus, although \u201c[n]ot every error in the application of a particular methodology should warrant exclusion [a]n alleged error in the application of a reliable methodology should provide the basis for exclusion of the opinion [when] that error negates the basis for the reliability of the principle itself.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martines, </em>3 F.3d 1191, 1198 (8th Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">For example, in <em>In re Paoli R. Yard PCB Litigation, </em>supra, 35 F.3d 717, several plaintiffs claimed that the defendant\u2019s use of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) in its railcar maintenance facility had caused various physical ailments. One witness for the plaintiffs was a physician who reviewed the medical history of all of the plaintiffs, but only personally examined two of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>them. Id., 764. After a thorough review of the physician\u2019s diagnostic technique, the Court of Appeals concluded that her basic methodology was valid. Id., 764-65. The court found, however, that this technique could not be properly applied at all in those cases where the physician did not personally examine a particular plaintiff, or with regard to particular symptoms of the plaintiffs she did examine when her inquiry into those symptoms was not sufficiently broad. Id., 764-70. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals concluded that the District Court had properly excluded much of the physician\u2019s testimony, even though the underlying methodology was valid, because the application of the methodology with regard to many of the plaintiffs was sufficiently flawed as to eliminate completely its reliability. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">It is important to note, however, the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that, in those instances where the physician\u2019s inquiry into a patient\u2019s condition <em>had been </em>sufficient, it was an abuse of discretion for the trial court to exclude her testimony. Id., 765-67. Even though the physician was of \u201cdubious expertise\u201d; id., 765; such concerns did not render her underlying methodology per se invalid, and once that validity had been established, concerns about her qualifications went to her credibility, not to the admissibility of her testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b111-5\"> Even under <em>Frye, </em>however, \u201cgeneral acceptance,\u201d and thus scientific validity, was often determined by reference to acceptance among judges, not scientists. \u201cContrary to the assertion . . . that the <em>Frye </em>test places the responsibility of determining scientific validity upon scientists, in practice too many courts reference reported case law to determine what is generally accepted in the scientific community.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Alberico, </em>supra, 861 P.2d 203.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b111-6\"> Indeed, this concern motivated the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, on remand in <em>Daubert, </em>to offer the following comment regarding the new <em>Daubert </em>standard: \u201c[Tjhough we are largely untrained in science and certainly no match for any of the witnesses whose testimony we are reviewing, it is our responsibility to determine whether those experts\u2019 proposed testimony amounts to \u2018scientific knowledge,\u2019 constitutes \u2018good science,\u2019 and was \u2018derived by the scientific method.\u2019 . . . Our responsibility, then ... is to resolve disputes among respected, well-credentialed scientists about matters squarely within their expertise, in areas where there is no scientific consensus as to what is and what is not \u2018good science,\u2019 and occasionally to reject such expert testimony because it was not \u2018derived by the scientific method.\u2019 Mindful of our position in the hierarchy of the federal judiciary, we take a deep breath and proceed with this heady task.\u201d <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>supra, 43 F.3d 1316.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b113-7\"> Most courts agree that evidence of both the results of a polygraph test and of a witness\u2019 willingness to take a polygraph test implicate the same concerns and should be treated alike. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Webber, </em>260 Kan. 263, 276, 918 P.2d 609 (1996). Admittedly, even if the polygraph test itself lacks evidentiary value, an individual\u2019s willingness to undergo such a test might have some probative value so long as the subject believed in the test\u2019s efficacy. Such willingness may also indicate, however, that the witness knows about the test\u2019s weaknesses or is simply willing to take his or her chances. We conclude that a witness\u2019 willingness to take a test of questionable validity is itself of limited probative value. Accordingly, all references in this opinion to \u201cpolygraph evidence\u201d refer to evidence of both the substantive results of polygraph tests and of a witness\u2019 willingness to take such tests.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b113-8\"> Indeed, concerns regarding the polygraph\u2019s prejudicial impact have historically been the primary basis upon which this court has excluded polygraph evidence.

A review of our cases excluding polygraph evidence, however, reveals that the polygraph\u2019s unreliability and prejudicial impact, and not reliance on the <em>Frye </em>standard, were the principal motivating factors behind the decisions. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>169 Conn. 161, 170, 362 A.2d 808 (1975) (polygraph evidence inadmissible because unreliable, and because \u201c[c]redibility as an issue is committed to the sole determination of the trier of fact\u201d); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 831 (polygraph evidence inadmissible because of \u201c[t]he questionable accuracy of polygraph tests\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Duntz, </em>223 Conn. 207, 238, 613 A.2d 224 (1992) (polygraph evidence inadmissible \u201c[d]ue to the questionable accuracy of the results of polygraph examinations\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Plourde, </em>208 Conn. 455, 471, 545 A.2d 1071 (1988), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 1034, 109 S.

The guilty knowledge test \u201cdoes not attempt to determine whether the [subject] is lying but, rather, whether he or she possesses guilty knowledge, that is, whether the [subject] recognizes the correct answers, from among several equally plausible but incorrect alternatives, to certain questions relating t,o a crime. For example, escaping through an alley a bank robber drops and leaves behind his hat. A likely suspect is later apprehended and, while attached to the polygraph, he is interrogated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">\u201c1. \u2018The robber in this case dropped something while escaping.

Was it: a weapon? a face mask? a sack of money? his hat? his car keys?\u2019 . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">\u201cUnlike the control question test, the accuracy of the guilty knowledge test does not depend upon the nature or degree of the subject\u2019s emotional concern. The physiological variables employed are not intended to measure emotional response but, rather, to signal the cognitive processes involved in the recognition of the correct alternative.\u201d D.

Tarantino, supra, \u00a7 6.13, p. 219. Advocates claim that the primary advantage of the guilty knowledge test is that recognition can be more directly measured by physiological data than can truth or deception. D.

[Two examiners] had forty-eight prison inmates tested in a mock crime situation. It was understood that each participant\u2019s bonus of $20 would be withheld if more than ten of the forty-eight subjects failed the polygraph test. Moreover, the names of inmates failing the test would be posted in the prison for all to see. The intent was to make both \u2018guilty\u2019 and \u2018innocent\u2019 subjects believe that, if they failed the test, they might be blamed by their fellow inmates for the loss of the $20, a considerable sum by prison standards. That this manipulation was successful is suggested by the fact that several inmates expressed their concern about the consequences of failing and a few actually declined to participate for that reason. Two skilled and experienced examiners administered control question tests and all charts were independently scored by both examiners. . . . [0]nly thirty of the forty-eight subjects were correctly classified. Excluding inconclusive tests, there were 13 percent false negative errors and 44 percent of the \u2018innocent\u2019 inmates were misclassified as deceptive.\u201d D. Lykken, \u201cThe Case Against Polygraph Testing,\u201d supra, p. 115.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"53\">\n<p id=\"b130-7\"> The term \u201cbase rate\u201d refers to the prevalence of a condition among the relevant tested population. In the context of the polygraph test, the base rate is the percentage of people who submit to a polygraph exam who are, in fact, deceptive on the exam. If, out of every 100 people who take a polygraph test, we could empirically demonstrate that fifty are, in fact, giving deceptive responses, then the base rate of deception would be 50 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">The base rate is important because it can greatly accentuate the impact of the false positive and false negative rates arising from any given specificity and sensitivity values. If one assumes base rates progressively higher than 50 percent, then, by definition, the number of deceptive examinees increases and the number of honest examinees decreases. A logical consequence is that, even holding specificity and sensitivity rates constant, as the base rate increases the number of false negatives (the labeling of deceptive subjects as truthful) also rises and the number of false positives (the labeling of truthful subjects as deceptive) falls, because only deceptive subjects produce false negatives and only truthful subjects produce false positives. Likewise, if one were to assume base rates progressively lower than 50 percent, then, even holding sensitivity and specificity constant, as the base rate falls the number of false positives will necessarily rise and the number of false negatives will fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">For example, a very low base rate would dramatically emphasize the problem of false positives, even if sensitivity and specificity were both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>relatively high. Suppose that, the polygraph has a sensitivity of 90 percent (and thus a false negative rate of 10 percent) and a specificity of 80 percent (and thus a false positive rate of 20 percent), and that the base rate of deception is 10 percent. If 100 subjects are tested, then the 10 percent base rate signifies that ten subjects are deceptive and ninety are truthful. Given the specificity of 80 percent, seventy-two of the ninety truthful subjects will be labeled accurately as truthful (80 percent of ninety is seventy-two); the remaining eighteen truthful subjects will be mislabeled as deceptive due to the 20 percent false positive rate. Similarly, given the sensitivity of 90 percent, nine of the. ten deceptive subjects will be labeled accurately as deceptive (90 percent of ten is nine); the remaining deceptive subject will be mislabeled as truthful due to the 10 percent false negative rate. These results can be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Innocent Guilty</p>\n<p id=\"ABR\">Pass 72 1</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">Fail 18 9</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">\u201cA hundred people are tested: 81 percent are correctly classified; 90 percent of the guilty fail; 80 percent of the innocent pass.

Assuming an 89 percent sensitivity, a 91 percent specificity and a base rate of 50 percent, the predictive value positive of the polygraph test is only 91 percent and the predictive value negative is only 89 percent. In other words, approximately one out of every ten polygraph examinations would still mislabel the subject</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">We emphasize, moreover, that Raskin himself has never advocated assessing the validity of the polygraph examination solely by the use of laboratory data, without reference to field studies. Indeed, for the reasons set forth by the polygraph critics, we are persuaded that it would be reversible error for a trial court to follow such a procedure. Furthermore, to the extent that the previously mentioned figures may appear impressive to some, it is important to remember that, even if one does believe that use of laboratory derived values for sensitivity and specificity is appropriate, the assumed base rate of 50 percent underlying the calculations has essentially no empirical support.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"57\">\n<p id=\"b134-6\"> But see D. Lykken, supra, 27 Jurimetrics J. 267 (\u201cAs it happens, there is a simple, easily learned technique with which a guilty person can \u2018beat\u2019 the control question test. In one informal prison study, twenty-seven inmates accused of violating prison rules were given some fifteen minutes of instruction in this method [by a fellow inmate, based on information provided by Lykken] before reporting for a test concerned with the alleged infraction.

This is certainly a more honest approach, but we nonetheless recognize that, in the context of trial testimony, the message conveyed to the jury by both styles of testimony would be the same. Furthermore, altering the technical format of the evidence does not alter the general balance between its probative value and prejudicial impact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"60\">\n<p id=\"b136-9\"> By contrast, we allow expert testimony as to the general behavior patterns of battered women and sexual assault victims, even though such testimony also implicates witness credibility, specifically because such mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>ters are <em>not </em>within the understanding and personal knowledge of the average juror.

Ten jurors responded to a mailed questionnaire regarding their reaction to the polygraph evidence submitted in that case.

Nonetheless, more recent studies, although inconclusive, do not dispel the fear that juries will give undue weight to polygraph results. Each of eight jurors interviewed after the conclusion of a federal drug case, for example, indicated that, in a close case, the polygraph tests standing by themselves would be sufficient to raise reasonable doubt.

In another study, one quarter of the jurors in a mock trial competition indicated that they would change their votes if contrary polygraph evidence that was stated to be 95 percent accurate were presented to them, while another one quarter stated they were uncertain what they would do. S. Carlson, M. Pasano &amp; J. Jannuzzo, supra, 5 J. Police Sci. &amp; Admin. 152; see also A. Markwart &amp; B. Lynch, \u201cThe Effect of Polygraph Evidence on Mock Jury Decision-Making,\u201d 7 J.

Heslegrave, \u201cThe Admissibility of Polygraph Evidence in Court: Some Empirical Findings,\u201d 4 Law &amp; Hum. Behav. 117 (1980). In one experiment discussed therein, 52 percent of mock jurors in a control group found a defendant \u201cguilty\u201d based on a written fact pattern, whereas only 28 percent found the defendant \u201cguilty\u201d when exculpatory polygraph evidence with a stated accuracy of 80 percent was added. Id., 121,123. A cautionary statement by the judge in the fact pattern regarding the limitations of polygraph reliability somewhat mitigated the effect of polygraph evidence. Id., 123, 128. A second study demonstrated, however, that when an antipolygraph expert was added to the fact pattern, who testified that polygraph results should be treated \u201cwith skepticism,\u201d the effect of the polygraph evidence was almost completely eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">Given the limited number and scope of the extant studies, and the equivocal conclusions thereof, definitive contentions that jurors will blindly follow polygraph evidence; see, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>526 F.2d 161, 169 (8th Cir. 1975); or that they will not; C. Honts &amp; M. Perry, supra, 16 Law &amp; Hum. Behav. 366; seem equally unfounded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"63\">\n<p id=\"b139-9\"> It is interesting to note that critics of the <em>Frye </em>rule and critics of polygraph exclusion in general have on occasion asserted Frye\u2019s factual innocence as part of their arguments. \u201cThe premise appears to be that if, in truth, Frye was innocent of the crime charged, then the rule in the case is the culprit, for it permitted an innocent man to be convicted when science was ready and able to exonerate him. In the absence of the <em>Frye </em>court\u2019s parochial, constraining attitude toward the efficacy of scientific evidence, or so the proponents of this position seem to say, an innocent man would not have been unjustly convicted of murder and punished for it.\u201d J.

Thus, authors have at various times asserted that someone else confessed to the murder for which Frye was convicted; see, e.g., W. Wicker, \u201cThe Polygraphic Truth Test and the Law of Evidence,\u201d 22 Tenn. L. Rev. 711, 715 (1953); and that Frye was thereafter pardoned. See, e.g., P. Giannelli, supra, 80 Colum. L. Rev. 1204 n.42.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">Subsequent scholarship has demonstrated, however, that both the third party confession and the pardon arising therefrom are nothing more than \u201cfolklore,\u201d and that, in fact, Frye served eighteen years in jail before being paroled. See generally J. Stairs, supra, 27 J. Forensic Sci. 690, 692. Moreover, even if Frye had, in fact, been innocent, we conclude, for the reasons discussed in the text of this opinion, that the court in <em>Frye </em>was nonetheless correct to exclude the sphygmomanometer evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"64\">\n<p id=\"b142-7\"><em> </em>Asking questions such as those used in the present case, involving such phrases as \u201cdo you know for sure,\u201d renders answers \u201cchimerical\u201d at best. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kwong, </em>supra, 69 F.3d 668.

Sup. 877. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals had only addressed the question of polygraph admissibility before <em>Daubert </em>had been released; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Soundingsides, </em>820 F.2d 1232, 1241-42 (10th Cir. 1987); so the court in <em>Galbreth </em>felt free to formulate its own standard. The court accepted that <em>Daubert </em>provided the proper threshold standard; id., 878; and then relied largely on testimony by Raskin to conclude that polygraph evidence satisfied <em>Daubert </em>and rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. Id., 895. Although the court in <em>Galbreth </em>did address many of the concerns that have motivated us to retain our per se rule of exclusion, it did so by recounting only the most propolygraph studies and information. Id., 885-93. We believe that a more balanced review of the polygraph literature, such as we have conducted in the present case, reveals substantially more uncertainty regarding the effectiveness and prejudicial impact of the polygraph test than the court in <em>Galbreth </em>acknowledged.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">The defendant also relies heavily on <em>United States </em>v. <em>Crumby, </em>895 F. Sup. 1354 (D. Ariz. 1995). The court in <em>Crumby </em>held that, in light of <em>Daubert, </em>a reevaluation of the admissibility of polygraph evidence was required. Id., 1358. The court concluded, moreover, that with the proper safeguards, polygraph evidence should be permitted regarding a testifying defendant\u2019s credibility. Id., 1363.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">Putting aside the question of the relevance of <em>Crumby </em>to the present case, in which the defendant did <em>not </em>testify, we find <em>Crumby </em>unpersuasive to the extent that it specifically argues that the probative value of polygraph evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect. First, based largely on the testimony of Raskin, the court concluded that the control question test has great probative value. Id., 1361. It is unclear from the opinion, however, whether the court\u2019s validity assessment referred to the polygraph\u2019s sensitivity and specificity, or to the more relevant predictive positive and predictive negative values. Regardless, our review of the literature leads us to a contrary conclusion. See generally part II B of this opinion. Second, the court in <em>Crumby </em>disputed the severity of the prejudicial impact from polygraph evidence. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Crumby, </em>supra, 895 F. Sup. 1361. The court in <em>Crumby </em>rejected the argument that the evidence would consume too much time at trial, opining that as polygraph evidence becomes more established, standards will develop, and so time spent reviewing this evidence will decrease. Id., 1362. Experience in Massachusetts and Wisconsin, among other states, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>indicates otherwise, as noted previously. The court also flatly denied that juries will be unduly influenced by polygraph evidence. Id. Although the court may be right on this point, the matter is not as clear as the opinion suggests.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"77\">\n<p id=\"b153-9\"> Because the defendant has failed to provide any independent analysis under the state constitution, we limit our review to the federal constitution. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dyson, </em>238 Conn. 784, 794, 680 A.2d 1306 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>232 Conn. 740, 744 n.4, 657 A.2d 611 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"78\">\n<p id=\"b153-10\"> Some authorities have argued that <em>Rock </em>provides a \u201cstrong constitutional impetus\u201d for polygraph admission.

For, as a matter of logic, there can be no constitutional right to an evidentiary hearing regarding evidence that, as a matter of law, is inadmissible. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>41 Conn. App. 255, 262-64, 675 A.2d 887, cert. granted, 237 Conn. 931, 677 A.2d 1372 (1996). Given our conclusion that, as a matter of law, the prejudicial impact of polygraph evidence outweighs any possible probative value, we fail to see why the defendant is entitled to a hearing on this topic, or what function such a hearing could serve. In this connection, we simply disagree with the majority opinion in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scheffer, </em>44 M.J. 442 (C.M.A. 1996), on which the dissent herein relies, and agree with the dissent in <em>Scheffer </em>that the sixth amendment right to confrontation is not violated by a per se evidentiary rule barring the admissibility of polygraph evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">The dissent sets forth two scenarios to support its underlying position <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>that, despite the polygraph\u2019s questionable validity, we should abandon our per se rule against admitting polygraph evidence at trial. First, the dissent claims that minority criminal defendants are so disadvantaged by the problems attendant to cross-racial identifications that, essentially, it is only fair to allow these defendants to present exculpatory polygraph results. This court has specifically rejected the notion of special treatment for defendants in cross-racial identification situations, however, holding that the mere fact that a defendant is of a different race than a witness does not entitle the defendant to a special instruction on eyewitness identification at trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cerilli, </em>222 Conn. 556, 571-72, 610 A.2d 1130 (1992). Similarly, the mere fact that a witness and a defendant may be of different races does not warrant admitting evidence that, whatever the races of the trial participants, is of very questionable probative value and is highly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">The dissent also asserts that our per se exclusionary rule may lead to the death penalty being imposed on an innocent defendant. Due to the prejudicial nature of polygraph evidence and its lack of probative value, we have concluded that polygraph evidence is inadmissible in any judicial proceeding <em>which is subject to the rules of evidence. </em>It would make little sense to subject such proceedings \u2014 which are part of the trial process, even when they are conducted separately \u2014 to the minimal validity and great prejudice of polygraph evidence that we determine is inappropriate for the trial itself. As the dissent is well aware, however, the rules of evidence simply do not apply to the presentation of mitigating factors during the penalty phase of a capital case. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-46a (c); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>230 Conn. 183, 268, 646 A.2d 1318 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1165, 115 S. Ct. 1133, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1095 (1995) (\u201c[o]n its face, [\u00a7 53a-46a (c)] authorizes a judge presiding over a penalty hearing to exclude mitigating evidence <em>only </em>on the basis of a lack of relevancy\u201d [emphasis in original]). Consequently, the per se rule that we articulate today is not a bar to the introduction of polygraph evidence during the penalty phase of a capital case pursuant to \u00a7 53a-46a (c). Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bartholomew, </em>101 Wash. 2d 631, 646, 683 P.2d 1079 (1981) (polygraph evidence admissible by defense at sentencing phase of capital case). Thus, with respect to court proceedings to which the rules of evidence do not apply, such as the sentencing phase of a capital case, or sentencing proceedings generally, we adopt no blanket rule regarding the admissibility of polygraph evidence, and leave that question to a case in which there has been a claim that the trial court has abused its discretion in either admitting or precluding such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Moreover, the dissenter\u2019s inference that we have \u201cattempt[ed] to allay [his] concerns by suggesting that polygraph evidence is admissible\u201d in the penalty phase of a capital case is misguided. We are not engaged in the process of \u201callaying\u201d the dissenter\u2019s \u201cconcerns,\u201d nor do we endorse the judicial psychoanalysis by which he draws such an inference.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"81\">\n<p id=\"b155-9\"> See part II of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"82\">\n<p id=\"b156-6\"> For example, we recognize that a modification of the control question test, the \u201cdirected lie control question test,\u201d has been developed over the past few years. Indeed, the results from the latter test have been admitted in at least one case. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Galbreth, </em>supra, 908 F. Sup. 877. \u201cThe basic rationale of the [directed lie control question test] is similar to that of the [control question test]. Subjects are asked direct accusatory relevant questions. Physiological responses to the relevant questions are evaluated against the physiological response to comparison questions. However, in the [directed lie control question test] the comparison questions are known lies.\u201d C. Honts &amp; B. Quick, supra, 71 N.D. L. Rev. 1001-1002. \u201c[T]he subject [is] asked a question like, \u2018Before 1994, did you ever tell even one lie in your entire life?\u2019 . . . The subject [is then] instructed to answer this question on the test with a lie, and [is also] instructed to: think of a specific incident of lying and to pay close attention to his or her physiological responses. . . . Subjects are told that it is important that they respond appropriately when lying and that if they fail to do so the test will be inconclusive. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 1002 n.93. \u201cThe rationale of the [directed lie control question test] predicts that guilty subjects will respond with greater physiological responses to the relevant questions while innocent subjects will respond with greater responses to the directed lie questions.\u201d Id., 1002.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The directed lie control question test has been praised both because it allows for standardization of the pretest interviews and control questions; id.; and because it is less intrusive than the traditional control question test. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Galbreth, </em>supra, 908 F. Sup. 885. Moreover, such limited studies as have been conducted indicate that the directed lie control question test might produce somewhat fewer false positives than the traditional control question test. See, e.g., C. Honts &amp; D. Raskin, \u201cA Field Study of the Validity of the Directed Lie Control Question,\u201d 16 J. Police Sci. &amp; Admin. 56, 60 (1988).

The court today retains a per se rale that bars from evidence the results of a polygraph test under any circumstances. This per se rale infringes on the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to present a defense. The significance \u2014 and indeed the absurdity \u2014 of this rale barring polygraph evidence under any circumstances is demonstrated by hypothesizing the following factual scenario. A defendant is accused of a capital felony subject to the death penalty and the only issue is one of identification \u2014 that is, whether he was incorrectly identified by a witness as the perpetrator of the crime. The defendant submits to a properly administered polygraph examination that indicates that he is telling the truth when he says that he did not kill the victim. He also submits to a polygraph examination administered by the state that confirms the truthfulness of his statement that he was not the perpetrator. Notwithstanding the results of these two polygraph tests, the state continues with its prosecution of the defendant because of the strong identification testimony of its sole eyewitness. The thought of executing a person found guilty under these circumstances would shock anyone\u2019s conscience,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> whether the poly<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>graph is 91 percent or merely 59 percent accurate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cThe quintessential miscarriage of justice is the execution of a person who is entirely innocent.\u201d <em>Schlup </em>v. <em>Delo, </em>513 U.S. 298, 324-25, 115 S. Ct. 851, 130 L. Ed. 2d 808 (1995). This per se rule of the court collides with the \u201c \u2018fundamental value determination of our society,\u2019 given voice in Justice Harlan\u2019s concurrence in <em>Winship, </em>that \u2018it is far worse to convict an innocent man than to let a guilty man go free.\u2019 \u201d <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>471 U.S. 307, 313, 105 S.

Furthermore, it is well known that the frailties of eyewitness identification are not limited to cross-racial identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">In this case, the defendant sought a hearing before the trial court in order to demonstrate the validity of the polygraph test results he sought to introduce. The trial court, relying upon our failure to adopt <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1993), for the admission of scientific evidence and assuming that we would continue to adhere to the antiquated rule of <em>Frye </em>v. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>States, 293 F. 1013 (D.C. Cir. 1923), rejected the defendant\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing. The trial court in the present case stated that it was \u201conly a trial level court\u201d and that an \u201cappellate court [must] direct a trial court like this court to have [a] hearing.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the defendant sought before the trial court the very procedure that we subsequently indicated should be followed in a recent opinion authored by Justice Borden in <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>235 Conn. 802, 832-33, 670 A.2d 301 (1996). In <em>Esposito, </em>we sent the strong message that in order \u201c [t] o create a record sufficient to allow this court to consider altering the long-standing Connecticut law barring polygraph evidence, the defendant bore the burden of demonstrating that traditional reasons for the rule are no longer applicable. Even under the <em>Daubert </em>rule, the evidence must be shown to be relevant and reliable to be admissible. . . . <em>[T]he defendant bore the burden of creating a factual record before the trial court that the polygraph test possesses sufficient reliability to justify its introduction as scientific evi</em>dence.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis added.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The majority of this court, instead of predicating its decision on a factual record, today decides as a matter of law that the polygraph, under any circumstances, does not have sufficient validity for the results of the test to be admissible into evidence. There are two procedural problems underlying the majority\u2019s conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>that have constitutional implications. First, the defendant was never given an opportunity to either develop the factual basis for his claim, or, equally important, an opportunity to argue the validity of an appropriately administered polygraph. This court, on its own, contrary to <em>Dauberl, </em>which we embrace today, delves into the literature on the subject and decides that the polygraph does not have a sufficiently high level of validity and, therefore, determines that its prejudicial impact outweighs its probative value. Second, we did not certify that issue on appeal from the Appellate Court. Rather, we certified two issues: (1) whether the defendant had the right to an evidentiary hearing, on the issue of whether the polygraph evidence was admissible; and (2) whether we should adopt <em>Dauberl </em>for the admissibility of scientific evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>236 Conn. 908, 670 A.2d 1308 (1996). In view of the certified issues, neither the state nor the defendant addresses the validity and reliability of a properly administered polygraph examination. Without giving the defendant an opportunity to demonstrate the scientific underpinnings and the accuracy of the polygraph, this court not only deprives the defendant of his constitutional right to present a defense,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but also his right to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner \u2014 both rights which, of course, are at the core of due process under the federal and state constitutions. <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Manzo, </em>380 U.S. 545, 552, 85 S.

Incredibly, not content to bar polygraph evidence from criminal trials, the court today in one sweep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>ing sentence in a footnote also adopts a per se rule excluding polygraph evidence in civil trials.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">First, it is important that the issues in this case be placed in the context of the evidence presented at the defendant\u2019s trial. The defendant was charged with arson for a fire that destroyed his home on July 20, 1992. The defendant and his wife had moved into their new residence in September, 1991, and had extensively renovated the house. During the defendant\u2019s trial, his wife testified that an area of the living room, which was identified as one of the sources of the fire, was primed and painted the day before the fire occurred. On the day of the fire, the defendant, his wife and their child smelled smoke and observed a haze in the house. The three of them then went to a neighbor\u2019s house across the street. The defendant returned to the family home and emptied a fire extinguisher on the electrical panel in the basement, the location from which the defendant observed smoke originating. The defendant then returned to the neighbor\u2019s house and telephoned his brother-in-law, a licensed electrician, for advice. A fire subsequently consumed the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">The deputy fire marshall for the city of Norwich, who testified as a state\u2019s witness, was aware that there were items such as paint thinner, turpentine, aerosol cans, jelly substances and other flammable items used in the painting of the interior of the home during the time that the fire occurred. The deputy fire marshall testified that he found three points of origin of fire, but that he had no opinion as to the source of the <em>ignition </em>of the fire. He also testified that he never considered electrical arcing<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> as a potential source of ignition of the fire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>because no one communicated to him that there was such electrical arcing in the house. While the firefighters were tending to the fire, however, the electricity in the house was not shut off and other witnesses observed electrical arcing.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The deputy fire marshall identified a floor lamp, contained in a photograph admitted as a state\u2019s exhibit, that was near a couch located in one of the three points of origin of the fire. Although the fire marshall testified that electrical arcing can cause fires, he failed to have the lamp or the electrical outlet dismantled and tested in order to determine if either of those were the source of the ignition of the fire. Indeed, the defendant\u2019s attorney elicited testimony on cross-examination of the deputy fire marshall that the bum pattern on the lamp was inconsistent with his theory of where the fire started and that he had no explanation for such an inconsistency. In addition, he testified that if a fire is caused by an electrical arc, neither he nor any one else trained in the field of fire investigation would be able to determine the contact between an appliance and the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">At the trial, the defendant\u2019s homeowner\u2019s insurance agent indicated that the home was underinsured by approximately $48,000 at the time of the fire. The insur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>anee agent also testified that an increase in insurance was due to go into effect on August 30,1992, one month and ten days after the fire. Previous to the fire, the home was evaluated by the insurance company to have been in excellent condition with many renovations having been made. The renovations included new kitchen cabinets, tiled bathrooms, electrical plugs and painted walls, and new carpeting was set to arrive a week after the fire occurred. A certified public accountant testified that the defendant and his wife were current with their bills and had even prepaid their mortgage at the time of the fire. The accountant also testified that the defendant and his wife had invested most of their life savings into the renovation of their home. There were no eyewitnesses to the start of the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The defendant did not testify on his own behalf, but his sworn statement to the police, concerning the denial of his participation in setting the fire and the circumstances surrounding the fire, was introduced into evidence by the state. The defendant submitted to a polygraph examination on January 27, 1993, which was administered by Leighton R. Hammond,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> a certified polygraphist and president of the Associated Detective Bureau, Inc. The defendant, well before the trial commenced, filed a pretrial motion to admit the results of a polygraph examination that he had taken. In the opinion of Hammond, the defendant was telling the truth when he answered that he neither set the fire nor knew if anyone else had purposely set the fire. Although there was sufficient time to order the defendant to submit to a polygraph examination from an expert retained by the state, as a condition for the admission of the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>polygraph test results, the trial court, after argument, denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a hearing regarding the admissibility of the polygraph examination. As evidenced by the above facts, the defendant\u2019s credibility was crucial to his defense in light of the fact that the state\u2019s case was paper-thin. Indeed, the jury agreed that the state failed to prove the fire was started by the defendant for the purpose of collecting insurance proceeds by finding him not guilty on the first count of the information, which alleged a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-111 (a) (3).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Rather, the jury found him guilty on the second count of starting a fire under circumstances in which a firefighter was subjected to substantial risk of bodily injury in violation of \u00a7 53a-111 (a) (4).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The defendant was sentenced to imprisonment for a period of seventeen years, execution suspended after twelve years.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">I agree with the majority that for the admissibility of scientific evidence we should abandon the <em>Frye </em>test and adopt the general principles of <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>supra, 509 U.S. 579. Under <em>Daubert, </em>the scientific evidence need not be generally accepted by the scientific community; rather, the scientific evidence must be relevant and reliable. Id., 594-95. <em>In Daubert, </em>the court delineated certain considerations, although not an exhaustive checklist, in order to guide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>trial courts through their evaluation of the admissibility of scientific evidence: (1) whether the theory or technique can be, or has been, tested; (2) whether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer review and publication, although publication (which is one element of peer review) is not an indispensable condition; (3) the known or potential rate of error and the existence and maintenance of standards controlling the technique\u2019s operation; and (4) whether the theory or technique possesses general acceptance within the scientific community. Id., 592-95. The Supreme Court also stated that \u201c[t]he inquiry ... is, we emphasize, a flexible one. Its overarching subject is the scientific validity \u2014 and thus the evidentiary relevance and reliability \u2014 of the principles that underlie a proposed submission. The focus, of course, must be solely on principles and methodology, not on the conclusions that they generate.\u201d Id., 594-95. If the trial court determines that the scientific evidence is relevant and reliable, then the <em>trial court </em>must determine whether to exclude the evidence because its probative value is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect, or whether the scientific evidence will confuse the issues or mislead the jury. Id., 595. In other words, as the majority states it, a trial judge should deem scientific evidence inadmissible \u201conly when the methodology underlying such evidence is sufficiently invalid to render the evidence incapable of helping the fact finder determine a fact in dispute.\u201d In exercising this discretion, the trial court, however, must take into account the defendant\u2019s right to present a defense under the sixth amendment to the federal constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the state constitution.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Our conclusion today that <em>Daubert </em>is the correct standard for determining the admissibility of scientific evidence requires, as I shall subsequently point out, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>trial courts determine on a case-by-case basis whether polygraph evidence is admissible. Indeed, the <em>Daubert </em>standard will have the salutary effect of opening the door to a new vista of scientific evidence in order to achieve justice.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">In my view, there is substantial authority that would at least justify affording the defendant an opportunity to have a hearing regarding the admissibility of the polygraph evidence. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Piccinonna, </em>885 F.2d 1529 (11th Cir. 1989), the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, sitting en banc, abandoned the per se exclusionary rule regarding polygraph evidence, even before <em>Daubert </em>was decided.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u201cSince the <em>Frye </em>decision, tremendous advances have been made in polygraph instrumentation and technique.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Better equip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>ment is being used by more adequately trained polygraph administrators. Further, polygraph tests are used extensively by government agencies. Field investigative agencies such as the FBI, the Secret Service, military intelligence and law enforcement agencies use the polygraph. Thus, even under a strict adherence to the traditional <em>Frye </em>standard, we believe it is no longer accurate to state <em>categorically </em>that polygraph testing lacks general acceptance for use in all circumstances. For this reason, we find it appropriate to <em>reexamine the per se exclusionary rule and institute a [new] rule more in keeping with the progress made in the polygraph field.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 1532.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">\u201cThere is no question that in recent years polygraph testing has gained increasingly widespread acceptance as a useful and rehable scientific tool. Because of the advances that have been achieved in the field which have led to the greater use of the polygraph examination, coupled with a lack of evidence that juries are unduly swayed by polygraph evidence, we agree with those courts which have found that a per se rule disallowing polygraph evidence is no longer warranted. Of course, polygraphy is a developing and inexact science, and we continue to believe it inappropriate to allow the admission of polygraph evidence in all situations in which more proven types of expert testimony are allowed. However, as Justice Potter Stewart <em>wrote, 'any rule that impedes the discovery of truth in a court of law impedes as well the doing of justice.\u2019\u2019 Hawkins </em>v. <em>United States, </em>358 U.S. 74, 81, 79 S. Ct. 136, 140, 3 L. Ed. 2d 125 (1958) [Stewart, J., concurring]. Thus, we believe the best approach in this area is one which balances the need to admit all relevant and reliable evidence against the danger that the admission of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>evidence for a given purpose will be unfairly prejudicial.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Piccinonna, </em>supra, 885 F.2d 1535.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">Indeed, in a recent unanimous decision, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit abandoned the per se rale against the admissibility of polygraph evidence. <em>\u201cDaubert </em>holds that it is the trial judge\u2019s task, rather than [an appellate court\u2019s task], to conduct the initial weighing of probative value against prejudicial effect. Accordingly, we hold that <em>Daubert </em>also overruled any per se rale [in the Ninth Circuit] that unstipulated polygraph evidence is always inadmissible under [r]ule 403 [of the Federal Rules of Evidence].<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Requiring the trial judge to conduct the [r]ule 403 analysis is consistent with the law of other circuits. \u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cordoba, </em>104 F.3d 225, 228 (9th Cir. 1997); see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Posado, </em>57 F.3d 428, 433-34 (5th Cir. 1995) (\u201cAfter <em>Daubert, </em>a per se rale is not viable. . . . Remaining controversy about test accuracy is almost unanimously attributed to variations in the integrity of the testing environment and the qualifications of the examiner. . . . We merely remove the obstacle of the per se rale against admissibility, which was based on antiquated concepts about the technical ability of the polygraph and legal precepts that have been expressly overruled by the Supreme Court.\u201d [Citations omitted.]);<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pettigrew, </em>77 F.3d 1500 (5th Cir. 1996) (reaffirming elimination of per se rale in <em>Posado); United States </em>v. <em>Pulido, </em>69 F.3d 192, 205 (7th Cir. 1995) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>(\u201c[t]his court has persistently refused to adopt [a per se rule against admissibility of polygraphs], choosing rather to leave the decision on admissibility to the sound discretion of the district court\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sherlin, </em>67 F.3d 1208 (6th Cir. 1995) (acknowledging <em>Daubert </em>as standard for admissibility of polygraph evidence but holding that decision to exclude polygraph evidence rests within sound discretion of District Court); <em>McMorris </em>v. <em>Israel, </em>643 F.2d 458 (7th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 967, 102 S.

Likewise, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has indicated that it is ready to reconsider the admissibility of polygraph evidence; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Toth, </em>91 F.3d 136 (4th Cir. 1996) (decided without published opinion), No. 95-5191, 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 19017, *12-14 (implying that, in appropriate case, polygraph evidence will be reconsidered in light of <em>Daubert, </em>Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Posado, </em>and Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>PiccinonmT)-, </em>and the Eighth Circuit has also implied that it will reconsider the admissibility of polygraph evidence. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>95 F.3d 723, 728-30 (8th Cir. 1996) (implying that nonstipulated polygraph evidence may be admissible under <em>Daubert, </em>but that District Court has discretion to exclude the evidence under rule 403).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The only federal circuit in which the Court of Appeals, or the district courts within the circuit, have not abrogated or rejected a per se rule is the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Skeens, </em>494 F.2d 1050, 1053 (D.C. Cir. 1974). The decision in <em>Skeens, </em>however, dates back to 1974, more than eighteen years before <em>Daubert, </em>and that, of course, was the Circuit Court of Appeals that originally promulgated the <em>Frye </em>test back in 1923. See id., 1053 (\u201cThe leading case in this Circuit [regarding the admissibility of polygraph tests] is <em>Frye. . . . </em>This case has been followed uniformly in this and other Circuits and there has never been any successful challenge to it in any federal court.\u201d [Citation omitted.]). In addition, the First Circuit, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Black, 78 </em>F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1996), stated that \u201cthe results of polygraph examinations are <em>generally </em>inadmissible . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis added.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>This appears not to be a per se rule, but, notwithstanding, <em>Black </em>relied on a Sixth Circuit case for the proposition that polygraph test results are generally inadmissible. See id., citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scarborough, </em>43 F.3d 1021, 1026 (6th Cir. 1994). Even the Sixth Circuit, however, as noted previously, no longer follows that rule. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sherlin, </em>supra, 67 F.3d 1216-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Thus, six federal Circuit Courts of Appeals (Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Ninth, Eleventh and the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces) and federal district courts in two other circuits (Second and Tenth) no longer apply a per se rule excluding polygraph evidence; three federal Circuit Courts of Appeals (Second, Fourth and Eighth) have either indicated a willingness to review the admissibility in a proper case or implicitly indicated that it was admissible. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has not addressed the issue of polygraph admissibility. As the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit just recently pointed out, \u201ccircuits that have not yet permitted evidence of polygraph results for any purpose are now in the decided minority.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Toth, </em>supra, 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 19017, *13.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">In addition, state courts<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> have ruled that polygraph evidence is admissible in varying situations.

Notwithstanding our adoption of <em>Daubert </em>in this case, the majority then completely ignores the underpinnings of <em>Daubert. </em>In <em>Daubert, </em>the United States Supreme Court held: \u201cFaced with a proffer of expert scientific testimony . . . the <em>trial judge must determine at the outset . . . </em>whether the expert is proposing to testily to (1) scientific knowledge that (2) will assist the trier of fact to understand or determine a fact in issue.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis added.) <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>supra, 509 U.S. 592; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cordoba, </em>supra, 104 F.3d 228 (pursuant to <em>Daubert, </em>it is trial judge\u2019s task, rather than appellate level court\u2019s task, to weigh probative value against prejudicial effect).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">Although the determination of the admissibility of scientific evidence in the first instance is a question for the trial court, I must comment on the <em>majority''s finding </em>that, as a matter of law, the prejudice of polygraph evidence outweighs its probative value. Applying what the majority formulates as our general standard for the admissibility of evidence \u2014 whether the prejudicial impact outweighs its probative value \u2014 the majority concludes that polygraph evidence is more prejudicial for essentially three reasons: (1) it lacks accuracy and, therefore, is of limited probative value; (2) it is time-consuming; and (3) it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>invades the jury\u2019s fact-finding mission. I find none of these reasons sufficient to support a rule that directs our trial courts to omit polygraph evidence under all circumstances, in civil as well as criminal trials, regardless of whether the omission is stipulated to in advance by both the state and the defendant in a criminal case<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> or by the plaintiff and the defendant in a civil case.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">First, as to its accuracy, the courts and the literature have indicated that a properly administered polygraph examination is quite accurate. In fact, the majority concedes that there are impressive statistics as to its accuracy, based upon a very recent study. The majority opinion indicates that David Raskin, a noted authority, reviewed laboratory studies (simulated studies) that indicate that the polygraph has an 89 percent sensitivity rate (correctly labels a deceptive subject as being deceptive 89 percent of the time) and 91 percent specificity rate (correctly labels a truthful subject as being truthful 91 percent of the time), whereas the field studies (based on data from polygraph examiners in actual criminal cases) indicate that the polygraph has an 87 percent sensitivity rate and 59 percent specificity rate.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> D.

Indeed, with respect to psychiatric testimony used to predict a defendant\u2019s future potential for dangerous behavior, the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Supreme Court has stated, despite the unanimous expert opinion that such conclusions were accurate only one out of three times; <em>Barefoot </em>v. Estelle, 463 U.S. 880, 920-22, 103 S. Ct. 3383, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1090 (1983) (Blackmun, J., dissenting); that \u201c[a]ll of these professional doubts about the usefulness of psychiatric predictions can be called to the attention of the jury. Petitioner\u2019s entire argument, as well as that of Justice Blackmun\u2019s dissent, is founded on the premise that a jury will not be able to separate the wheat from the chaff. We do not share in this low evaluation of the adversary process.\u201d Id., 899-901 n.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Second, the claims that it will be time-consuming for our courts can be disposed of in short shrift. The need to conserve precious court time pales in significance when a person\u2019s liberty or life is at stake.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Surely, we cannot be that callous to a person who may be innocent. Any problems with polygraph evidence can be overcome through rules developed by this court regarding its admissibility, the availability of apolygraph examination conducted by the state, cross-examination and jury instructions.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>The greatest tragedy in our judicial system, with all its fallibility and misidentifications, would be to take away the life or liberty of one innocent person for the sake of preventing guilty persons from escaping punishment. See 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England (1769) c. 27, p. 352 (\u201cit is better that ten guilty persons escape, than that one innocent suffer\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Finally, the majority curiously rejects polygraph evidence on the ground that it invades the fact-finding province of the jury. There are three answers to that argument. First, any reliable device that can aid the jury in its truth seeking mission should be available under rules and standards set forth by this court. As stated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces: \u201cWe believe that the truth-seeking function is best served by keeping the door open to scientific advances.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scheffer, </em>supra, 44 M.J. 446. Second, as we approach the twenty-first century, \u201cscience, for better or for worse, has become more a part of our daily lives. Scientific evidence, in turn, has become more a part of the ordinary trial so that jurors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>may be more likely to use polygraph evidence with discretion.\u201d <em>McMorris </em>v. <em>Israel, </em>supra, 643 F.2d 462. Third, we allow the prosecution to introduce expert testimony, which is fax less reliable than the polygraph, to bolster the credibility of the state\u2019s case in other situations. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Ali, </em>233 Conn. 403, 432, 660 A.2d 337 (1995) (expert allowed to testify as to typical behavior patterns of victims of sexual assault); <em>State </em>v. <em>Freeney, </em>228 Conn. 582, 592, 637 A.2d 1088 (1994) (same); <em>State </em>v. <em>Borrelli, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 173-74 (expert allowed to testify as to typical behavior patterns of victims of battered women\u2019s syndrome); <em>State </em>v. <em>Spigarolo, </em>210 Conn. 359, 378-79, 556 A.2d 112, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 933, 110 S. Ct. 322, 107 L. Ed. 2d 312 (1989) (expert allowed to testify that it is not unusual for child sexual abuse victim to give inconsistent or incomplete statements).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Indeed, this court recently allowed expert testimony to bolster the testimony of a child sexual abuse victim where there was a prolonged delay in the disclosure of the abuse to the authorities. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Christiano, </em>228 Conn. 456, 459-63, 637 A.2d 382, cert. denied, 513 U.S. 821, 115 S. Ct. 83, 130 L. Ed. 2d 36 (1994). In fact, in the court\u2019s opinion in that case, authored by Justice Borden, we observed that \u201c[t]he admissibility of opinion testimony of expert witnesses is a matter within the discretion of the trial court. . . . Generally, expert testimony is admissible if (1) the witness has a special skill or knowledge directly applicable to a matter in issue, (2) that skill or knowledge is not common to the average person, and (3) the testimony would be helpful to the court or jury in considering the issues.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Although some of the previously noted cases can be distinguished because the expert testimony was admitted for the purpose of establishing the behavior patterns of the victims, I see little difference in the distinction. Nevertheless, that distinction has little substance because in those situations the evidence is submitted to bolster the credibility of the state\u2019s case, the state\u2019s witness, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Finally, by not allowing the defendant an opportunity to have a hearing before the trial court in order to demonstrate the reliability of the polygraph evidence, he is deprived of his right to present a defense under the sixth amendment to the federal constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the state constitution.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court has made it clear that the right of an accused to present testimony that is relevant and material may not be denied arbitrarily. <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>388 U.S. 14, 23, 87 S. Ct. 1920, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1019 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">In <em>Rock </em>v. <em>Arkansas, </em>483 U.S. 44,107 S. Ct. 2704,97 L. Ed. 2d 37 (1987), the United States Supreme Court reversed the conviction of a defendant by holding that her sixth amendment right under the federal constitution was violated when she was deprived of the right to call herself as a witness to testify on her own behalf, regardless of the fact that she needed to be hypnotically refreshed and the state\u2019s law did not allow this form of testimony. <em>\u2018A State\u2019s legitimate interest in barring unreliable evidence does not extend to per se exclusions that may be reliable in an individual case. . . . </em>The State would be well within its powers if it established guidelines to aid trial courts in the evaluation of posthypnosis testimony and it may be able to show that testimony in a particular case is so unreliable that exclusion is justified.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 61. \u201cDespite the unreliability that hypnosis concededly may introduce . . . the procedure has been credited as instrumental in obtaining investigative leads or identifications that were later confirmed by independent evidence. . . . The inaccuracies the process introduces can be reduced, although perhaps not eliminated, by the use of procedural safeguards.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 60.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>On the basis of <em>Rock, </em>one commentator has pointed out that a per se exclusionary rule regarding polygraph evidence violates a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to present a defense. \u201cA recent [United States] Supreme Court interpretation of the constitutional right of a defendant in a criminal prosecution to call witnesses to testify in his or her behalf requires a reconsideration of the denial position when a criminal defendant attempts to introduce exculpatory polygraph evidence. Beginning with its earlier opinions in <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi </em>[410 U.S. 284, 93 S. Ct. 1038, 35 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1973)] and <em>Green </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>[442 U.S. 95, 99 S. Ct. 2150, 60 L. Ed. 2d 738 (1979)] the Supreme Court started the development of a constitutional right to introduce exculpatory evidence in criminal trials. The Court\u2019s 1987 opinion in <em>[Rock] </em>established the basic components of that right. . . . The Court stated in dicta that reasonable restrictions on the right to call a witness to give posthypnotic recall, as opposed to a per se prohibition, would be constitutional.\u201d J. McCall, \u201cMisconceptions and Reevaluation \u2014 Polygraph Admissibility after <em>Rock </em>and Daubert,\u201d 1996 U. Ill. L.

Although stipulated polygraph <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>results were admissible under state law at that time, the prosecutor, without offering any reasons, refused to stipulate. . . . The court [in granting habeas corpus relief to the defendant] . . . rested its decision on [narrow] grounds; that is, the prosecution\u2019s refusal to stipulate without offering a valid ground for the refusal deprived the defendant of due process . . . .\u201d P. Giannelli, \u201cForensic Science: Polygraph Evidence: Part II,\u201d 30 Crim. L. Bull. 366, 375 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Just recently, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scheffer, </em>supra, 44 M.J. 445-46, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces held, notwithstanding the militaiy rule of evidence with respect to the inadmissibility of polygraph evidence, that such evidence could not be excluded in a situation where the defendant testified, placed his credibility in issue, and was accused by the prosecution of being a liar. \u201cA per se exclusion of polygraph evidence offered by an accused to rebut an attack on his credibility, without giving him an opportunity to lay a foundation under [the military rule of evidence regarding scientific testimony] and <em>Daubert, </em>violates his Sixth Amendment right to present a defense.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Id., 445. In <em>Scheffer, </em>the court relied <em>on Rock </em>for the proposition that per se exclusions of evidence that may be reliable in an individual case cannot stand; <em>Rock </em>v. <em>Arkansas, </em>supra, 483 U.S. 61; and stated that \u201c[w]hile <em>Rock </em>concerned exclusion of a defendant\u2019s testimony and this case concerns exclusion of evidence supporting the truthfulness of a defendant\u2019s testimony, we perceive no significant constitutional difference between the two. In either case, the Sixth Amendment right to present a defense is implicated.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scheffer, </em>supra, 446; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mobley, </em>supra, 44 M.J. 454-45. Likewise, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>in the present case, the defendant\u2019s right to present a defense is also implicated.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">In conclusion, I would remand this case to the trial court in order to furnish the defendant with an opportunity to prove the validity of his polygraph examination and to demonstrate that it was correctly administered in this case. Both the state and the defendant should have the opportunity to be heard on the issue of accuracy and the conditions for the admissibility of the polygraph evidence. Only then do I believe that a court would be in the position to rule on its admissibility. \u201cWhere credibility is as critical as in the instant case, the circumstances are such as to make the polygraph evidence materially exculpatory within the meaning of the [federal] [constitution.\u201d <em>McMorris </em>v. <em>Israel, </em>supra, 643 F.2d 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">Accordingly, I dissent with respect to the issue of the admissibility of polygraph evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">BERDON, J., dissenting. I write this separate dissenting opinion based upon what occurred after this court released its opinion in this case on May 20, 1997. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>241 Conn. 57, 698 A.2d 739 (1997). In part I of the court\u2019s opinion, in which I concurred, we unanimously agreed to abandon the Frye<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> test for the admissibility of scientific evidence in order to adopt the standards under the Federal Rules of Evidence as interpreted in <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1993). <em>State </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>supra, 75-76. <em>Daubert </em>did not formulate a court-made rule, but merely interpreted the federal rules. As its starting point, the court in <em>Daubert </em>noted that rule 402 of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides the \u201cbaseline\u201d for interpreting the federal rules. <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuti</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164A\">*164A</page-number><em>cals, Inc., </em>supra, 587. Rule 402 provides that \u201c[a]llrelevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution of the United States, by Act of Congress, by these rules, or by other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority. Evidence which is not relevant is not admissible.\u201d With respect to expert testimony, <em>Daubert </em>relied on rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which provides: \u201cIf scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.\u201d With these rules in mind, the court in <em>Daubert </em>outlined certain \u201cconsiderations\u201d in order to guide trial courts when considering, as part of their \u201cgatekeeper\u201d role, whether to admit proffered scientific evidence. Interrelated with rule 702, as <em>Daubert </em>points out, is rule 403, which \u201cpermits the exclusion of relevant evidence \u2018if its probative value is <em>substantially </em>outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury ....\u201d\u2019 (Emphasis added.) <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>supra, 595. Accordingly, in part I of our original opinion, we not only adopted the \u201cconsiderations\u201d that the court in <em>Daubert </em>delineated under the auspices of rule 702, but we also made clear that the admissibility of scientific evidence was subject to the limitations of rule 403 by stating that \u201cscientific evidence, like all evidence, is properly excluded if its prejudicial impact <em>substantially </em>outweighs its probative value, even if it is otherwise admissible. See, e.g., <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>supra, [595] . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>Connecticut Law Journal, Vol. 53, No. 47, p. 92 (May 20, 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">On June 24, 1997, the majority of this court amended the original version of the <em>Porter </em>opinion by deleting the word \u201csubstantially\u201d from the previously quoted material when it substituted the original page 90 with a replacement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164B\">*164B</page-number>page. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 90.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The rule that the court now adopts in <em>Porter </em>is that such scientific evidence can be excluded from evidence, after passing <em>Daubert\u2019s </em>threshold considerations for admissibility, if \u201cits prejudicial impact outweighs its probative value\u201d; id.; a rule neither party advocated.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">I neither question that this court has the authority to hone the rules of evidence interpreted by <em>Daubert, </em>in order to fit the needs of our Connecticut jurisprudence,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> nor do I necessarily believe that the word \u201csubstantially\u201d should not have been deleted from the formulation in <em>Porter </em>of the prejudicial impact versus probative value test. I believe, however, that the decision to make such a substantial change in the opinion should have been made only in the context of the advocacy of a case, so that this court could act with the input of the parties, as well as of others who have a potential interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Furthermore, I note that although our prior case law has not been consistent, this court has stated in the past that relevant evidence is to be excluded only if it is \u201cunduly prejudicial.\u201d See <em>State </em>v. <em>Jeffrey, </em>220 Conn. 698, 707, 601 A.2d 993 (1991) (holding that admitted evidence \u201chad probative value and that its admission into evidence was not <em>unduly prejudicial </em>to the defendant and was, consequently, a proper exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion\u201d [emphasis added]); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Crafts, </em>226 Conn. 237, 255, 627 A.2d 877 (1993) (\u201cThe defendant\u2019s final objection to the admission of the statements is that the testimony should have been excluded because it was more prejudicial than probative. The <em>test </em>for determining whether evidence is <em>unduly prejudicial </em>is not whether it is damaging to the defendant but whether it will improperly arouse the emotions of the jury.\u201d [Emphasis added.]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>224 Conn. 325, 339-40, 618 A.2d 32 (1992) (enumerating situations in which \u201cunduly prejudicial\u201d effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>of relevant evidence would counsel its exclusion); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rinaldi, </em>220 Conn. 345, 356, 599 A.2d 1 (1991) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Because we should leave the decision of whether to delete the word \u201csubstantially\u201d from our rule, with respect to the admissibility of scientific evidence, to such time when that issue is properly raised within the context of a case or controversy, I disagree with the change in the original opinion of this court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b157-9\"> The majority, in footnote 80 of its opinion, in response to my concerns about the execution of an innocent person, attempts to allay those concerns by suggesting that polygraph evidence is admissible before the jury in the penalty phase of a capital case. I am unable to understand how polygraph evidence could be sufficiently reliable for the jury to consider when determining whether a person should be executed or whether a person should spend the rest of his or her life confined in prison, but not sufficiently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>reliable for the purpose of determining guilt or innocence. The logic of the majority eludes me.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b158-8\"> See part IV of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b158-9\"> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>241 Conn. 165, 694 A.2d 1317 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b158-10\"> \u201cIt is well documented that cross-racial identification is less reliable than identification of one person by another of the same race.

Moreover, counterintuitively, the ability to perceive the physical characteristics of a person from another racial group apparently does not improve significantly upon increased contact with other members of that race. Because many crimes are cross-racial, these factors may play an important role in reducing the accuracy of eyewitness perception. Note, \u2018Did Your Eyes Deceive You? Expert Psychological Testimony on the Unreliability of Eyewitness Identification,\u2019 29 Stan. L. Rev. 969, 982 (1977). Elizabeth F.

E. Loftus, Eyewitness Testimony (1979) pp. 136-37. She concluded, on the basis of an examination of studies made on the subject, that [pjeople have greater difficulty in recognizing faces of another race than faces of their own race.

We are painfully aware of miscarriages of justice caused by wrongful identification. Those experienced in criminal trial work or familiar with the administration of justice understand that one of the great problems of proof is posed by eyewitness identification, <em>especially in cross-racial identification </em>.... Judge Bazelon, dissenting in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>636 F.2d 727 (D.C. Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 1019, 101 S. Ct. 3010, 69 L. Ed. 2d 392 [1981], observed that many experts have concluded that convictions based solely on one eyewitness identification represent conceivably the greatest single threat to the achievement of our ideal that no innocent men shall be punished. . . . <em>Brown v. Davis, </em>752 F.2d 1142, 1146 (6th Cir. 1985); see <em>also Kampshoff </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>698 F.2d 581 (2d Cir. 1983). Another important factor to be considered in assessing the reliability of an identification is whether the witness and the person identified are of the same or different races. In general, there is a much greater possibility of error where the races are different than where they are the same. Where they are different, there is more likelihood of error where the suspect belongs to a minority group and the witness to a majority group than there is in the opposite situation. Almost fifty years ago, it was said to be: well known that, other things being equal, individuals of a given race are distinguishable from each other in proportion to our familiarity, to our contact with the race as a whole. Thus to the uninitiated American, all [Asians] look alike, while to the [Asian] all white men look alike. P. Wall, Eye-Witness Identification in Criminal Cases (2d Ed.) p. 122; A.
