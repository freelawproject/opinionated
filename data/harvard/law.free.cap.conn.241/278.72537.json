We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The plaintiff, Robert Walsh, initiated this action against the defendant, National Safety Associates, Inc., alleging unfair practices in violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq.,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and an illegal contingent transaction in violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>of General Statutes \u00a7 42-144 et seq.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant is a Tennessee corporation that manufactures air and water treatment devices and markets them through a multilevel sales force of independent distributors and dealers. The plaintiff became a dealer of the defendant\u2019s product after responding to a newspaper advertisement and attending a recruitment meeting. In his complaint, the plaintiff alleges that, as a result of the defendant\u2019s unfair and deceptive trade practices and illegal pyramid scheme, he lost his investment, was not paid for his labor, lost the opportunity to seek other employment and suffered humiliation, degradation and emotional distress. Thereafter, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7\u00a787 and 88, the trial court granted the plaintiffs motion for class certification, concluding that the plaintiff had satisfied the requirements for a class action. This appeal ensued.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Our careful examination of the record on this appeal, and the briefs and arguments of the parties, persuades us that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed. The issues pertaining to whether the class should be certified were properly resolved in the thoughtful and comprehensive memorandum of decision filed by the trial court. <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>National Safety Associates, Inc., </em>44 Conn. Sup. 569, 695 A.2d 1095 (1997). Because that memorandum of decision fully addresses the arguments raised in the present appeal, we adopt the trial court\u2019s well reasoned decision. It would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion therein contained.
