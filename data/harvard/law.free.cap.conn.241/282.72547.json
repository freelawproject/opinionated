J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXaS\">This is an appeal by the defendant<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> second injury fund (fund), from a decision of the compensation review board (board). The principal issue is whether the board correctly concluded that the provisions of Public Acts 1995, No. 95-277, \u00a7 4 (a) (P.A. 95-277),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> now codified at General Statutes \u00a7 31-349c, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>applied prospectively only and did not apply retroactively to a claim in which the claimant\u2019s second injury occurred before July 1, 1995, the effective date of P.A. 95-277. Section 31-349c requires aparty seeking to transfer liability for a claim to the fund pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-349 (a) and (b)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to submit all controverted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>issues concerning the existence of a previous disability to the chairman of the workers\u2019 compensation commission (chairman), who is required to submit such disputes to a three physician panel for determination. We conclude that the legislature intended \u00a7 31-349c to apply retroactively. We therefore reverse the decision of the board and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The record reveals the following facts and procedural history. On June 23, 1980, the claimant, Garland Hall, sustained an injury to his cervical spine arising out of and in the course of his employment with the defendant Gilbert and Bennett Manufacturing Company, Inc. (Gilbert and Bennett). On August 11, 1983, the defendant Travelers Insurance Company (Travelers), the workers\u2019 compensation carrier for Gilbert and Bennett, notified the fund, on behalf of Gilbert and Bennett, of its intent to transfer liability for Hall\u2019s claim to the fund pursuant to \u00a7 31-349. In support of its transfer request, Travelers alleged that Hall had various spinal conditions that pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>dated the June 23,1980 injury, and that the combination of these preexisting permanent conditions with the injuries sustained in the 1980 accident resulted in a permanent disability materially and substantially greater than would have existed in the absence of the preexisting conditions. The fund questioned the medical assertions of Travelers, and eventually rejected Travelers\u2019 transfer request.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">On August 8, 1995, at Travelers\u2019 request, the trial commissioner (commissioner) held a formal hearing addressing whether transfer of Hall\u2019s claim to the fund was appropriate. At the hearing, the fund argued that the commissioner had no jurisdiction to entertain Travelers\u2019 transfer request because P.A. 95-277, \u00a7 4 (a), mandated that all contested issues regarding the existence of a previous disability under \u00a7 31-349 were to be decided by a panel of three physicians to be appointed by the chairman. The commissioner agreed with the fund.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Travelers subsequently petitioned the board for review of the commissioner\u2019s decision. The board reversed the commissioner\u2019s decision and remanded the case for a hearing on the transfer request. After first determining that it had jurisdiction to consider Travelers\u2019 appeal, the board concluded that P.A. 95-277, \u00a7 4 (a), affected substantive rather than procedural rights, and, therefore, that it should be applied only prospectively from July 1, 1995, its effective date.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The fund appealed from the decision of the board to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Appellate Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a731-301b,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a751-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">The first issue that this court must address is whether we have jurisdiction to consider the merits of the fund\u2019s appeal. That inquiry initially requires us to answer two questions: First, we must determine whether the board had subject matter jurisdiction over Travelers\u2019 appeal pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-301 (a).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Next, we must determine whether the board\u2019s decision constituted an appealable final judgment pursuant to \u00a7 31-301b. If we determine, on the basis of the answers to those two questions, that the present appeal is not properly before us, we then must determine whether there is another jurisdictional basis to consider the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">We first address the question of whether the board had subject matter jurisdiction. In its brief to the board, the fund declined to argue the merits of Travelers\u2019 appeal. Rather, it claimed, inter alia, that the board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>lacked jurisdiction to entertain the appeal because, the fund contended, none of the statutory prerequisites necessary under \u00a7 31-301 (a) for an appeal to the board existed. In support of this claim, the fund argued that, because the commissioner had not entered an award, had not issued a decision on a motion, and had not issued an order pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-299b,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the board lacked jurisdiction. The board concluded, however, on the basis of the provision of \u00a7 31-301 (a) allowing a party to appeal from a commissioner\u2019s decision on a motion, that it did have jurisdiction over Travelers\u2019 appeal from the commissioner\u2019s decision. In its brief to this court, the fund renewed its argument that the board lacked subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">We begin our analysis by noting that \u201c [a] dministrative agencies are tribunals of limited jurisdiction and their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>jurisdiction is dependent entirely upon the validity of the statutes vesting them with power and they cannot confer jurisdiction upon themselves. . . . [A]n administrative body must act strictly within its statutory authority, within constitutional limitations and in a lawful manner. ... It cannot modify, abridge or otherwise change the statutory provisions, under which it acquires authority unless the statutes expressly grant it that power.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Castro </em>v. Viera, 207 Conn. 420, 428, 541 A.2d 1216 (1988). \u201cIt is a familiar principle that [an administrative agency] which exercises a limited and statutory jurisdiction is without jurisdiction to act unless it does so under the precise circumstances and in the manner particularly prescribed by the enabling legislation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 427-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Section 31-301 (a) defines the board\u2019s appellate jurisdiction. It affords parties the right to appeal from three distinct actions of a commissioner: (1) an entry of an award; (2) a decision upon a motion; or (3) an order according to the provisions of \u00a7 31-299b. <em>Dixon </em>v. <em>United Illuminating Co., </em>232 Conn. 758, 775-76, 657 A.2d 601 (1995). The commissioner did not enter an award, nor did he issue an order according to the provisions of \u00a7 31-299b. The only basis upon which the board could have exercised jurisdiction, therefore, was the provision of \u00a7 31-301 (a) allowing an appeal from a commissioner\u2019s decision on a motion. Consequently, the question before us is whether the commissioner\u2019s ruling at the August 8, 1995 hearing properly can be characterized as a decision on a motion. There is no definition of \u201cmotion\u201d in the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act, General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq. Practice Book \u00a7 197,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> however, defines a motion as \u201cany application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>to the court for an order, which application is to be acted upon by the court or any judge thereof . . . .\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990) defines a \u201cmotion\u201d as \u201c[a]n application made to a court or judge for [the] purpose of obtaining a rule or order directing some act to be done in favor of the applicant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">With these two definitions in mind, we turn to the commissioner\u2019s ruling at the August 8, 1995 hearing. Travelers ostensibly requested the hearing so that the commissioner could hear evidence and make a determination of all of the factual issues necessary to transfer liability for Hall\u2019s claim to the fund pursuant to \u00a7 31-349. See footnote 3 of this opinion. The fund objected to the hearing claiming that P.A. \u00a7 95-277, \u00a7 4 (a), removed from the commissioner\u2019s purview any determination regarding the existence of a previous disability. We construe the fund\u2019s objection to the August 8, 1995 hearing going forward, and its request that the previous disability issue be submitted to the chairman pursuant to P.A. 95-277, \u00a7 4 (a), as an application to the commissioner for a continuance of the proceeding pending submission of the previous disability issue to the chairman, and the rendering of an opinion by a three physician panel appointed by the chairman pursuant to P.A. 95-277, \u00a7 4 (a). In essence, the fund orally moved the commissioner for \u201ca rule or order directing some act to be done in favor of the applicant\u201d; Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed.); i.e., to continue the proceeding pending further proceedings in accordance with the provisions of P.A. 95-277, \u00a7 4 (a). We conclude that the commissioner\u2019s oral ruling granting the fund\u2019s application for a continuance of the proceeding amounted to a decision on a motion pursuant to \u00a7 31-301 (a) and, therefore, that the board properly determined that it had subject matter jurisdiction over Travelers\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>We next must determine whether the board\u2019s decision reversing and remanding the case to the commissioner constitutes an appealable final judgment in accordance with \u00a7 31-301b and our case law interpreting \u00a7 31-301b. We raised this issue, sua sponte, prior to oral argument. Section 31-301b provides that \u201c[a]ny party aggrieved by the decision of the [c]ompensation [r]eview [b]oard upon any question or questions of law arising in the proceedings may appeal the decision of the [c]ompensation [rjeview [bjoard to the Appellate Court.\u201d We have stated, however, that \u201cappellate review of disputed claims of law and fact ordinarily must await the rendering of a final judgment by the compensation review [board].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cleveland </em>v. <em>U.S. Printing Ink, Inc., </em>218 Conn. 181, 185, 588 A.2d 194 (1991). \u201cThe test that determines whether such a decision is a final judgment turns on the scope of the proceedings on remand: if such further proceedings are merely ministerial, the decision is an appealable final judgment, but if further proceedings will require the exercise of independent judgment or discretion and the taking of additional evidence, the appeal is premature and must be dismissed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 185-86; see also <em>Szudora </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>214 Conn. 552, 556, 573 A.2d 1 (1990); <em>Matey </em>v. <em>Estate of Dember, </em>210 Conn. 626, 631, 556 A.2d 599 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">On Travelers\u2019 appeal to the board, the board determined that P.A. 95-277, \u00a7 4 (a), affected substantive rather than procedural rights, and, therefore, that its provisions requiring a three physician panel to decide all controverted issues concerning the existence of a previous disability could be applied only prospectively from the effective date of the act, July 1, 1995. Because the claimant\u2019s injury in the present case predated July 1, 1995, the board determined that P.A. 95-277, \u00a7 4 (a), did not apply. The board, therefore, reversed the commissioner\u2019s ruling and remanded the case to the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>missioner for a hearing on, among other things, the issue of Hall\u2019s previous disability. On remand, the commissioner, after allowing the parties to present evidence on the issue, would be required to exercise his independent judgment and discretion to determine, among other things, whether the claimant suffered from a previous disability. Such an undertaking by the commissioner cannot fairly be construed as ministerial. We conclude, therefore, that the board\u2019s decision reversing and remanding the case does not constitute an appeal-able final judgment pursuant to <em>Cleveland </em>v. <em>U.S. Printing Ink, Inc., </em>supra, 218 Conn. <em>185, Szudora v. Fairfield, </em>supra, 214 Conn. 556, and <em>Matey </em>v. <em>Estate of Dember, </em>supra, 210 Conn. 631.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">At oral argument before this court, the fund asked that we revisit our decisions interpreting a final judgment requirement into \u00a7 31-301b. See <em>Cleveland </em>v. <em>U.S. Printing Ink, Inc., </em>supra, 218 Conn. 185; <em>Szudora </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>supra, 214 Conn. 556; <em>Matey </em>v. <em>Estate of Dember, </em>supra, 210 Conn. 631. The fund argued that \u00a7 31-301b does not require a final judgment in order for a party to appeal from the board to the Appellate Court because the text of \u00a7 31-301b, unlike the text of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-183<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and 52-263,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> does not contain such a prerequisite. Rather, \u00a7 31-301b allows any party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>aggrieved by a decision of the board \u201cupon any question or questions of law arising in the proceedings\u201d to appeal to the Appellate Court. The fund contended that the absence of a final judgment requirement in the text of \u00a7 31-30 lb was consistent with other provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. In sum, the fund has requested that we overrule our previous decisions interpreting \u00a7 31-30 lb to require a final decision by the board before such a decision may be appealed. We decline the fund\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The interpretation of \u00a7 31-301b is a question of statutory construction. Our fundamental objective when construing a statute \u201cis to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>236 Conn. 18, 22-23, 670 A.2d 851 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">We acknowledge that the text of \u00a7 31-301b does not contain language requiring a final judgment in order for a party to appeal to the Appellate Court. In speaking on the floor of the Senate about a proposed amendment to Public Acts 1979, No. 79-540, \u00a7 3 (P.A. 79-540), the genesis of \u00a7 31-301b, however, Senator Salvatore C. DePiano stated: \u201cMr. President, the Amendment merely indicates that the appellate session of the Superior Court shall have jurisdiction [over] appeals <em>from any final judgment or action </em>in the following [manner] which would now include, if this Bill is passed, any proceeding of the Compensation Review Division for Workers\u2019] Compensation appeals arising under Section 5 of this Act.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 22 S. Proc., Pt. 9, 1979 Sess., p. 2939. The legislature subsequently adopted the amendment of which Senator DePiano spoke. Id., p. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>2940. Although, as the fund has indicated, the legislature expressly has included final judgment language in the text of other statutes governing appeals from the Superior Court and from other administrative agencies; see footnotes 11 and 12 of this opinion; we nonetheless conclude that Senator DePiano\u2019s remarks on the floor of the Senate raise an issue as to whether the legislature intended \u00a7 31-301b to contain a final judgment requirement. We resolve this ambiguity by adhering to the doctrine of stare decisis and following established precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The doctrine of stare decisis counsels that \u201ca court should not overrule its earlier decisions unless the most cogent reasons and inescapable logic require it.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jolly, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>237 Conn. 184, 196, 676 A.2d 831 (1996). Stare decisis \u201cis justified because it allows for predictability in the ordering of conduct, it promotes the necessary perception that the law is relatively unchanging, it saves resources and it promotes judicial efficiency.\u201d <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Wilton, </em>238 Conn. 653, 658-59, 680 A.2d 242 (1996). \u201cIt is the most important application of a theory of decisionmaking consistency in our legal culture and it is an obvious manifestation of the notion that decisionmaking consistency itself has normative value.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">In evaluating the force of stare decisis, our case law dictates that we should be especially wary of overturning a decision that involves the construction of a statute. See <em>Jolly, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 196; <em>General Electric Employees Federal Credit Union </em>v. <em>Zakrzewski, </em>235 Conn. 741, 744, 670 A.2d 274 (1996); <em>Kluttz </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>228 Conn. 401, 406, 636 A.2d 816 (1994); <em>White </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>213 Conn. 307, 333-34, 567 A.2d 1195 (1990); <em>Herald Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Bill, </em>142 Conn. 53, 61-62, 111 A.2d 4 (1955). \u201cWhen we construe a statute, we act not as plenary lawgivers but as surro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>gates for another policy maker, the legislature. In our role as surrogates, our only responsibility is to determine what the legislature, within constitutional limits, intended to do. Sometimes, when we have made such a determination, the legislature instructs us that we have misconstrued its intentions. We are bound by the instructions so provided. . . . More often, however, the legislature takes no further action to clarify its intentions. Time and again, we have characterized the failure of the legislature to take corrective action as manifesting the legislature\u2019s acquiescence in our construction of a statute. . . . Once an appropriate interval to permit legislative reconsideration has passed without corrective legislative action, the inference of legislative acquiescence places a significant jurisprudential limitation on our own authority to reconsider the merits of our earlier decision.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Wilton, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 682-83 <em>(Peters, C. J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The first of our decisions construing \u00a7 31-301b to require that a party appealing from a decision of the board must appeal from a final decision; <em>Matey </em>v. <em>Estate ofDember, </em>supra, 210 Conn. 631; was rendered in 1989. In 1991, two years after <em>Matey </em>and one year after <em>Szudora </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>supra, 214 Conn. 556, the legislature enacted a comprehensive reform of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, yet only affected a nonsubstantive change to \u00a7 31-301b. See Public Acts 1991, No. 91-339, \u00a7 22 (P.A. 91-339) (substituting \u201creview board\u201d for \u201creview division\u201d). The legislature\u2019s failure to amend \u00a7 31-301b following our interpretation of it in <em>Matey </em>and <em>Szudora, </em>which both predated legislative consideration of P.A. 91-339, provides adequate support for our disinclination to overrule controlling precedent and thereby \u201ceffect an amendment by the process of judicial interpretation.\u201d <em>Herald Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Bill, </em>supra, 142 Conn. 63; see also <em>White </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 333-34. \u201cThe legislature is presumed to be aware of the interpretation which the courts have placed upon one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>of its legislative enactments and of the effect that its own nonaction, thereafter, may have.\u201d <em>Herald Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Bill, </em>supra, 63. In short, the fund has not presented \u201ccogent reasons and inescapable logic\u201d that compel us to overrule our prior decisions interpreting \u00a7 31-301b. <em>Jolly, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Our conclusion that the board\u2019s decision did not constitute an appealable final judgment, however, does not foreclose consideration of the merits of the present appeal. In response to our raising of the final judgment issue, sua sponte, the fund requested, in a letter sent in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 4064J, that this court consider General Statutes \u00a7 52-265a<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> as an alternative basis for jurisdiction. Section 52-265a \u201callows the chief justice to certify a direct appeal to the Supreme Court from an interlocutory order of the Superior Court on an issue of law that \u2018involves a matter of substantial public interest and in which delay may work a substantial injustice.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ayala, </em>222 Conn. 331, 341, 610 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>A.2d 1162 (1992). Consideration of \u00a7 52-265a as a basis for jurisdiction in the present case raises two questions: (1) whether an appeal from an interlocutory decision of the board is within the ambit of \u00a7 52-265a, since that statute, on its face, allows parties to appeal only from orders or decisions of the Superior Court; and (2) whether \u00a7 52-265a is an appropriate basis for jurisdiction in view of the fact that the fund failed to follow the certification procedures set forth in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">We first address whether an appeal from a board decision fits within the parameters of \u00a7 52-265a, in view of the fact that \u00a7 52-265a, on its face, allows appeals only from orders or decisions of the Superior Court. The legislature enacted \u00a7 52-265a in 1967 to provide an expedited means of appealing from the Superior Court to the Supreme Court in cases involving matters of substantial public interest and in which delay might work an injustice. Public Acts 1967, No. 895; see also 12 H.R. Proc., Pt. 6, 1967 Sess., pp. 2667-78, remarks of Representative John A. Carrozzella. At the time the legislature enacted \u00a7 52-265a, workers\u2019 compensation appeals were within its purview because the board did not exist and appeals from commissioners went directly to the Superior Court. See General Statutes (Cum. Sup. 1967) \u00a7 31-301.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In 1979, in order to facilitate workers\u2019 compensation appeals and foster the creation of a uniform body of workers\u2019 compensation law, the legislature established the board. P.A. 79-540, \u00a7 3; see also Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 4, 1979 Sess., pp. 1312-13, testimony of Commissioner John A. Arcudi. Contemporaneous with the establishment of the board, the legislature altered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>appellate procedure so that all appeals from the newly created board went to the appellate session of the Superior Court.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> P.A. 79-540, \u00a7 3. Neither the text of P.A. 79-540, \u00a7 3, nor its legislative history evince an intent on the part of the legislature to remove workers\u2019 compensation appeals from the scope of \u00a7 52-265a. Rather, the legislative history of P.A. 79-540, \u00a7 3, suggests that the legislature merely sought to create an appellate body within the workers\u2019 compensation commission that both possessed expertise in that area of the law and would unburden the Superior Court of time consuming workers\u2019 compensation appeals. We conclude, therefore, that a party aggrieved by an order or decision of the board may petition this court, in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 52-265a, in the same manner that a party aggrieved by an order or decision of the Superior Court may petition this court pursuant to \u00a7 52-265a.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">We next address whether the fund\u2019s failure to follow the procedures of \u00a7 52-265a precludes our consideration of \u00a7 52-265a as a basis for jurisdiction in the present case. In the ordinary situation, a litigant must request \u00a7 52-265a certification within two weeks from the date of the issuance of the order or decision for which review is being sought. In the present case, no such request for certification was ever filed with this court. Rather, the fund simply appealed the decision of the board to the Appellate Court pursuant to \u00a7 31-301b, and we transferred the case to this court. Prior to the present case, however, the fund had no reason to believe that it could file a petition for an expedited appeal from the board to this court pursuant to \u00a7 52-265a. For that reason, we conclude that the fund\u2019s failure to follow the normal certification procedure is not a bar to our consideration of \u00a7 52-265a as a basis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>jurisdiction. Rather, we choose to treat the fund\u2019s appeal as a late petition for certification pursuant to \u00a7 52-265a. As chief justice, I have agreed to waive the fund\u2019s delay in tiling its petition, and have determined\u2014on the basis of the legislature\u2019s enactment of Public Acts 1996, No. 96-242, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> which imposes a temporal deadline on the resolution of all transfer claims \u2014 that the fund\u2019s appeal concerns a matter of substantial public interest in which delay may work an injustice. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ayala, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 341-42.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The merits of the fund\u2019s appeal, therefore, are properly before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The fund\u2019s substantive argument requires us to determine whether the provisions of P.A. 95-277, \u00a7 4 (a), requiring a panel of three physicians to decide all controverted issues concerning the existence of a previous disability, applies retroactively to cases in which the claimant\u2019s second injury predated the effective date of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>the act, July 1, 1995. The fund contends that the board improperly concluded that P.A. 95-277, \u00a7 4 (a), applied only prospectively. The fund argues that the legislature intended P.A. 95-277, \u00a7 4 (a), to apply retroactively because, in \u00a7 3 (d) of P.A. 95-277, now codified at General Statutes \u00a7 31-349 (d),<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the legislature effectively eliminated the transfer of cases in which the claimant\u2019s second injury occurred on or after July 1,1995. The fund argues, therefore, that the only logical interpretation of \u00a7 4 (a) of P.A. 95-277, when read together with \u00a7 3 (d), is that the legislature intended \u00a7 4 (a) to apply retroactively to transfer cases in which the claimant\u2019s second injury occurred prior to July 1, 1995. Otherwise, the fund argues, P.A. 95-277, \u00a7 4 (a), would have no effect whatsoever. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Our analysis of P.A. 95-277, \u00a7 4 (a), is governed by well settled principles of statutory construction. We are mindful of the accepted principle that \u201ca statute affecting substantive rights is to be applied only prospectively unless the legislature clearly and unequivocally expresses its intent that the legislation shall apply retrospectively.\u201d <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>219 Conn. 703, 712, 595 A.2d 297 (1991); see also General Statutes \u00a7 55-3; <em>Darak </em>v. <em>Darak, </em>210 Conn. 462, 467-68, 556 A.2d 145 (1989). We are equally mindful, however, of other \u201ccompelling principles of statutory construction [that] require us to construe a statute in a manner that will not thwart [the legislature\u2019s] intended purpose or lead to absurd results. <em>Sutton </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>201 Conn. 115, 121, 513 A.2d 139, cert. denied sub nom. <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>479 U.S. 964, 107 S. Ct. 466, 93 L. Ed. 2d 410 (1986); <em>Narel </em>v. <em>Liburdi, </em>185 Conn. 562, 571, 441 A.2d 177 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>(1981), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 928, 102 S. Ct. 1974, 72 L. Ed. 2d 443 (1982). We must avoid a construction that fails to attain a rational and sensible result that bears directly on the purpose the legislature sought to achieve. <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Jacquemin, </em>196 Conn. 53, 63-64, 491 A.2d 1043 (1985). If there are two possible interpretations of a statute, we will adopt the more reasonable construction over one that is unreasonable. <em>State </em>v. <em>Uretek, Inc., </em>207 Conn. 706, 719, 543 A.2d 709 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Parmalee, </em>197 Conn. 158, 165, 496 A.2d 186 (1985). We presume that the legislature had a purpose for each sentence, clause or phrase in a legislative enactment, and that it did not intend to enact meaningless provisions. <em>Zichichi </em>v. <em>Middlesex Memorial Hospital, </em>204 Conn. 399, 407, 528 A.2d 805 (1987).\u201d <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>supra, 712-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">After reviewing the text of P.A. 95-277 in its entirety, we conclude that the legislature clearly and unequivocally intended \u00a7 4 (a) to apply retroactively to those transfer claims in which the claimant\u2019s second injury occurred prior to July 1, 1995. If we were to conclude that the legislature intended \u00a7 4 (a) of P.A. 95-277 to apply only prospectively from the effective date of the act, we would render it a legal nullity, since \u00a7 3 (d) of the same act effectively terminated the transfer of cases in which the second injury occurred on or after July 1, 1995, the effective date of the act. Such an interpretation would be illogical and would run contrary to the principle that \u201c[cjourts must presume that the [legislature] did not intend to enact useless legislation.\u201d <em>Union Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Heggelund, </em>219 Conn. 620, 626, 594 A.2d 293 (1991). Rather, we must interpret \u00a7 4 (a) of P.A. 95-277 to be consistent with \u00a7 3 (d) of the act so that \u201cno word, phrase, or clause [of the act] will be rendered insignificant.\u201d <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Unemployment Security Board of Review, </em>181 Conn. 1, 7, 434 A.2d 293 (1980). We note that the only relevant legislative history sug<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>gests that the legislature enacted \u00a7 4 (a) of P.A. 95-277 in an effort to expedite the resolution of disputes concerning the existence of a previous disability. 38 H.R. Proc., Pt. 16, 1995 Sess., p. 5951, remarks of Representative James O\u2019Rourke; 38 S. Proc., Pt. 15, 1995 Sess., p. 5488, remarks of Senator John A. Kissel. With the enactment of \u00a7 3 (d) of P.A. 95-277, such disputes could exist only in cases in which the claimant\u2019s second injury occurred prior to July 1, 1995. We think the legislature\u2019s clear intent, therefore, was for the provisions of \u00a7 4 (a) of P.A. 95-277 to apply retroactively to cases, such as the present case, in which the claimant\u2019s second injury occurred prior to July 1, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Travelers argues that P.A. 95-277, \u00a7 4 (a), effected at least three substantive changes in the law governing transfer of claims to the fund, namely that the act: (1) gave to the chairman broad new powers that previously did not exist; (2) required the claimant to submit to any examination that the medical panel might require; and (3) removed the right to appeal the medical panel\u2019s determination of the previous disability issue. Relying on \u00a7 55-3<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and our case law interpreting \u00a7 55-3, Travelers argues that P.A. 95-277, \u00a7 4 (a), cannot be applied retroactively in the absence of clear and unequivocal legislative intent that it be so applied. See <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 712. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">We have interpreted \u00a7 55-3 simply \u201cas a rule of presumed legislative intent that statutes affecting substantive rights shall apply prospectively only.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gil </em>v. <em>Courthouse One, </em>239 Conn. 676, 688, 687 A.2d 146 (1997). \u201cThe legislature only rebuts this presumption, however, when it clearly and unequivocally expresses its intent that the legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>tion shall apply retrospectively.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. It is difficult to see how the legislature more clearly could have expressed its intent that P.A. 95-277, \u00a7 4 (a), apply retroactively than by eliminating any possibility of its prospective application with the enactment of P.A. 95-277, \u00a7 3 (d). We conclude that, with the enactment of \u00a7 3 (d) of P.A. 95-277, the legislature sufficiently rebutted any presumption in favor of prospective only application of \u00a7 4 (a) of P.A. 95-277, provided by \u00a7 55-3 and our case law. Consequently, we need not address Travelers\u2019 arguments concerning whether P.A. 95-277, \u00a7 4 (a), affected substantive rights or merely involved matters of procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">As additional support for its argument in favor of prospective application of P.A. 95-277, \u00a7 4 (a), Travelers cites the date of injury rule. We recently analyzed the date of injury rule in <em>Gil </em>v. <em>Courthouse One, </em>supra, 239 Conn. 685. The date of injury rule states that \u201cnew workers\u2019 compensation legislation affecting rights and obligations as between the parties, and not specifying otherwise, appliejs] only to those persons who received injuries after the legislation became effective, and not to those injured previously.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. We stated, however, that \u201c[t]he date of injury rule functions as a presumption of legislative intent within the workers\u2019 compensation context, similar to the general presumption against retroactive application of a statute.\u201d Id., 686; see also <em>Civardi </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>231 Conn. 287, 293 n.8, 649 A.2d 523 (1994); <em>Iacomacci </em>v. <em>Trumbull, </em>209 Conn. 219, 222, 550 A.2d 640 (1988). The legislature, therefore, may \u201coverride\u201d the date of injury rule as long as it makes its intention clear. <em>Gil </em>v. <em>Courthouse One, </em>supra, 686. Once again, we conclude that the legislature sufficiently overcame any presumption in favor of only prospective application of P.A. 95-277, \u00a7 4 (a), provided by the date of injury rule, when, in \u00a7 3 (d) of the same act, it eliminated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>the transfer of cases in which the claimant\u2019s second injury occurred on or after the effective date of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Finally, Travelers raises two constitutional challenges to \u00a7 31-349c, the current codification of P.A. 95-277, \u00a7 4 (a). First, Travelers argues that \u00a7 31-349c violates procedural due process under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution. Second, Travelers argues that \u00a7 31-349c is unconstitutionally vague. Our consideration of these claims is hindered, however, by the procedural posture in which the present case arrived at our doorstep. Because Travelers initiated this appeal from the commissioner\u2019s ruling continuing the case, pending submission of the previous disability issue to the chairman and, ultimately, to a three physician panel, the provisions of \u00a7 31-349c were never applied in the present case. Travelers never submitted the previous disability issue to the chairman and the chairman, therefore, never appointed the three physician panel. In essence, Travelers asks this court to declare \u00a7 31-349c unconstitutional on its face. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">\u201cIn the absence of weighty countervailing circumstances, it is improvident for the court to invalidate a statute on its face.\u201d <em>Sassone </em>v. <em>Lepore, </em>226 Conn. 773, 778, 629 A.2d 357 (1993); <em>Lehrer v. </em>Davis, 214 Conn. 232, 235, 571 A.2d 691 (1990); <em>Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Assn. of the United States, Inc. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>203 Conn. 63, 75, 523 A.2d 485 (1987). \u201cA party mounting a constitutional challenge to the validity of a statute must provide an adequate factual record in order to meet its burden of demonstrating the statute\u2019s adverse impact on some protected interest of its own, in its own particular case, and not merely under some hypothetical set of facts as yet unproven. . . . We do not give advisory opinions, nor do we sit as roving commissions assigned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>to pass judgment on the validity of legislative enactments. Determination of the scope and constitutionality of legislation in advance of its immediate adverse effect in the context of a concrete case involves too remote and abstract an inquiry for the proper exercise of the judicial function. <em>International Longshoremen\u2019s &amp; Warehousemen\u2019s Union, Local 37 </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>347 U.S. 222, 224, 74 S.

We ought not, and will not, declare a statute to be unconstitutional unless our judgment is formed in the light of this rule of our law: It is our duty to approach the question with caution, examine it with infinite care, make every presumption and intendment in its favor, and sustain the Act unless its invalidity is, in our judgment, beyond a reasonable doubt. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Zach, </em>supra, 177-78; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>supra, 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">With regal'd to a claim that our prejudgment remedy statutes violated procedural due process on their face, we stated: \u201cA claim that a statute fails, on it face, to comport with the constitutional requirements of procedural due process reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the law of due process. Due process is inherently fact-bound because \u2018due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sassone </em>v. <em>Lepore, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 779, quoting <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 481, 92 S. Ct. 2593, 33 L. Ed. 2d 484 (1972). \u201c \u2018The constitutional requirement of procedural due process thus invokes a balancing process that cannot take place in a factual vacuum.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sassone </em>v. <em>Lepore, </em>supra, 779.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>With the above principles in mind, we conclude that Travelers\u2019 arguments concerning the facial constitutionality of \u00a7 31-349c are not ripe for our review. The procedures of \u00a7 31-349c were not invoked in the present case, and, as far as we can ascertain from the parties\u2019 assertions at oral argument, have never been applied. If we were to address Travelers\u2019 constitutional arguments, we would do so in a factual vacuum. Our case law counsels against embarking on such an expedition in the absence of an adequate factual record.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>Sassone </em>v. <em>Lepore, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 779; <em>Lehrer </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 214 Conn. 234-35; <em>Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Assn. of the United States, Inc. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>supra, 203 Conn. 75; <em>State </em>v. <em>Zach, </em>supra, 198 Conn. 177-78; <em>State </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>supra, 198 Conn. 105. Moreover, we perceive no \u201cweighty countervailing circumstances\u201d that counsel in favor of consideration of these constitutional claims.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>Sassone </em>v. <em>Lepore, </em>supra, 778. Although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>legislature has imposed a deadline for the completion of all transfer claims; see footnote 16 of this opinion; and the existence of that deadline constituted a reason for our exercise of jurisdiction in this case pursuant to \u00a7 52-265a, we do not believe that the deadline constitutes a sufficiently weighty countervailing circumstance that would require us, at the present time, to decide serious constitutional questions in the absence of a factual record to review. In addition, we note that the chairman has yet to issue regulations interpreting \u00a7 31-349c. In theory, the chairman could promulgate regulations clarifying \u00a7 31-349c that might render moot any potential constitutional due process or vagueness problems. Finally, on remand, Travelers might prevail on the previous disability issue, thus precluding the necessity for us to decide the constitutionality of \u00a7 31-349c. In the absence of a concrete application of \u00a7 31-349c, or any exigent circumstances counseling immediate review of Travelers\u2019 constitutional claims, we decline to address whether \u00a7 31-349c, on its face, violates the due process protections of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution or is unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">To summarize, we conclude that P.A. 95-277, \u00a7 4 (a), now codified at General Statutes \u00a7 31-349c, applies retroactively to all pending transfer claims in which the claimant\u2019s second injury occurred prior to July 1, 1995. The commissioner, therefore, correctly refused to entertain Travelers\u2019 arguments concerning Hall\u2019s previous disability and properly continued the proceeding pending submission of the issue to the chairman pursuant to \u00a7 31-349c.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>The decision of the board is reversed and the case is remanded to the board with direction to remand it to the commissioner for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b306-9\"> There were three defendants in this action: Gilbert and Bennett Manufacturing Company, the employer; Travelers Insurance Company, the employer\u2019s insurer; and the second injury fund.
