Buonato, Jr.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for several days while the defendant was away. On October 21, 1992, the defendant delivered the dog, a chow, to the plaintiffs house for its stay in the plaintiffs care. The following day, before leaving for work, the plaintiff took the dog for a walk and then put it inside his house. When the plaintiff returned home from work, he took the dog outside and tied it to a tree in his yard. Later, while the plaintiff was attempting to bring the dog into his house for the night, the dog bit him on the left hand, causing several puncture wounds and injury to his left arm and elbow and necessitating a series of rabies shots.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">The plaintiff thereafter brought this action pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22-357<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to recover damages for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>his injuries. The trial court found that the plaintiff was not a \u201ckeeper\u201d of the dog as defined by General Statutes \u00a7 22-327 (6)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and awarded the plaintiff damages and interest pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-192a in the total amount of $39,364.48. The defendant appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment arguing that the plaintiff was a \u201ckeeper\u201d of the dog as defined in \u00a7 22-327 and, therefore, could not recover pursuant to \u00a7 22-357, because \u201ckeepers\u201d are not within the class of persons that the legislature intended to protect by the enactment of \u00a7 22-357. The Appellate Court agreed with the defendant, concluding that the trial court\u2019s finding that the plaintiff was not a \u201ckeeper\u201d was clearly erroneous, and that a \u201ckeeper\u201d could not recover under the statute. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Buonato, </em>42 Conn. App. 239, 246, 250, 679 A.2d 411 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">We granted certification limited to the following question: \u201cDid the Appellate Court correctly conclude that the plaintiff was a \u2018keeper\u2019 under General Statutes \u00a7 22-237 and prohibited from recovering from the dog\u2019s owner for injuries caused by the dog when the plaintiff was temporarily caring for the dog at the owner\u2019s request?\u201d <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Buonato, </em>239 Conn. 935, 684 A.2d 708 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">After examining the record on appeal and after considering the briefs and arguments of the parties, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>conclude that the judgment of the Appellate Court should be affirmed. The issue on which we granted certification was properly resolved in the Appellate Court\u2019s majority opinion. It would serve no purpose for us to repeat the discussion contained therein. See <em>Gajewski </em>v. <em>Pavelo, </em>236 Conn. 27, 30, 670 A.2d 318 (1996); <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Wyatt, Inc., </em>230 Conn. 12, 16, 644 A.2d 871 (1994); <em>Whisper Wind Development Corp. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>229 Conn. 176, 177, 640 A.2d 100 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b342-11\"> The plaintiffs complaint named Charles A. Buonato, Jr., Charles A. Buonato, Sr., and Kim Fiore as defendants. The complaint was later withdrawn as to Buonato, Sr., and Fiore.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b342-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 22-357 provides: \u201cDamage to person or property.

If a minor, on whose behalf an action under this section is brought, was under seven years of age at the time the damage was done, it shall be presumed that such minor was not committing a trespass or other tort, or teasing, tormenting or abusing such dog, and the burden of proof thereof shall be upon the defendant in such action.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b343-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 22-327 provides in relevant part: \u201c(6) \u2018Keeper\u2019 means any person, other than the owner, harboring or having in his possession any dog . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
