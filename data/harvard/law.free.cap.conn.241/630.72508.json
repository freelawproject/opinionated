J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7y\">The principal issue in this appeal is whether the trial court properly concluded that the plaintiffs suffered an \u201cascertainable loss of money or property,\u201d as required to maintain an action pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which is part of the Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>necticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), as the result of the installation of several video surveillance cameras by the named defendant, Daniel Quinn, on his property. The cameras were focused on the front entrances to the plaintiffs\u2019 two neighboring business establishments. We conclude, inter alia, that the trial court properly determined that the plaintiffs suffered an ascertainable loss as a result of Quinn\u2019s actions. We therefore affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">The record reveals the following facts. At all relevant times, the plaintiffs, Service Road Corporation and Cousin Vinnie\u2019s, Inc., operated adjacent exotic dance clubs, known as Uncle Al\u2019s and Cousin Vinnie\u2019s, at 145 and 147 West Service Road in Hartford. Quinn operated an adult bookstore known as Danny\u2019s Adult Book World next to Uncle Al\u2019s and Cousin Vinnie\u2019s at 151 West Service Road. During the time period in question, Quinn also owned and operated two exotic dance clubs, one, known as Kahoots, located in East Hartford, the other, known as Carrie-Ann\u2019s, located in Vernon. Both Kahoots and Carrie-Ann\u2019s competed with Uncle Al\u2019s and Cousin Vinnie\u2019s for patrons. The other defendant in this case, Gordon Debigare, worked for Quinn as the manager of Kahoots.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">On September 7, 1993, the plaintiffs, through their attorney, notified Quinn and the Hartford police department that customers of Danny\u2019s Adult Book World had been engaging in sexual activity and drug use at the rear of Quinn\u2019s property at 151 West Service Road. Approximately two weeks later, Quinn installed two video surveillance cameras on the south side of his building, which faced the north side of the plaintiffs\u2019 building, where the front entrances to both Uncle Al\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>and Cousin Vinnie\u2019s were located. One of the cameras was situated so that it pointed directly at, and focused on, the front door of Uncle Al\u2019s, the other so that it pointed directly at, and focused on, the front door of Cousin Vinnie\u2019s. A short time later, Quinn installed additional cameras on his building, four of which also focused on the front doorways of Uncle Al\u2019s and Cousin Vinnie\u2019s. Sometime in October, 1993, Debigare contacted at least two patrons of the plaintiffs\u2019 clubs and informed them that he had seen them entering the plaintiffs\u2019 clubs on the security television attached to the surveillance cameras at 151 West Service Road. Debigare also provided several of the plaintiffs\u2019 patrons with free drink coupons that were redeemable at Kahoots. In addition, Debigare assisted in posting advertisements for Carrie-Ann\u2019s on the side of the building at 151 West Service Road that faced the front entrances of Uncle Al\u2019s and Cousin Vinnie\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">The plaintiffs filed a two count complaint and an application for a temporary injunction against the defendants in the trial court. In the first count of their complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants\u2019 actions tortiously interfered with the plaintiffs\u2019 business, causing them irreparable loss and damage. In the second count of the complaint, the plaintiffs claimed that the defendants\u2019 actions constituted unfair and deceptive acts and practices in the conduct of trade or commerce, in violation of CUTPA, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 42-110a through 42-110q. In the first count, the plaintiffs sought damages, costs and temporary and permanent injunctions ordering the defendants to remove the cameras, or to adjust them so that they did not focus on the plaintiffs\u2019 property. In addition, the plaintiffs sought temporary and permanent injunctions ordering the defendants to refrain from contacting the plaintiffs\u2019 customers. In the CUTPA count, the plaintiffs sought both economic and punitive damages, temporary and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>permanent injunctive relief, attorney\u2019s fees and costs, all under \u00a7 42-1 lOg. Thereafter, the plaintiffs amended their complaint by removing from both counts any claim for economic damages.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Before trial, the parties stipulated to the entry of a temporary injunction against the defendants requiring the defendants to adjust the cameras that were capable of viewing the premises at 145 and 147. West Service Road so that at all times the cameras pointed downward at an angle of less than fifty degrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">After a court trial, the trial court issued a memorandum of decision in which it found for the defendants on the first count of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint and for the plaintiffs on the second count. The court concluded that Quinn\u2019s actions constituted an unfair trade practice in violation of \u00a7 42-110b.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court issued the permanent injunction sought by the plaintiffs,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and also determined that the plaintiffs were entitled to attorney\u2019s fees and costs from Quinn. The court found that at all times <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>Debigare had acted simply as Quinn\u2019s agent and declined to award attorney\u2019s fees against him. The court also, in the exercise of its discretion, declined to award the plaintiffs punitive damages. On January 1, 1997, the court rendered judgment in accordance with its memorandum of decision and awarded the plaintiffs attorney\u2019s fees against Quinn in the stipulated amount of $14,930.30. The defendants appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The defendants claim that the second count of the plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint, which alleged a CUTPA violation, was insufficient as a matter of law because it contained no allegation that the plaintiffs had suffered an economic loss as a result of the defendants\u2019 conduct. The defendants contend that a plaintiff claiming a CUTPA violation in the context of a competitive business relationship must allege some economic loss in order to satisfy the ascertainable loss requirement of \u00a7 42-1 lOg. They claim that the plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint did not include such an allegation. In addition, the defendants claim that the trial court\u2019s factual determination that the plaintiffs had suffered an ascertainable loss was clearly erroneous in light of the evidence presented at trial. Consequently, they contend that the trial court\u2019s judgment ordering a permanent injunction and awarding the plaintiffs attorney\u2019s fees must be reversed. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">As an initial matter, we decline to address the defendants\u2019 arguments concerning the legal sufficiency of the plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint at this late stage of the proceedings. \u201c[A] judgment ordinarily cures pleading defects .... The absence of a requisite allegation in a complaint that would have justified the granting of a motion to strike ... is not a sufficient basis for vacating a judgment unless the pleading defect has resulted in prejudice. [I]f parties will insist on going to trial on issues framed in a slovenly manner, they must abide the verdict; judgment will not be arrested for faults in statement when facts sufficient to support the judgment have been substantially put in issue and found. . . . Want of precision in alleging the cause of an injury for which an action is brought, is waived by contesting the case upon its merits without questioning such defect.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Normand Josef Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut National Bank, </em>230 Conn. 486, 497, 646 A.2d 1289 (1994); see also <em>Tedesco </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>215 Conn. 450, 458, 576 A.2d 1273 (1990), on remand, 24 Conn. App. 377, 588 A.2d 656 (1991), rev\u2019d, 222 Conn. 233, 610 A.2d 574 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">Instead of submitting a motion to strike the plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint, the defendants waited until the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence and then moved, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 302,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> for a judgment of dismissal for failure of the plaintiffs to make out a prima facie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, the defendants challenged the sufficiency of the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence rather than the sufficiency of their pleading. Because the defendants did not raise their argument concerning the sufficiency of the plaintiffs\u2019 pleading in the trial court and have failed to demonstrate that they in any way were prejudiced by the plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we conclude that the defendants have waived this claim. <em>Normand Josef Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut National Bank, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 496-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">The defendants next contend that the trial court improperly concluded that the plaintiffs had sustained their burden of proving that they had suffered an ascertainable loss of money or property as required by \u00a7 42-110g. The defendants do not find fault with the trial court\u2019s determination that Quinn\u2019s actions constituted an unfair trade practice in violation of \u00a7 42-110b. They argue, rather, that the trial court committed clear error in concluding that the plaintiffs had proven that they had suffered an ascertainable loss as a result of Quinn\u2019s installation of the surveillance cameras. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">We begin our analysis with the principle that CUTPA \u201cis remedial in character . . . and must be liberally construed in favor of those whom the legislature intended to benefit.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fink </em>v. <em>Golenbock, </em>238 Conn. 183, 213, 680 A.2d 1243 (1996). In <em>Larsen Chelsey Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Larsen, </em>232 Conn. 480, 496-99, 656 A.2d 1009 (1995), we reaffirmed the principle, first stated in <em>McLaughlin Ford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ford, Motor Co., </em>192 Conn. 558, 566-67, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>473 A.2d 1185 (1984), that CUTPA was designed to provide protection to businesses as well as to consumers.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cCUTPA is not limited to conduct involving consumer injury. ... [A] competitor or other business person can maintain a CUTPA cause of action without showing consumer injury.\u201d <em>McLaughlin Ford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>supra, 566-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Section 42-110b (a) prohibits persons from engaging in \u201cunfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\u201d Section 42-110g (a) affords a cause of action to \u201c[a]ny person who suffers any ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of the use or employment of a method, act or practice prohibited by section 42-110b . . . .\u201d We have stated that \u201c[t]he ascertainable loss requirement is a threshold barrier which limits the class of persons who may bring a CUTPA action seeking either actual damages or equitable relief.\u201d <em>Hinchliffe </em>v. <em>American Motors Corp., </em>184 Conn. 607, 615, 440 A.2d 810 (1981). An ascertainable loss is a \u201cdeprivation, detriment [or] injury\u201d that is \u201ccapable of being discovered, observed or established.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 613. \u201c[A] loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>is ascertainable if it is measurable even though the precise amount of the loss is not known. . . . Under CUTPA, there is no need to allege or prove the amount of the ascertainable loss.\u201d Id., 614. A plaintiff need not \u201cprove a specific amount of actual damages in order to make out a prima facie case [under CUTPA].\u201d Id., 612-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the validity of the trial court\u2019s finding that the plaintiffs suffered an ascertainable loss. In its memorandum of decision, the trial court stated: \u201cAt trial, representatives of the plaintiffs testified that they had no evidence that Quinn\u2019s actions caused them a loss of profits. This may be due in part to the entry of a temporary injunction on April 22,1994, under the terms of which the cameras were pointed away from the plaintiffs\u2019 front doorways. Not surprisingly, the plaintiffs also failed to present the testimony of any patron or prospective patron concerning the effect Quinn\u2019s cameras had on their willingness to enter the plaintiffs\u2019 exotic dance clubs. <em>Nevertheless, the court finds that Quinn\u2019s cameras, when pointed at the entrance to the plaintiffs\u2019 exotic dance clubs, were intended to and probably would have a negative impact on the plaintiff s\u2019 business because they would deter certain prospective patrons from entering the clubs.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">The plaintiffs had the burden to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that they suffered an ascertainable loss of money or property as the result of the defendants\u2019 actions. In order to satisfy that burden, the plaintiffs needed to convince the trial court that it was more likely than not that the plaintiffs suffered such a loss. See <em>Tianti </em>v. <em>William Raveis Real Estate, Inc., </em>231 Conn. 690, 701, 651 A.2d 1286 (1995). A fair reading of the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision indicates that the court was persuaded that it was more likely than not that Quinn\u2019s installation of cameras on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>building at 151 West Service Road and the monitoring of the entrances to the plaintiffs\u2019 establishments caused prospective patrons to refrain from entering the plaintiffs\u2019 establishments. The trial court found that Quinn\u2019s actions \u201cprobably would have a negative impact on the plaintiffs\u2019 business because they would deter certain prospective patrons from entering the clubs.\u201d We read this to mean that the trial court found, as a matter of fact, that Quinn\u2019s installation of cameras did deter prospective customers from patronizing the plaintiffs\u2019 establishments. The defendants claim that this factual finding is not supported by the evidence that was adduced at trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">\u201c[A] trial court\u2019s findings are binding upon this court unless they are clearly erroneous in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the record as a whole. . . . We cannot retry the facts or pass on the credibility of the witnesses. ... A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. . . . <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>Danforth, </em>222 Conn. 150, 156, 609 A.2d 654 (1992); see also <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 220, 435 A.2d 24 (1980).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United Components, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wdowiak, </em>239 Conn. 259, 263, 684 A.2d 693 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">\u201cIt is axiomatic that the trier of fact may draw reasonable and logical inferences from the facts proven. . . . In doing so, finders of fact are not expected to lay aside matters of common knowledge or their own observation and experience of the affairs of life, but, on the contrary, to apply them to the evidence or facts in hand, to the end that their action may be intelligent and their conclusions correct .... Our review of the fact finder\u2019s inferences is limited to determining whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>inferences drawn are so unreasonable as to be unjustifiable.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tianti </em>v. <em>William Raveis Real Estate, Inc., </em>supra, 231 Conn. 700-701. \u201cIn a civil case, proof of a material fact by inference from circumstantial evidence need not be so conclusive as to exclude every other hypothesis. It is sufficient if the evidence produces in the mind of the trier a reasonable belief in the probability of the existence of the material fact.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co., N.A. </em>v. <em>Reckert, </em>33 Conn. App. 702, 704-705, 638 A.2d 44 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">We conclude that the trial court reasonably could have inferred from the evidence presented during the trial that the defendants\u2019 actions caused prospective patrons to refrain from entering the plaintiffs\u2019 establishments at 145 and 147 West Service Road. The plaintiffs had presented evidence that they operated two exotic dance clubs at those addresses. They also presented evidence, which the trial court found credible, that Quinn had installed the surveillance cameras on his building at 151 West Service Road with the intention of interfering with the plaintiffs\u2019 establishments.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>addition, the plaintiffs presented evidence that the cameras on the building at 151 West Service Road were visible to a person standing in the entrances to both Uncle Al\u2019s and Cousin Vinnie\u2019s and that such a person would believe that he or she was being filmed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moreover, the plaintiffs presented Alan Tannenbaum, the treasurer of Service Road Corporation and the president of Cousin Vinnie\u2019s, Inc., who testified that the cameras on Quinn\u2019s building at 151 West Service Road intimidated customers of Uncle Al\u2019s and Cousin Vinnie\u2019s, Inc. Tannenbaum testified that a number of patrons had informed him that they made sure that they entered his establishments with their backs toward Quinn\u2019s cameras. He also testified that he believed that some patrons had not entered his establishments because of the cameras, but that he did not know of any particular patrons who had refrained from doing so.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We conclude, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>the basis of the totality of the evidence presented at trial, that the trial court\u2019s factual determination that Quinn\u2019s installation of cameras on the building at 151 West Service Road deterred prospective patrons from entering the plaintiffs\u2019 establishments was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">We next address the question of whether the trial court\u2019s factual finding satisfied the ascertainable loss requirement of \u00a7 42-110g. We have never addressed the meaning of the phrase \u201cascertainable loss\u201d in a similar context, in which one business owner claims that another has engaged in an intentional unfair trade practice that has caused the first business to lose potential customers.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Nevertheless, we conclude that, in the business context, a plaintiff asserting a CUTPA claim may satisfy the ascertainable loss requirement of \u00a7 42-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>110g by establishing, through a reasonable inference, or otherwise, that the defendant\u2019s unfair trade practice has caused the plaintiff to lose potential customers. A loss of prospective customers constitutes a \u201cdeprivation, detriment [or] injury\u201d that is \u201ccapable of being discovered, observed or established.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hinchliffe </em>v. <em>American Motors Corp., </em>supra, 184 Conn. 613. Such a loss appears to be precisely the type of business injury for which the legislature intended to provide redress when it enacted CUTPA. <em>See Larsen Chelsey Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Larsen, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 496-97. The fact that a plaintiff fails to prove a particular loss or the extent of the loss does not foreclose the plaintiff from obtaining <em>injunctive relief </em>and attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to CUTPA if the plaintiff is able to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that an unfair trade practice has occurred and a reasonable inference can be drawn by the trier of fact that the unfair trade practice has resulted in a loss to the plaintiff. In the present case, the trial court found that the defendants engaged in an intentional unfair trade practice and drew the reasonable inference that the unfair trade practice had caused the plaintiffs to lose potential customers. We conclude, therefore, that the plaintiffs satisfied their burden of proving that they had suffered an ascertainable loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">After properly finding that the plaintiffs had suffered an ascertainable loss as the result of the defendants\u2019 unfair trade practices, the trial court exercised its discretion, pursuant to \u00a7 42-110g, to issue a permanent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>injunction and to award the plaintiffs attorney\u2019s fees.

The court agrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">\u201cQuinn has claimed that he installed the cameras purely for security reasons. However, the court does not find that claim to be credible. A disproportionately large number of the video cameras were placed on the side of Quinn\u2019s building which was nearest to Uncle Al\u2019s and Cousin Vinnie\u2019s with no camera surveillance of the [entrance] to Quinn\u2019s store or its main parking lot.

The trial court found, however, that the plaintiff had not lost any potential customers as a result of the defendant\u2019s actions. Id., 749.

Our analysis in <em>Hinchliffe, </em>therefore, does not provide us with an answer to the question posed in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b667-8\">KATZ, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A47\">dissenting. I agree with the majority as to the meaning of \u201cascertainable loss\u201d in the context of a claim pursuant to the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA); General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq.; and how such loss may be proven without presenting evidence of specific economic losses. I disagree, however, with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the trial court correctly found that the plaintiffs had suffered an ascertainable loss entitling them to seek an injunction and attorney\u2019s fees under CUTPA, in light of the trial court\u2019s conclusion in its memorandum of decision that there had been no evidence presented to support a finding that the plaintiffs had suffered any loss whatsoever.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I believe that the record demonstrates that the plaintiffs proved only that there was an unfair trade practice and that the offending practice was undertaken with the intent that they should suffer such a loss.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">\u201cUnder CUTPA, \u2018[t]he ascertainable loss requirement is a threshold barrier which limits the class of persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>who may bring a CUTPA action seeking either actual damages or equitable relief.\u2019 . . . <em>Hinchliffe </em>v. <em>American Motors </em>Corporation, 184 Conn. 607, 615, 440 A.2d 810 (1981).\u201d <em>Conaway </em>v. <em>Prestia, </em>191 Conn. 484, 494, 464 A.2d 847 (1983). To allow the unfair trade practice itself to be offered as proof of that loss would negate the effect of having such a threshold requirement. In this case, it is clear from the trial court\u2019s comments that it based its findings in regard to ascertainable loss on the fact that there was an unfair trade practice and that the practice was apparently intended to deter customers from entering the plaintiffs\u2019 businesses. I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that this evidence was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">As an initial matter, I acknowledge that our review of the trial court\u2019s findings is limited. \u201c[W]e will upset a factual determination of the trial court only if it is clearly erroneous. The trial court\u2019s findings are binding upon this court unless they are clearly erroneous in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the record as a whole .... We cannot retry the facts or pass on the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>24 Leggett Street Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Beacon Industries, Inc., </em>239 Conn. 284, 301, 685 A.2d 305 (1996). This limited review does not mean, however, that we may not conclude that the trial court\u2019s findings were purely speculative, and had no basis in the evidence adduced at trial. \u201cA finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. . . . <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>Danforth, </em>222 Conn. 150, 156, 609 A.2d 654 (1992); see also <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 220, 435 A.2d 24 (1980). . . . <em>Groton </em>v. <em>Yankee Gas Services Co., </em>224 Conn. 675, 691, 620 A.2d 771 (1993).\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>(Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>24 Leggett Street Ltd.

It is true that such proof may be inferred from the circumstances of the case. \u201cThe test of the sufficiency of proof by circumstantial evidence [however] is whether rational minds could reasonably and logically draw the inference. . . .

An inference must have some definite basis in the facts.

A review of the entire evidence, however, reveals that such a finding has no basis in fact but, rather, is purely speculative and, therefore, clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">In 195 pages of trial transcript, only two pages contain testimony from the plaintiffs related to possible, ascertainable, losses. Alan Tannenbaum, the treasurer of the named plaintiff Service Road Corporation and the president of the plaintiff Cousin Vinnie\u2019s Backroom, Inc., testified that the cameras intimidated customers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>asked if he knew this for a fact, however, he was unable to point to any single instance of a customer being deterred from entering the club. In fact, the <em>only </em>evidence Tannenbaum presented concerning customer intimidation was that \u201ca couple of people\u201d had told him that they were aware of the cameras but, nevertheless, had entered the clubs, albeit with their backs to the cameras. When asked if customers were still coming to the clubs, Tannenbaum could only respond: \u201cSome people haven\u2019t, I\u2019m sure.\u201d The only other discussion as to the possible intimidation of customers was in Quinn\u2019s testimony, wherein he was asked by the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney to comment on whether he believed that the cameras he had installed might have an effect on the plaintiffs\u2019 businesses.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> No evidence, direct or circumstantial, was adduced in either colloquy to support even an inference that customers were actually deterred by the presence of the cameras, or any other actions by the defendants, from entering the plaintiffs\u2019 businesses. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>Indeed, any finding to such effect is merely speculation built upon speculation, because the plaintiffs themselves had admitted that they did not know whether they had lost any customers or business <em>or </em>whether any such loss, even if ascertainable, could be attributed to the defendants\u2019 actions. Rather than relying on the evidence before it, the trial court, in effect, concluded that, as a matter of law, the existence of the cameras would have a detrimental effect on the plaintiffs\u2019 businesses and, therefore, <em>did </em>have a detrimental effect on the plaintiffs\u2019 business. Such a conclusion dispenses with the requirement of CUTPA that the plaintiffs prove an ascertainable loss in addition to proving an unfair trade practice causing such a loss. See footnote 2 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b667-10\"> In its memorandum of decision, the trial court stated: \u201cAt trial, representatives of the plaintiffs testified that they had no evidence that [the named defendant Daniel] Quinn\u2019s actions caused them a loss of profits. . . . [T]he plaintiffs also failed to present the testimony of any patron or prospective patron concerning the effect Quinn\u2019s cameras had on their willingness to enter the plaintiffs\u2019 exotic dance clubs.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b667-11\"> Although I understand that it was not the intent of the majority, I am nevertheless concerned that, because this decision relies on evidence that proves only that there was an unfair trade practice, the court\u2019s holding may be read to support the argument that a plaintiff may prove an ascertainable loss entitling him or her to relief under CUTPA merely by proving that there was an unfair trade practice undertaken with the intent to bring about such a loss.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b670-7\"> During cross-examination by the defendants\u2019 attorney, Tannenbaum testified regarding his belief as to the effect the cameras may have had on potential customers:</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">\u201cQ.

I can\u2019t tell you for a fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b670-20\">Neither of the plaintiffs testified on direct examination regarding the possible loss of customers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b671-6\"> The transcript contains the following colloquy between Quinn and the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney:</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">\u201cQ. Okay. Sir, when those cameras were installed ... did you take into account the possible effect these cameras may have had on customers of [the plaintiffs]?</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">\u201cA. Absolutely not.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">\u201cQ. Why not?</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">\u201cA. Well, I have cameras on all my businesses, including the exterior.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">\u201cQ.

They do? Okay, sir, do you think that the kind of business that [the plaintiffs] are engaged in, similar to your own, would make a difference in deciding whether or not a patron or customer might be troubled by having a housing or housings pointed at him or at her?</p>\n<p id=\"b671-14\">\u201cA. Absolutely not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-15\">Following this colloquy, the trial court interrupted Quinn\u2019s testimony to state that, notwithstanding Quinn\u2019s opinion, it found that the plaintiffs\u2019 establishments were such that \u201chaving a camera trained on you as you\u2019re entering or exiting, the nature of the business could well make a difference and that people might not want to have a camera due to the nature of the business.
