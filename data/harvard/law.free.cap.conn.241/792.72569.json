The defendant, New Hampshire Insurance Company, appeals from the judgment of the trial court upholding the ruling by an arbitration panel that the defendant, the insurer of Jim\u2019s Auto Repair (Jim\u2019s Auto), and not the borrower\u2019s insurer, was required to provide primary uninsured motorist coverage to the plaintiff, George Sandor. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">The following undisputed facts are relevant to this appeal. On December 31, 1992, Jim\u2019s Auto loaned to Ralph Masselli a motor vehicle for the purpose of taking a test drive. The plaintiff, Masselli\u2019s brother-in-law, accompanied Masselli on the test drive and was injured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>when the loaned motor vehicle that Masselli was driving collided with a motor vehicle owned and negligently operated by Dawn Cappellieri. Masselli was not at fault in the collision. At the time of the accident, neither the plaintiff nor Cappellieri was insured. Masselli was insured under an automobile policy issued by the Aetna Insurance Company (Aetna), that provided $25,000 in liability coverage and $25,000 in uninsured motorist coverage for each of the two vehicles that Masselli owned. Jim\u2019s Auto was insured under a garage policy issued by the defendant that provided $100,000 in liability coverage and $100,000 in uninsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">The plaintiff sought uninsured motorist benefits under the policy issued to Jim\u2019s Auto by the defendant, but the defendant denied coverage. Thereafter, the plaintiff applied to the trial court for an order to proceed with arbitration. The trial court granted the application. On December 13, 1995, a panel of three arbitrators conducted a hearing to determine whether the defendant was required to provide primary uninsured motorist coverage to the plaintiff. At the hearing, both the plaintiff and the defendant stipulated that a question of law existed as to the applicability of \u00a7 14-60 (a) to the determination of whether the defendant\u2019s uninsured motorist insurance was primary. The parties also agreed throughout the proceedings that the uninsured motorist coverage provided by the defendant to the dealer plainly applied, as a contractual matter, to the plaintiff. The only question before the arbitrators was whether the terms of \u00a7 14-60 (a) abrogated the defendant\u2019s contractual obligation under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">The arbitration panel concluded that the defendant was required to provide primary uninsured motorist coverage to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant subsequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>filed an application with the trial court to vacate, correct or modify the arbitrators\u2019 award on the ground that \u00a7 14-60 (a) requires the policy issued to Masselli, as the borrower of the loaned motor vehicle, to be the primary source of uninsured motorist benefits for the plaintiff. On the basis of its review of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 38a-336 (d)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 14-60 (a), the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion. The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly upheld the arbitration panel\u2019s conclusion that the defendant should provide primary uninsured motorist coverage to the plaintiff. The defendant argues that, under \u00a7 14-60 (a), the automobile insurance policy issued to Masselli as the borrower of the loaned motor vehicle is the primary source of uninsured motorist coverage for the plaintiff. We are unpersuaded and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim requires us to decide for the first time whether, in setting forth the priority of a borrower\u2019s liability and property insurance, \u00a7 14-60 (a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>also establishes the priority of a borrower\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage. In resolving this issue, \u201cwe seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of this case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, \u2018we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u2019 \u201d <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>240 Conn. 422, 431, 692 A.2d 742 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">We note at the onset that the legislature has imposed broad liability for many years on lenders of automobiles for injuries arising out of the misuse of their automobiles. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 14-154a; <em>Gionfriddo </em>v. <em>Avis Rent A Car System, Inc., </em>192 Conn. 280, 472 A.2d 306 (1984). Because the plaintiff\u2019s injury resulted from the misuse of a third party\u2019s automobile, the legislative objective embodied in \u00a7 14-154a is not directly implicated in this case. Nonetheless, the legislature\u2019s broad policy of holding lenders responsible for injuries associated with the use of their automobiles directs us to construe narrowly those statutes that limit lender liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">With this principle in mind, we consider the language of the statute. Section 14-60 (a) permits an automobile dealer to lend a motor vehicle for the purpose of demonstration \u201cprovided such person shall furnish proof to the dealer or repairer that he has liability and property damage insurance which will cover any damage to any person or property <em>caused by the operation of the loaned motor vehicle </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) This clause has been part of \u00a7 14-60 (a) since 1959; see Public Acts 1959, No. 499, \u00a7 1; and it emphasizes the responsibility of the borrower\u2019s insurer for any damage <em>caused </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number><em>by </em>the borrower in the operation of the loaned motor vehicle. In 1961, the legislature amended \u00a7 14-60 (a) to require that the automobile Lability and property insurance of the borrower of a motor vehicle loaned by the dealer is the primary source of coverage. See Public Acts 1961, No. 277, \u00a7 1; <em>Whitfield </em>v. <em>Empire Mutual Ins. Co., </em>167 Conn. 499, 505, 356 A.2d 139 (1975). The legislature again amended \u00a7 14-60 (a) in 1973 \u201cto clarify the consequences of a dealer\u2019s violation of the statute . . . .\u201d <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Collins Chevrolet, Inc., </em>199 Conn. 245, 249, 506 A.2d 1035 (1986). The provision added in 1973 requires that, if the borrower does not have any automobile liability or property insurance, the borrower and the dealer are <em>\u201cjointly liable </em>for any damage to any person or property <em>caused </em>by the operation of such loaned motor vehicle . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Public Acts 1973, No. 73-233. The statute reflects the legislative effort to protect the public from reckless driving of loaned motor vehicles. See 8 S. Proc., Pt. 6, 1959 Sess., pp. 2595-96. By giving an injured person the statutory right to recover from the borrower\u2019s insurer when the borrower is at fault, \u00a7 14-60 (a) provides an incentive to those who test drive motor vehicles to drive with the same care that they would exercise if they were driving a motor vehicle they owned.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">As the defendant concedes, although \u00a7 14-60 (a) establishes the priority of a borrower\u2019s automobile liability and property insurance, the statute is silent about uninsured motorist insurance. The defendant nevertheless argues that, because the legislature has required uninsured motorist insurance to be included in all automobile insurance liability policies since 1967, the references in \u00a7 14-60 (a) to liability and property insurance must be read to include uninsured motorist coverage. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">The Connecticut uninsured motorist statute, \u00a7 38a-336, formerly General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 38-175c, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>requires that \u201c[e]ach automobile liability insurance policy shall provide insurance, herein called uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage . . . for the protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles and underinsured motor vehicles and insured motor vehicles, the insurer of which becomes insolvent prior to payment of such damages, because of bodily injury, including death resulting therefrom. . . .\u201d The accompanying regulation, \u00a7 38a-334-6 (a) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies provides that the \u201cinsurer shall undertake to pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall be legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle because of bodily injury sustained by the insured caused by an accident involving the uninsured motor vehicle. This coverage shall insure the occupants of every motor vehicle to which the bodily injury liability coverage applies. . . .\u201d The defendant contends that, in order to construe \u00a7 14-60 (a) coherently and consistently with \u00a7 38a-336, we must interpret the references to liability and property insurance in \u00a7 14-60 (a) to include uninsured motorist insurance and that, therefore, we must conclude that primary coverage in this case is that afforded by the Aetna policy issued to Masselli.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">A careful analysis of the language and legislative history of \u00a7\u00a7 14-60 (a) and 38a-336 persuades us, to the contraiy, that the legislature did not intend the references to liability and property insurance in \u00a7 14-60 (a) to include uninsured motorist coverage. First, we note as a general matter that uninsured motorist insurance operates upon a different set of principles from those upon which automobile liability and property insurance are premised, and that uninsured motorist insurance protects the named insured against risks that are fundamentally different from liability and property insurance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>Automobile liability and property insurance covers damage to other persons or motor vehicles for which the named insured or named insured\u2019s covered motor vehicle is, at least in some measure, responsible. See R. Keeton &amp; A. Widiss, Insurance Law (1988) \u00a7 4.8 (a), pp. 376-77 and \u00a7 4.9 (a), pp. 385-86. In contrast, \u201cthe purpose of [unjinsured motorist coverage is to protect the named insured and other additional insureds from suffering an inadequately compensated injury caused by an accident with an inadequately insured automobile.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Florestal </em>v. <em>Government Employees Ins. Co., </em>236 Conn. 299, 305, 673 A.2d 474 (1996). The public policy established by the uninsured motorist statute is to ensure that an insured recovers damages he or she would have been able to recover if the uninsured motorist had maintained a policy of liability insurance. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of America, </em>225 Conn. 566, 573, 624 A.2d 892 (1993); <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>188 Conn. 245, 249, 449 A.2d 157 (1982). Because uninsured motorist insurance operates upon principles that are different from those on which liability and property insurance are premised, we do not agree with the defendant\u2019s contention that, as a matter of cogent statutory interpretation, all references in \u00a7 14-60 (a) to automobile liability and property insurance also must include uninsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Second, the text of the uninsured motorist statute provides compelling support for our conclusion that the legislature did not intend to include uninsured motorist coverage within the ambit of \u00a7 14-60 (a). Subsection (d) of \u00a7 38a-336, which became effective on January 1, 1994, provides in relevant part: \u201cIf a person insured for uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage is an occupant of a nonowned vehicle covered by a policy also providing uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage, the coverage of the occupied vehicle shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>primary and any coverage for which such person is a named insured shall be secondary. All other applicable policies shall be excess. . . .\u201d This amendment establishes the priority of multiple uninsured motorist policies by providing that the policy of the host motor vehicle is primary, the policy under which the occupant is a named insured is secondary, and all other policies for which the occupant may be an insured, such as a resident relative, are excess. Although the plaintiff in this case was uninsured at the time of the accident and, therefore, the priorities established by \u00a7 38a-336 (d) do not control this case, \u00a7 38a-336 (d) informs our interpretation of \u00a7 14-60 (a). If we were to accept the defendant\u2019s argument that \u00a7 14-60 (a) applies to priorities of uninsured motorist policies, we would create a direct conflict between \u00a7 14-60 (a) and \u00a7 38a-336 (d) in those cases in which an insured passenger in an insured vehicle loaned by an automobile dealership to an insured borrower is involved in an accident caused by an uninsured motorist. According to the defendant, \u00a7 14-60 (a) would require that the borrower\u2019s uninsured policy provide primary coverage for the plaintiffs injuries. In the same situation, however, \u00a7 38a-336 (d) would require that the dealership\u2019s uninsured policy provide primary coverage for the plaintiffs injuries. We are unwilling to create such an anomaly by accepting the defendant\u2019s argument. See <em>Stein </em>v. <em>Hillebrand, </em>240 Conn. 35, 42-43, 688 A.2d 1317 (1997) (legislature presumed to have knowledge of existing laws and presumed to intend to create harmonious body of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Finally, we are unpersuaded that a construction of \u00a7 14-60 (a) to include uninsured motorist coverage would serve to effect the legislative policy embodied in \u00a7 14-60 (a). In providing that the borrower\u2019s liability and property insurance is to be the primary source of coverage, \u00a7 14-60 (a) reflects the legislative effort to encourage careful driving of motor vehicles loaned by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>dealers. Uninsured motorist insurance protects against harm caused by an. inadequately insured third party, rather than providing coverage for damage that the insured causes. We cannot conceive how construing the references to liability and property insurance in \u00a7 14-60 (a) to include uninsured motorist coverage would enhance the fundamental purpose of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">In light of the plain language, history and legislative purpose of \u00a7\u00a7 14-60 (a) and 38a-336 (d), we conclude that the legislature did not intend to include uninsured motorist coverage within the liability and property insurance coverage provisions of \u00a7 14-60 (a). The defendant\u2019s sole claim on appeal is that the arbitration panel failed to apply \u00a7 14-60 (a) in deciding that the defendant was required to provide primary uninsured motorist coverage to the plaintiff. Having concluded that \u00a7 14-60 (a) has no bearing on the resolution of this issue, we affirm the trial court\u2019s decision not to vacate the arbitrators\u2019 award.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b815-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-60 (a) provides: \u201cNo dealer or repairer may <em>rent or </em>allow or cause to be rented, or operate or allow or cause to be operated for hire, or use or allow or cause to be used for the purpose of conveying passengers or merchandise or freight for hire, any motor vehicle registered under a general distinguishing number and mark. No dealer or repairer may loan a motor vehicle or number plate or both to any person except for the purpose of demonstration of a motor vehicle, or when a motor vehicle owned by or lawfully in the custody of such person is undergoing repairs, or when such person has purchased a motor vehicle, the registration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>which by him is pending, and in any case for not more than thirty days in any year, provided such person shall furnish proof to the dealer or repairer that he has liability and property damage insurance which will cover any damage to any person or property caused by the operation of the loaned motor vehicle, motor vehicle on which the loaned number plate is displayed or both. Such person\u2019s insurance shall be the prime coverage. If the person to whom the dealer or repairer loaned the motor vehicle or the number plate did not, at the time of such loan, have in force any such liability and property damage insurance, such person and such dealer or repairer shall be jointly liable for any damage to any person or property caused by the operation of the loaned motor vehicle or a motor vehicle on which the loaned number plate is displayed. Each dealer or repairer shall keep a record of each loaned number plate showing the date loaned, the vehicle identification number of the vehicle on which such plate is displayed, the date returned and the name, address and operator\u2019s license number of the person operating any vehicle with such loaned number plate. Such dealer or repairer shall give a copy of this record to each person to whom such plate or vehicle and plate are loaned which shall be carried in the motor vehicle at all times when operated upon a public highway. This record shall be retained by the dealer or repairer for a period of six months from the date on which the number plate or motor vehicle or both were loaned and such record shall be available during business hours for examination by any police officer or inspector designated by the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b817-7\"> Arbitrators Daniel E.

The total amount of uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage recoverable is limited to the highest amount recoverable under the primary policy, the secondary policy or any one of the excess policies. The amount paid under the excess policies shall be apportioned in accordance with the proportion that the limits of each excess policy bear to the total limits of the excess policies. If any person insured for uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage is an occupant of an owned vehicle, the uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage afforded by the policy covering the vehicle occupied at the time of the accident shall be the only uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage available.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
