The claimant, John Doe,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> an employee of the named defendant, the city of Stamford,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appealed from the decision of the compensation review board (review board) affirming the decision of the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner (commissioner). The commissioner had denied the claimant\u2019s application for compensation and his request for an order requiring the defendant to enter into a voluntary agreement with him. We transferred the appeal from the Appellate Court to this court pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>ant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c), and now reverse the judgment of the review board.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">The parties have stipulated to the relevant facts, which arise out of two separate incidents. In the first incident, which occurred in February, 1993, the claimant, a police officer engaged in the performance of police duties, was exposed to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) when medical pads contaminated with body fluids of a criminal suspect came into contact with an open wound on the claimant\u2019s thumb. After the suspect revealed that he had tested positive for HIV, the claimant proceeded immediately to Stamford Hospital, where his wound was treated and he was released. In the second incident, which occurred in May, 1993, the claimant, again while engaged in the performance of police duties, was exposed to tuberculosis when he came into repeated, close physical contact with another criminal suspect who, it was later learned, suffered from an active case of that disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">The claimant subsequently underwent testing for the two diseases. Although he did not test positive for either disease,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> his physician recommended a follow-up consultation with respect to his HIV exposure. In connection with the initial testing, the claimant incurred bills for medical treatment and laboratory work. The defendant has paid for the laboratory services, but not for the medical treatment. With the exception of time lost for the medical testing, the claimant has missed no work as a result of these incidents and claims no loss of income.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">The parties agree that both incidents arose out of and occurred in the course of the claimant\u2019s employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>ment with the defendant. The parties further agree that the claimant\u2019s contacts with both suspects were sufficient to constitute \u201cexposures\u201d to HIV and tuberculosis. Nonetheless, although the claimant filed a timely application for compensation for past and future unpaid medical testing and treatment, the defendant refused his application and refused also to enter into a voluntary agreement with the claimant recognizing the compensability of his exposures. Accordingly, the claimant\u2019s compensation claim proceeded to a formal hearing before the commissioner. See General Statutes \u00a7 31-294c (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">At the hearing, held in May and August, 1994, the principal witness for the claimant was Debra Adler-Klein, a physician specializing in infectious diseases. Adler-Klein testified that an exposure to HIV similar to that sustained by the claimant would, for at least one year thereafter, require regular testing, drug therapy and, potentially, psychological counseling.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> She also testified that an exposure to tuberculosis similar to that sustained by the claimant would require testing and preventive drug therapy for at least six months. The defendant offered no contradictory medical testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">The commissioner denied the claimant\u2019s application for compensation. He found no fault with the claimant\u2019s factual representation but held that, as a matter of law, \u201cmere exposure to infectious diseases does not give rise to a viable claim that the [c]laimant has suffered an injury or occupational disease\u201d under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">The review board affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision. The board agreed with the commissioner that exposure to an infectious disease, without more, constitutes neither a \u201cpersonal injury\u201d nor an \u201coccupational disease\u201d under the act. While recognizing that principles of equity militate against the defendant\u2019s refusal to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>cover the claimant\u2019s medical expenses, the review board concluded that, in the absence of statutory authorization, it could not compel the defendant to fulfill its equitable obligation. One member of the review board dissented.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">On the claimant\u2019s appeal to this court, we must decide whether exposure to an infectious disease constitutes a compensable \u201cinjury\u201d under the act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The claimant contends that, in order to effectuate the act\u2019s humanitarian purposes, \u201cinjury\u201d cannot be defined so narrowly as to exclude a serious risk of contracting a life threatening disease. At least, he argues, the term \u201cinjury\u201d must be construed to include exposures in circumstances under which the prevailing standard of care calls for immediate and ongoing medical monitoring and treatment. The defendant urges us to uphold the decision of the commissioner and the review board. It contends that, in the absence of either visible physical trauma or present loss of income, a claimant has not suffered a compensable injury. We conclude that, under the circumstances of this case, in which the claimant concededly has sustained actual exposures to life threatening infectious diseases in incidents that arose out of and occurred in the course of his employment, the claimant has suffered compensable injuries under the act and may recover the expenses associated with reasonable medical testing and treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">The principles that govern our standard of review in workers\u2019 compensation appeals are well established. \u201cThe conclusions drawn by [the commissioner] from the facts found must stand unless they result from <em>an incorrect application of the law </em>to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>from them.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Besade </em>v. <em>Interstate Security Services, </em>212 Conn. 441, 449, 562 A.2d 1086 (1989). Neither the review board nor this court has the power to retry facts. See <em>Six </em>v. <em>Thomas O\u2019Connor &amp; Co., </em>235 Conn. 790, 798-99, 669 A.2d 1214 (1996). Where, however, the appeal involves an issue of statutory construction that has not yet been subjected to judicial scrutiny, this court has plenary power to review the administrative decision. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>232 Conn. 311, 317, 654 A.2d 1221 (1995) (state agency not entitled to special deference when its construction of statute has not undergone previous judicial scrutiny).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Although the parties have called our attention to the public policy implications of this case, the issue presented is, at bottom, a matter of statutory construction. General Statutes \u00a7 31-294d (a) provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he employer, as soon as he has knowledge of an <em>injury, </em>shall provide a competent physician or surgeon to attend the <em>injured </em>employee and, in addition, shall furnish any medical and surgical aid ... as the physician or surgeon deems reasonable or necessary.\u201d (Emphasis added.) See also General Statutes \u00a7 31-294d (e) (if employer refuses to provide medical assistance, \u201cthe injured employee\u201d may pursue medical assistance at employer\u2019s expense). The defendant does not dispute that the claimant\u2019s exposures to HIV and tuberculosis reasonably require both long and short term medical monitoring. The sole issue, rather, is whether these exposures constitute compensable \u201cinjuries\u201d within the definitional boundaries of the act. We conclude that they do.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">We reach this conclusion mindful both of general principles of statutory construction and of principles specifically applicable to workers\u2019 compensation law. As a general matter, \u201c[o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>legislature.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>230 Conn. 400, 409, 645 A.2d 965 (1994). We discern that intent by looking to the statutory language, to legislative history and policy and to other legislation and common law principles. See id., 409. In appeals arising under workers\u2019 compensation law, we must resolve statutory ambiguities or lacunae in a manner that will further the remedial purpose of the act. See <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>221 Conn. 29, 32, 602 A.2d 560 (1992). Although we recognize that, in enacting workers\u2019 compensation law, the legislature did not intend to create \u201ca general health and benefit insurance program\u201d; id.; we do not read the act to include limitations on eligibility for compensation for which there is no statutory basis. See <em>Crochiere </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>227 Conn. 333, 359, 630 A.2d 1027 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The dispositive statute in this case is General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (16) (A), which defines the term \u201cinjury\u201d to encompass an \u201caccidental injury which may be definitely located as to the time when and the place where the accident occurred . . . .\u201d There is no dispute in this case that the claimant\u2019s exposures to HIV and tuberculosis may be definitely located as to time or place or that they resulted from accidental contact with infected suspects. The commissioner and the review board concluded, however, that, because the claimant had not yet contracted either disease, he had not suffered an \u201cinjury\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 31-275 (16) (A).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">Nothing in the text or the legislative history of the act supports such a limited reading of the statutory definition of \u201cinjury.\u201d See <em>Crochiere </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 359 (\u00a7 31-275 \u201cuses the term \u2018injury\u2019 without limitation\u201d). Although actual infection may be necessary to establish an \u201coccupational disease\u201d as that term is defined in \u00a7 31-275 (15),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the definition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>of \u201cinjury\u201d in \u00a7 31-275 (16) (A) does not require a similar pathological manifestation. Indeed, it would be contrary to the humanitarian and remedial purpose of the act to infer that the legislature intended that an employee who sustains actual exposure to a potentially fatal infectious disease must await the onset of the disease before he can recover expenses associated with necessary,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and possibly lifesaving, medical intervention. See <em>Jackson Township Volunteer Fire Co. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Wallet), </em>594 A.2d 826, 828 (Pa. Commw. 1991).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The defendant raises two alternate grounds in support of the decision of the commissioner and review board. One focuses on the form of the claimant\u2019s injury and the other focuses on the extent of the injury. Neither ground is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">First, the defendant contends that the claimant has not suffered a compensable injury because his expo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>sures were not accompanied by a physical wound or trauma. The defendant concedes that, if, for example, the claimant\u2019s skin had been <em>punctured </em>by a syringe containing blood contaminated with HIV, that puncture would be sufficient to constitute an injury. The defendant contends, however, that, in the absence of similar trauma, the claimant cannot recover under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">The defendant\u2019s argument cannot be reconciled with the undisputed facts in this case. The parties have stipulated that the claimant\u2019s contacts with the contagious suspects were sufficient to constitute \u201cexposures.\u201d The defendant, therefore, cannot be arguing that the contacts were not sufficiently serious to create a risk of infection.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant must be arguing, instead, that the claimant did not suffer an \u201cinjury\u201d because the incidents giving rise to his exposures did not leave a mark, abrasion or other outward sign not already present. The defendant, in effect, invites us to exalt the form of the claimant\u2019s contact with the infected suspects over the substance of the claimed injury. We decline this invitation. For purposes of workers\u2019 compensation law, the injury suffered by the claimant is the <em>exposure </em>to potentially fatal contagious diseases. That injury is no less real or cognizable because it was not attended by puncture or abrasion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Arkansas Dept. of Correc</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number><em>tion </em>v. <em>Holybee, </em>46 Ark. App. 232, 235, 878 S.W.2d 420 (1994) (in case involving correction officer bitten by HIV positive inmate, claimant\u2019s injury was not merely bite wound but also risk of infection); <em>Jackson Township Volunteer Fire Co. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Wallet), </em>supra, 594 A.2d 828 (in case involving ambulance attendant who came into contact with HIV contaminated blood, claimant\u2019s \u201cinjury was the risk of infection\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Second, the defendant contends that the claimant has not suffered a compensable injury because he has not, as yet, been incapacitated or suffered any loss of income. To the extent that this argument relies on dicta in <em>Mulligan </em>v. <em>F. S. Electric, </em>231 Conn. 529, 541, 651 A.2d 254 (1994), and cases cited therein for the proposition that \u201c \u2018 [c] ompensation under [the act] is based upon incapacity . . . [and] loss of earning power,\u2019 \u201d that dicta has been disavowed. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Best Cleaners, Inc., </em>237 Conn. 490, 492-93, 677 A.2d 1356 (1996). To the extent that this argument is based on the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 31-295 (a), which provide that no compensation for total or partial <em>disability </em>shall be payable under the act until the injured employee misses more than three days of employment, those provisions are irrelevant to the present case. The claimant does not seek disability compensation. He seeks, rather, to recover medical expenses in connection with the testing and treatment for HIV and tuberculosis exposure. Pursuant to \u00a7 31-294d, he is entitled to these medical expenses without any showing of incapacity or disability. See also <em>Coca Cola Bottling Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>233 Cal. App. 3d 1273, 1284, 286 Cal. Rptr. 855 (1991) (\u201ca compensable injury is one which causes disability or need for medical treatments\u201d); <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Dugger, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>579 So. 2d 827, 830 (Fla. App. 1991) (\u201c[t]he fact that [workers\u2019 compensation claimant] has yet to suffer any proven disability ... as a result of his exposure to [acquired immune deficiency syndrome] does not make his injury any less compensable\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Accordingly, in light of the undisputed factual circumstances of record, we conclude that the claimant has estabhshed, as a matter of law, that his exposures to two potentially fatal infectious diseases are compensable \u201cinjuries\u201d under the act. Accordingly, the commissioner and the review board improperly denied him the right to recover for reasonable expenses that he incurred for medically appropriate testing and treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the review board with direction to remand it to the commissioner for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b715-8\"> As did the compensation review board, we will refer to the claimant as John Doe in order to protect his identity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b715-9\"> The Connecticut Interlocal Risk Management Agency, the claims administrator for the city of Stamford, is also named as a defendant in this action. In the interest of simplicity, we will refer to the city of Stamford as the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b716-9\"> Although a \u201ctine test\u201d performed on the claimant indicated that he had been exposed to tuberculosis, chest X rays revealed no evidence of the disease. As of the date of the oral argument, the claimant had not contracted either HIV or tuberculosis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b717-9\"> The parties stipulated that the incubation period following an IIIV exposure \u201ccan be several years.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b718-8\"> The claimant does not dispute the conclusion of the review board that exposure to a disease, without actual contraction of the disease, does not constitute an \u201coccupational disease\u201d under the act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b720-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (15) provides in relevant part: \u201c \u2018Occupational disease\u2019 includes any disease peculiar to the occupation in which the employee was engaged and due to causes in excess of the ordinary hazards of employment as such . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b721-8\"> The defendant does not dispute that, under federal law, an employee who has been exposed to HIV at the workplace is required to receive postexposure medical treatment, counseling and evaluation. See 29 C.F.R. c. XVII, \u00a7 1910.1030 (f) (3) (iv) through (vi). The claimant contends, and we agree, that it would undermine the importance of prompt medical testing to hold that an exposed employee must obtain this testing at his own cost.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b721-9\"> We note that, in the context of <em>tort law, </em>at least one court has set forth a four part inquiry to determine whether a plaintiff who has been exposed to, but has not yet contracted, an illness has stated a viable claim for economic damages associated with medical monitoring. See <em>In re Paoli R. Yard PGB Litigation, </em>916 F.2d 829, 852 (3d Cir. 1990), cert. denied sub nom. <em>General Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>499 U.S. 961, 111 S. Ct. 1584, 113 L. Ed. 2d 649 (1991) <em>(Paoli </em>1); see also <em>In re Paoli R. Yard PCB Litigation, </em>35 F.3d 717, 788 (3d Cir. 1994), cert. denied sub nom. <em>General Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Ingram, </em>513 U.S. 1190, 115 S. Ct. 1253, 131 L. Ed. 2d 134 (1995). Pursuant to this test, a plaintiff can succeed on such a claim if he demonstrates that: (1) he was significantly exposed to hazardous materials as a result of the negligence of the defendant; (2) as a proximate result of his exposure, he suffers a significantly increased risk of contracting a serious latent disease; (3) the increased risk makes regular medical monitoring and treatment reasonably necessary; and (4) the monitoring and treatment make early detection and/or prevention of the disease possible. <em>Paoli I, </em>supra, 916 F.2d 852. Although neither party has asked us to adapt this test to the context <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>of workers\u2019 compensation law, we note that the factors it embraces are demonstrated in the undisputed facts of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b722-8\"> Accordingly, we express no opinion on the degree or duration of contact with infectious disease that is sufficient to constitute an \u201cexposure\u201d for purposes of workers\u2019 compensation law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b722-9\"> At oral argument before this court, the defendant attempted for the first time to draw a distinction between the review board\u2019s authority to compel the defendant to pay for the claimant\u2019s medical bills and its authority to compel the defendant to enter into a voluntary agreement with the claimant. According to the defendant, the claimant\u2019s exposures constituted nothing more than \u201ccompensable events,\u201d and, therefore, triggered only the review board\u2019s power to award medical compensation and not its power to order a voluntary agreement. This argument and the distinctions upon which it relies are, to our knowledge, entirely unsupported by either statute or case law. It is, however, unnecessary for us to address these deficiencies in light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>of the defendant\u2019s concession that, if we conclude the claimant\u2019s exposures constituted \u201cinjuries\u201d within the scope of the act, the review board had the authority to order the parties to enter into a voluntary agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b724-13\"> The defendant also calls our attention to federal cases in which an exposed employee has brought an action for emotional distress and medical monitoring costs under the Federal Employers Liability Act. See, e.g., <em>Buckley v. Metro-North Commuter R. Co., </em>79 F.3d 1337 (2d Cir. 1996). Subsequent to oral argument in this case, the Circuit Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bucldey </em>was overturned by the United States Supreme Court, which held that the employee could not maintain such an action under that federal act in the absence of pathological manifestations. <em>Metro-North Commuter R. Co. </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>521 U.S. 424, 117 S. Ct. 2113, 2117, 138 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1997). Because the <em>Buckley </em>case arose in the context of a federal statute that is closely tied to traditional tort principles, it does not constrain our independent analysis of Connecticut workers\u2019 compensation law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
