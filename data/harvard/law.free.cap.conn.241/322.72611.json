The defendant was convicted, after a jury trial, of all counts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following a capital penalty hearing in which the jury found a mitigating factor, the defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of release, to run concurrently with additional sentences totaling seventy years. The defendant appeals from the judgment of conviction to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (b) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly: (1) admitted into evidence his statements to police because the statements were involuntary and given without a knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>his Miranda<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> rights; (2) gave the jury a supplemental instruction that he could be convicted as an accessory; (3) violated his state constitutional light to due process by rendering a judgment of conviction of capital felony even though the jurors did not unanimously agree on either accessorial or principal liability; (4) refused to grant his motion for a mistrial after the state introduced inadmissible evidence; and (5) admitted expert testimony that invaded the province of the jury and was more prejudicial than probative. The defendant also claims that a new trial should be granted because the state\u2019s attorney, in closing arguments, violated his constitutional rights by appealing to ethnic prejudice and commenting on his refusal to testify. The defendant also requests that we inspect documents sealed by the trial court to determine whether they should have been disclosed pursuant to the Brady<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> doctrine. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. Rodolfo Garcia Tamayo was a Hartford drug dealer. Jorge Trujillo Izquierdo, a native of Colombia, South America, supplied Garcia with cocaine from New York. On November 14, 1990, Garcia met with the defendant and Yo-Yo, another drug dealer. Yo-Yo, whose identity remains unknown, was a Colombian who formerly had been a steady customer of Trujillo. Garcia and Trujillo agreed that on the following day, November 15, 1990, they would sell the defendant and Yo-Yo one kilogram of cocaine for $20,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Between 7:30 and 8 p.m. on November 15, 1990, the defendant borrowed a tan Cadillac El Dorado from Felix Rivera, who planned to sell the car to the defendant. The defendant had agreed to pay Rivera $1800 for the car, of which one half would be paid in cash and one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>half in cocaine. When the defendant borrowed the car, he told Rivera that he needed it to go \u201cget the stuff\u201d in order to pay for the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The defendant and another person took the Cadillac to Adelaide Street, where Garcia and Trujillo were already waiting in Garcia\u2019s car. When the defendant approached Garcia\u2019s car, Garcia attempted to exit his car. The defendant shot Garcia in the shoulder and head, and Garcia fell back into the driver\u2019s seat. The defendant then shot Trujillo, who was in the passenger seat, at close range in the head. He then shot Garcia again in the head. Garcia and Trujillo died of those wounds. Thereafter, the defendant removed a metal box from the back seat of Garcia\u2019s car, ran to the Cadillac and jumped into its passenger side. The defendant and the driver then left the scene in the Cadillac.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">After disposing of his gun, the defendant took the metal box to the apartment of his girlfriend, Elizabeth Delgado, arriving at about 9 p.m. The defendant had blood on his clothes. He told Delgado that \u201che had gotten into a fight . . . and he had to throw the gun away.\u201d Inside the box was a block of cocaine with a street value of $100,000. The defendant gave one or two ounces of the cocaine to Rivera in partial payment of the Cadillac. The defendant then put the empty box in the Cadillac and hid the remaining cocaine in his apartment at 54 Barker Street in Hartford.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Five days later, on November 20,1990, the defendant was stopped in the Cadillac and arrested. During the early morning hours of November 21,1990, the Hartford police executed a search warrant at the defendant\u2019s apartment. In the broiler pan storage area of the defendant\u2019s oven, they found a bag containing 839.7 grams of cocaine. At the defendant\u2019s apartment, the police also seized a shirt that later tested positive for gunshot residue on the left sleeve. Tests on the Cadillac showed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>similar residue on the steering wheel and the passenger door. The police found a metal box in the Cadillac and opened it with a key from Garcia\u2019s key ring.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The jury could have found that the defendant\u2019s crimes were motivated by the fact that he did not have $20,000 to pay Garcia and Trujillo for the cocaine and that he went to the meeting armed and intending to murder them and leave with the cocaine. The jury, therefore, could have, and did, find the crimes to be robbery murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">On December 6, 1991, it was discovered that the defendant had cut the top and bottom portions of a bar in his cell window at the Hartford community correctional center. The defendant had used tape to hold the bar in place and to conceal what he had done. A hacksaw, pliers, screwdriver, and a roll of tape were found in the defendant\u2019s cell. The defendant had also broken part of the louver window outside of the cell bars.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly admitted into evidence three statements that he had given to the Hartford police. He argues that the statements were involuntary and given only as a result of threats, coercion and inducements made by the police. The defendant also claims that he made the statements without a knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. We find no merit to the defendant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">\u201c[T]he use of an involuntary confession in a criminal trial is a denial of due process of law. <em>Mincey </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>437 U.S. 385, 398, 98 S. Ct. 2408, 57 L. Ed. 2d 290 (1978); <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>378 U.S. 368, 376, 84 S. Ct. 1774, 12 L. Ed. 2d 908 (1964); <em>Culombe </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>367 U.S. 568, 602, 81 S. Ct. 1860, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1037 (1961); <em>State </em>v. <em>Shifflett, </em>199 Conn. 718, 727, 508 A.2d 748 (1986). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Schroff, </em>206 Conn. 182, 195, 536 A.2d 952 (1988). Furthermore, a criminal defendant is entitled, as a matter of due process, to a reliable, clear-cut determination prior to trial that the confession sought to be introduced by the state was made voluntarily. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>supra, 391. In Connecticut, the preliminary voluntariness determination is made by the trial court. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Oliver, </em>160 Conn. 85, 95, 273 A.2d 867 (1970), cert. denied, 402 U.S. 946, 91 S. Ct. 1637, 29 L. Ed. 2d 115 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">\u201cIn order to be voluntary a confession must be the product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice by the maker. ... If it is not, if his will has been overborne and his capacity for self-determination critically impaired, the use of the confession offends due process. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Chung, </em>[202 Conn. 39, 53, 519 A.2d 1175 (1987)]. The determination of whether a confession is voluntary must be based on a consideration of the totality of circumstances surrounding it; id., 53-54; including both the characteristics of the accused and the details of the interrogation. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>210 Conn. 22, 41, 554 A.2d 263 (1989). Factors that may be taken into account, upon a proper factual showing, include: the youth of the accused; his lack of education; his intelligence; the lack of any advice as to his constitutional rights; the length of detention; the repeated and prolonged nature of the questioning; and the use of physical punishment, such as the deprivation of food and sleep. . . . Id.; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Shifflett, </em>supra, 199 Conn. 728. Under the federal constitution . . . coercive police activity is a necessary predicate to the finding that a confession is not voluntary .... <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>479 U.S. 157, 167, 107 S. Ct. 515, 93 L. Ed. 2d 473 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">\u201cThe trial court\u2019s findings as to the circumstances surrounding the defendant\u2019s interrogation and confession are findings of fact . . . which will not be over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>turned unless they are clearly erroneous. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>[235 Conn. 748, 759, 679 A.2d 920 (1996)]. On the ultimate issue of voluntariness, however, we will conduct an independent and scrupulous examination of the entire record to ascertain whether the trial court\u2019s finding is supported by substantial evidence. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Chung, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 54 . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>237 Conn. 390, 410-12, 678 A.2d 1338 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The following evidence concerning the defendant\u2019s statements was introduced. On November 20, 1990, at approximately 8 p.m., Officer Ramon Bermudez of the Hartford police department stopped a tan Cadillac El Dorado occupied by persons identified as suspects in a homicide. Six or seven other police cruisers arrived and several officers, including Bermudez, approached the Cadillac with their service revolvers drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">Officer Charles Allen ordered the defendant out of the Cadillac, which he was driving. Bermudez handcuffed the defendant and placed the defendant in his cruiser.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rivera, the other occupant of the Cadillac, was removed from the passenger seat. Bermudez asked the defendant his name, address and birth date. The defendant stated that he was Jose Alberto Nieves, born December 16, 1961, and that he lived at 42 Wilson Street in Hartford. An identification card found on the defendant\u2019s person, however, provided the name Jose A. Colon of 46 Wilson Street, Hartford, born January 17, 1967, and was signed \u201cJose Nieves.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">Bermudez transported the defendant to Hartford police headquarters at about 9 p.m. Rivera was also taken there in another cruiser. Both individuals were seated in a large room, several feet apart. About five minutes later, the police began to question the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>ant. Because the defendant claimed not to understand English, Bermudez, who spoke Spanish, served as an interpreter. Detectives Stephen Kumnick and Fred Morhardt conducted the interview. Bermudez read the defendant his <em>Miranda </em>rights, once in English and twice in Spanish. After Bermudez read each right, the defendant indicated that he understood. Bermudez then reviewed a waiver of rights form with the defendant, who signed the form and indicated that he wanted to waive his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">When asked if he knew why he had been apprehended, the defendant said that he did not know. When told that he was a suspect in a double homicide, the defendant said that he had not killed anyone. Bermudez then asked the defendant to identify his nationality. Initially, the defendant claimed to be from Rio Pedras, Puerto Rico. When Bermudez, who knew the area, asked the defendant about Rio Pedras, the defendant admitted that he was not Puerto Rican, but rather, Colombian, and that he had entered the United States illegally about one and one-half years earlier. The defendant also stated that his family was residing illegally in the United States. The police then told the defendant that if he would tell them what had happened, they would see what they could do for his family with the Department of Immigration and Naturalization Services. The defendant shrugged his shoulders and did not respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Fifteen to twenty minutes into the interview, the defendant was informed that he was lucky that the police had picked him up. The defendant was told that the police had information that two people were being paid $50,000 to kill him because he had killed someone very important in the New York drug business. The defendant was also told that the hired killers might go after his family if they could not reach him. The defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>ant remained calm and continued to deny any knowledge of the murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">In the interview, the defendant was questioned about the Cadillac and his whereabouts on November 15,1990. The defendant said that he had bought the Cadillac from Rivera on the night of November 15. He stated that he paid for the car with money he had earned working as a janitor at the federal building in Hartford. The defendant also stated that he usually worked from 12 to 9 p.m. and had worked the night of the murders. When confronted with the contradiction of having both worked and purchased the car on the same night, the defendant explained that his car was parked on Hungerford Street between 7 and 9:30 p.m. that night. The police told the defendant that he was one of the \u201cmost confused persons\u201d ever and that someone had seen his car leaving the crime scene. The defendant continued to remain calm and to maintain that he had not killed anyone. During the interview, the defendant also stated that he had a beeper.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">The detectives also showed the defendant two photographs, which they identified as the men whom he had killed. The photographs had been taken prior to the victims\u2019 deaths. Only then did the defendant appear to become nervous and agitated. The defendant would not look at the photographs despite the requests of the detectives and continued to assert that he knew nothing. The interview ended after forty-five minutes to one hour. Thereafter, the defendant was moved to an interview room at about 10 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">At approximately 3:10 a.m. on November 21, 1990, Officer Ezequiel Laureano, who had been assigned to transport the defendant to the booking area and who spoke Spanish, entered the interview room where the defendant was being held and handcuffed him. There is no evidence of any attempt by the police to interview <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>the defendant between the end of the first interview and this time. As the defendant and Laureano were leaving the room, the defendant whispered in Spanish that he wanted to speak with Laureano in private. Laureano discussed the defendant\u2019s request with Sergeant Lawrence Irvine, who instructed Laureano to inquire about what the defendant wanted. When asked, the defendant stated that he did not commit the murders, but that he knew who did. Laureano then read the defendant his rights again in both English and Spanish. The defendant stated that he understood his rights and that he would waive them. Laureano then served as an interpreter while the defendant gave a statement to Irvine.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The defendant told the officers that, at 6:30 p.m. on November 15, 1990, he was in front of 179 Hungerford Street when he was approached by a man he knew as Luis Carlos. This man asked the defendant if he could borrow the defendant\u2019s car to take his girlfriend home, and the defendant agreed. The defendant had become very upset because Carlos did not return with the car until sometime between 9 and 10 p.m. When Carlos finally returned, the defendant had a heated argument<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> with him before returning to Delgado\u2019s house. The defendant stated that he remained at Delgado\u2019s house until about 10:10 p.m., when Delgado\u2019s brother-in-law drove him to his apartment because the Cadillac would not start.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Between 6:20 and 8:10 a.m. on the morning of November 21, 1990, Detective Louisa St. Pierre, who spoke Spanish, took a written statement from the defendant. St. Pierre discussed with the defendant his <em>Miranda </em>rights. In response, he stated that he had been given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>his rights, that he understood them, and that he wished to give a statement. The defendant did not appear to be tired, agitated, nervous or upset.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">St. Pierre then asked the defendant questions to which he gave responses that St. Pierre typed in Spanish. During this interview, the defendant was shown the shirt he had worn the night of the murders. This shirt had been seized by the police during a search of the defendant\u2019s home that morning. When the two page statement was completed, the defendant read it. St. Pierre explained to the defendant the English portions of the form on which the statement was typed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant then signed the document under an oath administered by St. Pierre in Spanish.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">In the statement, the defendant claimed that Carlos had borrowed the Cadillac from him on the night of the murders, that Carlos had returned late, and that they had had a fight during which the defendant got blood on his pants. The defendant further claimed that he had discovered the cocaine in his car only after returning to Delgado\u2019s house.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>The trial court found that the defendant had made a voluntary, knowing and intelligent waiver of his rights. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>It found that the defendant had been read his rights, understood them and signed multiple waiver of rights forms. The court also found that the defendant was about twenty-five years old and that, although he had only five years of formal education, he was able to communicate with the police in Spanish without any difficulty. The court further found that the defendant\u2019s physical condition appeared to be good at all times and that he did not appear to be under any stress. The court found as a fact that the defendant initiated the statement to Laureano and Irvine at 3:10 a.m. The court further concluded that the defendant\u2019s statements were not motivated by any promises or threats by the police. The court held, therefore, that the state had satisfied its burden of proof that the defendant had waived his rights and that his statements were made freely and voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The defendant argues that the combination of the circumstances of his arrest, the intimidating attitude of the police, the offer concerning the immigration status of his family, the statements regarding the $50,000 contract against his life, and his alienage and lack of education render his statements involuntary.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We address these arguments with the recognition that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>has not claimed, and there is no evidence that, he suffered any physical coercion or was denied food or rest.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">An involuntary confession may result from psychological, as well as physical, coercion. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Fenton, </em>796 F.2d 598, 602-603 (3d Cir. 1986). \u201cHowever, while a per se involuntariness rule applies when an interrogation is accompanied by physical violence, see <em>Stein </em>v. <em>New York, </em>346 U.S. 156, 182, 73 S. Ct. 1077, 1091, 97 L. Ed. 1522 (1953), no such rule applies when the alleged coercion is psychological. [Id., 184]. As the [United States] Supreme Court has noted, \u2018[t]he line between proper and permissible police conduct and techniques and methods offensive to due process is, at best, a difficult one to draw, particularly in cases such as this where it is necessary to make fine judgments as to the effect of psychologically coercive pressures and inducements on the mind and will of an accused.\u2019 <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>373 U.S. 503, 515, 83 S. Ct. 1336, 1344, 10 L. Ed. 2d 513 (1963).\u201d <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Fenton, </em>supra, 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">We agree with the trial court that the defendant\u2019s will was not overborne by any promises, threats or coercion. The trial court aptly observed: \u201cI don\u2019t see whether the court . . . could come to any conclusion that the confession ... if this was a confession and I am not sure that it was a confession, a statement made by the defendant, was not freely and voluntarily made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">It is significant that the defendant never confessed to the murders and robbery in response to the police statements that he now claims to have been psychologically coercive. While the defendant stated during the initial interview that he owned the Cadillac El Dorado and had a beeper, we conclude that, under the circumstances, the defendant was never \u201ccoerced\u201d into providing this information. The defendant had been apprehended while driving the Cadillac with Rivera, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>who had sold him the car on the night of the murders, as a passenger. The defendant knew that Rivera also had been taken by the police for questioning that night and that Rivera could provide the police with certain incriminating information. He continually denied any knowledge of the murders while revealing the information that he knew Rivera could provide to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Approximately five hours later, however, the defendant initiated a statement when Laureano came to take him to the booking room. The defendant does not claim that Laureano sought to question him or asked him to give a statement. Instead, the defendant sought to explain away his possession of the incriminating Cadillac. Later in the morning, while being shown the shirt that police had seized from his apartment, the defendant also tried to explain away the metal box containing cocaine that Rivera had seen in his possession on November 15, his bloody clothes and the kilogram of cocaine that the police would discover. All the while, he attempted to incriminate Carlos. If the defendant\u2019s will was overborne, it is highly unlikely that he would have signed a statement in which he accused another individual of being the killer. The defendant\u2019s consistent claims that he had not been involved in the crimes provide strong evidence that his will was not overborne by any police tactics. See <em>Self v. Collins, </em>973 F.2d 1198, 1214 (5th Cir. 1992) (\u201c[i]f [the defendant] had been coerced into saying whatever would please law enforcement officials, it seems most unlikely that they would have allowed him to sign a confession that was inconsistent with the physical evidence\u201d); <em>McCall </em>v. <em>Dutton, </em>863 F.2d 454, 460 (6th Cir. 1988) (\u201cit is noteworthy that [the defendant\u2019s] denials were consistently exculpatory and he persistently identified [another] as the individual who shot and killed [the victim]\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pelton, </em>835 F.2d 1067, 1073 (4th Cir. 1987) (defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>statement was not involuntary where he \u201crefused to give certain information\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">We do not find any evidence that the defendant\u2019s statements were procured by use of the police tactics of which the defendant complains. Other facts support our conclusion that the statements were not the product of police coercion. The defendant was transported to police headquarters, where he was seated in a large room, and in no way threatened with physical force. There, the police repeatedly read the defendant his <em>Miranda </em>rights before beginning the interrogation. \u201c[A] warning at the time of the interrogation is indispensable to overcome its pressures and to [e]nsure that the individual knows he is free to exercise the privilege at that point in time.\u201d <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 469, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Lapointe, </em>237 Conn. 694, 734, 678 A.2d 942, cert. denied, 519 U.S. 994, 117 S. Ct. 484, 136 L. Ed. 2d 378 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">The defendant argues that the police statements regarding his family\u2019s immigration status and the purported contract on his life overcame his will. We disagree.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant reacted calmly when these statements were made and exhibited no signs of duress. It was several hours later before the defendant himself initiated a statement seeking to exculpate himself and to inculpate Carlos. There is nothing in the record to show that the defendant was persuaded to give incriminatory statements to police as a result of the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>representations. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lapointe, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 733 (\u201c[w]ithout a causal connection, even the most egregious police misconduct will not render a confession involuntary under the due process clause\u201d), and cases cited therein; <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 428 (\u201cthe defendant did not confess because his will to remain silent was overborne, but rather ... he confessed of his own free will because he believed it would be in his best interest to do so\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">In sum, we agree with the trial court that the defendant\u2019s statements were the result of the police stopping the defendant in the Cadillac and informing him that someone saw the Cadillac leave the crime scene rather than of any of the other interrogation techniques employed by the police, which the defendant labels as coercive. The initial interview of the defendant, in which the circumstances the defendant complains of took place, lasted until about 10 p.m. The defendant was then taken to the interview room until 3:10 a.m. During that time, he was not interrogated. When Laureano then went to the interview room to take the defendant to be booked, the defendant <em>initiated, </em>as the trial court found, his statement attempting to incriminate Carlos. Later in the morning, after the defendant had been shown the shirt seized from his apartment, he added that he had fought with Carlos, leaving blood on his clothes, and that he had found the box of cocaine in his car. We conclude that the defendant\u2019s statements were voluntary and properly admitted against the defendant at his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">With respect to the waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, the defendant argues that the same police conduct that coerced him into giving statements also establishes that his waiver was not knowing, intelligent and voluntary. As the evidence presented above demonstrates, however, the police repeatedly advised the defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and ascertained that he understood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>those rights. The defendant\u2019s statements, following these warnings, were initiated by him in the hope of explaining what he knew the police already knew or were about to discover from Rivera, other witnesses and the search of his apartment. We conclude, therefore, that \u201c[t]he evidence that establishes the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s statements equally establishes that his waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights was knowing, intelligent and voluntary.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Roseboro, </em>221 Conn. 430, 444, 604 A.2d 1286 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">The defendant claims that the trial court denied him his rights to due process and a fair trial<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> by giving the jury a supplemental instruction that allowed the jury to convict him as an accessory of one count each of capital felony and robbery in the first degree, and two counts of murder.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The defendant argues that the state prosecuted him only as a principal and that in preparing his defense he relied on not being charged as an accessory. We are unpersuaded. Because it is clear from the record that the defendant was on notice that he could face liability as an accessory, he suffered no prejudice from the trial court\u2019s supplemental instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">The fact that a defendant is not formally charged as an accessory pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8 does not preclude a conviction as such. <em>State </em>v. <em>Crump, </em>201 Conn. 489, 493, 518 A.2d 378 (1986). \u201cThis state . . . long ago adopted the rule that there is no practical significance in being labeled an \u2018accessory\u2019 or a \u2018principal\u2019 for the purpose of determining criminal responsibility.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>198 Conn. 158, 164, 502 A.2d 880 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>(1985). Under the modem approach, \u201ca person is legally accountable for the conduct of another when he is an accomplice of the other person in the commission of the crime. . . .\u2019 \u201d Id. \u201c \u2018[T]here is no such crime as \u201cbeing an accessory\u201d .... The accessory statute merely provides alternate means by which a substantive crime may be committed.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. Baker, 195 Conn. 598, 608, 489 A.2d 1041 (1985).\u201d Id., 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Steve, </em>208 Conn. 38, 45-46, 544 A.2d 1179 (1988), however, it was held that the defense was prejudiced as a result of a substantial variance between the allegations in the bill of particulars that the defendant was the principal and the court\u2019s instructions concerning accessorial liability where the state presented no evidence in its case-in-chief that the defendant had acted as an accomplice. \u201cThe purpose of a bill of particulars is to inform the defendant of the charges against him with sufficient precision to enable him to prepare his defense and avoid prejudicial surprise. <em>State </em>v. <em>Roque, </em>190 Conn. 143, 154, 460 A.2d 26 (1983). A bill of particulars limits the state \u2018to proving that the defendant has committed the offense in substantially the manner described.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>171 Conn. 264, 270, 368 A.2d 222 (1976).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Steve, </em>supra, 44-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">The state argues that <em>Steve </em>is distinguishable because in this case the state alleged in the substitute information and bill of particulars that the defendant was guilty of two counts of felony murder because he, or another participant in the robbery, caused the deaths of the victims by shooting them with a handgun. The state also argues that the state\u2019s attorney provided the defendant with notice of the accessorial liability theory by stating, at the end of the state\u2019s case-in-chief, that he would request an instruction on accessorial liability if the defendant attempted to introduce evidence that the defendant was an accessory rather than the principal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>or if the defendant made such an argument.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The defendant interprets the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s statement as an assertion that the state would not seek an accessory instruction absent those circumstances. The defendant claims that he relied on this assertion when presenting his defense. See footnote 16 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The trial court instructed the jury that in order to convict the defendant of capital felony and the two counts of murder, the jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt that <em>the defendant </em>committed the murders of the two victims. With respect to the two counts of felony murder, the court instructed the jury that it must find that the defendant, <em>or another participant, </em>caused the deaths of the victims while in the course of or in furtherance of the commission of robbery in the first degree. Finally, the court instructed the jury that in order to convict the defendant of robbery in the first degree, it must find that the defendant, <em>or another participant, </em>caused serious physical injury or was armed with a deadly weapon in the course of the commission of a crime or immediate flight therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">After the court instructed the jury, the court excused the alternates immediately before lunch and did not return until after 3 p.m. At 2:20 p.m., the jury sent a note asking if it should begin deliberating and requesting pads of paper and a list of charges. At 3:25 p.m., the jury sent a second note asking the following question: \u201cCount[s] six and seven [the two counts of felony murder], does the defendant have to be the person causing the murder in order to find him guilty or merely a participant in [the] robbery in which the victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>was murdered? . . . nine [the count of first degree robbery] does the defendant have to be the person using force or causing injury or merely a participant in the incident?\u201d At 3:57 p.m., the court instructed the jury not to deliberate until the court had answered the question concerning counts six and seven and excused the jury until the next morning. In response the next morning, the court instructed the jury on the law of accessorial liability and instructed the jury to apply that law to the count of capital felony, the two counts of murder, the two counts of felony murder and the count of robbery in the first degree. The court then answered the jury\u2019s question by stating that the defendant did not have to be the person who caused the murder for counts six and seven and did not have to be the actual perpetrator for count nine.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thereafter, the court told the jury it was excused and could deliberate.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">The defendant argues that the supplemental instruction on accessorial liability requires reversal of the judgment as to the capital felony count, the two counts of murder and the robbery count.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The defendant focuses on the jury vote for the capital felony count. After the verdict, on a motion by the defendant, the jury was asked whether the conviction of capital felony was based on a finding of principal or accessorial liability. The jury answered that ten jurors voted to convict the defendant as a principal and two voted to convict the defendant as an accessory.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">We do not agree with the defendant that the jury\u2019s findings demonstrate prejudice where the substitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>information and bill of particulars permitted a theory of accessorial liability and the evidence demonstrated that the defendant could have been an accessory.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">We do not read each count specified in the substitute information and bill of particulars in isolation. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Beaulieu, </em>164 Conn. 620, 626, 325 A.2d 263 (1973) (information supplied by another count). In this case, the defendant was charged with three <em>counts </em>of conspiracy,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> each of which specified that \u201canother person, who is believed to use the street name \u2018Yo-Yo,\u2019 \u201d conspired with the defendant to commit murder. Also, the two counts of felony murder alleged that the defendant and Yo-Yo committed the crime of robbery in the first degree and that the defendant, or another participant, caused the deaths of the two victims. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>220 Conn. 385, 389-90, 599 A.2d 1053 (1991). During the trial, an eyewitness testified that on the night of the murders she saw an individual, who did not look unlike the defendant, run from the victim\u2019s car to the defendant\u2019s Cadillac carrying a box and enter the passenger side door of the Cadillac as the car began to move off. The state\u2019s evidence, thus, demonstrated that the defendant was one of two persons responsible for these robbery murders. This case, therefore, is clearly distinguishable from <em>State </em>v. <em>Steve, </em>supra, 208 Conn. 46, in which this court found it \u201csignificant that the state presented no evidence in its case-in-chief suggesting' that the defendant had acted as an accomplice.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We conclude that the defendant had notice that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>he was subject to accessorial liability and, therefore, the trial court did not improperly give the supplemental instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">The defendant claims that his conviction of capital felony violates his state constitutional rights to due process, a fair trial and the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment because the jury did not unanimously agree on whether the defendant was liable as a principal or an accessory for the shooting deaths of Garcia and Trujillo.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The jury was polled as to the basis of the defendant\u2019s conviction of capital felony. Ten jurors found him guilty as a principal and two as an accessory.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">The defendant urges us here to find greater protection of his rights under the state constitution than under the federal constitution as interpreted by the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>Supreme Court. We explore this claim by utilizing the criteria set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>222 Conn. 672, 685, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992): (1) the text of our constitution; (2) decisions of this court and the Appellate Court; (3) federal precedent; (4) decisions of sister state courts; (5) the history of our constitution; and (6) sociological and economic considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Nothing in the history or text of our constitution supports the defendant\u2019s claim. It is also plain that federal decisions do not support his position. An argument similar to the defendant\u2019s was rejected by the court in <em>Schad </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>501 U.S. 624, 111 S. Ct. 2491, 115 L. Ed. 2d 555 (1991), which contains strong and convincing arguments against reaching any other result under our constitution. In <em>Schad, </em>the United States Supreme Court deferred to the states\u2019 determination that certain statutory alternatives are mere means of committing a single offense. This court has repeatedly so held concerning principal and accessorial liability. <em>State </em>v. <em>Flanders, </em>214 Conn. 493, 504, 572 A.2d 983, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 901, 111 S. Ct. 260, 112 L. Ed. 2d 217 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>212 Conn. 593, 605, 563 A.2d 671 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>195 Conn. 598, 608, 489 A.2d 1041 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>199 Conn. 473, 480 n.4, 507 A.2d 1387 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">While giving initial deference to legislative competency in defining the elements of a crime, the court in <em>Schad </em>also recognized that fundamental fairness, as taught by \u201chistory and wide practice,\u201d as well as \u201cthe moral and practical equivalence\u201d of the different elements required under a statute should be considered. <em>Schad </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 501 U.S. 637. The Connecticut legislature has provided that \u201c[a] person, acting with the mental state required for commission of an offense, who solicits, requests, commands, importunes or intentionally aids another person to engage in conduct which constitutes an offense shall be criminally liable for such conduct and may be prosecuted and punished as if he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>were the principal offender.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8 (a). The defendant has failed to present any historic or current indication that we as a people would regard this definition as not fundamentally fair and rational. Moreover, several sister states also recognize principal and accessorial liability as statutory alternatives. See <em>Dixon </em>v. <em>State, </em>673 A.2d 1220, 1228 (Del. Super. 1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Carothers, </em>84 Wash. 2d 256, 525 P.2d 731 (1974); <em>Holland </em>v. <em>State, </em>91 Wis. 2d 134, 280 N.W.2d 288 (1979), cert. denied, 445 U.S. 931, 100 S. Ct. 1320, 63 L. Ed. 2d 764 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">With respect to the development of the law in other jurisdictions, the <em>Schad </em>court observed, in the words of the concurring opinion, that it has long been the general rule that when a single crime can be committed in various ways, a jury need not agree on the mode of commission. <em>Schad </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 501 U.S. 651 (Scalia, J., concurring). Such historical and contemporary acceptance is further evidence that the defendant\u2019s conviction of capital felony does not offend some principle of justice so rooted in the tradition of our people as to be ranked as fundamental. Id., 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Finally, the <em>Schad </em>court considered whether the alternative means, as developed by the evidence, were morally equivalent. The record here shows that the jury found that the defendant either intentionally caused the death of the two victims or aided and abetted another in killing the two victims with the intent that they be killed. There was evidence that the motive and result of these murders was the robbery of one kilogram of cocaine and that both victims were shot in the head as they sat in their car with the cocaine. Under these circumstances, we conclude that there was evidence from which the jury could find a highly culpable mental state on the defendant\u2019s part under either means of committing murder. Such equivalence \u201cis enough to rule out the argument that . . . moral disparity bars <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>treating them as alternative means to satisfy the . . . elements] of a single offense.\u201d Id., 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">We therefore reject the claim that the defendant has a right under the Connecticut constitution that the jury unanimously agrees on his liability as a principal or an accessory in his commission of a capital felony. Such a rule would lead to absurd results where, as here, the jury disagreed only about the defendant\u2019s exact role in the murders and there was ample evidence that he had intended the two victims to be killed. Our decision is, at its core, necessary and \u201cindispensable in a system that requires a unanimous jury verdict to convict.\u201d Id., 651 (Scalia, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">The defendant next claims that the state violated his rights to due process and a fair trial by eliciting testimony from the defendant\u2019s brother, Miguel Correa Motta, that the defendant did not discuss with his brother how he had obtained the block of cocaine, and by arguing in the presence of the jury that the defendant\u2019s statements to police that he found the cocaine in his car were inconsistent with the fact that the defendant did not give this explanation to his brother. The defendant made a motion for a mistrial, which the trial court denied. The court did, however, grant the defendant\u2019s motion to strike his brother\u2019s testimony and the state\u2019s argument. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">The state called Miguel Correa as a witness. On direct examination, Miguel Correa identified the defendant as his brother and testified that after the defendant was arrested, he visited the defendant in jail usually twice a month. Miguel Correa testified that when he asked the defendant \u201chow his problem was going,\u201d the defendant responded that \u201cthey were accusing him of possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>of drugs at home.\u201d Miguel Correa further testified that the defendant never told him the source of the drugs that were found in the apartment that he shared with the defendant. When the state asked Miguel Correa whether he had strong feelings about illegal drug activity, the defendant objected to the relevance of the question. The state responded that the question was foundational, and the court allowed Miguel Correa to answer that he had strong feelings about drugs. Miguel Correa then testified that he hated drugs and that the defendant knew of these feelings.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">On the completion of this examination, and while the jury was present, the defendant moved to strike the testimony as irrelevant. The court asked the state to what the elicited testimony was supposed to be foundational. The state answered that the testimony was relevant because if the defendant was truthful in telling police that he found the drugs in his car, then he would have told his brother, who he knew hated illegal drugs, that he had come into possession of the drugs by innocent means and had no intention of selling them.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">The next day, outside of the presence of the jury, argument continued regarding the defendant\u2019s motion to strike. The defendant also made a motion for a mistrial. He argued that a mistrial was required in view of the testimony before the jury. The court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to strike. The court denied the motion for a mistrial, however, stating: \u201cI don\u2019t feel there is anywhere near sufficient prejudice, and especially with cautionary instructions that I\u2019m going to give the jury that the defendant is \u2014 would be in any way prejudiced.\u201d The court then summarized Miguel Correa\u2019s testimony for the jury, including the inferences that the state argued could be drawn from the testimony, and instructed the jury \u201cthat [the] evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>you heard is not sufficient, at least at this time, for you to make any inference as to any conduct by the defendant during the course of . . . those conversations with his brother.\u201d The court instructed the jury, therefore, that the testimony was stricken from the record and that the jury was to disregard the testimony and any claims of inference that the state argued could be drawn from the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The defendant argues that the state improperly failed to bring the admissibility of the defendant\u2019s silence to the attention of the court prior to presenting it to the jury and failed to lay a basic foundation for the claim of admission. The defendant contends that this was in contravention of practice and the obligations of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office, and was exacerbated by the state\u2019s arguments before the jury. The defendant argues that the striking of this testimony and the rendering of a curative instruction were not sufficient to cure the prejudice caused by the state\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">\u201cWhile the remedy of a mistrial is permitted under the rules of practice, it is not favored. [A] mistrial should be granted only as a result of some occurrence upon the trial of such a character that it is apparent to the court that because of it a party cannot have a fair trial . . . and the whole proceedings are vitiated. ... If curative action can obviate the prejudice, the drastic remedy of a mistrial should be avoided. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Wooten, </em>[227 Conn. 677, 693-94, 631 A.2d 271 (1993)]. On appeal, we hesitate to disturb a decision not to declare a mistrial. The trial judge is the arbiter of the many circumstances which may arise during the trial in which his function is to assure a fair and just outcome. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>210 Conn. 315, 333, 554 A.2d 1080 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bausman, </em>162 Conn. 308, 312, 294 A.2d 312 (1972).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Day, </em>233 Conn. 813, 836-37, 661 A.2d 539 (1995). The trial court is in a better position than we are to evaluate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>in the first instance whether a certain occurrence is prejudicial to the defendant and, if so, what remedy is necessary to cure that prejudice. Id., 837. The decision whether to grant a mistrial is within the sound discretion of the trial court. Id., 835; see Practice Book \u00a7 887.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">We are unpersuaded that the state\u2019s presentation of Miguel Correa\u2019s testimony and its comments concerning that testimony were so prejudicial, in the context of the whole trial, that the defendant was denied a fair trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Traficonda, </em>223 Conn. 273, 282-83, 612 A.2d 45 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">The defendant relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>202 Conn. 676, 706, 523 A.2d 451 (1987), for the proposition that \u201c [consistent with a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, the prosecution, in accord with the high standards of that office, must act in good faith\u201d in its presentation of evidence. <em>Bryant </em>specifically concerned the prudence of holding a bench conference to ascertain whether a proper foundation existed for cross-examining an alibi witness about the witness\u2019 pretrial silence. Id., 705. We do not doubt that a bench conference, initiated by the state\u2019s attorney or the trial court, should have been held here.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>Bryant </em>did not foreclose, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>ever, the use of a curative instruction in appropriate cases where a bench conference is not held prior to the hearing of the inadmissible evidence. Id., 706; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Traficonda, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 283 (\u201ctrial court promptly struck the witness\u2019 response, immediately admonished the jurors to \u2018erase it from your minds\u2019 and told them not to consider the statement in their deliberations\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Finally, the defendant argues that the state\u2019s attorney violated Practice Book \u00a7 288 by arguing, in the presence of the jury, the inferences that he claimed could be drawn from Miguel Correa\u2019s testimony. Section 288 provides in pertinent part: \u201cWhenever an objection to the admission of evidence is made . . . [argument upon such objection shall not be made by either party unless the court requests it and, if made, must be brief and to the point.\u201d As the defendant recognizes, the trial court asked the state to what Miguel Correa\u2019s testimony was supposed to be foundational. The state responded that the testimony created an inference that the defendant\u2019s statements to the police were untrue. The state did not, as the defendant contends, take the opportunity to take advantage of the court and the defendant, but was presenting its theory of relevancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">While the state\u2019s presentation of Miguel Correa\u2019s testimony and its theory regarding the inference to be drawn therefrom was not based on sound evidentiary principles, it is not likely that the jury would be prejudiced by this portion of the proceedings. \u201cDue process seeks to assure a defendant a fair trial, not a perfect one.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kurvin, </em>186 Conn. 555, 565, 442 A.2d 1327 (1982). The trial court struck Miguel Correa\u2019s testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>immediately following the defendant\u2019s arguments on the issue and instructed the jury to disregard the testimony as well as the inferences that the state suggested could be drawn from the testimony. \u201cIt is to be presumed that the jury followed the court\u2019s instructions unless the contrary appears.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rouleou, </em>204 Conn. 240, 254, 528 A.2d 343 (1987). Under the circumstances, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its broad discretion by denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly admitted the expert testimony of Special Agent Richard Foster of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Foster testified concerning the cocaine distribution system in Hartford, cocaine purity levels, the value of cocaine in 1990, his opinion of Garcia\u2019s and Trujillo\u2019s role in the drug business and the nature of drug transactions, including the role of weapons in those transactions. The defendant argues that Foster impermissibly drew conclusions about the defendant\u2019s guilt by presenting the inferences that the state hoped the jury would reach from the evidence and that such testimony is not necessary from experts in this day and age. We find no merit to the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">\u201c[T]he trial court has wide discretion in ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony and, unless that discretion has been abused or the ruling involves a clear misconception of the law, the trial court\u2019s decision will not be disturbed. <em>State </em>v. <em>Campbell, 225 </em>Conn. 650, 654, 626 A.2d 287 (1993); <em>State v.

He claimed that evidence of such a connection was prejudicial and its prejudicial impact outweighed its probative value. The court agreed and restricted the evidence to portrayal of the roles of \u201cmules,\u201d those people who transport the drugs, and middle-level, local dealers distributing the cocaine in Hartford since the evidence presented a reasonable basis for equating those roles with Garcia and Trujillo. During the lengthy colloquy that followed, the defendant conceded that evidence of the value of the cocaine, one kilogram of 54 percent purity, would be relevant on the issue of motive. The defendant persisted, however, in his claim that even this evidence would be prejudicial because it linked him to a worldwide drug problem in which cocaine came from South America. The court then restricted the testimony to evidence that cocaine comes from New York City to Hartford in order to avoid any connection of the defendant to an international drug cartel. Thereafter, Foster testified before the jury concerning the operation of a cocaine distributor, the value of the cocaine removed by the police from the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>ant\u2019s apartment, the significance of materials found at Garcia\u2019s apartment for cutting and distributing cocaine and the function of Trujillo in delivering cocaine to Garcia in Hartford.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The defendant argues that Foster\u2019s further testimony concerning the use of weapons, the potential for robbery and homicide during drug dealings, the interest of major drug dealers to retaliate for robberies with violence and the robbers\u2019 interest in, and means of, escaping retaliation should not have been allowed. He argues that the jury already knew of these circumstances and that expert testimony was not required, especially because the testimony was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">We conclude that expert testimony concerning drug trafficking and its potential for violence may be admitted into evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Delossantos, </em>211 Conn. 258, 281, 559 A.2d 164, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 866, 110 S. Ct. 188, 107 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1989) (\u201cexpert testimony that individuals possessing large amounts of drugs often carry weapons to protect their goods\u201d). Even in this era when drugs and drug dealing have been widely portrayed in the media, the state may present evidence from those who have observed firsthand what is really happening on the streets. Here, the court was careful to instruct the jury that Foster\u2019s testimony should not be considered a judgment of the defendant\u2019s guilt, but only a view into a world that might be unknown to the average juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Furthermore, Foster\u2019s testimony concerning the use of weapons, the value of the kilogram of cocaine ($20,000 wholesale and $100,000 retail) and the use of murder to avoid retaliation was in every respect consistent with the evidence. There was evidence that the defendant arranged to buy one kilogram of cocaine for $20,000, that he went to make the deal armed with his nine millimeter pistol, that the dealers were shot at point blank range in the head while still in Garcia\u2019s car <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>and that the defendant then took the cocaine and left. In view of this, and the fact that Foster\u2019s testimony bore directly on the defendant\u2019s conduct, motive and role in the events, it was properly admitted. <em>Headley </em>v. <em>Tilghman, </em>53 F.3d 472, 476 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 877, 116 S. Ct. 207, 133 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1995); see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>776 F.2d 397, 401 (2d Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1141, 106 S. Ct. 1793, 90 L. Ed. 2d 339 (1986). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Foster\u2019s expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">The defendant next claims that, in closing arguments, the state improperly appealed to ethnic prejudice and commented on the defendant\u2019s silence and failure to testily. The defendant did not preserve these claims at trial and now seeks review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We find no merit to the defendant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">Prosecutorial misconduct may occur in the course of closing arguments. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 539, 529 A.2d 653 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>194 Conn. 530, 563-64, 482 A.2d 300 (1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1192, 105 S. Ct. 967, 83 L. Ed. 2d 971 (1985). \u201cIn order to deprive a defendant of his constitutional right to a fair trial, however, the prosecutor\u2019s conduct must have so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process. . . . We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>do not focus alone, however, on the conduct of the prosecutor. The fairness of the trial and not the culpability of the prosecutor is the standard for analyzing the constitutional due process claims of criminal defendants alleging prosecutorial misconduct. . . . [M] ore-over . . . [Golding] review of such a claim is unavailable where the claimed misconduct was not blatantly egregious and merely consisted of isolated and brief episodes that did not reveal a pattern of conduct repeated throughout the trial . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>235 Conn. 748, 769, 670 A.2d 276 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">The defendant points to two isolated remarks by the state\u2019s attorney in the course of his closing arguments. In his opening summation, the state\u2019s attorney stated: \u201cWhat this case is about is the dark and shadowy world of drugs, where greed leads to the buying and selling of the souls of men. A case about a Colombian who came to this country and who exploited the demand for drugs that exists here. Who became a merchant of despair and destruction.\u201d Then in rebuttal, the state\u2019s attorney stated: \u201cDon\u2019t let [the defendant] laugh at the American system of criminal justice . . . . Just tell this man that in America, we do not tolerate the execution of people for the love of money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">The defendant argues that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s remarks improperly appealed to prejudice against Colombians. The defendant contends that by stressing the defendant\u2019s ethnicity, the state\u2019s attorney invoked stereotypes of \u201cviolence, murder, drugs [and] lawlessness.\u201d Bermudez had testified before the jury that the defendant admitted to being from Colombia after the officer questioned him about Rio Pedras, Puerto Rico, from where the defendant initially claimed to have come. Also, there was evidence that, on the night of November 15, 1990, the defendant saw a newscast covering the murders and \u201chad a small laugh.\u201d The state\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>attorney alluded to that incident immediately prior to his reference to the defendant laughing at the justice system. Defense counsel did not object when the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s comments were made or at the end of the state\u2019s closing argument. He, therefore, \u201cpresumably did not regard [the] remarks as seriously prejudicial [when] they were made.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>227 Conn. 711, 746, 631 A.2d 288 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Negron, </em>221 Conn. 315, 330, 603 A.2d 1138 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">We likewise cannot conclude that, to the extent that the comments were inappropriate, they seriously prejudiced the defendant. The defendant fails to point to a sufficient pattern of misconduct to demonstrate blatantly egregious behavior. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>231 Conn. 235, 245-47, 645 A.2d 999 (1994). The defendant cannot, by identifying isolated remarks, set forth a claim of constitutional magnitude. <em>State </em>v. <em>Chance, </em>236 Conn. 31, 64, 671 A.2d 323 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 770; <em>State </em>v. <em>Watlington, </em>216 Conn. 188, 193, 579 A.2d 490 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>209 Conn. 423, 428, 551 A.2d 742 (1988). This claim is therefore not reviewable under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">The defendant also argues that the state\u2019s attorney commented on the inability to cross-examine the defendant, who did not testify, regarding the defendant\u2019s statements to police. He claims that this was misconduct because it attracted the jury\u2019s attention to the defendant\u2019s decision not to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">\u201cIt is well settled that comment by the prosecuting attorney ... on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify is prohibited by the fifth amendment to the United States constitution. <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 615, 85 S. Ct. 1229, 14 L. Ed. 2d 106, reh. denied, 381 U.S. 957, 85 S. Ct. 1797, 14 L. Ed. 2d 730 (1965). . . . This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>court applies the following test in evaluating whether a prosecutor\u2019s remark has violated this right: \u2018 \u201cWas the language used manifestly intended to be, or was it of such a character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify?\u201d \u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>206 Conn. 300, 307, 537 A.2d 1021 (1988); <em>United States ex rel. Leak </em>v. <em>Follette, </em>418 F.2d 1266, 1269 (2d Cir. 1969), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Leak </em>v. <em>Follette, </em>397 U.S. 1050, 90 S. Ct. 1388, 25 L. Ed. 2d 665 (1970). Even an indirect remark by the prosecuting attorney may violate a defendant\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination if it draws the jury\u2019s attention to the failure of the accused to testify. <em>State </em>v. <em>Menzies, </em>26 Conn. App. 674, 696, 603 A.2d 419, cert. denied, 221 Conn. 924, 608 A.2d 690 (1992) <em>(Berdon, J., </em>dissenting from denial of certiorari).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Arline, </em>223 Conn. 52, 66-67, 612 A.2d 755 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">During his opening summation, the state\u2019s attorney reviewed the defendant\u2019s statements to Officer Laureano. He stated that after the defendant was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights, the defendant \u201ctells some of the story. It\u2019s this incremental disclosure based on how much in trouble he thinks he is.\u201d The state\u2019s attorney then noted that although the defendant told Laureano that he wanted to reveal everything that he knew about the murders, he did not tell Laureano about being at Delgado\u2019s house, that he just bought the car\u2019, that he had been in a fight or that he had found drugs in his car.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">In rebuttal, the state\u2019s attorney argued that in the defendant\u2019s closing argument, \u201cdefense counsel [relied] on things the defendant said in his statement to the police, a statement that we can\u2019t cross-examine, but ... in that statement, the defendant says he found the box in his car.\u201d We conclude that the state\u2019s attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>was not commenting on the defendant\u2019s refusal to testify, but rather, on the weight to be afforded the defendant\u2019s statements to the police.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Negron, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 325 (challenged remark a comment on defendant\u2019s statements to three others); <em>State </em>v. <em>Magnotti, </em>198 Conn. 209, 220, 502 A.2d 404 (1985) (comment on \u201coverall quality of the defendant\u2019s evidence\u201d). We find no merit to the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Finally, the defendant requests that we inspect the exhibits sealed by the trial court to determine whether the contents were exculpatory and should have been disclosed. The record reveals that the defendant filed a pretrial motion for the disclosure of exculpatory evidence. During trial, the court reviewed numerous documents turned over by the state and, after determining that the state was not required to disclose the information in the documents, sealed them. We are unpersuaded by the defendant that he was prejudiced by that nondisclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">The defendant has a right to the disclosure of exculpatory evidence under the due process clauses of both the United States constitution and the Connecticut constitution. <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 86, 83 S.

We have reviewed the sealed exhibits and the record, in the manner presented, and conclude that the defendant was not prejudiced.

Afterwards I went to my girlfriend\u2019s house [whose] name is Elizabeth Delgado and lives on the Street Hillside Avenue. I arrived at her house about six in the evening. Her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>husband was working. I was there a short time when a man that I know only as \u2018Tato\u2019 arrived with a car that he wanted to sell.

I went directly to the home of Elizabeth. I arrived at Elizabeth\u2019s home like after nine at night. When I arrived at Elizabeth\u2019s house I was bleeding. On the pants I had blood. I had a coffee color pants and a green shirt. The shirt was shown to me by the detective. He brought it to the police station. The shirt was in my sister\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">\u201cElizabeth asked me what had happened. Because I had blood on the pants. I told her that I had gotten into a fight. I told her that I had a fight with a \u2018Boricua.\u2019 Afterwards I wanted to leave in the car but it would not start. I returned and told her to call me a taxi that I was going to my home. It was past 10 [p.m.] and Elizabeth\u2019s husband arrives like around twelve at night. Elizabeth called her sister-in-law and Elizabeth\u2019s brother took me home.

The futility of this argument, however, is demonstrated by the specifics of the defendant\u2019s primary claim. After the trial court initially denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the state revealed that during the initial interview there had been discussions concerning the deportation status of the defendant\u2019s family and the contract on his life and that the police had attempted to show the defendant, photographs of the victims. The motion to suppress was then opened, and Bermudez was recalled to testify regarding the specific questions the police had asked the defendant. The defendant then had every opportunity to explore the issue of voluntariness on cross-examination of Bermudez, or by calling his own witnesses, which he chose not to do.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b360-8\"> The defendant also points to the fact that the police tried to show him photographs of the victims. The defendant reacted to this by rocking in his chair and breaking out in \u201clike a cold sweat.\u201d We do not agree with the defendant, however, that this police action coerced him to give a confession.

The defendant\u2019s state and federal constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial were violated when the trial court improperly instructed the jury that it could find the defendant guilty of capital felony and robbery, either as a principal or as an accessory, after the jury had already commenced its deliberations, and when accessorial liability was neither alleged in the substitute information on those counts nor supported by the evidence. The egre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>giousness of the failure to furnish the defendant with notice that he was being charged with accessorial liability is underscored by the jury\u2019s vote in this case. Upon the trial court\u2019s polling of the jury,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the foreperson disclosed that ten members of the jury had voted to find the defendant guilty of capital felony and robbery as a principal, and two members had voted to find him guiliy as an accessory.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In other words, two jurors voted to acquit the defendant of the charges of capital felony and robbery as a principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Steve, </em>208 Conn. 38, 544 A.2d 1179 (1988), the majority of the court reversed a conviction because of the state\u2019s failure to put the defendant on notice that he was being prosecuted as an accessory as well as a principal. In <em>Steve, </em>the court held as follows: \u201cWe conclude that . . . the defendant was prejudiced in his defense as a result of a substantial variance between the allegations in the bill of particulars and the court\u2019s instructions concerning accessorial liability. It is clear that the presentation of his defense relied upon the state\u2019s claim [in its bill of particulars] that the defendant was in fact the principal of each crime. . . . It is significant that the state presented no evidence in its casein-chief suggesting that the defendant had acted as an accomplice. . . . The state did not seek to amend its information to allege that the defendant had acted as an accomplice . . . .We do not regard the state\u2019s notification to the defendant prior to [closing] argument of its intention to request a charge on accessorial liability as equivalent to an amendment offered seasonably before the close of evidence. . . . Accordingly, we need not decide whether such an amendment would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>been proper in these circumstances. We conclude that the court\u2019s instructions concerning accessorial liability were not in substantial conformity with either the allegations in the bill of particulars or the evidence in the state\u2019s case-in-chief, and, therefore, hold that these instructions were erroneous.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 45-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">In an attempt to distinguish this case from <em>Sieve, </em>the majority claims that the defendant was put on notice of accessorial liability, based upon the conspiracy counts from the \u201csubstitute information and bill of particulars\u201d (substitute information) that the majority has applied completely out of context \u2014 that is, the majority points to clauses that allege that the defendant \u201cagreed with another person, who is believed to use the street name, \u2018Yo-Yo,\u2019 to intentionally cause the death of [the victims] . . . .\u2019\u2019First, this is not language of accessorial liability, but, rather, it is that of a conspiracy. This is made absolutely clear by the fact that the substitute information does not refer to the accessorial liability statute, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but, instead, it refers to the conspiracy statute, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-48.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For instance, the first count of the substitute information provides in pertinent part: \u201cState\u2019s Attorney . . . accuses -Jesus Alberto Correa ... of the crime of conspiracy to commit capital felony, in violation of Connecticut General Statutes Sections 53a-48 [conspiracy] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>and 53a-54b (8) [capital felony], and charges that at an unknown place, on or around November 15, 1990, Correa agreed with another person, who is believed to use the street name, \u2018Yo-Yo,\u2019 to intentionally cause the death of two persons . . . and that Correa committed an overt act in furtherance of said conspiracy, that is, he obtained a handgun and went to Adelaide Street, Hartford, CT, on November 15, 1990, to commit said murders.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This did not furnish the defendant with notice that he was being prosecuted as an accessory when he was only charged as a principal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Furthermore, the substitute information was filed in response to the defendant\u2019s motion for a bill of particulars,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which sought, inter alia, \u201c[t]he specific crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>charged including the statutory number, subsection and language which the defendant is alleged to have violated [and] [t]he specific acts, language or behavior of the defendant alleged to constitute the crime charged.\u201d Based upon the state\u2019s response to the motion, which culminated in the filing of the substitute information, it is clear that the state did not charge him with accessorial liability in the capital felony, murder or robbery counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Finally, even the assistant state\u2019s attorney conceded at trial that the defendant was charged as a principal when he stated to the trial court that if the defense were to suggest, by way of evidence or argument to the jury, that the defendant was an accessory, then the state would seek an accessory instruction \u201ceven though he was charged as a principal in the information.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">The majority also attempts to distinguish <em>Steve </em>on the basis that in this case there was evidence on which the jury could have found that the defendant was an accessory. This is simply incorrect. In this case, there was no evidence, as the state conceded at trial, of accessorial liability on the part of the defendant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>did not offer evidence that any person other than the defendant played an active role in the shooting. The only evidence introduced pointed to the defendant as principal. Indeed, even if we assume that there was evidence of accessorial liability, this case is more compelling than <em>Steve </em>for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">In <em>Steve, </em>the prosecution requested an accessorial charge prior to closing arguments. In this case, <em>only after the jury </em>sent a note to the trial court, raising the question of accessorial liability, did the court instruct the jury on this issue. Notwithstanding the majority\u2019s intimation to the contrary, the record clearly indicates that the instruction on accessorial liability was given after the jury began its deliberations, and <em>the state concedes this in its brief </em>The trial court completed its charge to the jury at 12:48 p.m. and suggested that the jury go to lunch. Specifically, the trial court stated that: \u201cYour first duty when you go into the jury room will be to select a foreperson from among you and then, after all of the exhibits are delivered to you, you may start your deliberations. . . . I\u2019m going to excuse you now. My suggestion to you is, in view of the lateness \u2014 if you wish to select your foreman before you go to lunch, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>you can do that. If not, you\u2019ve certainly been sitting here long enough that you deserve to go to lunch but when you come back, you will go to the deliberation room. . . . You may not discuss this case unless all of you are together \u2014 all twelve of you are together in the deliberation room.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Because the judge had a commitment and would not return until between 3 and 3:30 p.m., and after having been instructed in the aforementioned manner, it is clear that the jury began deliberating before 3:57 p.m., the time at which they were brought back into the courtroom. This conclusion, which the majority does not directly contradict, is based on several facts. First, defense counsel expressed concern because the trial court would not entertain his exceptions to the charge until the judge returned after 3 p.m., and after the jury began its deliberations.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Second, defense counsel, when taking his exception to the supplemental instruction on accessorial liability the next day, referred to the fact that the jury had been deliberating for approximately one and one-half hours. Third, it is common sense to conclude that the jury commenced its deliberations prior to the charge on accessorial liability due to the fact that the jury crafted two questions for the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>court, one of which prompted the giving of the accessorial liability charge.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The conclusion that the jury began deliberating before the trial court instructed it on accessorial liability is buttressed by several other revealing facts contained in the transcripts. Before the jury returned to the courtroom at 3:57 p.m., the trial court had a short colloquy with the attorneys regarding the jury questions it had been presented with by the sheriff. After the questions were read into the record, the trial court stated that \u201cif they want to keep deliberating, I don\u2019t have any problem. We\u2019ll just tell them that we can\u2019t give them an answer right now.\u201d The assistant state\u2019s attorney indicated that he did not want the jury to continue deliberating without the jury\u2019s questions first being answered by the court. After the jury returned to the courtroom, the trial court excused the jurors for the day and indicated that the court would answer their questions in the morning. In doing so, it was clearly indicated by the jury that it had been deliberating.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The next morn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>ing, the trial court gave supplemental instructions to the jury on certain issues and added the improper instructions on accessorial liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Unlike in <em>Steve, </em>we know that the jury\u2019s verdict was not unanimous in the present case. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Steve, </em>supra, 208 Conn. 47 (jury not polled, but concluding that trial court\u2019s improper instruction on accessorial liability \u201cmore likely than not affected the result\u201d). Here, the trial court polled the jury and exposed the fact that ten jurors had found the defendant guilty as a principal on the capital felony and robbery in the first degree counts, and two jurors had found him guilty as an accessory on those counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Finally, the defendant was misled by the state because the state advised the trial court and defense counsel, after the presentation of its case-in-chief, that it would not seek a charge on accessorial liability unless the defendant suggested, by way of evidence or argument to the jury, that he was was not a principal, but an accessory.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The defendant relied on this representation when he presented his defense. It was only after the jury sought a clarification as to whether it could find the defendant guilty as an accessory on certain counts did the trial court broaden the defendant\u2019s potential culpability by instructing the jury that it could find him guilty as an accessory on those counts on which he had been charged only as a principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">I find that not only is this case on all fours with <em>Steve, </em>but it presents additional facts, all of which are undisputed, that make it more compelling. In my view, the accessorial liability instruction deprived the defendant of a fair trial and due process of law. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Franko, </em>199 Conn. 481, 491-92, 508 A.2d 22 (1986) (\u201c[d]ue process requires that a criminal defendant be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>given notice of the specific charge against him and an opportunity to defend against that charge\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b384-7\"> The defendant was also charged with and found guilty of two counts of murder. The jury was not polled on the murder counts because murder is a lesser included offense of the crime of capital felony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b384-8\"> The defendant also raises the issue of whether such a nonunanimous jury verdict passes state constitutional muster. I leave that issue for another day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b385-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8 provides in pertinent part: \u201cCriminal liability for acts of another, (a) A person, acting with the mental state required for commission of an offense, who solicits, requests, commands, importunes or intentionally aids another person to engage in conduct which constitutes an offense shall be criminally liable for such conduct, and may be prosecuted and punished as if he were the principal offender. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b385-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-48 provides in pertinent part: \u201cConspiracy. . . .

The defendant does not raise the issue of notice of accessorial liability with respect to counts six and seven, but, rather, he argues that he was not given notice of his potential culpability as an accessory under the capital felony charge (count three), the murder charges (counts four and live), and the robbery in the first degree charge (count nine).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b386-10\"> \u201cThe purpose of a bill of particulars is to inform the defendant of the charges against him with sufficient precision to enable him to prepare his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>defense and to avoid prejudicial surprise. ... A bill of particulars limits the state to proving that the defendant has committed the offense in substantially the manner described.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Steve, </em>supra, 208 Conn. 44.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b387-12\"> See footnote 9 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b387-13\"> The majority relies on the vague testimony of an eyewitness in the state\u2019s case-in-chief that, after she heard gunshots, she saw someone, who did not look unlike the defendant, run from the victim\u2019s automobile carrying a box and enter the passenger side of the getaway vehicle. The majority states that this testimony demonstrates that the state attempted to prove that the defendant was either the principal or an accessary. This assertion, however, is inconsistent with the admission by the assistant state\u2019s attorney at trial and the theory on which the state tried its case.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-14\">After the state completed its case-in-chief, the assistant state\u2019s attorney started to mention the possible issue of accessorial liability, and the trial court quickly responded by asking him, \u201c[d]o we have some evidence here of accessorial liability?\u201d The assistant state\u2019s attorney responded: \u201cI don\u2019t think so but . . . there\u2019s a possibility that defense counsel could either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>argue to the jury or perhaps attempt to present evidence that . . . the defendant was the driver and not the assailant or whatever. And if that\u2019s the case, we certainly want the record to be clear that if such an argument or suggestion is going to be made to the jury, we would rely on the statute that allows Your Honor to charge [him as an] accessory even though he was charged as aprincipal in the information.\u201d There is not even a suggestion by the assistant state\u2019s attorney that the defendant presented evidence or raised the issue of accessorial liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">The state, in its closing argument, argued to the jury that the defendant was the shooter/robber and reminded the jury \u201cthat you do not need to know the identity of any accomplice or any coconspirator in order to find the defendant guilty of the crimes charged that involve an accomplice or coconspirator.\u201d Indeed, the state presented testimony that the defendant, shortly after the time that the shootings occurred, arrived at his girlfriend\u2019s apartment carrying a box, with blood on his pants. The state also offered forensic evidence and testimony that the shirt worn by the defendant at that time contained residue from gunshots fired at close range.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b389-7\"> The following colloquy occurred after the judge excused the jury and advised counsel that he would not return until approximately between 3 and 3:30 p.m.:</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">\u201cMr. Gold [Defense Counsel]: . . .

But I mean, if they say they\u2019ve come to a verdict and I haven\u2019t done it yet, I suppose we\u2019ll have to face that at the time but well face that.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b390-7\"> The first question from the jury, written by the foreperson of the jury at 2:20 p.m., asking whether it could begin deliberating, was obviously moot by the time the jury was brought back into the courtroom at 3:57 p.m. The second question from the jury, written by the foreperson at 3:25 p.m., was with respect to whether it could consider accessorial liability on certain charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b390-8\"> After the jury returned to the courtroom, one juror asked the court whether the juiy would be allowed to continue deliberating without having its questions answered. The following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">\u201cThe Court: [Sjomebody have a question? Is there a problem at coming in at 10 o\u2019clock?</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">\u201cJuror: No, I was just \u2014 we shouldn\u2019t continue if we \u2014 I mean, if we feel that we want to continue without having those questions ....</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">\u201cThe Court: Without the questions being answered at this time? Do you want to?</p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">\u201cJuror: I don\u2019t know. We have to discuss it but is that an option?</p>\n<p id=\"b390-13\">\u201cThe Court: Well, if you\u2019d like to. If you\u2019d like to but I don\u2019t \u2014 you know, I\u2019d just as soon you not \u2014 I\u2019d like to answer your questions first. I think perhaps you might be going down the wrong road if I don\u2019t answer them first. So, do you agree with that? Okay. ... So then I\u2019ll excuse you at this time . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b391-9\"> See footnote 9 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
