The plaintiff insurance company, Thompson &amp; Peck, Inc., from September 24, 1989 through August 21, 1990, provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>workers\u2019 compensation insurance and general employer\u2019s liability insurance to the named defendant Division Drywall, Inc. (insured), and Connecticut Drywall, Inc., as named insureds, on an \u201copen account\u201d basis for all work they performed in various states. On or about June 22, 1989, the insured entered into a subcontract with Konover Construction Corporation and Segu\u00ed Associates and Company, Inc., a \u201cconstruction joint venture,\u201d to perform certain drywall installations at a project in New Haven known as Century Tower, which is owned by the defendant Century-New Haven Limited Partnership (owner). Claiming that it was owed insurance premiums, the plaintiff filed a mechanic\u2019s lien against Century Tower in the amount of $67,218. By agreement, the owner, as principal, and the defendant Aetna Casualty and Surety Company (surety), as surety, substituted a bond for the lien in the amount of $81,000. The plaintiff thereafter filed the present action for breach of contract against the insured in the first count and for recovery under the lien against the owner and the surety in the second count.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 378 et seq., the owner and the surety filed a motion for summary judgment as to count two of the complaint, claiming that the mechanic\u2019s lien foreclosure action failed as a matter of law because the underlying lien was not based on \u201cmaterials\u201d or \u201cservices\u201d that the legislature intended to be secured by a mechanic\u2019s lien. The trial court agreed, as a matter of law, that unpaid insurance premiums could not be secured by a mechanic\u2019s lien on a plot of land and, therefore, rendered summary judgment for the owner and the surety on count two of the complaint. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>We conclude that the legislature did not intend to extend the benefits of the mechanic\u2019s lien statute to an insurance agent attempting to collect unpaid premiums from an insured subcontractor. Specifically, we conclude that the trial court properly rendered summary judgment on the second count of the plaintiffs complaint because the legislature did not intend to include within \u00a7 49-33 those persons or businesses whose services have not enhanced the property in some physical manner, laid the groundwork for the physical enhancement of the property, or whose work was not an essential part in the scheme of physical improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\u201cThe standards governing our review of a trial court\u2019s decision to grant a motion for summary judgment are well established. Practice Book \u00a7 384 provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. . . . <em>Miller </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>233 Conn. 732, 744-45, 660 A.2d 810 (1995). In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. . . . Id., 745. The party seeking summary judgment has the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue [of] material facts which, under applicable principles of substantive law, entitle him to a judgment as a matter of law; <em>D.H.R. Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Donnelly, </em>180 Conn. 430, 434, 429 A.2d 908 (1980); and the party opposing such a motion must provide an evidentiary foundation to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact. Practice Book \u00a7 381. . . . <em>Suarez </em>v. <em>Dickmont Plastics Corp., </em>229 Conn. 99, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>105, 639 A.2d 507 (1994).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Doty </em>v. <em>Mucci, </em>238 Conn. 800, 805-806, 679 A.2d 945 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">In the present case, there is no dispute that the plaintiff is an insurance agency and that the mechanic\u2019s lien represents unpaid insurance premiums due and owing from the insured. The plaintiff nevertheless contends that the question of whether insurance coverage constitutes materials or services rendered in the construction of the building in issue is a question of fact. We disagree. The interpretation of the language of \u00a7 49-33 is an issue of law. See generally <em>Camputaro </em>v. <em>Stuart Hardwood Corp., </em>180 Conn. 545, 429 A.2d 796 (1980). In the absence of any issue of fact, we are left to decide whether the trial court properly concluded that the mechanic\u2019s lien failed as a matter of law because \u201cunpaid insurance premiums cannot be secured by a mechanic\u2019s lien\u201d because \u201cunder the mechanic\u2019s lien statute \u2018materials\u2019 and \u2018services\u2019 do not include insurance premiums.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. Under our rules of statutory construction, we are guided by the words of the statute itself, the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, the legislative policy the statute was designed to implement, and its relationship to existing legislation and common-law principles governing the same subject matter. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>240 Conn. 317, 327-28, 692 A.2d 713 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">\u201cThe guidelines for interpreting mechanic\u2019s lien legislation are [equally] well established. Although the mechanic\u2019s lien statute creates a statutory right in derogation of the common law; <em>Camputaro </em>v. <em>Stuart Hardwood Corporation, </em>[supra, 180 Conn. 550]; <em>Gruss </em>v. <em>Miskinis, </em>130 Conn. 367, 370, 34 A.2d 600 (1943); its provisions should be liberally construed in order to implement its remedial purpose of furnishing security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>for one who provides services or materials. <em>H &amp; S Torrington Associates </em>v. <em>Lutz Engineering Co., </em>185 Conn. 549, 553, 441 A.2d 171 (1981); <em>Henry F. Raab Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>J. W. Fisher Co., </em>183 Conn. 108, 115, 438 A.2d 834 (1981). Our interpretation, however, may not depart from reasonable compliance with the specific terms of the statute under the guise of a liberal construction. <em>Camputaro </em>v. <em>Stuart Hardwood Corporation, </em>supra, 551; <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Rosenfield, </em>141 Conn. 188, 191, 104 A.2d 545 (1954). Finally, the provisions of our statute differ sufficiently from the mechanic\u2019s lien legislation of other states so that precedents elsewhere are of limited utility in the interpretation of our [statute]. <em>Camputaro </em>v. <em>Stuart Hardwood Corporation, </em>supra [551]; <em>New Haven Orphan Asylum </em>v. <em>Haggerty Co., </em>108 Conn. 232, 236, 142 A. 847 (1928).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Nickel Mine Brook Associates </em>v. <em>Joseph E. Sakal, P.C., </em>217 Conn. 361, 364-65, 585 A.2d 1210 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Pursuant to \u00a7 49-33, the persons entitled to claim a mechanic\u2019s hen are those who have provided \u201cservices\u201d or \u201cmaterials\u201d in connection with \u201cthe construction, raising, removal or repairs of any building or any of its appurtenances or in the improvement of any lot or in the site development or subdivision of any plot of land . . . .\u2019\u2019To date we have declined to address expressly the claim that \u00a7 49-33 includes <em>only </em>those services and materials that physically enhance the property or that lay the groundwork for physical enhancement. See <em>Nickel Mine Brook Associates </em>v. <em>Joseph E. Sakal, P. C., </em>supra, 217 Conn. 370 (because legal services are not included within \u00a7 49-33, court need not decide whether physical enhancement test is required). Nevertheless, our cases reflect a distinction between services and materials that have directly shaped the liened property and those that have not. Id., 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Prior to the statute\u2019s amendment by the legislature in 1974, our cases construing \u201cthe language of [\u00a7 49-33] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>. . . required, as a condition of lienability, that the work done be incorporated in or utilized in the building (or the appurtenance) to be constructed, raised, removed or repaired. . . . Our other cases . . . consistently . . . insisted that mechanic\u2019s lien work be wrought into the liened property in some fashion. Thus the installation of fixtures that do not become part of the realty; <em>Hartlin v. Cody, </em>144 Conn. 499, 506, 134 A.2d 245 (1957); or of electrical work that is not permanently attached to the realty; <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Rosenfield, </em>[supra, 141 Conn. 192]; <em>Abbadessa </em>v. <em>Puglisi, </em>101 Conn. 1, 124 A. 838 (1924); the removal of pipe from one building that is not incorporated into the building that is its replacement; <em>Hillhouse </em>v. <em>Duca, </em>101 Conn. 92, 101, 125 A. 367 (1924); and the furnishing of materials or equipment that is not shown to have gone into the construction or repair of a building; <em>Lewin &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Herman, </em>143 Conn. 146, 150, 120 A.2d 423 (1956); <em>Chapin v. Persse &amp; Brooks Paper Works, </em>30 Conn. 461, 473 (1862); <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Persse &amp; Brooks Paper Works, </em>29 Conn. 256, 267-68 (1860); [were] all unlienable. <em>Batch </em>v. <em>Chaffee, </em>73 Conn. 318, 321, 47 A. 327 (1900), did hold lienable as an appurtenance the construction of an artesian well not physically connected to the house which it was to serve, but <em>Batch </em>v. <em>Chaffee, </em>supra, 320, describes the category of appurtenance as one of detached <em>structures . . . </em>and its holding, thus limited, is therefore consistent with the structural constraints that our other cases . . . uniformly imposed.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Camputaro </em>v. <em>Stuart Hardwood Corp., </em>supra, 180 Conn. 552-53.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">In 1974, the legislature extended the reach of a mechanic\u2019s lien, under \u00a7 49-33, to encompass claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>for materials furnished or services rendered \u201cin the improvement of any lot or in the site development or subdivision of any plot of land . . . Public Acts 1974, No. 74-310, \u00a7 1. A key purpose of the amendment was to eliminate the requirement that the work be incorporated or utilized in a building or appurtenance and to extend the coverage of \u00a7 49-33 to two distinct types of services: (1) services rendered in the improvement of any lot; and (2) services rendered in the site development or subdivision of any plot of land. \u201c[T]he phrase \u2018improvement of any lot\u2019 was intended to include the same types of services embraced by the phrase \u2018site development or subdivision of any plot of land.\u2019 The only distinction intended by the legislature was between services benefiting particular lots and those benefiting the subdivision as a whole.\u201d <em>Nickel Mine Brook Associates </em>v. <em>Joseph E. Sakal, P.C., </em>supra, 217 Conn. 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">We have also decided that to be the subject of a mechanic\u2019s lien, the materials for which a lien has been claimed must not merely have been furnished for, or delivered to the site of, the particular building or improvement, but must actually also have been used in its construction. <em>Lewin &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Herman, </em>supra, 143 Conn. 150 (where some plumbing materials represented by mechanic\u2019s lien were used elsewhere, plumber not entitled to full amount claimed by lien). The rationale for this rule is that it is equitable to grant a lien against property that has increased in value by virtue of the use of materials and, conversely, that it is not equitable to burden the property with a lien to secure the price of materials that never entered the construction. Similarly, we have construed the meaning of \u201cservices\u201d to be confined to services that are of a mechanical nature or to those services related to the construction of a building or skilled workmen using tools, machinery and other equipment to improve the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>land. See <em>Nickel Mine Brook Associates </em>v. <em>Joseph E. Sakal, P.C., </em>supra, 217 Conn. 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The distinct difference between insurance providers and the types of services that we have indicated fall within the scope of \u00a7 49-33 is apparent. Id., 368. Historically, our cases construing the statute have required as a condition of lienability that the work done be <em>incorporated in </em>or <em>utilized in </em>the building to be constructed, raised, removed or repaired or in the improvement of any lot or subdivision. Moreover, the fact that the legislature consistently has referred to a \u201cmechanic\u2019s lien\u201d is some evidence of whom the legislature intended to be benefitted by the lien. \u201cA \u2018mechanic\u2019 [has been described] as a skilled worker who brings about a result by the use of tools, machines or equipment. See Random House Dictionary of the English Language (Unabridged <em>Ed.).\" Nickel Mine Brook Associates </em>v. <em>Joseph E. Sakal, P.C., </em>supra, 217 Conn. 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">With this background in mind, we conclude that, like legal services, \u00a7 49-33 does not extend to services not directly associated with the physical construction or improvement of the land. Our decision is bolstered by reference to statutes from other jurisdictions that, although sufficiently different such that the decisions of courts interpreting their terms are of limited significance, are nevertheless useful for comparison purposes. Unlike statutes in jurisdictions where insurance premiums are specifically defined as material furnished to a contractor; see, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Mountain States Mutual Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>KNC, Inc., </em>106 N.M. 140, 141, 740 P.2d 690 (1987) (\u201c \u2018worker\u2019s compensation insurance furnished to ... subcontractor ... is hereby defined to be material\u2019 \u201d [citation omitted]);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u00a7 49-33 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>does not contain express language permitting a lien upon premises the value or condition of which has not been benefited for items that have not improved the property. Although \u00a7 49-33 has been amended to extend the availability of a mechanic\u2019s hen; see Public Acts 1974, No. 74-310, \u00a7 1; the statute has not been amended to include services and materials that have not enhanced the property in some physical manner, laid the groundwork for the physical enhancement of the property or that did not play an essential part in the scheme of physical improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">We find further support for the conclusion that the insurance premiums owed by the insured are not hen-able as materials or services by a practical construction of the statute. \u201c[G]eneral words and phrases may be restricted in meaning to adapt their meaning to the subject-matter in reference to which they are used.\u201d <em>Barber </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>89 Conn. 583, 588, 94 A. 984 (1915). \u201cIn construing a statute, common sense must be used and courts must assume that a reasonable and rational result was intended.\u201d <em>Kron </em>v. <em>Thelen, </em>178 Conn. 189, 192, 423 A.2d 857 (1979). Interpreting \u00a7 49-33 to include insurance premiums could lead to the filing of mechanic\u2019s hens by a wide range of parties who provide services to builders and developers, such as real estate agents who are instrumental in the purchase of land and advise as to its potential uses, or financial advisers such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>bankers and accountants, giving them priority over any other encumbrance originating after the commencement of services or the furnishing of materials. See General Statutes \u00a7 49-33 (c); <em>see also Nickel Mine Brook Associates </em>v. <em>Joseph E. Sakal, P.C., </em>supra, 217 Conn. 371; <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Pace, </em>115 Conn. 702, 160 A. 428 (1932). \u201cAlthough as a general matter our mechanic\u2019s lien statute must be liberally construed; <em>JI&amp;S Torrington Associates </em>v. <em>Lutz Engineering Co., </em>supra, [185 Conn.] 553; we refuse to adopt an interpretation of \u00a7 49-33 (a) that could lead to such a fundamental change in our mechanic\u2019s lien statute absent clear evidence that the legislature intended such a far reaching result.\u201d <em>Nickel Mine Brook Associates </em>v. <em>Joseph E. Sakal, P.C., </em>supra, 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Finally, we must acknowledge the realities of the manner in which the construction world operates. At the request of the owner of the property, general contractors typically require subcontractors to furnish mechanic\u2019s lien waivers from all their material suppliers. These suppliers generally are the standard material-men who furnish actual materials such as lumber, electrical and plumbing fixtures, concrete, and the like. Were insurance agents to be included in the list of those from whom waivers are likely to be sought, the list, and indeed the possible candidates no longer limited by their direct contribution or essential link to the project, could be endless. Rather than serving to expedite matters and facilitate the payment process, the application of \u00a7 49-33 to the subcontractor\u2019s insurance provider would have the opposite and deleterious effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed as to the second count of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b393-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 49-33 provides: \u201cMechanic\u2019s lien.
