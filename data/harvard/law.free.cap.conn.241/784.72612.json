The defendant, Charles Coleman, was convicted after a jury trial of burglary in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101 (a) (2), burglary in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-102 (a), sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 53a-70 (a), and unlawful restraint in the first degree in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 53a-95 (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We granted the state\u2019s petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>for certification to appeal<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to this court from the judgment of the Appellate Court, which had reversed the judgment of conviction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>42 Conn. App. 78, 679 A.2d 950 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">On appeal to this court, the state claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the trial court should not have admitted evidence regarding the knives found in the defendant\u2019s vehicle and on his per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>son at the time of his arrest. We agree with the state and reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">There was evidence before the jury that the victim lived with her mother on the first floor of a two-family house in New Haven. \u201cIn the early morning hours of July 7, 1986, the victim was awakened by an assailant, who put his hand over her mouth. The assailant told the victim that if she did not do what he said, her mother would be harmed.\u201d Id., 80-81. The assailant then had sexual intercourse with the victim against her will.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">After her assailant had left, the victim \u201cchecked the doors and windows of the house. She noticed that the doors to the house were still locked, as they had been before she went to bed. The victim also noticed that the window in the living room was wide open, even though the screen had been down and in the locked position when she went to bed.\u201d Id., 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">When the police arrived, \u201cthey processed the scene for fingerprints, and found seven latent fingerprints on the windowsills of the window of entry and the victim\u2019s bedroom window.\u201d Id., 81. Two of the fingerprints found on the exterior of the bedroom window were identified as being those of the middle and ring fingers of the defendant\u2019s right hand.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Additionally, the police found that the window screens in the living room had been sliced on both sides with a sharp cutting instrument, and the assailant had reached through the slices in the screen in order to unlatch the locks and gain entry to the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">The defendant was arrested the following day, July 8, 1986, in connection with this incident. At the time of the defendant\u2019s arrest, he was sitting in his car and was carrying a knife. That knife was seized by the police, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>who, acting pursuant to a search warrant, subsequently seized three more knives from the defendant\u2019s automobile. At trial, the state sought to introduce evidence of the four knives claiming that they demonstrated that the defendant had the means with which to have cut the victim\u2019s window screens, and could thereby have reached in with his fingers to unlatch the locks and enter the victim\u2019s apartment. The defendant objected to the admission of any evidence regarding the knives, claiming that the evidence was irrelevant and more prejudicial than probative. The trial court overruled the objection, ruling that the evidence was relevant to establish the means of entry and that the objections were more suited to the weight of the evidence than to its admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">The evidence admitted with respect to the four knives was the testimony of the officer who had executed the search warrant, Detective James Stephenson, and a stipulation regarding the testimony of the arresting officer, Detective Ray Della Camera.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Additionally, the knives themselves were introduced as exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">We begin our analysis with the well established laws of evidence. \u201cRelevant evidence is evidence that has a logical tendency to aid the trier in the determination of an issue. . . . One fact is relevant to another if in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>the common course of events the existence of one, alone or with other facts, renders the existence of the other either more certain or more probable. . . . Evidence is irrelevant or too remote if there is such a want of open and visible connection between the evidentiary and principal facts that, all things considered, the former is not worthy or safe to be admitted in the proof of the latter. . . . Evidence is not rendered inadmissible because it is not conclusive. All that is required is that the evidence <em>tend </em>to support a relevant fact even to a slight degree, so long as it is not prejudicial or merely cumulative.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>235 Conn. 274, 305, 664 A.2d 743 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Further, \u201c[t]he trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility [and relevancy] of evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>202 Conn. 463, 482, 522 A.2d 249 (1987). The trial court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Avis, </em>209 Conn. 290, 298, 551 A.2d 26 (1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1097, 109 S. Ct. 1570, 103 L. Ed. 2d 937 (1989).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>236 Conn. 514, 549, 673 A.2d 1117 (1996). \u201cWe will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling, and only upset it for a manifest abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kulmac, </em>230 Conn. 43, 61, 644 A.2d 887 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">Applying these principles to the facts of this case, we conclude that the Appellate Court improperly determined that the trial court should not have admitted the evidence concerning the four knives. Our review of the record persuades us that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it determined that evidence regarding the knives was relevant to this case. The trial testimony indicated that the defendant had entered the victim\u2019s apartment by way of slits made in the window screen by a sharp cutting instrument. The state intro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>duced evidence of the knives to show that the defendant, twenty-two hours after the offense, had a number of sharp cutting instruments at his immediate disposal. \u201cIt is the generally accepted rule that in a case in which the defendant is charged with the offense of burglary, after proof of the burglary has been introduced the prosecution may show that the defendant had burglar tools or implements in his possession soon after the time of the commission of the offense and may introduce such tools or implements in evidence.\u201d <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>United States, </em>238 F.2d 145, 147 (10th Cir. 1956); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>205 Conn. 279, 283, 533 A.2d 553 (1987) (where victim bound by rope, testimony regarding clothesline in defendant\u2019s basement admissible to show defendant had access to rope); <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 482 (where victim bound by handcuffs, evidence that handcuffs were used at defendant\u2019s workplace admissible to show defendant\u2019s access to handcuffs); <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>198 Conn. 147, 157, 502 A.2d 874 (1985) (where defendant threatened victim with gun, evidence that gun with similar appearance was in defendant\u2019s possession shortly after crime admissible to show defendant\u2019s access to gun); <em>State </em>v. <em>Paoletto, </em>181 Conn. 172, 185-86, 434 A.2d 954 (1980) (in burglary case where entry was gained by forcibly tearing down door of building, evidence of pry bar and screwdriver found in defendant\u2019s possession admissible to show defendant\u2019s access to type of burglary tools used). Accordingly, the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the evidence with respect to the knives was irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">Further, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it determined that the evidence of the knives was more probative than prejudicial. We have recognized that even where evidence is relevant there are \u201cfour situations where prejudice to the defendant could outweigh the probative value of evidence. \u2018These are: (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>where the facts offered may unduly arouse the jury\u2019s emotions, hostility or sympathy, (2) where the proof and answering evidence it provokes may create a side issue that will unduly distract the jury from the main issues, (3) where the evidence offered and the counterproof will consume an undue amount of time, and (4) where the defendant, having no reasonable ground to anticipate the evidence, is unfairly surprised and unprepared to meet it.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>209 Conn. 458, 478-79, 551 A.2d 1231 (1988); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>DeMatteo, </em>186 Conn. 696, 702-703, 443 A.2d 915 (1982). None of these situations exists in this case. The state conceded in argument to the jury that the knives were relevant only to prove that the defendant had at his disposal the means to enter the victim\u2019s apartment. The state also conceded that it could not prove that any one of the knives was actually so used. The offer did not create a side issue or consume an undue amount of time. Furthermore, there was no surprise, because the defendant had knowledge from the time of their seizure that the state possessed the knives as evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">The defendant objected to the introduction of <em>any </em>evidence of the four knives, but failed to object specifically to the admission of any one of the four knives in particular as evidence and never made any distinct claim to any single knife. \u201cThis court, will not consider claimed errors on the part of the trial court unless it appears that the question was distinctly raised at the trial and was ruled upon and decided by the court . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Simms, </em>170 Conn. 206, 208, 365 A.2d 821, cert. denied, 425 U.S. 954, 96 S. Ct. 1732, 48 L. Ed. 2d 199 (1976); see also Practice Book \u00a7 4061 (appellate court \u201cnot. . . bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial\u201d). We are constrained to review the actions of the trial judge in ruling on the objection as made at trial. \u201cOur review of evidentiary rulings made by the trial court is limited to the specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>legal ground raised in the objection. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Weinberg, </em>215 Conn. 231, 246, 575 A.2d 1003, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 967, 111 S. Ct. 430, 112 L. Ed. 2d 413 (1990). . . . This court reviews rulings solely on the ground on which the party\u2019s objection is based. <em>State </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>162 Conn. 112, 118, 291 A.2d 750 (1971). . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 310. The nature of the defendant\u2019s objection thus limits our review of the trial court\u2019s decision to the prejudicial effect of admission of evidence concerning the four knives. Accordingly, we do not address whether the trial court should have admitted into evidence testimony regarding any one of the knives, rather than the four knives themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude, as did the Appellate Court, that the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that the evidence concerning the knives was relevant and more probative than prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to consider the defendant\u2019s remaining claims on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b807-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of burglary in the first degree when he enters or remains unlawfully in a building with intent to commit a crime therein and ...
