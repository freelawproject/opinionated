On November 2, 1994, in an oral ruling, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, to which the state excepted. On November 15, 1994, the charges against the defendant were dismissed, and the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>granted the state\u2019s motion for permission to appeal from the judgment of dismissal. The Appellate Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s granting of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress and the subsequent judgment of dismissal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Colvin, </em>42 Conn. App. 537, 542, 680 A.2d 1360 (1996). We granted the state\u2019s petition for certification to consider whether the Appellate Court, under the circumstances of this case, properly concluded that the cocaine discovered in the defendant\u2019s automobile must be suppressed. <em>State </em>v. <em>Colvin, </em>239 Conn. 922, 682 A.2d 1007 (1996).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">The following facts, which are recited in the Appellate Court\u2019s opinion, are relevant to the determination of the issue presented in this case. \u201cOn September 16, 1992, several [Hartford police] officers who were in the area conducting an investigation observed the defendant drive to 235 Sergeant Street and park his car. They then watched the defendant walk to 91 Atwood Street, 200 feet away from his car, and sit on a stoop. The officers observed the defendant for twenty-five minutes. During their surveillance, the officers did not witness a sale of narcotics or any act giving the appearance of a sale. At the close of their surveillance, Detectives Keith Knight and Henry Martin approached the defendant. The defendant knew them as police officers, saw their sidearms and badges, and addressed one of the officers by his first name. One of the detectives ordered the defendant to accompany them to his automobile. The defendant reluctantly complied and walked with the officers to the vehicle. While standing on the sidewalk next to the defendant\u2019s automobile, Martin looked through the window of the vehicle and observed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>in plain view a bag containing a white substance later determined to be a narcotic substance. The officers seized the bag and charged the defendant with possession of narcotics.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Colvin, </em>supra, 42 Conn. App. 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">On the basis of these facts, the trial court concluded that the defendant\u2019s detention, while being escorted to his automobile, was a de facto arrest. The trial court then stated: \u201c[T]here appears to now be fruits of a poisonous tree which apparently have to be suppressed, and so the court concludes that . . . those items . . . are suppressed for purposes of this trial.\u201d Subsequently, on November 15, 1994, the trial court dismissed the charges against the defendant and granted the state\u2019s motion for permission to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">On appeal, the Appellate Court concluded that the trial court properly granted the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress and the subsequent judgment of dismissal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Colvin, </em>supra, 42 Conn. App. 542. The Appellate Court based its decision on the state\u2019s inability to prove that the discovery of the narcotics was sufficiently attenuated from the allegedly unlawful arrest to cleanse it of its taint. The attenuation doctrine, as the Appellate Court noted, contains three factors that courts use to determine whether evidence is sufficiently attenuated from the alleged illegality to cleanse it of its taint: (1) \u201cthe temporal proximity of the illegal police action and the discovery of the evidence\u201d; (2) \u201cthe presence of intervening circumstances\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe purpose and flagrancy of the official misconduct.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 541; see <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>422 U.S. 590, 603-604, 95 S. Ct. 2254, 45 L. Ed. 2d 416 (1975); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cates, </em>202 Conn. 615, 621, 522 A.2d 788 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">With respect to the three factors of the attenuation doctrine, the Appellate Court stated: \u201c [Application of these factors to the present case supports the conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>sion that the discovery of the evidence in the defendant\u2019s vehicle was not sufficiently attenuated from the illegal arrest to be purged of the taint. First, the discovery of the evidence occurred shortly after the defendant\u2019s arrest. Second, there were no intervening circumstances between the arrest and the discovery of the contraband. Moreover, as in <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>222 Conn. 672, 684, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992), a continuum of police action existed in that, from the time the police ordered the defendant to go to his car until the discovery of the evidence, the officers did not allow the defendant to leave. Finally, by effectuating an illegal arrest, the police officers engaged in misconduct similar to that in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 422 U.S. 605. As in <em>Brown, </em>this illegal arrest had a quality of purposefulness: \u2018The impropriety of the arrest was obvious . . . .The arrest, both in design and in execution, was investigatory.\u2019 Id.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Colvin, </em>supra, 42 Conn. App. 541-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">On appeal, the state contends that \u201cthe trial court should not have suppressed the cocaine because it was not obtained by exploitation of [the defendant\u2019s] detention, but rather, by virtue of the fact that it was exposed in plain view in a car parked on a public road.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant argues, in support of the trial court\u2019s suppression of the cocaine, that the evidence was derived from his illegal seizure, and, therefore, should be considered fruit of the poisonous tree. See <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 83 S. Ct. 407, 9 L. Ed. 2d 441 (1963). Additionally, he claims that the evidence is not admissible by reason of any recognized doctrine, such as: (1) independent source; see <em>Silverthome Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>251 U.S. 385, 392, 40 S. Ct. 182, 64 L. Ed. 319 (1920); (2) inevitable discovery; see <em>Nix </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>467 U.S. 431, 444, 104 S. Ct. 2501, 81 L. Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>2d 377 (1984); or (3) attenuation. See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 422 U.S. 603. We agree with the state that the seizure was not the result of the defendant\u2019s detention, and, therefore, conclude that the trial court incorrectly granted the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Our standard of review of a trial court\u2019s findings and conclusions in connection with a motion to suppress is well defined. A finding of fact will not be disturbed unless it is \u201cclearly erroneous in view of the evidence and pleadings in the whole record . . . .\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 4061; <em>State </em>v. <em>Oquendo, </em>223 Conn. 635, 645, 613 A.2d 1300 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kyles, </em>221 Conn. 643, 660, 607 A.2d 355 (1992). \u201c[W]here the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision . . . .\u201d <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221, 435 A.2d 24 (1980); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Trine, </em>236 Conn. 216, 225, 673 A.2d 1098 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">\u201cUnder the exclusionary rule, evidence must be suppressed if it is found to be the \u2018fruit\u2019 of prior police illegality. <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, [371 U.S.] 485. All evidence is not, however, a \u2018fruit of the poisonous tree\u2019 simply because it would not have been discovered but for the illegal action of law enforcement officials. Id., 487-88; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Villafane, </em>171 Conn. 644, 655, 372 A.2d 82 (1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1106, 97 S. Ct. 1137, 51 L. Ed. 2d 558 (1977), overruled in part on other grounds, <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>191 Conn. 233, 464 A.2d 758 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1084, 104 S. Ct. 1455, 79 L. Ed. 2d 772, reh. denied, 466 U.S. 954, 104 S. Ct. 2163, 80 L. Ed. 2d 547 (1984). \u2018Rather, the more apt question in such a case is \u201cwhether, granting establishment of the primary illegality, the evidence to which instant objection is made has been come at by exploita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>tion of that illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.\u201d \u2019 <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 488, quoting Maguire, Evidence of Guilt (1959) p. 221.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cates, </em>202 Conn. 615, 619-20, 522 A.2d 788 (1987). The initial determination is, therefore, whether \u201cthe challenged evidence is in some sense the product of illegal government activity.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Crews, </em>445 U.S. 463, 471, 100 S. Ct. 1244, 63 L. Ed. 2d 537 (1980); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>29 Conn. App. 207, 216, 614 A.2d 1229 (1992), aff'd, 227 Conn. 363, 630 A.2d 1315 (1993) (\u201c[b]ecause the seizure of the gun did not owe its origin in material part to the [illegal] <em>Terry </em>stop, the <em>Terry </em>stop cannot provide a basis for excluding the gun from evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Our decision in this case is controlled by our previous decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>200 Conn. 9, 509 A.2d 493 (1986). In <em>Graham, </em>\u201ctwo Waterford police officers went to the defendant\u2019s home and searched the premises pursuant to a \u2018search and seizure warrant.\u2019 Although the police did not find any of the stolen property anticipated, the defendant was arrested at that time. While they were leaving the premises, the officers saw the defendant\u2019s car across the street parked in a lot accessible to the public. They walked over to the car and looked into the rear seat with the aid of a flashlight. On the seat they noticed a rope which matched the description of the one used in the robbery. On the basis of this observation, they obtained a warrant and returned later to seize the rope.\u201d Id., 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">The defendant in <em>Graham </em>argued that his arrest was unlawful, that the discovery of the rope was the \u201cfruit\u201d of that unlawful arrest and, therefore, that the rope must be suppressed. We concluded, however, that \u201c[e]ven if we were to assume, without deciding, that the arrest of the defendant was illegal, we cannot agree with the defendant that the rope is inadmissible. The plain view \u2018search\u2019 of the car was wholly unconnected with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>arrest other than by the fact that it occurred shortly thereafter. The arrest did not generate a confession leading the police to the rope in the car; cf. <em>Brown </em>v. Illinois, [supra, 422 U.S. 590]; nor did the search of the car take place \u2018incident to arrest.\u2019 Cf. <em>Chimel </em>v. <em>California, </em>395 U.S. 752, 89 S. Ct. 2034, 23 L. Ed. 2d 685 (1969) .... We conclude, therefore, that the rope was not the \u2018fruit\u2019 of an allegedly illegal arrest.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">We find the same to be true in the present case. The trial court heard no evidence that would support a conclusion that the discovery of the cocaine was the product of the allegedly unlawful arrest and the trial court made no such finding. More specifically, there is no evidence of any exchange between the defendant and the police officers during the allegedly unlawful detention that might be construed as causing the police officer to look into the defendant\u2019s automobile.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There is clear evidence, moreover, that the police officers knew which automobile was the defendant\u2019s before approaching him on Atwood Street. As in <em>Graham, </em>the allegedly unlawful arrest is not causally connected with the discovery of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">The defendant, however, attempts to distinguish <em>Graham </em>by focusing on the fact that the officers in <em>Graham </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>had a valid search warrant for the defendant\u2019s dwelling and that the police activity in that case, including the viewing of the rope, was surrounded by an air of legitimacy. The defendant contrasts this to the \u201cunsavory sense of purposefulness\u201d in the present case. The defendant\u2019s characterizations of the action of the police, however, are inapposite to the issue before us. We acknowledge that \u201cthe purpose and flagrancy of the official misconduct\u201d should be considered when evaluating an attenuation argument. It is not the state\u2019s claim, however, that the discovery of the cocaine was sufficiently attenuated to divest the discovery from the taint of the allegedly unlawful arrest. The state argues, instead, that the discovery of the evidence simply was not the result of the allegedly unlawful police conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">In response to the state\u2019s contention that the \u201cplain view\u201d doctrine is applicable to this case, the defendant argues that \u201c[s]ince the police officers came to be in a position to view the contraband because of the illegal arrest, the resultant seizure of the contraband must be suppressed.\u201d For the purposes of this argument, the defendant presumes that the illegal arrest placed the officers next to the defendant\u2019s car. As noted previously, there is no evidence in the record to support this assumption. The only link between the allegedly unlawful arrest and the discovery of the cocaine that is supported by the evidence is that the defendant was allegedly being unlawfully detained when the police observed the cocaine. The defendant, however, has provided no authority to support the contention that the concurrent nature of two causally distinct events, in and of itself, is a sufficient basis in this case to conclude that the discovery of the cocaine was tainted by the allegedly unlawful arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>Additionally, \u201c[t]he defendant\u2019s position contravenes the exclusionary rule\u2019s purpose of ensuring fairness and balancing the interests of the state and the defendant. \u2018Fairness can be assured by placing the State and the accused in the same positions they would have been in had the impermissible conduct not taken place.\u2019 <em>Nix </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>[supra, 467 U.S. 447]. \u2018When the challenged evidence has an independent source, exclusion of such evidence would put the police in a worse position than they would have been in absent any error or violation.\u2019 Id., 443.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>239 Conn. 235, 250, 684 A.2d 1165 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">If we were to adopt the defendant\u2019s position and suppress the cocaine as the fruit of an illegal arrest, we would place the police in a worse position than they would have been if the allegedly unlawful police conduct had not occurred, because if the allegedly unlawful arrest had not occurred, the police would have been free to approach the defendant\u2019s automobile and view the cocaine.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Nix </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 467 U.S. 447. In essence, the defendant asks us to conclude that the allegedly unlawful arrest made the police officers\u2019 presence on the sidewalk adjacent to the car unlawful. We decline to adopt such a position.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">We determine that the cocaine in this instance was not discovered as a result of the allegedly unlawful arrest. The police had a perfect right to be where they were and to observe the cocaine, notwithstanding any arrest. The suppression of the cocaine, therefore, is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>warranted because it was not seized as a consequence of police misconduct.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, that the trial court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress because there is no evidence to establish a causal connection between the allegedly unlawful arrest and the discovery of the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to remand the case to the trial court with direction to deny the motion to suppress and to reinstate the information and proceed according to law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">In this opinion NORCOTT, PALMER and MCDONALD, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b673-14\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (b) provides: \u201cAny person who manufactures, distributes, sells, prescribes, dispenses, compounds, transports with the intent to sell or dispense, possesses with the intent to sell or dispense, offers, gives or administers to another person any narcotic substance, halluci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>nogenic substance other than marijuana, amphetamine-type substance, or one kilogram or more of a cannabis-type substance except as authorized in this chapter, and who is not at the time of such action a drug-dependent person, for a first offense shall be imprisoned not less than five years nor more than twenty years; and for each subsequent offense shall be imprisoned not less than ten years nor more than twenty-five years.

I disagree with the majority opinion that the seizure of the narcotics was not the result of the defendant\u2019s detention. Because the evidence was seized as a consequence of police misconduct and its discoveiy was not sufficiently attenuated to divest it of the taint of the defendant\u2019s unlawful arrest, I would affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">The exclusionary rule is a judicially prescribed remedial measure that prohibits the introduction in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>criminal prosecution of evidence obtained by law enforcement officers through unconstitutional means. \u201cAs with any remedial device, the application of the rule has been restricted to those areas where its remedial objectives are thought most efficaciously served.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 348, 94 S. Ct. 613, 38 L. Ed. 2d 561 (1974). The rule reaches primary evidence obtained as a direct result of an illegal search or seizure; <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>United States, </em>232 U.S. 383, 398, 34 S. Ct. 341, 58 L. Ed. 652 (1914); as well as evidence later discovered and found to be derivative of an illegality or \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d <em>Nardone </em>v. <em>United States, </em>308 U.S. 338, 341, 60 S. Ct. 266, 84 L. Ed. 307 (1939). Evidence is not to be excluded, however, if the connection between the illegal police conduct and the discovery and seizure of the evidence is \u201cso attenuated as to dissipate the taint.\u201d Id. When evidence is obtained as a direct result of an unconstitutional search or seizure, it is subject to exclusion if it is \u201ctainted\u201d by the prior illegality, which determination depends on whether the challenged evidence was \u201ccome at by exploitation of [the initial] illegality or instead by means <em>sufficiently distinguishable </em>to be purged of the primary taint.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 488, 83 S. Ct. 407, 9 L. Ed. 2d 441 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The Supreme Court of the United States has never held that evidence is to be suppressed as \u201c \u2018fruit of the poisonous tree\u2019 simply because it would not have come to light but for the illegal actions of the police.\u201d Id.; <em>Rawlings </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>448 U.S. 98, 106, 100 S. Ct. 2556, 65 L. Ed. 2d 633 (1980); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>422 U.S. 590, 599, 95 S. Ct. 2254, 45 L. Ed. 2d 416 (1975). By the same token, those Supreme Court cases make it clear that evidence will not be excluded as \u201cfruit\u201d unless the illegality is <em>at least </em>the \u201cbut for\u201d cause of the discovery of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>the evidence. <em>Segura </em>v. <em>United States, </em>468 U.S. 796, 815, 104 S. Ct. 3380, 82 L. Ed. 2d 599 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">What the majority opinion ignores in the present case is the \u201cbut for\u201d language that is essential to the holding of the previously cited Supreme Court cases. Although the court in <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 371 U.S. 488, rejected a \u201cbut for\u201d test for determining whether to suppress evidence gathered following a fourth amendment violation, that court nevertheless imposed the test as a threshold matter to the issue of whether the seized evidence was a \u201cfruit.\u201d After the court determines that, but for the illegality, the evidence \u201cwould not have come to light,\u201d only then does the court inquire into whether the evidence is tainted. Id. The focus turns to whether the prior illegality and the seizure of the evidence in question were so interconnected as to render the evidence tainted, or whether the connection between the illegality and the seizure of the evidence was so attenuated as to render the evidence untainted.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">In the present case, the majority relies on the state\u2019s argument that the discovery of the evidence was not at all connected to the illegal seizure of the defendant because, as in <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>200 Conn. 9, 20, 509 A.2d 493 (1986), the police knew which automobile belonged to the defendant, and, therefore, presumably would have looked into the car even if they had not arrested the defendant. The majority\u2019s treatment of the issue, however, is couched in language generally used to invoke exceptions to the exclusionary rule. See <em>Nix </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>467 U.S. 431, 448, 104 S. Ct. 2501, 81 L. Ed. 2d 377 (1984); see also S. LaCount &amp; A. Girese, \u201cThe \u2018Inevitable Discovery\u2019 Rule, An Evolving Exception to the Constitutional Exclusionary Rule,\u201d 40 Albany L. Rev. 483 (1976); R. Maguire, \u201cHow to Unpoison the Fruit\u2014The Fourth Amendment and the Exclusionary Rule,\u201d 55 J. Crim. L. Criminology &amp; Police Sci. 307, 313-17 (1964). Such analysis implicitly recognizes that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>a determination has already been made that the seizure <em>was </em>connected to the initial illegality.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">In my view, the proper analysis should focus on whether the seizure of the evidence owed its origin in material part to the seizure of the defendant. The trial court found that \u201c[o]ne of the detectives ordered the defendant to accompany them to his automobile. The defendant reluctantly complied and walked with the officers to the vehicle.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Colvin, </em>42 Conn. App. 537, 539, 680 A.2d 1360 (1996). Under the circumstances of this case, the trial court found that this was a sufficient causal connection between the arrest and the discovery of the evidence. I see no reason to disagree with that determination as a matter of law, based upon the facts the trial court reasonably could have found. See <em>Segura </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 468 U.S. 806 (\u201cif all the contents of the apartment were \u2018seized\u2019 at the time of the illegal entry and securing [of the premises], presumably the evidence [being] challenged would be suppressible as primary evidence obtained as a direct result of that entry\u201d). This is not a case in which the chain between the challenged evidence and the primary illegality is long or in which the linkage is being demonstrated by sophistic argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">Indeed, relying on the various factors specified by the Supreme Court to assess attenuation, I consider the record in this case to be devoid of any evidence of intervening circumstances to otherwise break the causal connection. The record supports the temporal proximity of the arrest and the seizure of the evidence, the first factor generally examined by the Supreme Court when faced with the question of attenuation. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 422 U.S. 604. Another factor considered by the Supreme Court is whether there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>existed intervening circumstances, such as an intervening lawful arrest; see <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>406 U.S. 356, 365, 92 S. Ct. 1620, 32 L. Ed. 2d 152 (1972); or consent. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fortier, </em>113 Ariz. 332, 335-36, 553 P.2d 1206 (1976) (where record indicated defendant voluntarily opened trunk of car without request by officer, evidence was not seized through exploitation of illegal stop). In the present case, there is no evidence of any break in the chain leading from the defendant\u2019s arrest to the seizure of the evidence. Accordingly, I agree with the trial court that there is no antidote to the poison in this fruit.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Although there may indeed have been different theories upon which the state could have relied to circumvent the fourth amendment violation, including, but not limited to, inevitable discovery, the trial court rejected the state\u2019s proposition in that regard and expressly found that the state had not \u201c \u2018demonstrate^!] that the lawful means which made discovery inevitable were possessed by the police and were being actively pursued prior to the occurrence of the constitutional violation.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b686-8\"> This is the same procedural step that was passed over by the court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 20.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
