It did not rule on the defendants\u2019 alternative contention that, even if they are farm labor contractors, they may claim an exemption pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 3(b)(2) &amp; (3) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.- \u00a7 2042(b)(2)-(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-25\">As explained more fully below, the district court misconstrued the Act in holding that the defendant packing shed operators could not be farm labor contractors. The error resulted from the district court\u2019s excluding the plaintiff employees from coverage by the Act through an improper literal application of the Act\u2019s definition of the term \u201cmigrant workers.\u201d <em>See </em>7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2042(g). Status as a \u201cfarm labor contractor\u201d hinges upon hiring \u201cmigrant workers.\u201d 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2042(b). The Act read as a whole, the manifest legislative purpose and history of the Act, a 1974 amendment broadening the definition of \u201cagricultural employment,\u201d and prior judicial and administrative interpretation of the Act as amended in 1974 convince us that packing shed workers are \u201cmigrant workers\u201d and that packing shed operators are therefore \u201cfarm labor contractors\u201d governed by the Act unless entitled to a statutory exemption. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-26\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-27\">The parties do not dispute the district court\u2019s findings of fact. Neither do they dispute other relevant facts reflected in the record evidence. The findings of fact and the record evidence show the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-28\">Farmers grow onions and potatoes in the vicinity of Hereford, Texas. After harvest, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>the onions and potatoes must be washed, graded, packed, and shipped to wholesale and retail buyers. For this purpose, many of the farmers use the services of the Barrett-Fisher Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-4\">The Barrett-Fisher Company operates a so-called packing shed in this Texas area for six to eight weeks during the summer months. After packing, Barrett-Fisher ships the vegetables to buyers, collects the purchase price, holds out its agreed packing fee, and returns the balance of the proceeds to the farmers. Until sale to the buyers, the farmers have title and bear the risk of loss due to price changes or property loss or damage. In 1980, as in all years between 1978 and 1982, Barrett-Fisher registered with the United States Department of Labor as a farm labor contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-5\">Barrett-Fisher employs the defendant Ramiro Ramos each annual packing season. Ramos, who lives the remainder of the year in New Mexico, determines the number of workers needed in Barrett-Fisher\u2019s packing shed operations, hires them, arranges to have them come to the Hereford area, and thereafter determines the workers\u2019 job assignments, wages, and housing. Ramos\u2019 compensation is based on the weight of the vegetables packed by the plaintiffs. Ramos registered as a farm labor contractor each year from 1977 through at least 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-6\">The plaintiffs are a class of vegetable packing workers who worked in 1980 at the Barrett-Fisher packing shed. Ramos recruited and supervised them. The named plaintiffs came to the Hereford area from South Texas, as did others in the plaintiff class.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-7\">In 1980, shortly after the end of the packing season, the named plaintiffs sued the defendants Barrett-Fisher and Ramos. The complaint alleged wage and hour violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206. The parties reached a monetary settlement of this claim before trial, and it is not a part of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-8\">The plaintiffs also alleged violations of the Farm Labor Contractor Registration Act. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2041 <em>et seq. </em>The alleged violations of the Act\u2019s requirements included (a) failure to maintain required payroll records, (b) failure to provide the plaintiffs the required wage receipts, and (c) failure to disclose to the plaintiffs, as required, certain terms and conditions of employment and terms of furnished housing. The plaintiffs sought relief in the form of a declaration that the defendants violated the Act, an injunction against future violations, and an award to each class member of actual damages or statutory liquidated damages, <em>see </em>7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2050a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-12\">After a bench trial, the district court held that the defendants were not farm labor contractors within the intendment of the Act. It observed that a farm labor contractor is statutorily defined as any person</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIy\">who, for a fee, either for himself or on behalf of another person, recruits, solicits, hires, furnishes, or transports <em>migrant workers ... </em>for <em>agricultural employment.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1373-13\">7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2042(b) (emphasis added). The district court then acknowledged that packing shed operators furnish \u201cagricultural employment,\u201d as the Act was amended in 1974 expressly to define that term to include packing shed operators:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1373-14\">The term \u201cagricultural employment\u201d means employment in any service or activity included within the provisions of section 203(f) of Title 29 [Fair Labor Standards Act], or section 3121(g) of Title 26 [Federal Insurance Contributions Act] and the <em>handling, </em>planting, drying, <em>packing, packaging, </em>processing, freezing, or <em>grading </em>prior to its delivery for storage of any agricultural or horticultural commodity in its unmanufactured state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1373-15\">7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2042(d) (emphasis added). The court nevertheless concluded that the plaintiffs, packing shed workers, were not \u201cmigrant workers\u201d because the Act defines a migrant worker as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1373-16\">an individual whose primary <em>employment </em>is <em>in agriculture </em>as defined in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>section 203(f) of Title 29, or who performs <em>agricultural labor, </em>as defined in section 3121(g) of Title 26, on a seasonal or other temporary basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1374-4\">7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2042(g) (emphasis added). The parties agree that packing shed employees, <em>for purposes of the statutes thus referenced by \u00a7 2042(g), </em>are not employed \u201cin agriculture\u201d or performing \u201cagricultural labor.\u201d <em>See Marshall v. Gulf &amp; Western Industries, </em>552 F.2d 124 (5th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-5\">At issue, then, is whether, <em>for purposes of \u00a7 2042(g) itself, </em>packing shed employees do not have \u201cemployment ... in agriculture\u201d and are not performing \u201cagricultural labor,\u201d even though packing shed operator-employers clearly are engaged in \u201cagricultural employment\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2042(d). The district court recognized the incongruity of holding that the employ <em>er </em>was by the statute covered as engaged in agricultural employment, but that his employees were not in agricultural employment and thereby not covered. However, the court felt that this incongruous result was one required by the plain language of the statutory definition of migrant workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-6\">We conclude, for reasons to be stated, that this literal application of a single subsection of \u00a7 2042 was erroneous. It creates an absurd inconsistency within the text of \u00a7 2042, which must be read as a whole for the purpose of statutory construction, and it leads to a construction of the Act sharply at odds with its clear purpose and legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-8\">In construing a statute, the ultimate goal is to discern and enforce Congress\u2019 intent. The ordinary meaning of the language in a statute is the best indicator of that intent. \u201cAbsent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary, that language must be regarded as conclusive.\u201d <em>Consumer Product Safety Commission v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., </em>447 U.S. 102, 108, 100 S.Ct. 2051, 2056, 64 L.Ed.2d 766 (1980); <em>James v. United States, </em>760 F.2d 590, 593 (5th Cir.1985) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-9\">Literal application of apparently-clear statutory language may, however, be inappropriate if the literal application would conflict with the directive of other statutory language. <em>Chemical Manufacturers Association v. Natural Resources Defense Council, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 105 S.Ct. 1102, 1108-10, 84 L.Ed.2d 90 (1985); <em>Interstate Commerce Commission v. American Trucking Association, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 104 S.Ct. 2458, 2463-64, 81 L.Ed.2d 282 (1984); <em>Boys Markets, Inc. v. Retail Clerk\u2019s Union, </em>398 U.S. 235, 250, 90 S.Ct. 1583, 1592, 26 L.Ed.2d 199 (1970). Literal application of statutory language is, further, inappropriate if it would lead to untenable distinctions or unreasonable results, or to internal inconsistencies in the statute. <em>American Tobacco Co. v. Patterson, </em>456 U.S. 63, 71, 102 S.Ct. 1534, 1538-39, 71 L.Ed.2d 748 (1982); <em>United States v. Turkette, </em>452 U.S. 576, 580, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 2527, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981). And literal statutory construction is inappropriate if it would produce a result in conflict with the legislative purpose clearly manifested in an entire statute or statutory scheme or with clear legislative history. <em>United Steelworkers v. Weber, </em>443 U.S. 193, 201, 99 S.Ct. 2721, 2726, 61 L.Ed.2d 480 (1979); <em>Quarles v. St. Clair, </em>711 F.2d 691, 698 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-14\">Concerning the Farm Labor Contractor Registration Act specifically, we have held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5q\">Interpretation of the statute is guided by the rules of statutory construction, the plain meaning of the statute\u2019s terms, previous court interpretations, the interpretation of the Secretary of Labor as the administrative agency charged with administration of the statute, and the legislative history of the Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-15\">The Act should be broadly construed because it is remedial in nature. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1374-16\"><em>Soliz v. Plunkett, </em>615 F.2d 272, 275 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-17\">We begin, first, by looking at the original Act. Congress passed the Act in 1963 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number>remedy abuses in the practices of farm labor contractors. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2041. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 202, 88 Cong., 2d Sess. (1963), <em>reprinted in </em>[1964] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Adm.News 3690. \u201cCongress intended the Act to apply to the middlemen who make arrangements between farmers and migrant workers.\u201d <em>Soliz v. Plunkett, </em>615 F.2d 272, 276 (5th Cir.1980). Thus, Congress at that time defined \u201cfarm labor contractor\u201d to mean</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1375-5\">any person, who, for a fee, either for himself or on behalf of another person, recruits, solicits, hires, furnishes, or transports ten or more migrant workers ... at any one time in any calendar year for interstate agricultural employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEp\">7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2042(b). For present purposes, the key definitional terms are \u201cmigrant workers\u201d and \u201cagricultural employment.\u201d The original Act defined the two terms with complete functional consistency, as to the work activities covered, by reference to the same two other statutes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1375-6\">The term \u201cinterstate agricultural employment\u201d means employment in any service or activity included within the provisions of section 203(f) of Title 29, or section 3121(g) of Title 26, when such service or activity is performed by an individual worker who has been transported from one State to another or from any place outside of a State to any place within a State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1375-7\">7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2042(d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1375-8\">The term \u201cmigrant worker\u201d means an individual whose primary employment is in agriculture, as defined in section 203(f) of Title 29, or who performs agricultural labor, as defined in section 3121(g) of Title 26, on a seasonal or other temporary basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1375-9\">7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2042(g). As we indicated above, this definition did not then literally include packing shed employees because, under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(f) and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3121(g), they are not employed \u201cin agriculture\u201d and therefore do not perform \u201cagricultural labor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-10\">In 1974, Congress amended the Act to broaden its coverage. Pub.L. 93-518, 88 Stat. 1656. Congress changed the definition of agricultural employment, retaining the former references to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(f) and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3121(g) but <em>adding </em>coverage for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1375-12\">the handling, planting, drying, <em>packing, </em>packaging, processing, freezing, or grading prior to delivery for storage of any agricultural commodity in its unmanufactured state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1375-13\">7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2042(d) (emphasis added). Congress did not, however, make a corresponding change in the definition of \u201cmigrant workers,\u201d and that definition remained completely unchanged. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2042(g). Thus, applied literally, packing shed employment did constitute \u201cagricultural employment\u201d covered by the Act, but packing shed employees were not \u201cmigrant workers\u201d (because, under the unchanged statutory definition of \u00a7 2042(g), they were neither employed in agriculture under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(f) nor performing agricultural labor under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3121(g)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-14\">The district court concluded that Congress\u2019 failure to amend \u00a7 2042(g)\u2019s definition of \u201cmigrant workers\u201d therefore evidenced an intent to maintain the term\u2019s former meaning, <em>despite </em>amendment to \u00a7 2042(d)\u2019s definition of \u201cagricultural employment.\u201d That reasoning, although it may be valid in some situations, <em>cf., Russello v. United States, </em>464 U.S. 16,-, 104 S.Ct. 296, 300, 78 L.Ed.2d 17 (1983), cannot apply here: for the literal application of the unchanged definition of \u201cmigrant worker\u201d in \u00a7 2042(g) would render meaningless the important 1974 change in the \u00a7 2042(d) that broadened the definition of \u201cagricultural employment\u201d to include packing and processing of agricultural commodities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-17\">The district court\u2019s construction of the former definition of \u201cmigrant worker\u201d as unchanged would require the conclusion that Congress did nothing by expanding in 1974 the meaning of agricultural employment to include packing shed <em>operations, </em>while at the same time deliberately maintaining a definition of migrant workers that excluded packing shed employees. This would, in logic and practical effect, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>require us to conclude that Congress intended to accomplish nothing. <em>See Interstate Commerce Commission v. American Trucking Association, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S.-, -, 104 S.Ct. 2458, 2464, 81 L.Ed.2d 282 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-7\">We cannot ascribe to Congress such an intention to enact meaningless or futile legislation. \u201c[W]hen Congress amends a law the amendment is made to effect some purpose.\u201d <em>Argosy Ltd. v. Hennigan, </em>404 F.2d 14, 18 (5th Cir.1968). <em>See United States v. Crittenden, </em>600 F.2d 478, 479-80 (5th Cir.1979) (if there is conflict, later statute prevails). \u201c[A] court should go beyond the literal language of the statute if reliance on that language would defeat the plain purpose of the statute.\u201d <em>Bob Jones University v. United States, </em>461 U.S. 574, 586, 103 S.Ct. 2017, 2025, 76 L.Ed.2d 157 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-8\">The amendment of \u00a7 2042(d) obviously was done for a purpose, and we are bound to construe the entirety of \u00a7 2042 in a way that accomplishes, and does not defeat, that purpose. <em>See Chamberlain v. Kurtz, </em>589 F.2d 827, 838-40 (5th Cir.1979). Statutory language cannot be construed and applied in isolation from other relevant language in the statute or statutory scheme. \u201cStatutory interpretation requires more than concentration upon isolated words; rather, consideration must be given to the total corpus of pertinent law and the policies that inspired ostensibly inconsistent provisions.\u201d <em>Boys Markets, Inc. v. Retail Clerk\u2019s Union, </em>398 U.S. 235, 250, 90 S.Ct. 1583, 1592, 26 L.Ed.2d 199 (1970). <em>See Philbrook v. Glodgett, </em>421 U.S. 707, 713, 95 S.Ct. 1893, 1898, 44 L.Ed.2d 525 (1975); <em>Kokoszka v. Belford, </em>417 U.S. 642, 650, 94 S.Ct. 2431, 2436, 41 L.Ed.2d 374 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-11\">We are convinced, therefore, from a reading of \u00a7 2042 as a whole, that Congress intended to include packing shed operators as farm labor contractors in the 1974 amendments to the Act. It manifested its intent by the plain words of \u00a7 2042(d)\u2019s amended definition of agricultural employment. By obvious oversight,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Congress did not amend \u00a7 2042(g). \u201c[I]t is ... unequivocally our mission to take arguably contradictory statutory passages and to reconcile them where the intent of Congress is clear but the implementation somewhat faulty.\u201d <em>Atwell v. Merit Systems Protection Board, </em>670 F.2d 272, 286 (D.C.Cir.1981). The references in \u00a7 2042(g) to \u201cagricultural labor\u201d and \u201cemployment ... in agriculture\u201d should, therefore, be read in light of the amendment to \u00a7 2042(d). <em>See United States v. Turkette, </em>452 U.S. 576, 580, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 2527, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981) (\u201cinternal inconsistencies in the statute must be dealt with\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1281\">*1281</page-number>A contrary interpretation of \u00a7 2042 would impermissibly conflict with its clear purpose and policy. \u201cStatutes are contextual as well as textual.\u201d <em>Argosy Ltd. v. Hennigan, </em>404 F.2d 14, 20 (5th Cir.1968). We must \u201c \u2018find that interpretation which can most fairly be said to be imbedded in the statute, in the sense of being most harmonious with its scheme and with the general purposes that Congress manifested.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Engle, </em>464 U.S. 206,-, 104 S.Ct. 597, 604, 78 L.Ed.2d 420 (1984). <em>See Bob Jones University v. United States, </em>461 U.S. 574, 586, 103 S.Ct. 2017, 2025, 76 L.Ed.2d 157 (1983); <em>United Steelworkers v. Weber, </em>443 U.S. 193, 201-02, 99 S.Ct. 2721, 2726-27, 61 L.Ed.2d 480 (1979); <em>Scott v. Moore, </em>640 F.2d 708, 727 (5th Cir.1981) (construction must give \u201cdue regard to the mischief which the legislation was designed to remedy\u201d). The question of statutory purpose is particularly important where, as here, a statute is remedial. <em>See Soliz v. Plunkett, </em>615 F.2d 272, 275 (5th Cir.1980) (\u201cThe [present] Act should be broadly construed because it is remedial in nature.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-7\">We perceive the purpose of the amended Act to have been to check, as fully as possible, the abuses of the middlemen between farmers and migrant workers. The very reason for the 1974 amendment was to implement this purpose more fully by expanding the coverage of the Act to include persons such as packing shed operators. S.Rep. No. 93-1295, 93rd Cong., 2d Sess. (1974), <em>reprinted in </em>[1974] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Adm.News 6441, 6448. The defendants identify no functional distinction between their activities vis-a-vis the plaintiffs and those of the middlemen recognized as farm labor contractors before the 1974 amendment. <em>E.g., Soliz v. Plunkett, </em>615 F.2d 272 (5th Cir.1980). Indeed, it seems obvious that the reason for the amendment of \u00a7 2042(d) was to include packing shed operators such as Barrett-Fisher within the coverage of the Act. The Act should, therefore, be construed consistently with the remedial extension embodied in the 1974 amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-8\">The legislative history of the 1974 amendments to the Act confirms this construction _ of the Act. In its report, the Senate Committee on Labor Law and Public Welfare indicated that the 1974 amendments were designed \u201cto provide for the extension of [the Act\u2019s] coverage.\u201d Senate Report No. 93-1295, 93rd Cong., 2d Sess. (1974), <em>reprinted in </em>[1974] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Adm.News 6441. The Committee spoke of \u201cthe increased number of persons who would be defined as farm labor contractors under this legislation.\u201d <em>Id., </em>[1974] U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Adm.News 6441, 6446. Indeed, in that portion of the report discussing the \u201ccoverage\u201d of the amended Act, the Committee specifically noted that the amendment to \u00a7 2042(d) provided coverage \u201cto all aspects of commerce in agriculture, including\u201d not only those previously defined but also \u201cother processing of agricultural or horticultural products in an unmanufactured state,\u201d and the report also detailed when a \u201cpacking shed operator\u201d could be exempt from the requirements of the amended Act, \u2014 clearly indicating that packing shed operators ordinarily are farm labor contractors. <em>Id., </em>1974 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Adm.News at 6447, 6448; <em>see </em>H.Rep.

By the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number>terms of the Act, the Department of Labor was charged with its administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-4\">In an Opinion Letter of the United States Department of Labor Wage-Hour Administrator, the Administrator clearly interpreted the amended Act to include packing shed workers as \u201cmigrant workers\u201d and packing shed operators as \u201cfarm labor contractors.\u201d In this letter, the precise questions posed were \u201c[w]hether the definition of \u2018migrant worker\u2019 as used in Section 3(g) includes employees in the agricultural processing plant\u201d and whether those recruiting such employees were farm labor contractors required to comply with the Act. The Administrator answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1378-5\">\u201cUnder Section 3(b), a person is a farm labor contractor when he engages in any of the farm labor contracting activities enumerated therein with regard to the use of migrant workers for agricultural employment.\u201d Section 3(d) defines \u201cagricultural employment\u201d to mean \u201cemployment in any service or activity included within the provisions of Section 3(f) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 ... or Section 3121(g) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954____\u201d As a result of the 1974 Amendment to Section 3(d), the term \u201cagricultural employment\u201d has been expanded to encompass the handling, planting, drying, packing, packaging, processing, freezing, or grading pri- or to delivery for storage of any agricultural or horticultural commodity in its unmanufactured state.\u201d Thus, if the farm labor contracting activities enumerated in Section 3(b) involve workers for employment in any of the types of operations included in the amendment to Section 3(d), such workers are \"migrant workers\u201d for purposes of the amended Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1378-7\">Since the plant of the ... Corporation is engaged in processing unmanufactured citrus fruits, those workers who were recruited for employment in the \u201chandling, planting, drying, packing, packaging, processing, freezing, or grading ...\u201d activities would qualify as \u201cmigrant workers\u201d as this term is used in the amended Act. Accordingly, the recruitment of these workers would subject any person who recruited them to the registration requirements of the Act unless specifically exempted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1378-10\">Wage-Hour Administrator Opinion Letter No. 1491, Lab. L. Rep. (CCH) [1973-78 Wage-Hour Transfer Binder] 11 31,142, at 42,813-814.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1378-11\">Finally, we note that the Seventh Circuit has held \u201ccannery workers\u201d to be migrant workers under the amended Act, as being engaged in \u201cagricultural employment\u201d within the definition as provided by the 1974 broadening amendment of \u00a7 2042(d). <em>De La Fuente v. Stokely-Van Camp, Inc., </em>713 F.2d 225, 236 (7th Cir.1983). The 1974 amendment to the definition of agricultural employment in \u00a7 2042(d) included not only packing shed operations, but also \u201cpackaging\u201d and \u201cprocessing\u201d produce before it is processed <em>and </em>stored. <em>Id. </em>In <em>De La Fuente, </em>the defendants did not contest the issue we confront \u2014 whether the amendment to \u00a7 2042(d) impliedly changed the meaning of \u00a7 2042(g). Instead, the defendants contended narrowly that work after processing but before storage (e.g., canning) is not covered in the amended definition of agricultural employment. The Seventh Circuit rejected this contention and, while not confronting the precise argument made in this case, clearly stated that canning workers \u2014 included in the 1974 amendment to \u00a7 2042(d) \u2014 are \u201cmigrant workers\u201d for the purpose of \u00a7 2042(g). \u201c[T]he cannery workers in this case were, like their counterparts in the fields, engaged in \u2018agricultural employment\u2019 covered by the Act.\u201d 713 F.2d at 236.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1379-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>In summary: The express terms and plain purpose of the Act, its prior and subsequent legislative history, the interpretation of the Department of Labor, and a precedent of another circuit demonstrate that packing shed workers are statutory \u201cmigrant workers\u201d and that packing shed operators are statutory \u201cfarm labor contractors.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1379-4\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-5\">The defendants contend that they are entitled to a statutory exemption. <em>See </em>7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2042(b)(2)-(3). The district court did not reach this contention. Since the matter must be remanded as to other contentions also unreaehed, we deem it preferable to remand to the district court on this issue also.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is REVERSED. The district court did not determine the defendants\u2019 claim of statutory exemption, the existence or not of all alleged violations of the Act, or the appropriate relief. Accordingly, we REMAND to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-7\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1372-18\">. The Act originally was passed in 1963, Pub.L. 88-582, 78 Stat. 920, amended in 1974, Pub.L. 88-582, 78 Stat. 920, and replaced in 1982, Pub.L. 97-470, 96 Stat. 2584, by the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act of 1982, Pub.L. 97-470, 96 Stat. 2584, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1801 <em>et seq. </em>As explained below in the text, the plaintiffs in this case sued when the 1974 amended version of the Act was in effect and upon violations occurring under that version of the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1376-9\">. The oversight label seems inevitable as a matter of simple common sense. In the original version of the Act in 1963, the concepts of agriculture mentioned in \u00a7 2042(d) and in \u00a7 2042(g) were completely symmetrical, both relying on definitions in Title 26 and Title 29. The corresponding, symmetrical provisions of \u00a7 2042(d) and \u00a7 2042(g) are not surprising: there is no imaginable reason to give agricultural employment (for the purpose of the employer under \u00a7 2042(d)) a different meaning from the concept of agricultural labor or employment in agriculture (for the purpose of the employee under \u00a7 2042(g)). It seems silly to suggest that an employer offers agricultural employment \u2014 but that his employee accepting such employment is not engaged in agricultural labor or employed in agriculture. No basis is suggested to doubt that Congress, in amending \u00a7 2042(d) to broaden the Act\u2019s coverage in 1974, intended (but overlooked) a corresponding, symmetrical change in \u00a7 2042(g).</p>\n<p id=\"Aq0\">We are fortified in this conclusion by more recent legislation. Upon repeal of the Farm Labor Contractor Act, Pub.L. 97-470, 96 Stat. 2600, Congress re-enacted its provisions in the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act of 1982, Pub.L. 97-470, 96 Stat. 2584, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1801 <em>et seq. </em>The 1982 Act retained the 1974 amended definition of \"agricultural employment,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1802(3), but redefines migrant worker simply as an \"individual who is employed in agricultural employment,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1802(8). Thus, the relevant statute again has been expressly harmonized, as it was originally before the oversight in the 1974 amendment. (The view of a subsequent Congress is an available \u2014 albeit hazardous \u2014 tool of statutory construction. <em>Consumer Product Safety Commission v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., </em>447 U.S. 102, 117-18 &amp; n. 13, 100 S.Ct. 2051, 2061 &amp; n. 13, 64 L.Ed.2d 766 (1980).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1378-8\">. A reasonable agency interpretation of a statute is of particularly great weight if the agency assisted in drafting the statute. <em>Miller v. Youakim, </em>440 U.S. 125, 144, 99 S.Ct. 957, 968-69, 59 L.Ed.2d 194 (1979). Such was the case with the 1974 amendments to the Act. S.Rep. No. 93-1295, 93rd Cong., 2d Sess. (1974), <em>reprinted in </em>[1974] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Adm.News 6441, 6445.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1378-13\">. The defendants attempt to distinguish <em>De La Fuente </em>on two grounds. First, they say that, in <em>De La Fuente, </em>the defendant\u2019s securing interim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>employment of their workers with other employers, a feature not present in this case, was determinative. Nothing, however, in the language of the Seventh Circuit's opinion shows that this was even relevant to the cannery workers\u2019 \"migrant worker\" status. Second, the defendants note that the <em>De La Fuente </em>defendant engaged in harvesting and packing activities in addition to cannery activities. Again, the <em>De La Fuente </em>opinion does not indicate that the other activities of the defendant-employer bore any relation to the \"migrant worker\" status of the plaintiff-workers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1379-24\">. In view of this holding, we do not reach the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the defendants, having registered as farm labor contractors, are estopped to deny such status.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
