It is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Richmond Tank Car (RTC), which manufactures railroad cars. The lease that forms the subject matter of this appeal is part of a larger transaction in which RLC and its parent corporation, RTC, both played a part. RTC manufactured and sold 402 railroad cars to General Electric Credit Corporation (GECC). GECC in turn leased the railroad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1307\">*1307</page-number>cars back to RTC\u2019s subsidiary, RLC, for a twenty-year term. Under the lease agreement between GECC and RLC, dated June 1, 1982, RLC agreed to pay GECC approximately $1.8 million every six months, beginning on June 30, 1983. RLC also granted GECC a security interest in RLC\u2019s subleases of the cars to third parties. There was some suggestion at the hearing that GECC may have paid RTC a premium price for the ears and RLC may in turn have leased them from GECC at a premium. The 402 cars covered by the lease make up less than ten percent of RLC\u2019s inventory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-5\">On January 7, 1983, before the first payment was due under this lease, RLC filed its petition in bankruptcy. In April 1983, RLC and GECC offered for court approval a renegotiated lease that RLC proposed to assume. Under the amended lease, GECC agreed to waive existing defaults in the lease<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and to reduce the rent due under the lease through 1986 to quarterly payments of $500,000 or 85% of the gross quarterly revenues generated by the 402 cars, whichever was less; however, the quarterly payments were not to average less than $400,000 for two consecutive quarters. From 1986 through 2002, the quarterly payments were to increase to $937,500. In exchange, RTC agreed to issue preferred stock to GECC periodically, and GECC placed restrictions upon RTC\u2019s ability to encumber its property, buy stock, make loans, guarantee obligations, dilute its stock, dispose of its fixed assets at less than fair market value, lease property, merge with or be purchased by another company, or dispose of its receivables out of the ordinary course of business, without GECC\u2019s consent. The amended lease designates RTC\u2019s violation of these restrictions as an event of default. RTC\u2019s bankruptcy is an event of default under both the original and the amended leases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-7\">After a hearing, the bankruptcy court approved the joint application of RLC and GECC for authority to amend and assume the lease. The court\u2019s order provided that the automatic stay imposed by 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362 would be lifted automatically in the event of RLC\u2019s default, after GECC notified the court and all parties in interest. On appeal from the bankruptcy court, the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s approval of the assumption of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-8\">The bank creditors raise several points in their appeal to this Court. We shall consider those points in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-9\">\n<em>The Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-10\">The bank creditors argue that the district court improperly applied a \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard in its review of the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings of ultimate facts and conclusions of law. Specifically, the bank creditors maintain that the district court reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard the bankruptcy court\u2019s decisions regarding the correctness of RLC\u2019s business judgment in assuming the amended lease, whether RLC had provided adequate assurance of performance, whether the amended lease implemented a <em>sub rosa </em>reorganization, and whether the assumption of the lease with some amendment favorable to GECC complied with \u00a7 365. We have examined the district court\u2019s memorandum and order carefully, and we disagree. It is quite clear that the district court applied the appropriate <em>de novo </em>standard of review to the legal questions whether the amended lease implemented a <em>sub rosa </em>reorganization and whether the assumption of the amended lease complied with the standards set forth in \u00a7 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-11\">Moreover, assuming that the district court applied a \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard when it reviewed the bankruptcy court\u2019s decisions on business judgment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1308\">*1308</page-number>adequate assurance,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we conclude that the disputes involving those issues centered on contested <em>facts.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>No one denies that if RLC can generate sufficient income from GECC\u2019s cars and from its unencumbered assets to meet the payments on the amended lease, then the lease represents a valid exercise of RLC's business judgment and RLC has offered adequate assurance of performance. The various financial experts and company officers who testified at the hearing on the application to assume the lease differed in the inferences they drew from RLC\u2019s accounting data, upon the accuracy of which all agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-4\">Were we entirely without guidance on the application of the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard in this situation, we would adopt that standard in deference to the bankruptcy court\u2019s experience and expertise in resolving disputes between financial expert witnesses. In deciding this issue, however, we also have the benefit of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1511, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985), holding that an appellate court must review a finding of fact under the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> even when the lower court\u2019s findings of fact \u201cdo not rest on credibility determinations, but are based instead on physical or documentary evidence or <em>inferences from other facts.\u201d </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 105 S.Ct. at 1512 (emphasis added). The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1404-8\">The rationale for deference to the original finder of fact is not limited to the superiority of the trial judge's position to make determinations of credibility. The trial judge\u2019s major role is the determination of fact, and with experience in fulfilling that role comes expertise. Duplication of the trial judge\u2019s efforts in the court of appeals would very likely contribute only negligibly to the accuracy of fact determination at a huge cost in diversion of judicial resources. In addition, the parties to a case on appeal have already been forced to concentrate their energies and resources on persuading the trial judge that their account of the facts is the correct one; requiring them to persuade three more judges at the appellate level is requiring too much.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AN3\">Id.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1404-14\">Rule 8013 of the Bankruptcy Rules, which we apply here, mandates the application of the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of review to the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings of fact. Its language tracks that of Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure almost verbatim. The <em>Anderson </em>reasoning is thus equally compelling in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-15\">\n<em>RLC\u2019s Exercise of Business Judgment and Adequate Assurance of Future Performance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-16\">The bank creditors invite us to overturn the district court\u2019s holding that the bankruptcy court did not clearly err when it found that RLC\u2019s assumption of the amended lease was a proper exercise of its business judgment. The bank creditors urge us to hold that the business judgment question, as a mixed question of law and fact, is subject to <em>de novo </em>review. We have noted above that the decision whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1309\">*1309</page-number>assumption of the lease represented a proper exercise of business judgment depended entirely upon resolution of a factual dispute as to whether RLC could generate sufficient revenues in the future to cover its obligations under the lease. The parties did not dispute the legal standard to be applied in \u00a7 365 cases, nor could they. It is well established that \u201cthe question whether a lease should be rejected ... is one of business judgment.\u201d <em>Group of Institutional Investors v. Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul &amp; Pacific Railroad Co., </em>318 U.S. 523, 550, 63 S.Ct. 727, 742, 87 L.Ed. 959 (1943). <em>See also Matter of Minges, </em>602 F.2d 38, 42-43 (2d Cir.1979). \u201cAs long as assumption of a lease appears to enhance a debtor\u2019s estate, court approval of a debtor-in-possession\u2019s decision to assume the lease should only be withheld if the debtor\u2019s judgment is clearly erroneous, too speculative, or contrary to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code____\u201d <em>Allied Technology, Inc. v. R.B. Brunemann &amp; Sons, </em>25 B.R. 484, 495 (Bankr.S.D.Ohio 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-6\">The parties did not dispute whether doubts about RLC\u2019s financial stability had achieved a critical mass sufficient to render RLC\u2019s assuming the lease an improper exercise of business judgment; instead they disputed whether the doubts about RLC\u2019s financial status were justified. Thus this issue is properly considered under the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of review. The bankruptcy court heard extensive testimony on direct examination and cross-examination of financial experts and company officers. It was called upon to determine whether a projection of future income based on RLC\u2019s revenues was more accurate than one based on cash flows, whether certain types of income were sufficiently assured to be considered as available to pay RLC\u2019s lease obligations, whether an incipient upward turn in the railroad car leasing business was likely to continue in the long term, and whether the administrative claim that might result from RLC\u2019s default on the amended lease would be so large that possible prejudice to RLC\u2019s unsecured creditors mandated a more cautious business approach than that taken in assuming the lease. The bankruptcy court\u2019s findings reflect its decisions on these disputed factual matters. It did not clearly err.</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-10\">Similarly, the parties do not dispute that 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365(b)(1)(C) requires a debtor in possession<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to provide adequate assurance of future performance when it assumes a lease. Nor do they dispute the legal standard for determining adequate assurance. In <em>In Re Sapolin Paints, Inc., </em>5 B.R. 412, 420-21 (Bankr.E.D.N.Y.1980), the court traced the phrase \u201cadequate assurance\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 365 to the \u201cadequate assurance\u201d defined in \u00a7 2-609(1) of the Uniform Commercial Code:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1405-11\">The terms \u201cadequate assurance of future performance\u201d are not words of art; the legislative history of the Code shows that they were intended to be given a practical, pragmatic construction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1405-12\">The phrase first appears in the legislation proposed by the Commission on Bankruptcy Laws. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1405-13\">The Commission Report explains the language \u201cadequate assurance of future performance\u201d as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1405-14\">\u201cThe language \u2018is adopted from Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 2-609(1).\u2019 What constitutes \u2018reasonable time thereafter\u2019 for curing defaults or an \u2018adequate assurance of future performance\u2019 must be determined by consideration of the facts of the proposed assumption. Cf. Official Comment 4 to Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 2-609 (1972 Edition). It is not intended, however, that any non-debtor party should acquire greater rights in a ease under the act than he has outside the act.\u201d Report of the Commission on Bankruptcy Laws of the United States, H.R. Doc. No. 93-137, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. Pt. II 156-57 (1973).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1310\">*1310</page-number>Section 2-609 of the Uniform Commercial Code, from which the bankruptcy statute borrows its critical language, provides that \u201cwhen reasonable grounds for insecurity arise with respect to the performance of either party, the other may in writing demand adequate assurance of future performance .... \u201d The Commentaries to the Code note that \u201c \u2018adequate\u2019 assurance is to be \u2018defined by commercial rather than legal standards.\u2019 \u201d Official Comment 3 To Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 2-609 (1972 Ed.). What constitutes \u201cadequate assurance\u201d is to be determined by factual conditions; the seller must exercise good faith and observe commercial standards; his satisfaction must be based upon reason and must not be arbitrary or capricious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1406-4\">Courts have consistently determined whether a debtor offered adequate assurance of future performance by considering whether the debtor\u2019s financial data indicated its ability to generate an income stream sufficient to meet its obligations, the general economic outlook in the debt- or\u2019s industry, and the presence of a guarantee. <em>See, e.g., Seacoast Products, Inc. v. Spring Valley Farms, </em>34 B.R. 379, 381 (Bankr.M.D.N.C.1983); <em>In re Berkshire Chemical Haulers, Inc., </em>20 B.R. 454, 458-59 (Bankr.Mass.1982); <em>In re Lafayette Radio Electronics Corp., </em>9 B.R. 993, 1000 (Bankr.E.D.N.Y.1981). The bankruptcy court considered just such factual matters in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-5\">The bank creditors contend that the bankruptcy court erred when it credited the testimony of RLC\u2019s witnesses projecting RLC\u2019s future profitability rather than the testimony of the bank creditors\u2019 witnesses. That dispute is essentially factual and is subject to review under the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard. We affirm the district court\u2019s holding that the bankruptcy court did not clearly err when it made this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-7\">\n<em>RLC\u2019s' Granting GECC Greater Rights Under the Amended Lease</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-8\">The bank group contends that the bankruptcy court erred when it approved RLC\u2019s assumption of the amended lease on the ground that \u00a7 365 of the Bankruptcy Code requires that the debtor grant the creditor no greater rights under the amended lease than under the original lease. This argument misconstrues the requirements of \u00a7 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-9\">We first observe that the amended lease significantly reduces RLC\u2019s short-term obligations to GECC. In exchange for this concession, GECC receives additional benefits under the amended lease largely from RLC\u2019s parent corporation, RTC, in the form of stock and increased control over the way RTC conducts its business. The consideration flowing from RTC to GECC cannot affect any interest of the bank creditors that RLC\u2019s bankruptcy proceeding protects.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under the amended agreement, RLC provides GECC additional consideration only in the sense that it agrees that RTC\u2019s default on its new obligations to GECC will permit GECC to terminate the agreement and repossess its cars from RLC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-10\">Section 365 is intended to provide a means whereby a debtor can force another party to an executory contract to continue to perform under the contract if (1) the debtor can provide adequate assurance that it, too, will continue to perform, and if (2) the debtor can cure any defaults in its past performance. The provision provides a means whereby a debtor can force others to continue to do business with it when the bankruptcy filing might otherwise make them reluctant to do so. The section thus serves the purpose of making the debtor\u2019s rehabilitation more likely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-11\">In this context, it becomes clear that in the typical case under \u00a7 365, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1311\">*1311</page-number>anyone objects to the debtor\u2019s assumption of the contract it will be the other party to the executory contract, not the debtor\u2019s creditors who are strangers to the transaction. Thus, the often-repeated statement that the debtor must accept the contract as a whole means only that the debtor cannot choose to accept the benefits of the contract and reject its burdens to the detriment of the other party to the agreement. <em>See In re Holland Enterprises, Inc., </em>25 B.R. 301 (Bankr.E.D.N.C.1982); <em>In re LHD Realty Corp., </em>20 B.R. 717 (Bankr.S.D.Ind.1982). Similarly, the other party cannot hold out for concessions from the debtor beyond those required to provide adequate assurance. <em>See In re Lafayette Radio Electronics Corp., </em>9 B.R. 993, 998 (E.D.N.Y.1981). We conclude that RLC\u2019s recognizing an event of default in RTC\u2019s failure to perform the new covenants, which were included in the amended lease in order to assure GECC that RTC would perform its guarantee, is part of RLC\u2019s offer of adequate assurance of future performance to GECC. <em>See In re Kennesaw Dairy Queen Brazier, </em>28 B.R. 535, 536 (N.D.Ga.1983) (stating, \u201cThe fact that debtors may cure defaults and reinstate contracts or leases also is perhaps the clearest example of the modification of an executory contract or unexpired lease.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-9\">Moreover, to the extent that the amended lease represents a true renegotiation of the obligations of RLC, RTC and GECC, it falls entirely outside of \u00a7 365\u2019s concern. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1107 and 1108, taken together, authorize a debtor in possession to operate the business of the debtor. Nothing in the Code suggests that the debtor may not modify its contracts when all parties to the contract consent. Although \u00a7 1107 provides that a court may limit the debtor\u2019s exercise of the rights of the trustee, including the \u00a7 1108 right to operate the business, in the absence of special circumstances or a specific Code provision, we see no reason to require the debtor to do more than justify its actions under the \u201cbusiness judgment\u201d standard if creditors object.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> More exacting scrutiny would slow the administration of the debt- or\u2019s estate and increase its cost, interfere with the Bankruptcy Code\u2019s provision for private control of administration of the estate, and threaten the court\u2019s ability to control a case impartially. <em>See In re Airlift International, Inc., </em>18 B.R. 787, 789 (Bankr.S.D.Fla.1982); <em>In re Curlew Valley Assocs., </em>14 B.R. 506, 509-514 (Bankr.D.Utah 1981).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This business judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1312\">*1312</page-number>standard<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> thus does not differ from the business judgment inquiry already undertaken and resolved in favor of the amended lease under \u00a7 365.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, the bankruptcy court did not err in approving the lease as amended, and we affirm the district court\u2019s order on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-4\">\n<em>Lease as a Sub Rosa Plan of Reorganization</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-5\">The bank creditors contend that the amended lease goes beyond what is permissible in the assumption of a lease and establishes, <em>sub rosa, </em>a plan of reorganization, allowing GECC and RLC to circumvent the plan confirmation requirements of Chapter 11. The bank creditors complain that the lease does not expressly restrict payment due under the amended lease to the revenues generated by the GECC rail cars; the order approving the lease provides for the automatic lifting of the \u00a7 362 stay if there is a default; in the event of default, the lease permits GECC to assert a large administrative claim that would affect the proportion of assets that could be allocated to other creditors under a plan of reorganization; and the amended lease restricts RTC\u2019s actions and names as an event of default RTC\u2019s filing for bankruptcy, so that, in the event of RTC\u2019s bankruptcy, a consolidation with RLC\u2019s case would be more difficult.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-11\">We do not doubt that a debtor can assume a lease under its original, prebankruptcy terms without creating a <em>sub rosa </em>plan of reorganization, so long as such an assumption is a valid exercise of a debtor\u2019s business judgment. Thus, we need not greatly concern ourselves with the alleged debilitating effects of GECC\u2019s rights, under the amended lease, to look to sources other than revenues from the GECC cars for payment, to assert a large administrative claim in the event of default,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> or to consider RTC\u2019s bankruptcy as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>an event of default; the original lease afforded GECC all those advantages, and the bankruptcy court determined that they do not render assumption of the amended lease an improper business decision. The lifting of the automatic stay and the restrictions on RTC\u2019s actions, even were we to combine them with the advantages under the original lease, do not alter creditors\u2019 rights, dispose of assets, and release claims to the extent proposed in the wide-ranging transaction disapproved in <em>In re Braniff Airways, Inc., </em>700 F.2d 935 (5th Cir.1983). Although the disposition of a \u201ccrown jewel\u201d asset might, in combination with other factors, severely restrict a future reorganization plan so as to amount to a <em>sub rosa </em>plan of reorganization even though all or substantially all of the debt- or\u2019s assets were not involved in the transaction, that is not the case here. We will not make a mountain out of the molehill of restrictions included in the amended lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-5\">\n<em>Lifting of Automatic Stay in the Event of Default</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-6\">The bank creditors contend that the bankruptcy court erred in conditionally lifting the automatic stay in the event of default without a showing of adequate cause. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(d)(2) permits the court to lift the automatic stay, after notice and a hearing, if the debtor does not have an equity in the property that the movant seeks to recover and the property is not necessary to an effective organization. The order lifting the automatic stay was part and parcel of the amended lease transaction here, and the parties offered testimony concerning its effect at the hearing on the application to assume the lease. Although the bankruptcy court did not make findings of fact with respect to the requirements of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(d)(2), it did order the lifting of the automatic stay \u201c[p]ursuant to the Joint Application.\u201d When a court has not entered findings of fact in accordance with Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the appellate court ordinarily vacates the judgment and remands the case for appropriate findings. Remand is unnecessary, however, if \u201call the facts relied upon to support the judgment are in the record and are undisputed, or if the record as a whole presents no genuine issue as to any material fact.\u201d <em>Armstrong v. Collier, </em>536 F.2d 72 (5th Cir.1976) (quoting <em>King v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>458 F.2d 245, 249 (6th Cir.1972)). It is undisputed that RLC has no equity in GECC\u2019s cars. Under \u00a7 362(g), the party opposing the lifting of the stay bears the burden of proof on all issues other than the issue of the debtor\u2019s equity in the property. There is no evidence on record to suggest that GECC\u2019s railroad cars, which make up less than ten percent of RLC\u2019s inventory, are necessary to an effective reorganization of RLC. Therefore, the bankruptcy judge did not err in lifting the automatic stay.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1409-14\">Because we have found no error in the district court\u2019s decision in this case, its order is</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1402-21\">. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1403-6\"><em>. </em>The district court correctly held that RLC was not in default of its obligations under the lease, since no payment was yet due. RLC\u2019s filing for bankruptcy was an event of default under the lease, but under the provisions of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365(b)(2), that default would have had no effect in bankruptcy. However, RLC's bankruptcy would have triggered RTC\u2019s obligations as a guarantor of the June 1982 lease, so the waiver of defaults represented some consideration flowing from GECC to RTC.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1404-9\">.

Although the <em>Curlew </em>case suggests that a debtor-in-possession\u2019s decisions should be subject to greater supervision by the bankruptcy court than a trustee\u2019s, 14 Bankr. at 509-511, we see no reason to invoke in the ordinary case the greater supervision permitted by 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1107. Our view is consonant with the House and Senate Reports on \u00a7 1107(a), which state that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1407-6\">This section places a debtor in possession in the shoes of a trustee in every way.

Even assuming that a lease agreement increasing the debtor\u2019s inventory by less than ten percent represents a transaction not in the ordinary course of the debtor\u2019s business, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363(b) authorizes the debtor to sell or exchange property of the estate (i.e., its right to receive rentals from subleases of the cars it holds under the original lease agreement) with court approval. Even for a sale of <em>all </em>the debtor\u2019s assets, a considerably more radical action that the modification of a lease, those courts that have permitted such a sale under \u00a7 363(b) read the section as requiring only that the bankruptcy court consider whether there is an emergency, whether other buyers have been solicited, and whether the sale is in the best interests of the estate. <em>In re Ancor Exploration Co., </em>30 B.R. 802, 808 (Bankr.N.D. Okia.1983). <em>See also In re Charlesbank Laundry Co., </em>37 B.R. 20, 22 (Bankr.Mass.1983). The question whether a sale of all assets may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1312\">*1312</page-number>approved under \u00a7 363(b) of course remains open in this Circuit. <em>See In re Braniff Airways, Inc., </em>700 F.2d 935, 939 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1408-7\">. <em>Matter of Southern Biotech, Inc., </em>37 B.R. 318 (Bankr.M.D.Fla.1983), adopts an \"economic soundness\" standard for the approval of a trustee\u2019s proposal to purchase assets, other than in the ordinary course of business, in order to continue to operate the debtor\u2019s business. That proposed transaction resembles the debtor\u2019s offer here to lease assets in order to maintain its pre-bankruptcy level of inventory, although we are disinclined to hold, on the record before us, that the proposed lease is a transaction outside of the ordinary course of business. In announcing the \"economic soundness\u201d test, the <em>Biotech </em>court evidently meant to scrutinize the transaction more carefully than it would under the \"business judgment\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-8\">Upon examination of the analysis that the court actually applied in that case, however, we are unable to detect any difference between the analysis undertaken under the \u201ceconomic soundness\" test and that which we would undertake in applying the business judgment test in the circumstances of the case. The court considered the risks of the proposed transaction, the available alternatives, and the danger of prejudice to the objecting parties, who, like the creditors here, had no protected interest in the cash to be expended to purchase the assets. <em>See infra </em>note 12. It concluded, as we would, that the purchase was a valid business decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-9\">Because we cannot clearly demarcate the difference between an \"economic soundness\" and a \u201cbusiness judgment\u201d analysis, we see no reason to muddy the waters by introducing another level of scrutiny into the approval process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1408-13\">. Nothing in the record suggests to us that the bank creditors here have an interest in rentals received from subleases of GECC cars or cash generated in the future by unencumbered cars that would make the transaction subject to the strictures on disposition of cash \u25a0 collateral in \u00a7 363(c)(2). <em>See In re George Ruggiere Chrysler-Plymouth, </em>727 F.2d 1017, 1019 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1408-14\">. We believe that the bankruptcy court\u2019s discretion under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 503 is broad enough to reject administrative claims that result from inequitable conduct, including entering into agreements in bad faith, when the inequitable conduct prevents the estate\u2019s receiving the benefit that the court envisioned when it approved an agreement. <em>See generally In re Allied Artists Industries, Inc., </em>35 B.R. 737 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1983). The bankruptcy court\u2019s order in this case astutely reserves the right to exercise this discretion when and if GECC presents an administrative claim. If, as the bank creditors fear, GECC engages in the sharp practice of urging one interpretation of the amended lease\u2019s waiver of existing defaults before bankruptcy court approval and another thereafter, principles of estoppel should come into play.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-15\">Moreover, we keep in mind that creditor misconduct has traditionally formed the basis for equitable subordination of a creditor\u2019s priority status. <em>See generally Allied Technology, Inc. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number><em>R.B. Brunemann &amp; Sons, </em>25 B.R. 484, 499 (Bankr.S.D.Ohio 1982); <em>Matter of Multiponics, Inc., </em>622 F.2d 709 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1409-10\">. The bankruptcy court's order requires GECC to notify all parties in interest and the court before it declares a default under the amended lease. The broad equitable powers granted the bankruptcy court under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105 permit any party in interest to apply to the court to rescind its order lifting the stay in the event rehabilitation of the debtor requires such action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
