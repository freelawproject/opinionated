For the years 1940, 1941, 1942, and 1943, the plaintiff filed iwith the appropriate Collector of Internal Revenue federal income and excess profits tax returns, and paid for each year an amount in excess of the refund herein claimed. In each return the plaintiff declared its election to take the credit granted by Section 131 of the Internal Revenue Code for the amount of taxes paid or accrued during those years to any foreign country or possession of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-9\">On November 29, 1939, the plaintiff and another Maryland corporation entered into an agreement of joint venture for the performance of certain construction work at San Juan, Puerto Rico, under a Navy contract, and on October 21, 1941, a third corporation joined the venture.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-10\">During the years 1940, 1941, 1942, and 1943, the joint venturers performed work under the Navy contract and received and accrued net income therefrom which was subject <em>not only to </em>tax under the Internal Revenue Code of the United States but also under the laws of Puerto Rico. Under the laws of Puerto Rico income taxes for the years here involved were imposed not only upon the joint venturers\u2019 distributable shares of the joint .venture\u2019s- income but also -upon the income of the joint venture itself as a separate taxable entity. Thus for the years 1940 through 1943 plaintiff paid to the Puerto Rican government income taxes as follows: $130,557.73, as the tax on plaintiff\u2019s distributable share of the joint venture\u2019s income; and $184,597.56, as plaintiff\u2019s proportionate share of the tax assessed upon the income of the joint venture as a separate entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-12\">Upon final audit of plaintiff\u2019s federal returns for 1940, 1941, 1942, and 1943, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue allowed the taxes paid to Puerto Rico upon the plaintiff\u2019s distributable share of the income from the joint -venture, in the aggregate amount of $130,557.73, as a direct credit against federal taxes of the plaintiff for the several years involved, under Section-131 of the Internal Revenue Code. This determination is not here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-13\">Plaintiff claims here that the Commissioner should also have allowed as a direct credit under Section 131 against its federal taxes for the- years involved, the amount of its proportionate share of the tax paid upon the income of the joint venture as a separate taxable entity. It is this amount which is the subject of the present suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-14\">- The Commissioner determined that the amount in question was allowable as a deduction from gross income under Section 23(c) of the Internal Revenue Code in determining plaintiff\u2019s share of the net earnings of the joint venture [except for the years 1940 and 1941, for which no timely claim had been made for allowance under Section 23(c)]; but that it was not allowable as a direct credit under Section 131 against plaintiff\u2019s federal. taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-15\">The following statutes are applicable:</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-16\">(Internal Revenue Code.)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1068-17\">\u201c \u00a7 131.

To this defendant replies that under Puerto Rican law the tax was laid upon the joint venture as a separate entity, and therefore plaintiff as a member of the joint venture was not the '\"taxpayer\u201d within the meaning of Section 131(a) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-23\">Plaintiff\u2019s argument in the alternative is that even if it were not the taxpayer under Section 131(a) (1), it would nevertheless be entitled to the credit sought under Section 131(a) (4). To this argument defendant replies that Section 131(a) (4) allows such credits only to \u201cindividual\u201d members of a partnership (or joint venture), and that since plaintiff was a corporation and not an individual- it cannot claim- the advantage of -Section 131(a) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-24\">' The controversy is grounded in the divergent concepts of a partnership in the Puerto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>Rican law and in the laws of the United States. The Supreme Court of Puerto' Rico took notice of that difference in Ballester v. Court of Tax Appeals, 61 P.R.R. 460, 478: \u201c * * * But the term \u2018partnership\u2019 is not used in our Income Tax Act in the common-law sense. It is a translation of the term \u2018sociedad\u2019 found in the civil law. And a <em>sociedad </em>is a juridical 'person apart from the members thereof. Puerto Rico v. Russell &amp; Co., 288 U.S. 476, [53 S.Ct. 447, 77 L.Ed. 903], There is therefore no constitutional objection against assimilating a partnership or <em>sociedad </em>to a corporation for tax purposes, and taxing both the partnership and its individual members on the same income. Fantauzzi et al. v. Bonner, 34 P.R.R. 464, 74. To compare our situation with that obtaining under the Federal Income Tax Act as applied to a common-law partnership, which under that Act is not treated as a separate entity, except for accounting purposes, and which therefore pays no tax as such, is to invoke a false analogy. * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-4\">A closely analogous situation to that presented here arose in Biddle v. Commissioner, 302 U.S. 573, 58 S.Ct. 379, 381, 82 L.Ed. 431. In British law 'a stockholder receiving dividends from profits of a British corporation was required to report as income, in addition to the amounts actually received, an amount known as the tax \u201cappropriate\u201d which reflected her proportion of the tax paid by the corporation on its own profits. Under British law a stockholder receiving such dividends was regarded as having paid \u201cby deduction or otherwise\u201d the tax \u201cappropriate\u201d to the dividends. In her federal income tax returns the stockholder, an American citizen, included in gross income the entire sums so reported in her British returns and claimed credit under Section 131(a) (1) for the amount of the British tax appropriate to the dividends. The United States Supreme Court held that the tax appropriate \u25a0should not have been included as gross income in the federal tax return and that it was not avaifable as a credit under Section 131(a) (1), since by American standards the taxpayer was not the one who had paid \u2022or was subject to the British tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-5\">Defendant\u2019s position here in essence is that Puerto Rican characterizations and classifications of tax legislation must govern. In that connection the Supreme Court in the Biddle case said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-6\">\u201cAt the outset it is to be observed that decision must turn on the precise meaning of the words in the statute which grants to the citizen taxpayer a credit for foreign \u2018income taxes paid.\u2019 * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-7\">\u201cSection 131 does not say that the meaning of its words is to be determined by foreign taxing statutes and decisions, and there is nothing in its language to suggest that, in allowing the credit for foreign tax payments, a shifting standard was adopted by reference to foreign characterizations and classifications of tax legislation. The phrase finc\u00f3me taxes paid,\u2019 as used in our own revenue laws, has for most practical purposes a well-understood meaning to be derived from an examination of the statutes which provide for the laying and collection of income taxes. It is that meaning which must be attributed to it as used in section 131.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-8\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-9\">\u00ab m= Ms Ms the British conception [is] that the standard tax paid by the corporation is passed on to the stockholders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-10\">\u201c Our revenue laws give no recognition to that conception. * \u2666 Nor have they treated as taxpayers those upon whom no legal duty to pay the tax is laid. * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1070-12\">Thus it is evident that defendant\u2019s position here has been foreclosed by the Biddle decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-13\">The analogy is clear. In Biddle the Court resorted to American law to determine, for American tax purposes, whether the taxpayer there had paid the foreign tax, notwithstanding the conflicting foreign concepts. In this case it is the American law which must determine, for American tax purposes, whether the plaintiff was the' taxpayer of the Puerto Rican tax, notwithstanding Puerto Rican concepts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-14\">Under \u2019 American law the tax upon partnership income is imposed upon and is payable by the partners upon their respective distributable shares; and there is no tax imposed upon the income of the part<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>nership as a separate entity. Thus in the view of the American law it may be said that the total Puerto Rican tax upon the partnership income was imposed in two separate levies upon the partners, once nominally upon the partnership as a separate entity, and once upon the partners upon their respective distributable shares. But it was the individual partners who actually paid and were subject to both levies. Even under Puerto Rican law, Code of Commerce, supra, the individual partners were personally liable for the tax nominally laid upon the partnership as a separate entity. The plaintiff here was not only legally liable to pay the tax upon the partnership as a separate entity, but it did in fact pay that portion of the tax for which it here seeks credit. It was therefore entitled under Section 131(a) (1) to the credit there provided in the case of a domestic corporation for the amount of income tax paid or accrued to a possession of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-6\">This view of the case makes it unnecessary to rule upon plaintiff\u2019s contention that Section 131(a) (4) is applicable to corporate members of a joint venture as well as to non-corporate individual members. It suffices to hold that plaintiff is entitled to the credit sought under Section 131(a) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-7\">By stipulation of the parties entry of judgment will be withheld pending recalculation by the parties of the amount due in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-8\">HOWELL, MADDEN, WHITAKER, and LITTLETON, Judges, concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
