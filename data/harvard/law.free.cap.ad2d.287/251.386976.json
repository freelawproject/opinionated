These remarks were not unduly prejudicial and the court\u2019s curative actions were sufficient to prevent any prejudice (see, <em>People v Santiago, </em>52 NY2d 865; <em>People v Young, </em>48 NY2d 995).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">We perceive no basis for reduction of defendant\u2019s sentence in the interest of justice. Defendant\u2019s remaining arguments concerning his trial and sentencing are similar to claims rejected by this Court on the codefendant\u2019s appeal <em>(People v Garcia, </em>276 AD2d 285, <em>lv denied, </em>95 NY2d 934), and as to each argument we reach the same conclusions as we did with respect to the codefendant.
