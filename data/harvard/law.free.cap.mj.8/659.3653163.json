It was discussed in the review of the staff judge advocate where he expressed the opinion that the court was properly instructed and that the evidence \u201cis adequate to support the finding of the court that the accused was legally sane.\u201d It is clear to us that by referencing the military judge\u2019s instructions the staff judge advocate did not apply an erroneous standard, but determined that the sanity of the accused was established beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Oakley, </em>11 U.S.C.M.A. 187, 29 C.M.R. 3 (1960); <em>United States v. Herrington, </em>33 C.M.R. 814 (A.F.B.R.1963), pet. denied, 33 C.M.R. 436 (C.M.A.1963). However, in discussing the issue, the staff judge advocate failed to advise the convening authority that before approving findings of guilty, he too must find the accused\u2019s mental responsibility was established beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-16\">This failure to provide adequate guidance to the convening authority by which he could properly exercise his powers in determining the sanity of the accused is error. See <em>United States v. Smith, </em>23 U.S.C.M.A. 98, 48 C.M.R. 659 (1974); <em>United States v. Fields, </em>9 U.S.C.M.A. 70, 25 C.M.R. 332 (1958); <em>United States v. Kohler, </em>4 M.J. 941 (A.F.C.M.R.1978); <em>United States v. Her-rington, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b688-17\">This error was called to the staff judge advocate\u2019s attention by the trial defense counsel in his response to the review,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but the staff judge advocate chose to reaffirm his prior advice rather than correct the review.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>United States v. Boston, </em>7 M.J. 954 (A.F.C.M.R.1979). Therefore, the action of the convening authority is set aside and the record is returned for a new review and action in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b688-9\">. The convening authority\u2019s general responsibilities are explained in the final paragraph of the review which states: \u201cBefore approving a finding of guilty you must determine that the accused had the requisite . . . mental responsibility at the time of the commission of the offense . . .\u201d This does not provide any guidance as to the standard he must apply and is inadequate when the issue of sanity is raised by the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b688-13\">. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Goode, </em>1 M.J. 3 (C.M.A. 1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b688-19\">. Although no objection was made by trial defense counsel to the staff judge advocate's handling of the self defense issue, the failure of the reviewer to express his opinion as to that issue, and the failure to properly advise the convening authority as to his responsibilities in that regard is error. This should be corrected in the new review. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Coner, 4 </em>M.J. 915 (A.F.C.M.R.1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
