The military judge sentenced him to dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, confinement at hard labor for two years, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade. The convening authority changed the discharge from dishonorable to bad-conduct and otherwise approved the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-24\">This case involves the applicability of Wharton\u2019s Rule, which provides that a person cannot be convicted of a conspiracy to commit a criminal offense if the offense requires concerted action by two persons.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>Wharton\u2019s Rule is recognized in military practice<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as well as in the federal civilian courts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">The Rule, both by its terms and by judicial interpretation, applies only when the substantive offense necessarily entails a plurality of criminal activity. <em>Iannelli v. United States, </em>420 U.S. 770, 785, 95 S.Ct. 1284, 43 L.Ed.2d 616 (1975); <em>United States v. Sproles, </em>48 C.M.R. 278, 280 (A.C.M.R.1974). Although we agree with the appellant that the transfer of marihuana \u2014 the substantive offense in issue \u2014 required a duality of action, we do not agree with his contention that Wharton\u2019s Rule is applicable. The Supreme Court in its most recent analysis of the Rule held that it is not a categorical imperative to be applied in a mechanical fashion, but is merely an aid to statutory construction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">The rationale for treating conspiracy and its substantive offense as separate offenses, separately punishable, is that such concerted activities pose a potentially greater threat to the public than do individual crimes. <em>See Callanan v. United States, </em>364 U.S. 587, 593-94, 81 S.Ct. 321, 5 L.Ed.2d 312 (1961). The offenses to which Wharton\u2019s Rule traditionally apply, such as adultery, do not pose this danger. As the Court observed in <em>Iannelli:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-6\">The classic Wharton\u2019s Rule offenses\u2014 adultery, incest, bigamy, dueling \u2014 are crimes that are characterized by the general congruence of the agreement and the completed substantive offense. The parties to the agreement are the only persons who participate in commission of the substantive offense, and the immediate consequences of the crime rest on the parties themselves rather than on society at large. Finally, the agreement that attends the substantive offense does not appear likely to pose the distinct kinds of threats to society that the law of conspiracy seeks to avert. It cannot, for example, readily be assumed that an agreement to commit an offense of this nature will produce agreements to engage in a more general pattern of criminal conduct.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-14\">Concerted activity in drug transactions, however, is different. Agreements that accompany unlawful transfers of drugs tend to pose the kind of threats to society that the law of conspiracy seeks to prevent. Under the circumstances, we cannot ascribe to Congress an intent to limit prosecution to the substantive offense. Although the legislative history of the Uniform Code of Military Justice is silent in this regard, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found a Congressional intent to permit separate punishment for conspiracy and its substantive offense in prosecutions under the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act (\u00a7\u00a7 101 <em>et seq.; </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801 <em>et seq.). United States v. Bommarito, </em>524 F.2d 140 (2d Cir. 1975). We cannot conclude that Congressional concern for the far-reaching effects of concert<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>ed drug activities is limited to the civilian milieu.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">For the foregoing reasons we hold that the appellant could properly be prosecuted for conspiracy to transfer marihuana and for the substantive offense of transferring the marihuana. His pleas of guilty were provident.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">The findings of guilty and the sentence are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">Senior Judge CARNE and Judge DRIB-BEN concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b657-16\">. In its present incarnation, the Rule states: An agreement by two persons to commit a particular crime cannot be prosecuted as a conspiracy when the crime is of such a nature as to necessarily require the participation of two persons for its commission.</p>\n<p id=\"AZo7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>I Anderson, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law and Procedure, \u00a7 89, p. 191 (1957).
