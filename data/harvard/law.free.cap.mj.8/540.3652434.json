The judge, before proceeding with the trial, determined, in accordance with paragraph 11c, <em>Manual for Courts-Martial, 1969 (Rev.), </em>that appellant\u2019s absence was unauthorized and voluntary. Despite this satisfaction of the <em>Manual </em>rule, appellant contends that further proceedings were erroneous because he had not been informed by the judge that the trial could continue in his absence and that, therefore, his absence did not constitute an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right, as required by <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938), in order to be an effective waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-25\">This precise \u00e1ssertion was addressed and rejected by the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>414 U.S. 17, 94 S.Ct. 194, 38 L.Ed.2d 174 (1973), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>a case in which trial was held in an accused\u2019s absence pursuant to Rule- 43 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the civilian counterpart to the <em>Manual\u2019s </em>paragraph lie. Interestingly enough, the Army Court of Military Review, in an opinion authored by the Honorable Matthew O\u2019Donnell, reached the same conclusion in <em>United States v. Allison, </em>47 C.M.R. 968 (A.C.M.R.1973), almost a month before the Supreme Court\u2019s action. We find these decisions dis-positive of appellant\u2019s first assignment of error. His remaining assignments of error are also rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The findings of guilty and sentence approved below are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Judge PRICE and Judge MICHEL concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
