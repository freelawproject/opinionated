The approved sentence extends to a bad conduct discharge (suspended), confinement at hard labor for three months, and forfeiture of $299.00 per month for three months.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">On 15 June 1979, accused held his wedding reception at the Hickam Air Force Base Officer\u2019s Club and incurred a debt of $314.00. On several occasions in late June, he promised to pay this debt but did not. Eventually he promised to pay the full amount in installments on 1 July, 15 July and 1 August. The specification for this offense alleged that he dishonorably failed to pay from 1 August until 25 October 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Prior to accepting accused\u2019s plea, the military judge advised him of the elements of the offense of dishonorable failure to pay a debt, but did not explain the term dishonorable. The military judge\u2019s questions to the accused as to the factual basis for the plea were limited to the promises made in June and accused\u2019s capacity, in early July, to pay the debt. He did not inquire about accused\u2019s capacity to pay in August, September or October, or about any promises made during those months, or, indeed, about any events during those months, the period of the alleged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">At trial, independent evidence established that $946.92 was withheld from accused\u2019s pay from 15 August to 31 October, 1979 to satisfy indebtedness owed the government. During the same period, an additional $315.00 was withheld from his pay, but accused was permitted to draw from this, and in fact, did draw a total of $50.00 from August through October. A stipulation of testimony indicates that an unknown part of this debt to the Officer\u2019s Club was paid, in late August, through a military pay order executed against accused\u2019s pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">Among other requirements, a military judge, prior to accepting a plea of guilty, must question the accused about what he did or did not do and when relevant, what he intended. The purpose is to make clear the basis for a determination that the acts of the accused constitute the offense to which he is pleading guilty. <em>United States v. Care, </em>18 U.S.C.M.A. 535,40 C.M.R. 247 (1969). To be dishonorable, the \u201cfailure to pay a debt\u201d must be characterized by deceit, evasion, false promises, or other distinctly culpable circumstances indicating a deliberate nonpayment or grossly indifferent attitude toward one\u2019s just obligations. Manual for Courts-Martial, 1969 (Rev.), paragraph 213f(7). The term dishonorable connotes a mental element closely related to that of a specific intent; it is not established by negligence or irresponsibility, and often needs to be carefully explained to an accused. <em>United States v. Bethea, </em>3 M.J. 526 (A.F.C.M.R.1977); <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>1 M.J. 714 (A.F.C.M.R.1975); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>1 M.J. 703 (A.F.C.M.R.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-10\">In this case, there was no factual basis, secured through questioning of the accused, for the plea; and the elements of the offense were not meaningfully related to accused\u2019s conduct. Accordingly, the military judge erred in accepting accused\u2019s plea to this offense. While a rehearing could be ordered, we dismiss the charge in the interests of justice. In view of the dismissal, the error assigned by accused\u2019s appellate defense counsel, which relates to this offense, is moot. We have reassessed the sentence for the remaining offenses, and find appropriate only so much of the sentence as provides for a bad conduct discharge, as suspended by the convening authority, confinement at hard labor for three months and forfeiture of $150.00 per month for three months. As modified, the findings of guilty and the sentence are</p>\n<p id=\"b808-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-12\">HERMAN, Senior Judge and ARRO-WOOD, Judge, concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
