We disagree, since the accused received and possessed some thirteen pounds of hashish during the six-month period in which use was alleged on diverse occasions. This large amount was incompatible with that which would normally be possessed simply for one\u2019s personal use. The record reveals that the hashish was subsequently sold in smaller amounts by the accused and a friend. With this information presented to him by the accused during the guilty plea inquiry, the military judge was correct in holding the offenses of possession and use of marijuana were separate for punishment purposes. <em>United States v. Hand, </em>8 M.J. 701 (A.F.C.M.R. 3 Jan. 1980); <em>United States v. Poinsett, </em>3 M.J. 697 (A.F.C.M.R.1977), pet. denied, 3 M.J. 483 (C.M.A.1977). Contra, <em>United States v. Kinion, 5 </em>M.J. 930 (N.C.M.R.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">The assignments of error made by trial defense counsel are without merit. Accordingly, the findings of guilty and the sentence are</p>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
