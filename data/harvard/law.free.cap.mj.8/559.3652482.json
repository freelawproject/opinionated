Lanzer, </em>3 M.J. 60 (C.M.A.1977), where the Court of Military Appeals held that an accused who pled not guilty at a rehearing ordered by the convening authority was entitled to the sentence limitation benefits of a pretrial agreement because he had complied fully with the agreement\u2019s terms by pleading guilty and entering into a stipulation of fact at the first trial. The agreement in <em>Lanzer </em>was written expressly in terms of pretrial and trial actions by the accused and was silent with respect to a rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">We see nothing in <em>Lanzer </em>which precludes the parties from agreeing that guilty pleas are required at a rehearing as well as the initial trial in order for the accused to qualify for the sentence limitation. Furthermore, contrary to the assertions of appellant, a pretrial agreement provision such as the one encountered here does not abrogate either Article 63(b), UCMJ or paragraph 81d(l) <em>Manual for Courts-Martial, 1969 (Rev.). Accord, United States v. Thomas, </em>6 M.J. 573 (A.C.M.R.1978), <em>pet. granted, </em>6 M.J. 91 (C.M.A.1979); <em>United States v. Stoutmire, </em>5 M.J. 724 (A.C.M.R.1978). If a sentence is reduced by the convening authority in accordance with the terms of a pretrial agreement and higher authority orders a rehearing, the court would be limited at the rehearing to the reduced approved sentence pursuant to paragraph 81d(1), <em>Manual for Courts-Martial, 1969 (Rev.), </em>whether the accused pleads guilty or not guilty. At that point, the issue of whether there is still a viable pretrial agreement becomes irrelevant. The trial judge went over every provision of the pretrial agreement with the appellant in accordance with <em>United States v. Williamson, </em>4 M.J. 708 (N.C.M.R.1977), and thus assured on the record that appellant understood the meaning and effect of each condition as required by <em>United States v. Green, </em>1 M.J. 453 (C.M.A.1976). Moreover, pursuant to <em>Williamson, supra, </em>the judge expressly found the provisions of the agreement to be in accord with applicable case law, not contrary to public policy and also fair. We agree with the trial judge\u2019s determination and accordingly reject appellant\u2019s assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">The findings of guilty and sentence approved below are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Judge PRICE and Judge MICHEL concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
