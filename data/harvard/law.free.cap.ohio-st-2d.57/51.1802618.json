Capital City Excavating Co., </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St. 2d 184, 187, this court .held that this safety requirement satisfies the constitutional mandate of specificity because \u201cthe employer\u2019s right, to exercise his discretion <em>ends </em>and his duty to deenergize, move or guard the conductor or guard his equipment <em>begins once it becomes necessary </em>for his employees to operate within 12 feet of a conductor in the normal course of their duties.\u201d (Emphasis added in part.)</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">In the proceedings below the Industrial Commission found that, inasmuch as the boom did in fact come in contact with high voltage lines, appellant had violated rule IC-3-05.03(A)(5). There was no evidence that, in order to successfully erect and clean the sign, the boom would be required to come within 12 feet of the electrical lines, or that it was even likely to enter that 12 foot zone. On the contrary, the Court of Appeals admitted that \u201cin all probability, the job could have been accomplished without the boom entering the 12 foot zone if the crane operator had been careful.\u201d Thus it appears that appellee adopted a result-oriented approach in its determination that- Eule IC-3-05.03 (A) (5) was violated by appellant. The Court of Appeals sanctioned this approach when it stated that \u201cthe proper interpretation of necessary, \u2018is that when crane operation in fact comes within twelve feet of an electrical line, appropriate protection must be utilized * * #\u2019 \u201d (citing <em>State, ex rel. Capital City Excavating Co., v. Indus, Comm. </em>[Franklin Co. Ct. App., July 26, 1977, No. 77AP-10], unreported, affirmed 54 Ohio St. 2d 184 [1978]). We disagree with this interpretation, of the safety requirement, and to the extent that our opinion in <em>Capital City Excavating- </em>may be construed to approve .of that approach, it will no longer be followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>This court has repeatedly held that, in order for safety regulations to comply with the constitutional requirement of specificity they must be \u201cof a character plainly to apprise an employer of his legal obligation toward his employees.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Trydle, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1972), 32 Ohio St. 2d 257, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>State, ex rel. Holdosh, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1948), 149 Ohio St. 179, 182. The safety requirement must be such as to \u201cforewarn the employer and establish a standard which he may follow.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Rae, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1939), 136 Ohio St. 168, 173. The result-oriented approach used by appellee does not satisfy this constitutional standard. This method of applying the safety requirement is based solely on hindsight, and, as such, does not apprise or forewarn an employer of his legal obligation. Appellee\u2019s interpretation of Rule IC-3-05.03(A) (5) in effect converts the word \u201cnecessary\u201d into \u201cremotely conceivable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">There is testimony in the record that, considering the telescopic and rotating capabilities of the boom, it could be brought within the 12 foot zone through misjudgment or accidental occurrence while working on a job site over 200 feet away. Considering the frequency in which a crane is likely to come within 200 feet of power lines and the impractieality of instituting the other alternatives stated in the rule in each such situation, the only feasible way for an employer to comply with appellee\u2019s interpretation of IC-3-05.03(A) (5) is to \u201cinstall an insulated type guard about * * * [each of its] boom[s].\u201d If the Industrial Commission desires to require this type of safety device on all cranes it should plainly so state. This court will not distort the plain meaning of the word \u201cnecessary\u201d to accomplish that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">\u201cIn construing statutes, it is customary to give words their plain ordinary meaning unless the legislative body has clearly expressed a contrary intention.\u201d <em>Youngstown Club </em>v. <em>Porterfield </em>(1970), 21 Ohio St. 2d 83; 86. This maxim applies equally to administrative regulations. The Oxford' English Distionary defines \u201cnecessary\u201d as \u201cindis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>pensable, requisite, essential, needful; that cannot be done without.\u201d We believe that by applying this definition to rule IC-3-05.03(A) (5), the employer is given an objective standard to follow and the employee is provided with reasonable safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">Applying the safety requirement, as properly construed, to the facts of this cause, it is evident that appellee abused its discretion in granting the additional award. There is no evidence that it was \u201cnecessary\u201d for the boom to come within 12 feet of the electrical lines. Thus, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the writ of mandamus allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and tvrit allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b83-6\">Celebrezze, C.
