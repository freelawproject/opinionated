C. 4909.191(F)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is read in <em>pari materia </em>with R. C. 4909.191(B), the commission is required to, <em>ipso facto, </em>suspend the fuel adjustment cost clause of a company which does not so comply. We conclude otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Neither R. C. 4909.191(B) nor 4909.191(F) contains language requiring the commission to automatically suspend the fuel cost adjustment clause of a company which fails to comply with this 30-day filing requirement. Absent clear statutory language to that effect, such an extreme result should not be imposed. <em>Ohio Power Co. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St. 2d 342, 376 N. E. 2d 1337; see, also, <em>State, ex rel. Jones, </em>v. <em>Farrar </em>(1946), 146 Ohio St. 467, 66 N. E. 2d 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The purpose of the filing requirement of R. C. 4909.-191(B) is to provide advance opportunity for the parties to analyze information submitted by the utility pertinent to its fuel procurement practices and policies. The filing deadline is designed to facilitate an orderly and prompt hearing, <em>State, ex rel. Jones, </em>v. <em>Farrar, supra, </em>and is not jurisdictional in nature<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Pennsylvania Bd. Co. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1961), <em>172 </em>Ohio St. 154, 174 N. E. 2d 102; <em>Dover </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1933), 126 Ohio St. 438, 185 N. E. 833. Appellant was afforded an opportunity to review the submitted information prior to the hearings. Moreover, appellant opposed C&amp;SOE\u2019s <em>offer </em>to continue the hearings so that additional time would have been available to analyze the submitted data. Thereafter, the commission in its order of December 21, 1977, stated that C&amp;SOE\u2019s late filing neither delayed the proceedings nor prejudiced appellant\u2019s cause. This conclusion is not disputed by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Appellant contends further that C&amp;SOE passed demand costs through its fuel cost adjustment clause, in violation of R. C. 4905.32, and that the commission\u2019s order, which refused to refund these demand costs to C&amp;SOE customers, is unreasonable and unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">At the outset, a distinction must be recognized between the statutory rate-making process involved in establishing fixed rate schedules, and the statutory procedure govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>ing variable rate schedules under the fuel cost adjustment procedure. In the normal instance, a utility desiring to establish a rate, or change an existing one, must file a written application with the commission pursuant to R. C. 4909.-18. The function of the commission is to determine the justness and reasonableness of the proposed rates before they become effective, and to fix lawful rates in accordance with the statutory rate plan. <em>Cleveland Elec. Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St. 2d 105, 346 N. E. 2d 778. Once computed, a schedule of the rates approved by the commission must be filed with the commission under R. C. 4905.30. The utility is admonished, by the provisions of R. C. 4905.32, that it may not charge rates which differ from those previously approved and filed with the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">In contrast, the fuel cost adjustment provisions of R. C. Chapters 4905 and 4909 represent a statutory plan which authorizes a utility to pass variable fuel costs directly to consumers. Rates are thereby varied without prior approval of the commission, and independently from the formal rate-making process incorporated in R. C. 4909.18 and 4909.19. See R. C. 4905.01(C); Rule 4901:1-11-02(H), Ohio Adm. Code; R. C. 4905.302; <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util Comm. </em>( 1977), 52 Ohio St. 2d 142, 370 N. E. 2d 468. R. C. 4905.301 sets forth a procedure by which, \u201c[n]ot withstanding any other provision of law,\u201d the utilization of the fuel cost adjustment procedure is governed by the commission through an after-the-fact, periodic review of a company\u2019s rate adjustment practices, policies and charges. Therefore, appellant\u2019s proposition that R. C. 4905.32 limits the fuel cost adjustment procedure to prior approved rates is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">We find further that the commission\u2019s refusal t'o refund the demand costs is a valid exercise of its broad authority to promulgate rules designed to foster utility fuel procurement incentives. R. C. 4905.69(C)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>; see, also, R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>C. 4905.301(C). Initially, the commission promulgated Rule 4901:1-11-02(1), Ohio Adm. Code,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which, in pertinent part, provides that: \u201c* * * No amounts billed as capacity or demand charges may be included as cost of fuel\u201d in a fuel cost- adjustment clause. In accordance with commission Requirements stated in Rule 4901:1-11-09(B) (1), Ohio Adm. Code, a copy of Rule 4901 :1-11-02 was incorporated into-the \u25a0 tariff provisions of C&amp;SOE on file with the commission. It is this tariff provision that appellant contends precluded the recovery of demand costs through the fuel cost -adjustment clause. :</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Appellant\u2019s argument in this regard is not well taken. In <em>Consumers\u2019 Counsel </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St. 2d 319, 384 N. E. 2d 245, this court upheld an order of the commission which authorized the inclusion of the entire cost of energy purchased on an economic dispatch basis in the fuel cost adjustment clause. FurtheRmore, the commission has pR\u00e9viously determined, in case No. 76-166-EL-FAC, dated August 11, 1976, that Rule 4901:1-11-02(1), formerly Section1 26.02(1) of the commission\u2019s Code of Rules and Regulations, as applied to the demand costs associated'with purchased energy, was not'feasible because \u201cit would'; discourage economic transactions which would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>lower the overall cost of electricity and thus benefit, both, the utility and the consumer.\u201d The commission- stated further that it has been \u201cclearly demonstrated that the effect of excluding all demand charges * <em>* </em>* would be to discourage, if not eliminate certain economic purchases of power,, to the detriment of the consumer.\u201d \u25a0 Accordingly, the commission held the application of Rule 4901:1-11-02(1) unreasonable in those circumstances and authorized the inclusion of demand costs in the fuel cost adjustment clause. Thus the commission order in the instant cause, which results in a reduction: of energy costs, for the consumer and the utility is both reasonable and lawful. R. C. 4909.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">In its final proposition of law, appellant urges that the commission\u2019s determination not to order a refund of .$125,-000 in fuel costs passed through the company\u2019s fuel cost adjustment clause (which was subsequently refunded to C&amp;SOE by the selling utility) was unreasonable and unlawful. The commission, however, refused the refund because! the evidence adduced at the audit hearing demonstrated that C&amp;SOE erroneously neglected to charge $119,000' for 'net energy costs, which it could have passed through\u2019 its: fuel cost adjustment\u2019clause. The commission determined .that the overcharge and the undercharge \u201cresults, in\u2019 \u00e1. $6,000 difference, which is so minimal that the cost of administering the adjustment could exceed the refund.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">A finding and order of the commission will not be disturbed by this court unless it appears from the record that the commission\u2019s determination is manifestly against the weight of the evidence and so clearly unsupported as to show misapprehension or mistake or willful disregard of duty. <em>Cleveland Elec. Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St. 2d 403, 330 N. E. 2d 1 (paragraph eight of the syllabus); certiorari denied, 423 U. S. 986; <em>Reynoldsburg Trucking, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St. 2d 201, 373 N. E. 2d 1250. Under R. C. 4905.66(F),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>commission is empowered to readjust utility rates when it determines that an error or inaccuracy has occurred and it is equitable to do so.
