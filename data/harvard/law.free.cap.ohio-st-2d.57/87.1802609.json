Brown, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8N\">The sole issue raised by the instant cause is whether, under Ohio\u2019s felonious sexual-penetration statute, a finger is an \u201cobject.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-16\">R. C. 2907.12 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b115-17\">\u201c(A) No person without privilege to do so shall insert any <em>instrument, apparatus </em>or <em>other object </em>into the vaginal or anal cavity of another, not the spouse of the offender, when any of the following apply:</p>\n<p id=\"b115-18\">\u201c (1) The offender purposely compels the other person to submit by force or threat of force.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b115-19\">Appellant argues that the dictionary definition of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>object applies to R. 0. 2907.12(A). It then concludes that, since the dictionary defines an object as \u201canything [or \u201csomething\u201d] visible or tangible,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a finger is an object. \"We are not persuaded by that reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">\u201cThe primary purpose of the judiciary in the interpretation or construction of statutes is to * * * ascertain the legislative will.\u201d <em>Henry </em>v. <em>Central Natl. Bank </em>(1968), 16 Ohio St. 2d 16, paragraph two of the syllabus; 2A Sutherland on Statutory Construction 15, Section 45.05, and cases cited therein. Moreover, where statutory language clearly expresses that legislative intent, that language will not be construed by the courts. <em>Provident Bank </em>v. <em>Wood </em>(1973), 36 Ohio St. 2d 101, 106; <em>Katz </em>v. <em>Dept. of Liquor Control </em>(1957), 166 Ohio St. 229, 231. Words are not absolutes, however. Because their meanings may vary according to context, custom and usage <em>(American Oil Co. v. State Highway Board </em>[1962], 122 Vt. 496, 177 A. 2d 358), statutory language cannot be declared clear or ambiguous until the context in which it appears or the connotations which it may carry are taken into consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">R. C. 2907.12 is a sex-offense statute. Of the other 19 jurisdictions which specifically prohibit penetration of an individual\u2019s vagina or anus by something other than the male sex organ, 12 use the term \u201cobject\u201d and clearly exclude parts of the body from that term.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While the language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>used by those 12 jurisdictions does not control our reading of Ohio law,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it suggests that the broad dictionary definition of an object does not necessarily apply to R. C. 2907.-12(A) and that, therefore, this court must construe the statute in order to determine legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">R. C. 2907.12(A) prohibits the insertion of \u201cany instrument, apparatus or other object.\u201d The- statute lists three nouns\u2014two specific and the third, general. The gen-' eral term is immediately preceded by the word \u201cother\u201d\u2014a word which refers to the two specific nouns in the list and suggests legislative intent to limit the scope of the general noun to those objects having the characteristics of those specific nouns <em>(Glidden Co. </em>v. <em>Glander </em>[1949], 151 Ohio St. 344, 350). In addition, R. C. 2907.12 is a criminal statute which must be strictly construed against the state ( R. C. 2901.04 [A]).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Since R. C. 2907.12 lists specific terms followed by a catchall word which is linked to those specific terms by the word \u201cother,\u201d and since the statute must be construed strictly, it appears to be subject to the doctrine of <em>ejusdemgeneris.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> State </em>v. <em>Aspell </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St. 2d 1, paragraph two of the syllabus, describes the operation of this doctrine in the following manner:</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">\u201cUnder the rule of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>where in a statute terms are first used which are confined to a particular class of objects having well-known and definite features and characteristics, and then afterwards a term having per-. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>haps a broader signification is conjoined, such latter term is, as indicative of legislative intent, to be considered as embracing only things of a similar character as those comprehended by the preceding limited and confined terms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ak\">Once the doctrine of <em>e jus clem generis </em>is applied to Ohio\u2019s sexual-penetration statute, it becomes clear that a finger is not an \u201cobject\u201d within the purview of R. C. 2907.-12(A). In general, dictionaries define instruments and apparatuses as implements or tools, or groups of implements or tools. One characteristic common to instruments and apparatuses is that they are inanimate. (The .American Heritage Dictionary, for instance, defines an instrument as a \u201cmechanical implement.\u201d)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Since, under the doctrine of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>nothing may be construed to fall within the catchall term \u201cobject\u201d unless it shares the characteristics of instruments and apparatuses, only inanimate objects fall within the purview of R. C. 2907.12(A). A finger is not inanimate. It is part of the human body. Therefore, a finger is not an object under R. C. 2907.12(A), and Ohio\u2019s sexual-penetration statute does not encompass digital penetration.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Since the activity for which the defendant was convicted under R. C. 2907.12 was limited to digital penetration, his conviction must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><em>Judgment </em>affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b119-5\">P.

(The other states proscribing such activity do so in sexual battery or sexual imposition statutes or their equivalents.)- The memorandum supporting the New York law describes the behavior its sponsor hoped to discourage in the following manner: \u201cIt is not uncommon for sex crime defendants to force foreign objects into the vagina or anal cavities of their victims. Objects such as broom handles, gun, barrels, night sticks, closet poles and hangers have been used.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b117-9\"> 2A Sutherland on Statutory Construction 337, Section 52.03. <em>Funk </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1933), 290 U.

C. 2907.12 also supports the conclusion that a finger is not an object under that statute. \u201cInsert\u201d connotes thrusting an object into something with the possibility of leaving it there. (Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines insert as \u201cto set (something) in * * * [to] put or thrust in * * * to put or introduce into * * * to set in and make fast * * *.\u201d) That connotation does not apply to penetration by a part of the aggressor\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Appellant also argues that <em>ejusdem generis </em>does not apply to the instant statute because all three nouns listed in R. C. 2907.12(A) are general, and each should be treated as if it formed a separate class. We are not persuaded by this argument. The word \u201cobject\u201d has a broader meaning than do the words \u201cinstrument\u201d and \u201capparatus.\u201d Moreover, instruments and apparatuses fall within the same class. The main distinction between the two is that the latter is usually a group or collection of the former.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b119-9\">Celebrezze, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A9P\">dissenting. A resolution of the issue presented in this appeal requires not only a judicial analysis of one specific statute but an examination of the total range of individual conduct the General Assembly sought to proscribe by enacting that portion of R. C. Chapter 2907 dealing with the category of offenses known as sexual assaults. R. C. 2907.12(A) derives its meaning from the context in which it is placed and by a construction in harmony with other statutes dealing with related offenses. As indicated in 50 Ohio Jurisprudence 2d 199, Statutes, Section 221:</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">\u201c* * * A code of statutes relating to one subject is presumed to be governed by one spirit and policy, and intended to be consistent and harmonious, and <em>all of the several sections are to be considered in order to arrive at the meaning of any part, </em>unless a contrary intent is clearly manifest.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">The offenses that are described in that portion of R. C. Chapter 2907 dealing with sexual assaults include the following: R. C. 2907.02, rape; R. C. 2907.03, sexual battery; R. C. 2907.04, corruption of a minor; R. C. 2907.05, gross sexual imposition; and R. C. 2907.06, sexual imposition. A scrutiny of the foregoing statutes reveals two specifically defined modes of sexual activity that are prohibited\u2014\u201csexual conduct\u201d and \u201csexual contact,\u201d as defined in R. C. 2907.01(A) and (B), respectively.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>In addition to these statutory provisions the General Assembly enacted R. C. 2907.12 to deal with a third category of prohibited sexual activity. The conduct delineated does not incorporate the aforementioned definitions set forth in R. C. 2907.01, but is described as the felonious <em>penetration </em>or <em>insertion </em>by \u201cany instrument, apparatus, or other object into the vaginal or anal cavity of another.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">In summary, the sexual assaults encompassed by R. C. Chapter 2907 involve sexual conduct, sexual contact, and felonious sexual penetration. Since it is beyond dispute that the act of the defendant-appellee is a sexual assault, the question becomes \u201cwhere in the aforementioned, statutory scheme is this factual scenario to be found?\u201d The majority opinion in the Court of Appeals noted that appellee\u2019s conduct would \u201ccome within the scope of the crime of gross sexual imposition, although we are not obliged here to so decide.\u201d I strongly disagree with that observation as well as the conclusion of the majority of this court that appellee\u2019s actions do not amount to felonious sexual penetration pursuant to R. C. 2907.12(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">As indicated previously, the gross sexual imposition statute, R. C. 2907.05, deals with \u201csexual contact\u201d which, in turn, encompasses the act of <em>touching </em>as set forth in R. C. 2907.01(B). The act of the appellee involved not only a <em>touching </em>but an obvious <em>penetration </em>of the victim\u2019s vagina.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>It is equally clear that the General Assembly intended to make a conspicuous distinction between those two categor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>ies of sexual activity by the disparity in the penalties imposed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">As justification for the proposition that R. C. 2907.12 (A) only prohibits penetration by an inanimate object, the majority refers to several other state statutory schemes involving sex offenses. It is interesting to note that some of the statutes listed prohibit the penetration of an individual\u2019s vagina or anus by <em>either </em>an \u201cobject\u201d <em>or </em>\u201cany part of the body.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The observation that can be drawn from including both prohibitions in the same statute is that the primary concern of those legislative bodies is the un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>lawful <em>penetration </em>of an individual\u2019s body and <em>not </em>the various <em>means </em>by which that invasion is accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Keeping the foregoing observation in mind, and construing various portions of R. C. Chapter 2907 in <em>pari materia, </em>it is the opinion of this writer that the General Assembly intended to provide for a broad definition of the term \u201cobject\u201d in R. C. 2907.12(A) in light of the specific definitions of \u201csexual conduct\u201d and \u201csexual contact\u201d embodied in related statutes. To construe that term too narrowly would create an illogical state of affairs whereby the act of the appellee, obviously a form of sexual assault, is not covered by any of the statutory provisions codified in R. C. Chapter 2907.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">With that assessment of the legislative policy behind R. C. Chapter 2907 as a foundation, the majority\u2019s use of the doctrine of <em>ejusdem generis </em>is no longer dispositive of the issue presented in this appeal. Assuming, arguendo, that the rule does apply and that \u201cinstrument or apparatus\u201d are \u201cspecific nouns,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> thereby restricting the scope of the word \u201cobject\u201d to a specific class, the doctrine cannot operate to distort the legislative objective underlying the overall statutory scheme of which R. C. 2907.12 is merely a segment. The existence of such a rule of statutory interpretation does not warrant a court in confining the operation of a statute within limits narrower than those intended-by the lawmakers. <em>Woodworth </em>v. <em>State </em>(1875), 26 Ohio St. 196,198; see, also, <em>Shultz </em>v. <em>Cambridge </em>(1883), 38 Ohio St. 659, 663-664. Furthermore, the applicability of the dontrine to a particular statute is not conclusive as to the meaning of the statutory language when an examination of the \u201cwhole law upon the subject\u201d points to a different result:</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">\u201cThe rule of ejusdem generis is far from being one of universal application. It is neither final nor conclusive; there are many cases to which claims of the applicability, of the doctrine are denied, and in which general terms in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>a statute :are given meanings beyond the specific terms preceding them.* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">\u201c-*\u2022 * * If, on consideration of the context and whole law upon th\u00e9 subject, and the purposes sought to be effected, it is apparent that the legislature intended the general words to go beyond the class specially designated, the rul\u00e9 does not apply.\u201d 73 American Jurisprudence 2d 408-09, Section 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Since <em>all </em>the provisions of R. C. Chapter 2907 relating to sexual- assaults must be considered in <em>pari materia </em>to ascertain the legislative intent behind R. C. 2907.12, and in light of the foregoing limitations on the doctrine of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>it is my opinion that the legislature intended to give \u201cobject\u201d its normal dictionary definition. In addition-;'R. C. 1.42 mandates that \u201c [w]ords and phrases shall be read in context and construed according to the rules of grammar'and <em>common usage.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Adhering to that rule, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (Rev. 4'Ed.);-defines an \u201cobject\u201d as \u201c[ajnvthing which comes within the cognizance or scrutiny of the senses, especially 'anything tangible or visible.\u201d Applying that definition to the'' record I agree with Judge Castle\u2019s statement in his dissenting opinion below \u201cthat to hold that a human finger is -not something which is tangible, visible and stable in form is to ignore the clear unambiguous meaning of the word object.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">\u2022In-conclusion, with the enactment of R. C. 2907.12 the General Assembly intended to criminalize the act of penetrating- a victim\u2019s vaginal or anal cavity regardless of \u2022whether that penetration was accomplished by way of an animate or inanimate object. The purposeful and forceful invasion of the victim\u2019s body is in no sense mitigated because- the object used to accomplish that instrusion was connected to the body of the appellee. \u25a0 \u201c</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b124-10\">Herbert, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion. . \"</judges>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b119-12\">R. C. 2907.01 reads, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b119-13\">\u201c(A) \u2018Sexual conduct\u2019 means vaginal intercourse between a male <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>and female, and anal intercourse, fellatio, cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex. <em>Penetration, </em>however slight, is sufficient to complete vaginal or anal intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"Ay\">\u201c(B) \u2018Sexual contact\u2019 means any <em>touching </em>of an erogenous zone of another, including without limitation the thigh, genitals, buttock, pubic region, or, if such person is a female, a breast, for the purpose of sexually arousing or gratifying either person.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b120-9\">In the trial court the attorney for the appellee moved to dismiss the indictment on the charge of felonious sexual penetration arguing that a finger was not an \u201cobject\u201d within the purview of R. C. 2907.12. In the alternative, he requested that the trial judge <em>reduce </em>the charge to the lesser included offense of gross sexual imposition pursuant to R. C. 2907.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">The trial judge perceptively noted the distinction between \u201ctouch<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>ing\u201d and \u201cpenetrating\u201d, and the necessity of giving the term \u201cobject\u201d its standard dictionary definition. The analysis of these issues by the trial judge reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"Ahn\">\u201cTHE COURT: As counsel are aware, I have had the benefit of the memorandum filed on April 8th by Mr. Hickey, and the argument of the prosecutor, Mr. Shiverdecker.</p>\n<p id=\"A2k\">\u201cIn making my finding, I think the significant things are two in number. It would be important to the argument advanced by Mr. Hickey if the facts presented here came clearly within the purview of another criminal section. General principles of construction would then dictate if it were questionable whether the conduct were covered by the section at hand, but clear that it was covered by another section, and it should be the other section that should govern.'</p>\n<p id=\"AEu\">\u201cThis gets us to the definitions of sexual conduct and sexual contact, both of which were covered in Mr. Hickey\u2019s memorandum. Sexual conduct does deal with penetration. The statute before me now deals with penetration.</p>\n<p id=\"AR_\">\u201cIt is argued the appropriate section would be that which proscribes \u2018gross sexual' imposition,\u2019 which deals with sexual contact, as has just been pointed out by the proso^-J-or.</p>\n<p id=\"AT-\">\n<em>\u201cSexual contact deals only with any touching of certain areas of the body, but not specifically penetration.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Azq\"><em>\u201cSo the legislature has in its statutory scheme seemed to have differentiated between penetration and the'mere touching; and the section argued by the defendant deals \u2018with the mere touching.' So that we don\u2019t havt the situation where we have a questionable application in front of us and conduct that is clearly covered by another section. </em>[Emphasis added.]</p>\n<p id=\"AQe\">\u201cThe second significant thing deals simply with the interpretation of the language, \u2018other object.\u2019 Of signifieanc\u00e9 here, I think, is, first of all, .the dictionary definition of \u2018object,\u2019 at least the Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary definition of \u2018object,\u2019' which includes something that is or is capable of being' seen, touched or otherwise sensed. Certainly, a .finger falls within that definition.</p>\n<p id=\"AT7\">\u201cSecondly, counsel at least are familiar with cases that have been before the Court of.\" Common Pleas in recent history involving, in one instance, an A-l .bottle and, in another'instance, a pork chop bone. Under the terms of this statute, if \u2018object\u2019 were to be tied strictly to \u2018apparatus or. instrument,\u2019 it might be argued that because neither an A-l bottle nor a p.orjs chop bone are an apparatus or an instrument, likewise not another object, and without the purview of the section.</p>\n<p id=\"AJg\">\u201cHowever, I think counsel would probably agree that it was the insertion of that kind of object that the legislature at least generally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>if not specifically, had in mind when they adopted this section. So if those kind of objects which are not apparatus or instrument can he within the purview of the definition, then I think other objects, including a finger, would likewise be within the definition.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b122-7\">R. C. 2907.05(B) provides that gross sexual imposition is normally a felony of the fourth degree except where the victim is under the age of 13 when it becomes a felony of the third degree. In contrast, R. C. 2907.12(B) provides that, in- most instances, felonious sexual penetration is a felony of the first degree. The statute further provides that if the victim is less than 13 years of age and the offender purposely compels the victim to submit by force or threat of force the punishment is life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">It is interesting to note that the General Assembly has provided the identical punishment for <em>both </em>felonious sexual penetration and rape. See R. C. 2907.02(B). The inference that arises from that apparent similarity is that both statutes are directed at the act of \u201cpenetration\u201d although the means to accomplish that result may he different. See the definition of \u201csexual conduct\u201d incorporated in R. C. 2907.02 and set forth in fn. 7, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b122-9\">For example, in Arizona the crime of sexual assault, found in Ariz. Rev. Stat., Section 13-1406 (1978), incorporates the definition of \u201csexual intercourse\u201d outlined in Section 13-1401(3). The latter statute defines that term as <em>\u201cpenetration </em>into the penis, vulva or anus <em>by any part of the body or by any object </em>* * (Emphasis added.)
