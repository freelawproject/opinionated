C. 2945.71 or granting a continuance (with facts demonstrating the necessity and reasonableness of such continuance).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">In the recent case of <em>Elmwood Place </em>v. <em>Denike </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St. 2d 427, this court held that \u201ca standardized <em>entry </em>form completed by the trial court * * * is alone insufficient to support a <em>sua sponte </em>continuance order substantially extending the date of trial beyond the mandatory time limitations of R. C. 2945.71(B)(2). # * The * * * evidence <em>of record </em>is insufficient to demonstrate the necessity of a continuance for purposes of appellate review. * * *\u201d (Emphasis added.) The court concluded that \u201cbecause the <em>sua sponte </em>continuance order of the trial court * * * was not supported by <em>sufficient detail contained in the record, </em>the judgment\u201d must be reversed. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b31-11\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Wentworth </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St. 2d 171, this court held that the <em>order </em>of a trial court continuing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>defendant\u2019s'case for trial beyond the statutory time limitations for reason of a crowded docket \u201cwithout further explication of such reason appearing in the record\u201d is insufficient to extend the time limitations of R. 0. 2945.71(B) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">In <em>Elmwood Place </em>and in <em>Wentworth </em>entries appear in the records giving reasons for the continuance of trial dates. In the present cause, however, there is <em>no entry </em>in the record ever setting a trial date within the time limits provided in R. C. 2945.71 or giving any reason for the date of defendant\u2019s trial being substantially beyond such time limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">This court has \u201cimposed upon the prosecution and the trial courts the mandatory duty of complying with R. C. 2945.71 through 2945.73\u201d and held that \u201cthe burden is # * * on the state to bring an accused to trial within the statutory period.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Singer </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St. 2d 103, 105, 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Therefore, in accordance with this court\u2019s holdings in <em>Elmwood Place </em>and <em>Wentworth, supra, </em>the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b32-9\">Celebrezze, C. J., W. Brown, P. Brown, Sweeney and McCormac, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b32-10\">Herbert, J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b32-11\">Holmes, J., not participating.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b32-12\">McCormac, J., of the Tenth Appellate District, sitting for Locher, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b31-12\">The record does show statements by counsel for the state concerning other litigation in which defense counsel was involved, and remarks by the trial court as to causes for the delay in trial. Nowhere, however, is there <em>any entry </em>granting a continuance in the setting of a trial date.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
