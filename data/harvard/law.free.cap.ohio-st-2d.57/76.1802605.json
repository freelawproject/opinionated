Util. Comm. </em>(1931), 123 Ohio St. 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">It is uneontroverted that appellant has failed to file \u00e1n application for rehearing of the commission\u2019s order of January 11, 1978. Thus, an appeal from that order by appellant is improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">Further, appellant was never made a party to the December 7, 1977, order'from which it has appealed. <em>In Harrison </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1938), 134 Ohio St. 346, 347, this court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b105-12\">\u201cUnless a statute otherwise, provides it is fundamental that no one can appeal from an order [of the commission] to which he is not a party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-13\">R. C. 4903.13 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b105-14\">\u201cA final order made by the public utilities commission shall be reversed, vacated, or modified by the supreme court on appeal, if, upon consideration of the record, such court is of the opinion that such order was unlawful or unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-15\">\u201cThe proceeding to obt\u00e1in such reversal, vacation, or modification shall be by notice of appeal, filed with the public utilities commission <em>by any party to the proceeding </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number><em>before it, </em>against the commission, setting forth the order appealed from and the errors complained of. * * (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b106-6\">Celebrezze, C.
