Great Lakes brought this action seeking a declaratory judgment that it has no duty to defend or indemnify the Bank against the Huffs' claims under the Policy.

He shot and killed the Bank's president and then shot a teller who resisted his demand for money. He then took Mrs. Huff hostage at gunpoint. The robber ordered Mrs. Huff to drive him in a stolen vehicle and forced her to take him several miles as he sat in the passenger seat with a gun pointed at her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Law enforcement chasing the stolen vehicle were informed that Mrs. Huff was a hostage. After law enforcement stopped the vehicle, Mrs. Huff ran, but the robber caught up to her, put his arm around her neck and used her as a human shield. Law enforcement and the robber exchanged fire, during which law enforcement bullets struck Mrs. Huff approximately nine (9) times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Huffs allege that the Bank owed a duty to Mrs. Huff as a business invitee, that it failed to follow industry standards to protect its customers from such a foreseeable situation, and that its failures, negligence, and reckless disregard for her rights caused her injuries. The Huffs seek compensation for,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , Mrs. Huff's bodily injuries and emotional distress.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After the Huffs filed their state court lawsuit, the Bank demanded that Great Lakes indemnify and defend it against the Huffs' claims. Great Lakes is presently defending the Bank in the state court litigation under a reservation of rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      The Policy\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Policy at issue is an occurrence policy that was in effect from March 6, 2015 to March 6, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Policy provides in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   COVERAGE A BODILY INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   1.

This exclusion was in effect on the day Mrs. Huff was taken hostage and shot and is a main point of contention in the instant motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Policy also excludes punitive damages as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   3. EXLCUSION - PUNITIVE DAMAGES\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   This insurance does not apply to any claim or indemnification for punitive or exemplary damages. If a suit seeking both compensatory and punitive or exemplary damages has been brought against you for a claim covered by this policy, we will provide defense for such action. We will not have any obligation to pay for any costs, interests or damages attributable to punitive or exemplary damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    III. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Great Lakes argues that: (1) the Huffs' damages were not caused by an \"occurrence\" as that term is defined in the Policy; (2) the Huffs' claims are not covered under the Policy, as their damages were caused by an assault, a battery, and/or actions taken to prevent or suppress an assault or battery; and (3) the Policy does not provide coverage for any punitive damages. The Bank argues that the assault or battery exclusion is ambiguous and that it reasonably expected the Policy to provide coverage for harms suffered by its business invitees. The Bank concedes that the Policy does not provide coverage for punitive damages.

The Bank argues, however, that it is ambiguous because it \"fails to distinguish and determine what, if any, effect the intentional or negligent nature of an act has on its terms.\" The Bank argues further that \"[w]here intentionality is not present in the acts resulting in Ms. Huff's injuries, this ambiguity should be construed in favor of the insured Bank.\" The court does not agree that there is any ambiguity. The Policy clearly excludes coverage for any claims \"arising out of assault or battery, or out of any act or omission in connection with assault or battery, or with the prevention or suppression of an assault or battery\" and any claims \"arising out of charges or allegations of negligent hiring, training, placement or supervision with respect [thereto].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Mrs. Huff's injuries clearly were caused by the intentional battery by the bank robber and by the intentional acts of law enforcement trying to prevent or suppress the bank robber from further intentional battery. To the extent that the Bank could be found negligent for not hiring enough security to prevent such an event, that is also excluded. To the extent that the Bank could also be found negligent for having too many entrances, that does not change the fact that Mrs. Huff's injuries were caused by an assault and battery, coverage for which is excluded under the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Accordingly, as the Policy excludes coverage for the Huffs' claims, Great Lakes has no duty to defend or indemnify the Bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
