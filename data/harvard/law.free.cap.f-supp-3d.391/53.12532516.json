HOWELL, Chief Judge\n   The plaintiffs in this consolidated case are seventy-five long-term care hospitals (\"LTCHs\") located in twenty-six states seeking a total of $20,325,174 in reimbursements from the Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\"), in connection with the plaintiffs' provision of inpatient care, over the period of 2005 through 2010, for patients eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid (\"dual-eligible patients\"), who generally are indigent. Prior to 2007, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") had reimbursed LTCHs for their dual-eligible patients' unpaid co-insurance and deductible obligations (\"bad debt\") without requiring the LTCHs to bill state Medicaid programs for a formal determination of how much of that bad debt would be covered by state Medicaid programs. Billing state Medicaid programs was regarded as unnecessary, because the states were not liable for Medicare bad debts incurred at LTCHs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In 2007, however, CMS abruptly began denying LTCHs reimbursement for dual-eligible patients' bad debts unless the LTCHs had both billed their state Medicaid programs\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   received a specific document from those state Medicaid programs called a State Remittance Advice (\"RA\")-to prove that the state Medicaid programs were, in fact, not liable for any portion of the bad debts. This requirement that LTCHs bill the state Medicaid program to confirm that the state will not pay the Medicare cost-sharing amounts on behalf of a dual-eligible patient is known as CMS's \"must-bill policy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   At the time of CMS's change in the must-bill policy, no means were available to satisfy CMS's new requirements because the LTCHs were not enrolled in their respective state Medicaid programs, and states would neither process bills nor issue RAs to non-participating providers. Moreover, when the LTCHs attempted to enroll in their respective state Medicaid programs, some states rejected the LTCHs as unrecognized provider types under their state Medicaid programs. When the LTCHs were eventually able to enroll successfully in their state Medicaid programs, obtaining the requisite RAs remained impossible because states would not process claims for prior fiscal years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The plaintiffs claim,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that CMS could not change the requirements for Medicare bad debt reimbursement, at least as to non-participating Medicaid providers, without conducting notice-and-comment rulemaking, as required by the Medicare Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395hh(a)(2).

This policy change in October 1, 2003 was clearly not understood by CMS's own Intermediary to apply universally to all providers, however, because shortly thereafter, on October 15, 2003, the CMS Intermediary issued a newsletter stating that \"[i]f a provider can demonstrate that neither the [state Medicaid program] nor State or local law requires the welfare agency to pay the Medicare deductible or coinsurance amount, then the provider can be reimbursed for this amount without billing the welfare\n    agency.\" S1-AR at 97 (Providers' PRRB Brief at 30 (quoting S1-AR at 401 (CMS's Oct. 15, 2003 Newsletter))).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    In any event, as the PRRB made clear, \"there is no legal requirement that a Medicare-certified hospital enroll in Medicaid as a condition of participation in Medicare or to obtain Medicare reimbursement,\" S1-AR at 54 (2010 PRRB Decision at 8), despite the fact that CMS's new, or revived, must-bill policy imposed such a legal requirement, by denying reimbursement for dual eligible bad debt claims of non-Medicaid participating providers that were unable to provide an RA.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    <strong>\n     3.\n     <em>\n      Post-Denial Attempts by Plaintiffs to Obtain RAs and to Enroll in Medicaid\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    In response to the first Adjustment Reports denying reimbursement for dual-eligible bad debts due to the lack of RAs, the\n    <em>\n     Select I\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     II\n    </em>\n    Plaintiffs began submitting bills to state Medicaid programs in which they were not enrolled, in an attempt to obtain RAs.\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n    The\n    <em>\n     Select I\n    </em>\n    Plaintiffs first submitted a batch of 402 claims in twenty states, followed by a second batch of 102 bills in six states after the instant litigation began.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pls.'

Williams ed., 10th ed. 1947)). Notwithstanding the Supreme Court's hesitation in endorsing the D.C. Circuit's definition of \"substantive legal standard,\" this Court, being bound by the law of this Circuit, must apply the Circuit's definition.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    A comparison of the only two cases decided in this Circuit to analyze the term illustrates why a substantive legal standard is at issue in this case. In\n    <em>\n     Allina II\n    </em>\n    , CMS had changed the formula used to calculate payments to disproportionate share hospitals (\"DSH\"), i.e., hospitals which treat a higher percentage of low-income patients, which had the effect of lowering payments to such hospitals. CMS's formula \"define[d] the scope of hospitals' legal rights to payment for treating low-income patients.\"\n    <em>\n     Allina II\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276043\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/863/937/\">\n     863 F.3d at 943\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Therefore, by changing the formula, the Circuit concluded, CMS had made a change to a substantive legal standard within the meaning of the Medicare Act.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    By contrast, in\n    <em>\n     Clarian Health West, LLC v. Hargan\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264332\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/878/346/#p354\">\n     878 F.3d 346\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (D.C. Cir. 2017), the Circuit held that CMS's statement of the circumstances under which CMS Intermediaries were required to report hospitals to CMS for the reconciliation of certain prospective payments the hospitals had received, called \"outlier payments,\" with the hospitals' actual costs, was not a substantive legal standard under \u00a7 1395hh(a)(2) because the instructions \"merely set forth an enforcement policy that determines when [the Intermediaries] will report hospitals for reconciliation.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264332\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/878/346/#p354\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264332\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/878/346/#p354\">\n     at 355-56\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

That is, in contrast to\n    <em>\n     Allina II\n    </em>\n    , CMS has not attempted to change the amount owed to providers. Moreover, the mere fact that failure to comply with the RA requirement could result in the plaintiffs receiving no\n    bad debt reimbursements at all,\n    <em>\n     cf.\n    </em>\n    Pls.' Mem. at 64 (\"The Plaintiffs' legal entitlement to bad debt payments was abruptly denied.\"), does not alone remove the RA requirement from the realm of procedural rather than substantive law, as failure to comply with procedural requirements can of course also carry severe consequences, including complete loss of an otherwise valid claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Yet, closer analysis confirms that this case falls squarely within the holding of\n    <em>\n     Allina II.\n    </em>\n    When CMS instructed Intermediaries to apply the must-bill policy and RA requirement to all providers, the plaintiffs were non-participants in state Medicaid programs and could not comply. Further, the plaintiffs in many instances were not permitted to enroll in state Medicaid programs or, if permitted to enroll, were out-of-time to submit the dual-eligible patients' bad debts. To bill state Medicaid programs and obtain RAs, providers must now necessarily participate in state Medicaid programs, \"even though [Medicaid participation] is not a condition of participation or payment for purposes of Medicare reimbursement.\" Pls.' Mem. at 34;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    S1-AR at 54 (2010 PRRB Decision at 8). To participate in state Medicaid programs, providers must enter into legal contracts with states.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Spectrum Health Continuing Care Grp. v. Anna Marie Bowling Irrecoverable Trust\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8950916\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/410/304/#p313\">\n     410 F.3d 304\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 313 (6th Cir. 2005) (\"A health-care provider is not required to participate in the Medicaid program, but rather voluntarily contracts with the state to provide services to Medicaid-eligible patients in return for reimbursement from the state at the specified rates.\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    As a result of CMS's implementation of the must-bill policy to the plaintiffs, compounded by the RA requirement, CMS changed not just the steps that existing LTCHs must take, vis-\u00e0-vis CMS, to be reimbursed, but also changed whether such entities must form contracts with third parties, the state Medicaid programs. Deeming CMS's imposition of this new obligation a mere change in procedure, as opposed to a change in substantive law, would be out of place. This new requirement of providing an RA, even if superficially appearing to be merely procedural, had significant substantive consequences for the contractual obligations that LTCHs had to undertake. The RA requirement has essentially changed the eligibility criteria for reimbursement under the Medicare Act for dual-eligible patients, by requiring provider participation in the state Medicaid program. This change makes the RA requirement \"substantive.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Remarkably, HHS asserts that \"Plaintiffs need not participate in Medicaid to comply with the must-bill policy,\" Def.'s Mem. at 24;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Reply at 4 (\"Plaintiffs are not required to participate in Medicaid in order to receive Medicare reimbursement ....\"), a seemingly broad proposition, but one that HHS's own briefing later indicates means only that providers need not 'fully' participate in Medicaid, because states \"are 'required to permit the provider to enroll for the limited purpose of obtaining adjudication of the [Qualified Medicare Beneficiary] cost-sharing amount,' \" Def.'s Mem. at 24 (quoting S1-AR at 1098-1101 (CMS Informational Bulletin (June 7, 2013)). In its reply, HHS more explicitly admits that \"[i]n order for the state to return an RA, it would have to be able to identify the provider, which a state could determine\n    <em>\n     only if the provider was actually enrolled in Medicaid\n    </em>\n    at least for the limited purposes of obtaining RAs from the state.\" Def.'s Reply at 9 (emphasis added). Tellingly, HHS cites to nothing in the record dated prior to 2013 that articulates to the state Medicaid programs an obligation to enroll providers for the limited purpose of issuing RAs.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def.'s\n    Mem. at 24 (citing CMS Informational Bulletin (June 7, 2013)). The plaintiffs contend that CMS is misrepresenting the level of Medicaid participation required and point out that \"states refuse to allow the Plaintiffs to bill if they are not enrolled as full-fledged Medicaid providers.\" Pls.' Mem. at 40. Irrespective of whether best characterized as 'full' or 'limited,' CMS changed a substantive legal standard by newly requiring LTCHs to assume some form of Medicaid participation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Whatever reasons CMS offers for imposing the must-bill policy and RA requirement on non-Medicaid-participating LTCHs, the agency has not argued that these requirements are compelled by the Medicare Act itself. Rather, CMS is filling a \"gap\" as to how best to administer the Medicare program. As the Supreme Court has made clear, however, CMS \"can't evade its notice-and-comment obligation under \u00a7 1395hh(a)(2),\" just because the agency is changing a \" 'gap'-filing policy.\"\n    <em>\n     Allina Health Servs.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12620124\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/1804/\">\n     139 S. Ct. at 1817\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Thus, when CMS imposed the RA requirement, it changed a \"substantive legal standard\"-state Medicaid participation-that the LTCHs had to satisfy for reimbursement to occur, and CMS was required to conduct notice-and-comment rulemaking pursuant to \u00a7 1395hh(a)(2).\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    <strong>\n     IV. CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    CMS created a bureaucratic nightmare by requiring a certain type of paperwork that the plaintiffs simply could not provide without sufficient advanced notice, and by obstinately continuing to deny reimbursement claims rather than working to find a reasonable solution in conjunction with the state Medicaid programs. For many of the plaintiffs, this has already been a twelve-year journey to obtain reimbursement for dual-eligible patients' bad debts. Indeed, this whole affair is likely just the sort of scenario Congress sought to avoid by enacting the notice-and-comment requirement of \u00a7 1395hh(a)(2), ensuring that all parties would receive sufficient advanced notice of meaningful changes to reimbursement requirements. At any rate, without satisfying the notice-and-comment obligation of \u00a7 1395hh(a)(2), CMS could not, and indeed cannot, impose the must-bill policy and RA requirement on the plaintiffs for the period when they were non-Medicaid-participating providers. On remand, the Administrator is directed promptly to reconsider whether, absent the must-bill and RA requirements, the plaintiffs are entitled to bad debt reimbursement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    An Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion will be filed contemporaneously.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"3\">\n    <p id=\"p-84\">\n     The Secretary cites a provision from CMS's 1985 Medicare Intermediary Manual as evidence that the must-bill policy has existed at least since then.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Def.'s Mem. at 28-29 (citing Def.'s Mem., Ex.

The Manual provision cited by the defendant stating that \"[i]f the State has been billed, but did not pay the amount due, determine if there is a written notice of rejection in the patient's file,\" suggests that although\n     <em>\n      some\n     </em>\n     form of written notice was required, CMS did not at that time have a requirement that the sole acceptable documentation reflecting that the state Medicaid program had no obligation to pay the bad debt was an RA.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"4\">\n    <p id=\"p-85\">\n     Four Administrative Records have been filed in this consolidated case.
