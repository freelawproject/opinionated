McKesson, Cardinal Health, Inc., and AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation (\"Moving Defendants\") have filed a Joint Motion to Stay Proceedings (Docket No. 29), to which the plaintiffs have filed a Response (Docket No. 41).

They filed suit against the defendants-a number of pharmaceutical companies, pharmacies, clinics, and individuals-in Cumberland County Circuit Court, alleging liability arising out of the defendants' actions related to opioid medications, including, in particular, many defendants' alleged filling of suspicious orders for opioid medications. The plaintiffs have pleaded two causes of action under the Tennessee Drug Dealer Liability Act (\"TDDLA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2029-38-101\">\n    Tenn.

On May 3, 2019, one of the defendants, McKesson Corporation, filed a Notice of Removal removing the case to federal court. (Docket No. 1.) As the basis for removal, McKesson asserted that, although the plaintiffs have pleaded only state-law causes of action, their claims \"arise under federal law\" for jurisdictional purposes because they involve duties under the federal Controlled Substances Act (\"CSA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20801\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (Docket No. 1 \u00b6 23.)

Currently pending before Judge Dan Polster of the Northern District Ohio is multidistrict litigation (\"MDL\") that includes more than 1,800 opioid-related actions, including several originally filed in this district. Contemporaneously with the removal, one of the defendants, Purdue Pharma L.P., filed a notice with the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (\"JPML\") seeking to have this case transferred into that MDL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 10, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a Motion to Remand (Docket No. 18) in this court, arguing that the removal of the case to federal court was improper. Shortly thereafter, the Moving Defendants filed a Joint Motion to Stay Proceedings (Docket No. 29), arguing that the court should stay any consideration of the remand motion until the JPML determines whether the case will be transferred into the MDL. On May 16, 2019, the JPML entered a Conditional Transfer Order (Docket No. 44), proposing that the case be transferred into the MDL. Consistently with JPML Rules, the transfer will not take effect until, at the earliest, its entry on the docket of the U.S. District Court of the Northern District of Ohio. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) If a party opposes the transfer, the transfer will be stayed indefinitely.

The court, the Moving Defendants argue, should follow the lead of those courts and judges and allow the issue of remand to be resolved either by the MDL court or by this court after a transfer to the MDL has been rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   This court does not deny that staying consideration of a remand motion pending an MDL transfer decision may often be appropriate. \"As other district courts within the Sixth Circuit have recognized, the 'general rule is for federal courts to defer ruling on pending motions to remand in MDL litigation until after the [JPML] has transferred the case.' \"\n   <em>\n    Beshear\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203040492\">\n    2016 WL 3040492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Kelly v.

Ohio May 29, 2013) ). The fact that courts usually handle these matters one way, however, does not relieve this court of the necessity of considering whether a stay is warranted here. Indeed, the JPML's own rules explicitly make clear that no stay is mandated here, leaving the decision on how to proceed up to the original district court. JPML R. 2.1(d).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on the court's balancing of the factors relevant to whether a stay should be granted, the court concludes that proceeding with consideration of the plaintiffs' motion is warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   First, the risk of hardship resulting from a postponement of a jurisdictional determination is great. If transferred, this case will join a veritable sea of others in the MDL court. There is no guarantee of when that heavily burdened court would be able to address the important jurisdictional issues raised here. This court, however, is prepared to address those jurisdictional issues now. The prospect of indefinitely postponing a jurisdictional ruling is especially troubling, given that this case involves Tennessee public officials, charged with representing the interests of the citizens of their respective judicial districts, seeking access to the state's courts to assert claims under the state's laws. There is nothing inherently objectionable about a federal court considering state-law claims involving state and local officials, as long\n   as it does so pursuant to its limited constitutional and statutory jurisdiction. If that jurisdiction is lacking, however, the case should be returned to the state courts as soon as reasonably practicable. Otherwise, the federal courts will not only waste the parties' time but impair the state's interest in the administration of justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Staying matters while the JPML determines whether to transfer a case can sometimes serve the interests of judicial economy by preventing a district court from \"needlessly expend[ing] its energies familiarizing itself with the intricacies of a case that w[ill] be heard by another judge\" or making decisions that \"will most likely have to be replicated by the judge that is assigned to handle the consolidated litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Rivers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1135217\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/980/1358/#p1360\">\n    980 F. Supp. at 1360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Neither of those concerns, however, is present here. Resolving the discrete jurisdictional and procedural objections raised by the plaintiffs will not require this court to immerse itself in the intricacies of the case in full, and addressing the issue of jurisdiction now may, if anything, save the potential transferee court the unnecessary labor and attention that would accompany dealing with a case that the federal courts should not be considering in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The interests of judicial economy are furthered by putting a case, as expeditiously as possible, in a court that has the jurisdiction to resolve it. It would not be a good use of judicial resources for the JPML to devote its time and attention to a transfer from one federal court to another, if the ultimate legal reality is that neither court has or can have jurisdiction. Nor would it be a good use of the transferee court's resources for that court to have to deal with the intake and processing of a case only to realize, later, that the case should be in state court. \"It would be a waste of judicial resources for [a] case to proceed\" in the federal courts if, ultimately, a federal court is not \"the appropriate court to consider plaintiffs' claims.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. United States Envtl. Prot. Agency\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:15-CV-2467,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205117699\">\n    2015 WL 5117699\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (S.D. Ohio Sept. 1, 2015). This court can imagine few greater wastes of a court's resources than consideration of a case that the court has no jurisdiction to decide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Moving Defendants argue that declining to stay the court's consideration of the remand motion would cause it significant prejudice by potentially placing this case on a \"separate track\" from the numerous other opioid-related suits that are already being litigated in the MDL. (Docket No. 30 at 8.) But that is a risk of the remand motion, not a risk related to the denial of a stay; a post-transfer remand would result in cases on different tracks just as much as a pre-transfer remand would. More importantly, the Moving Defendants' argument loses sight of the fact that, if this case is not properly in the federal courts (either because we lack jurisdiction or because the removal was defective), then the case\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   be on a different track. Different litigation under different laws in different states is inherent to the federal system embraced by the limited jurisdiction of the federal courts. The court, accordingly, will not stay its consideration of the plaintiffs' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B.

As those courts have recognized, the fact that opioid abuse is an issue of national importance that is addressed, to some degree, by federal law in no way undermines the power of states to craft independent responses that do not rely on federal law to impose liability. When a\n    state has done so-as Tennessee has done here (by the plaintiffs' theory of the case)-then the appropriate forum for such causes of action are state courts, unless a filing or removing party can establish a recognized basis for federal jurisdiction. Because McKesson has not done so, this court will remand the case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      2. Consent of All Defendants\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Moreover, even if jurisdictional issues were not fatal to the removal, McKesson's decision to remove the case without the express consent of all defendants was procedurally improper and would independently warrant a remand. \"The rule of unanimity requires that in order for a notice of removal to be properly before the court, all defendants who have been served or otherwise properly joined in the action must either join in the removal, or ... consent to the removal.\"\n    <em>\n     Brierly v. Alusuisse Flexible Packaging, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11544512\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/184/527/\">\n     184 F.3d 527\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 533 n.3 (6th Cir. 1999). The plaintiffs have identified four defendants who did not consent to removal: Paul Haskins, David Florence, Lynnville Family Medical Center, LLC (\"LFMC\"), and the Center for Advanced Medicine, LLC (\"CAM\"). McKesson argues that three of those defendants-Florence, Haskins, and LFMC-were not properly served and that the fourth, CAM, is a nominal defendant whose consent was not required because it is a defunct business entity.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    With regard to at least one of the allegedly unserved defendants, however-Haskins-McKesson seemingly concedes that it does not actually have any direct evidence that he was not served when the action was commenced. (Docket No. 54 at 6 n.4.) A Declaration by one of McKesson's attorneys suggests, at most, that Haskins, when contacted by McKesson's counsel, was \"unable to confirm\" service and eventually stopped responding to McKesson's requests for consent. (Docket No. 55 \u00b6 7.) The plaintiffs, however, have produced a Return of Service suggesting that Haskins was indeed personally served. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Docket No. 20-1.) The Return of Services states, in a printed header, that it was \"Served On: NATHAN PAUL HASKINS,\" and the private process server has certified, in pen, that the summons was served \"by PERSONAL SERVICE AT [address].\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1.) McKesson argues that the Return of Service is defective because it violates the requirement that proof of service \"shall identify the person served and shall describe the manner of service.\" Tenn. R. Civ. P. 4.03(a). Specifically, McKesson takes issue with the fact that the section of the form filled out in pen by the process server does not expressly clarify that, as the header suggests, the personal service was on Haskins himself. McKesson cites no Tennessee case law in support of its argument that this supposed technical deficiency rendered service insufficient. Absent more, McKesson has not shown that a lack of service or defective service precluded it from having to obtain consent to removal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    McKesson argues, in the alternative, that Haskins is a nominal defendant with no actual stake in the litigation.

(\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Docket No. 1-3 \u00b6\u00b6 425-28, 653-54, 676.) He is, therefore, genuinely adverse to the plaintiffs and potentially liable for damages. Moreover, it is clear that the corporate defendants intend to defend themselves aggressively in this litigation, and there can be little doubt that their defenses will include the argument that the true parties responsible for opioid drugs finding their way onto the illegal market are low-level, criminal dealers such as Haskins. It is hard to imagine why McKesson should be permitted to choose its preferred forum for litigation by arguing that Haskins is a mere incidental entity, only to heap all culpability onto him and others like him when the parties reach the merits stage.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    McKesson argues that Haskins is nevertheless a nominal party because he has, so far, failed to contest the claims against him, and the plaintiffs have not yet sought an entry of default or discovery from him. Haskins' inaction, however-either because he has simply failed to look after his own interests or because he has made a strategic decision to lie low and attempt to piggyback onto the success of his presumably much wealthier codefendants-does not negate his very real stakes in this litigation. The plaintiffs' decision not to seek an entry of default while so many other claims remain pending, moreover, has no bearing on the nature of the claims that Haskins faces. Accordingly, even if the court concluded that it had jurisdiction, it would remand the case based on the lack of unanimous consent to removal.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      C.

While the court was ultimately unpersuaded by McKesson's assertion of federal jurisdiction, the complex interrelationship of state and federal laws in this area-along with the plaintiffs' decision to include express allegations of CSA violations in their Second Amended Complaint-provided McKesson a fair argument for federal jurisdiction. Moreover, McKesson's difficulties in obtaining consent from all defendants were not the result of a lack of trying, and it was not unreasonable to hope that the court might conclude that the lack of consent from Haskins was, in light of the circumstances, excusable. Ultimately, it is, in the view of the court, fair and equitable to allow the individual parties to shoulder their respective attorney's fees at this stage.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      CONCLUSION\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    For the foregoing reasons, the Moving Defendants' Joint Motion to Stay Proceedings (Docket No. 29) is hereby\n    <strong>\n     DENIED\n    </strong>\n    , the plaintiffs' Motion to Remand (Docket No. 18) is\n    <strong>\n     GRANTED\n    </strong>\n    on the merits and\n    <strong>\n     DENIED\n    </strong>\n    with regard to their request for attorney's fees, and this case is\n    <strong>\n     REMANDED\n    </strong>\n    to the Circuit Court of Cumberland County.
