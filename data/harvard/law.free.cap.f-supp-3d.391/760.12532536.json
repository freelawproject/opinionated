IHF is a handbag company that owns the Mona B trademark and designs and produces goods under the Mona B name. Defendants Khemchand Handicrafts (\"KH\") and Myra Bag are incorporated and headquartered in India. IHF alleges it met with the owner of KH, Defendant Khemchand Katri (\"Katri\"), at a trade fair in India and engaged with KH to mass produce and supply Mona B handbags from April 2013 to July 2016. This relationship involved the exchange of IHF's proprietary information, such as product design files, marketing materials, and other confidential information. IHF alleges that in 2016 the supplier relationship with KH ended and shortly after, in April 2017, Plaintiffs noticed a rebrand of KH under Myra Bag. Specifically, Mona B alleges that KH and Katri copied its' designs to produce substantially similar bags.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Based on these allegations, Plaintiffs filed a Complaint against Myra Bag, KH and Katri (together, the \"Indian Defendants\") on May 2, 2018, alleging claims for Copyright Infringement,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20101\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 106 and 501 et seq., Trademark and/or Trade Dress Infringement,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201114\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and the Lanham Act \u00a7 43(a), False Designation of Origin/ Unfair Competition or Misleading Advertising,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), Unfair and Deceptive Acts or Practices, O.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1345.02 and 4165.02, and Tortious Interference with Business Expectancy.

Indeed, presented with a properly supported Rule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, a district court has three options: \"it may decide the motion upon affidavits alone; it may permit discovery in aid of deciding the motion; or it may conduct an evidentiary hearing to resolve any apparent factual questions.\"\n   <em>\n    Theunissen v.

When the court is ruling without an evidentiary hearing, the plaintiff cannot rely on the pleadings alone, but must provide specific facts to establish personal jurisdiction.

Ohio Mar. 17, 2009). According to Plaintiffs, Markwest's relationship with UDW Minnesota, whose fulfillment center is located in Ohio, is evidence that Markwest transacts business in Ohio. This is a tenuous connection as Markwest receives electronic purchase orders from UDW's buyer in Minnesota and is not responsible for shipments to and from the Ohio fulfillment center. \"Markwest does not buy product from UDW in Ohio [and] does not ship product to UDW in Ohio.\" Doc #: 53 at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiffs also fail to produce any evidence regarding Markwest's connection to vendors Gooseberry, Michel, Malden, and Artistic Reflections or sales made at the Minneapolis Mart. Plaintiffs assert that Markwest has \"business relationship[s]\" with these Ohio vendors, rendering Markwest subject to personal jurisdiction in Ohio. Doc #: 30 at 8. However, Plaintiffs have produced no evidence indicating what connection Markwest has with these vendors or how these connections are related to their Complaint. Accordingly, Plaintiffs have not met their burden to show Markwest is subject to personal jurisdiction under Section (A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Section (A)(2) confers jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant \"contracting to supply services or goods\" in Ohio. Plaintiffs allege that Markwest's electronic purchase orders with UDW Minnesota constitute \"contracts\" under Ohio law and thereby confer jurisdiction because the court in\n   <em>\n    ALTA Analytics, Inc. v. Muuss\n   </em>\n   held that \" 'transacting business' subsumes the narrower act of contracting in Ohio.\" Doc #: 49 at 4 (citing\n   <em>\n    ALTA Analytics, Inc. v.

Markwest correctly notes that this is a misstatement of the law in\n   <em>\n    ALTA Analytics\n   </em>\n   , as the court in that case held that jurisdiction requires \"not only the act of contracting itself, but also: (1) whether ... the 'necessary nexus' exists between Defendants' business dealings in Ohio and the matters at issue in this case and (2) whether the cause of\n   action arises from the contract.\"\n   <em>\n    ALTA Analytics, Inc\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"643487\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/75/773/#p779\">\n    75 F.

Markwest's \"contracts\" with UDW Minnesota have\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   connection to Ohio and Plaintiffs have not shown how these purchase orders give rise to the allegations in the Complaint. Further, \"the actual transaction of business\n   <em>\n    in-state\n   </em>\n   is a prerequisite to the exercise of long-arm jurisdiction under \u00a7 2307.382(A)(2).\"\n   <em>\n    Kobill Airways Ltd. v.

Further, Plaintiffs have failed to show that Markwest derives substantial revenue from goods used or consumed or services rendered in Ohio. Generally, sales amounting to less than 5% of total sales are not considered substantial revenue. See\n   <em>\n    Hoover v. Robeson Indus.

Markwest's total commission from sales to UDW in Minnesota amounts to less than 1% of Markwest's annual commissions.

As described in the preceding long-arm analyses, Plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden to produce specific evidence that Markwest sold the infringing Myra Bag products in Ohio. In\n   <em>\n    Campinha-Bacote v.

Ex. 6. Similarly, Plaintiffs allege that from January 1, 2016 to December 7, 2018, NEST sold its products (in total, not just Myra Bag products) to thirty-three businesses in Ohio, with sales amounting to approximately $71,000.00. Ex. 7. Cathy and NEST counter that the only orders with any connection to Ohio were made by representatives of Ohio companies who visited their Dallas, Texas and Las Vegas, Nevada showrooms, respectively. Cathy and NEST also indicate that even though they act as sales representatives for Ohio-based companies, their sales territories do not include Ohio. Exs. C, D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiffs have failed to show that the Court has jurisdiction over these Defendants under Sections (A)(1) and (A)(2) of the Long-Arm statute because they have failed to show proximate cause, i.e., that these Defendants sold infringing Myra Bag products in Ohio. \"The Court will not assume that such sales occur just because defendan[t] ... has no reason to doubt that such a sale occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    Bridgeport Music, Inc. v.

Thus, purchases made by Ohioans in out-of-state showrooms (or products sold outside of Ohio by Defendants in their capacity as independent sales representatives) are insufficient to confer jurisdiction over them in Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Section (A)(3) provides jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant that \"caus[es] tortious injury by an act or omission in\" Ohio. Again, Plaintiffs have provided no evidence that these Defendants sold infringing products in Ohio. Rather, Plaintiffs argue that the \"[s]ales of Myra Bag goods, even if not directly infringing those Mona B products set forth in the Complaint, caused tortious injury in Ohio by\n   <em>\n    establishing a foothold of the Myra Bag brand throughout the stream of commerce in Ohio\n   </em>\n   , thereby ensuring that Ohio consumers will purchase the infringing products.\" Doc #: 50 at 10 (emphasis added). Plaintiffs have not provided, and the Court is unaware of, any case law supporting the proposition that \"establishing a foothold\" of a brand in Ohio that\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   someday include infringing products is sufficient to confer jurisdiction in Ohio. Thus, Plaintiffs have not met their burden to show the Court has Long-Arm jurisdiction over these Defendants under Section (A)(3). Plaintiffs' argument is no different when it comes to analyzing jurisdiction under Section (A)(4), thus, Plaintiffs have failed to show the Court has personal jurisdiction over these Defendants under Section (A)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Court does not need to conduct a Due Process inquiry for Cathy or NEST as Plaintiffs have not met their burden to prove that the Ohio Long-Arm statute confers jurisdiction over them.

Defendant CLA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Defendant CLA appears to concede long-arm jurisdiction by confining its argument to Due Process jurisdiction only. Doc #: 33-1, at 8 n.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that from May 1, 2012 to December 27, 2018, CLA sold its products (in total, not just Myra Bag products) to more than seven hundred Ohio vendors, accumulating over $4,000,000.00 in sales. Ex. 1. Plaintiffs also allege that CLA made more than 2,300 sales of Myra Bag products in Ohio and that seven of the allegedly infringing Myra Bag products were sold by CLA to Ohio. Ex. 2; Ex. 3; Ex. 5. Plaintiffs further allege that CLA has three independent contractors who sell Myra Bag products in Ohio. Ex. 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   CLA asserts that it does not have a mailing address or office in Ohio, it has no employees or agents in Ohio, and it owns no accounts or real property in Ohio. Ex. F, \u00b6\u00b62-6. CLA does sell to three independent contractors in Ohio, but it has not trained or visited them in Ohio, and it has no control over the prices or types of Myra Bag products that these independent contractors sell in Ohio.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b613. When CLA's independent contractors sell Myra Bag products, the orders and customer payments go directly to Myra Bag, which then ships the order directly to the Ohio customer.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b67. CLA states that is a sales representative for one vendor located in Ohio, but its territory does not include Ohio.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Court finds that it does not have general jurisdiction over CLA because CLA is at home in Michigan, where it is incorporated and headquartered. The only tangible connection to Ohio is via independent contractors over whom it has little control, and via one Ohio vendor whose products it represents outside the State of Ohio. This is not an \"exceptional case\" where CLA's operations render it at home in Ohio. \"Maintaining extensive operations within a state alone does not satisfy the general-jurisdiction exception.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BNSF\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604332\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1549/#p1558\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (although BNSF operated one of its automotive facilities in Montana, had more than 2,000 Montana employees, and had more than 2,000 miles of Montana railroad tracks, BNSF is not subject to general jurisdiction in Montana).\"\n   <em>\n    Maclin v.

Here, Plaintiffs contend that CLA sold at least seven of the allegedly infringing Myra Bag products in Ohio.
