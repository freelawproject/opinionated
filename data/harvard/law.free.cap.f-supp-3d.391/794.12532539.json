CRENSHAW, JR., CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This is a case about glider semi-trucks and, more particularly, whether excise taxes are properly imposed on the sale of those trucks. A glider truck is built from a kit. Glider kits consisting of new tractor parts, including such things as the cab, frame, sheet metal, mounting brackets and steering gear, are produced by original equipment manufacturers like Peterbilt, Kenworth, Freightliner, and Western Star. Powertrains and other necessary parts are then added and the glider trucks are offered for sale, usually at a price that is less that 75% of the cost of a new truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Fitzgerald Truck Parts and Sales, LLC (\"FTPS\") is a glider kit assembler, and has been for 30 years. (Doc. No. 1, Complaint \u00b6 13). FTPS's gliders \"begin as worn or wrecked highway tractors, the engines and transmissions of which are capable of being repaired (i.e., rebuilt).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18). When a glider truck is assembled and sold to a customer (usually an independent owner-operator or a small to mid-size trucking fleet), FTPS retains a copy of the previously taxed tractor's title. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18, 21). It is at this point that the tax dispute between FTPS and the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") comes into play, setting the stage for the Government's Motion to Dismiss in Part (Doc. No. 18) and Motion to Strike (Doc. 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Under the Internal Revenue Code, a 12% federal excise tax is imposed \"on the first retail sale\" on \"tractors of the kind chiefly used for highway transportation in combination with a trailer or semitrailer.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204051\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). The code also provides, however:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   (f) Certain repairs and modifications not treated as manufacture\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (1) In general\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   An article described in section 4051(a)(1) shall not be treated as manufactured or produced solely by reason of repairs or modifications to the\n   article (including any modification which changes the transportation function of the article or restores a wrecked article to a functional condition) if the cost of such repairs and modifications does not exceed 75 percent of the retail price of a comparable new article.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204052\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Because its costs and profits in assembling the glider (including the costs of rebuilding the engine and/or transmission, buying a glider kit, and melding the two) does not exceed seventy-five percent of the retail price of a comparable new highway tractor, FTPS believes that it is entitled to the exception set forth in \u00a7 4052(f)(1) and, thus not liable for the 12% tax set forth in \u00a7 4051(a). For two decades, the IRS apparently had the same view.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   FTPS and its predecessor Fitzgerald Kit Truck and Sales, LLC were examined on four separate occasions between 1991 and 2011, covering tax years 1991, 1996-1997, and 2006-2011. During each of those years, FTPS did not collect excise tax on the sale of gliders. Following each of the examinations, the IRS determined that \"FTPS's gliders satisfied the 75 percent safe harbor math test under \u00a7 4052(f)(1) and therefore were not taxable under \u00a7 4051(a)(1).\" (Complaint \u00b6 33). FTPS even received a letter from a District Director of the IRS dated March 20, 1998 that stated, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   It has ... been determined all of your rebuilt worn tractors using glider kits qualified for the 75% safe harbor provisions per Revenue Ruling 91-27. In conclusion, it is our opinion that no Federal Excise Tax applies to your glider kit installations for 1996 and 1997.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (Doc. No. 1-2 at 1). Unsurprisingly, FTPS continued not to collect the excise tax on the sale of its gliders. (Complaint \u00b6 33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In 2014, the IRS began an examination for each of the tax quarters from 2012 to 2014. On May 26, 2015, the IRS sent a letter informing FTPS that, among other things, it owed excise taxes, penalties, and interest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34-36). An accompanying report from a revenue agent opined that FTPS was \"not extending [the] useful life of an existing vehicle,\" but instead was \"fabricating ... a truck tractor that did not exist prior to the fabrication.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After FTPS filed a written protest and additional documentation with IRS Appeals (\"Appeals\"), the parties agreed to mediate their dispute before an IRS Appeals Mediator. An agreement was struck whereby no tax would be due for any period up to that point, but FTPS would begin collecting excise tax on a \"prospective basis.\" (Doc. No. 1-3 at 1). The next day, the mediator confirmed the agreement in a document titled \"Mediator's Report,\" and indicated that \"settlement documents will be prepared under established appeals procedures.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.)\n   </em>\n   . The Mediator's report outlining the terms of the settlement was signed by the Mediator, the IRS Appeals Team Manager, and a representative for FTPS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.)\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   For whatever reason, however, the IRS chose not to abide by the settlement, and sustained the assessments set forth in the earlier letter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47-48). This may have been due, in part, to the fact that \"in 2014\n   the IRS decided to target the glider industry, and specifically FTPS, and reversed its position [on taxibility] in secret, without any public notice\" until it issued a cryptically worded notice in 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 91, 92).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On February 28, 2017, FTPS paid the excise tax on one glider for each of the relevant tax periods, for a total payment of $166,690.20. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54). Thereafter, on or about April 3, 2017, and April 10, 2017, the IRS assessed taxes, penalties and interest against FTPS for the relevant tax periods. And, what a whopping assessment it was: $64 million for the three year period between 2012 and 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54, 97). The taxes, of course, were not collected at the time of the sale of the glider trucks, and it is highly unlikely that truckers or fleet owners would willingly pay taxes on trucks that were purchased between four and six years earlier. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 99, 100).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Based upon the foregoing events, FTPS filed a three-count Complaint in this Court. In Count I, it seeks a refund of the federal exercise taxes it paid on gliders after the settlement fell apart. Counts II is a claim for equitable estoppel based on the prior examinations, IRS rulings, and IRS guidance. Count III is also a claim for equitable estoppel, but is based upon the alleged retroactivity of a new legal standard. The Government seeks to dismiss the equitable estoppel claims, and also moves to strike paragraphs 49-53 of the Complaint that relate to the excise tax treatment that other glider dealers allegedly received from the IRS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Motion to Dismiss\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On no less than six occasions in its Memorandum supporting its Motion to Dismiss, the Government quotes from\n   <em>\n    Richmond v. Officer of Personnel Management\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12123658\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/414/\">\n    496 U.S. 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12123658\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/414/\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12123658\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/414/\">\n    110 L.Ed.2d 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990). This is understandable because\n   <em>\n    Richmond\n   </em>\n   is likely the leading case from the Supreme Court addressing equitable estoppel against the federal government and imposes a very high bar to hurdle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   There, a civilian worker for the Department of the Navy was granted disability retirement because poor eyesight prevented his work as a welder. Later, he took a job as a school bus driver, and was paid less than the 80% income limit for continued annuity payments. When plaintiff was offered overtime, he consulted with an employee in the Navy's Civilian Personnel Department who erroneously informed plaintiff that he could earn more than the 80% limit, so long as he did not do so for two consecutive years. Based on this advice, he worked overtime. However, the Office of Personnel Management discontinued plaintiff's benefits when he reported receiving total income in excess of the 80% limit in just one year. All totaled, plaintiff lost disability benefits for six months in the amount of $3,993.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Noting that \"[f]rom its earliest cases\" it has \"recognized that equitable estoppel will not lie against the government as it lies against private litigants,\" the Supreme Court found estoppel not to be appropriate in the case before it.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12123658\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/414/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12123658\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/414/\">\n    at 419-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12123658\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/414/\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

More importantly, and contrary to the Government's suggestion that FTPS is seeking to \"raid the public treasury in avoidance of a real determination of the taxability of Fitzgerald's tractors,\" (Doc. No. 18-1 at 10), there are permanent appropriations for refunds of taxes erroneously collected.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201324\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Mistaken advice on one or two occasions by someone arguably not in the know is one thing, but mistakes made on four separate examinations in three different decades may be quite another, particularly where the Government is seeking to collect excises taxes in the tens of millions of dollars that the taxpayer never collected and never had the benefit of.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Richmond\n   </em>\n   aside, the Government argues that (1) \"the complaint lacks any claim that the United States ever committed intentional or reckless affirmative misconduct that misled [FTPS]\"; (2) \"[t]here is also no mention in the complaint of a false representation of fact by the Service\"; (3) the Complaint \"does not meet the heightened burden required to estop the United States in this refund suit\"; (4) FTPS \"ignores a fundamental principal of federal tax law: ...each tax period stands on its own\"; (5) FTPS \"also ignores that the Service has argued since at least the 1960s that some uses of glider kits to create tractors could constitute manufacturing, and those sales were therefore subject to the federal excise tax\"; (6) \"[t]he Service's continued efforts to determine the taxability of [FTPS's] sales of different tractors during new tax periods show that the Service was fulfilling its mandate to ensure compliance with federal law\"; (7) \"[t]he Service conducted its normal examination functions for new tax periods\"; and (8) \"[i]t is unreasonable, as a matter of law, for [FTPS] to rely upon the results of a\n   previous audit to determine the outcome of a subsequent audit.\" (Doc. No. 18-1 at 6-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The majority of these arguments are only resolvable in the context of a motion for summary judgment where the undisputed material facts are supported and identified, or at trial where the facts are weighed. Take, for instance, items (4) through (8). The statement that the IRS has argued since the 1960s that\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   uses of glider kits\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   constitute manufacturing is awfully nebulous and begs more questions than answers, not the least of which is whether those other gliders were similar to the ones assembled by FTPS. The arguments that the IRS simply performed its mandate and \"normal examination functions\" may well be true, but the Court has no evidence before it to support those contentions. It may also be true that \"each tax period stands on its own,\" but it does not necessarily follow that it was \"unreasonable, as a matter of law,\" for FTPS to rely on those audits for subsequent tax years if, in fact, the item it was producing was the same year-after-year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Government's remaining arguments fail when considered in light of the elements of an equitable estoppel claim, and the standards of review governing motions to dismiss. \" 'Estoppel is an equitable doctrine which a court may invoke to avoid injustice in particular cases.' \"\n   <em>\n    Michigan Exp., Inc. v.
