Lanza, United States District Judge\n   This case arises from a March 12, 2016 traffic accident that resulted in the instantaneous death of Johnathan Blyler (\"the Decedent\"). The vehicle that struck the Decedent's vehicle was a tractor-trailer being driven by Steven Robertson, an employee of Ameri-Can Freight Systems, Inc. (collectively, \"Defendants\"). The plaintiffs in this lawsuit are (1) the Decedent's mother, Zandra Manion (\"Mother\"), who asserts a wrongful death claim under A.R.S. \u00a7 12-611 as a statutory beneficiary of the Decedent, and (2) the Decedent's wife, Lisa Blyler (\"Wife\"), who asserts both a wrongful death claim under A.R.S. \u00a7 12-611 in her capacity as a statutory beneficiary and a survival claim under A.R.S. \u00a7 13-1440 on behalf of the Decedent's estate (\"the Estate\") (together, \"Plaintiffs\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Now pending before the Court is a motion for partial summary judgment filed by Defendants. (Doc. 73.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In Section A of their motion, Defendants seek summary judgment on five causes of action (negligent supervision, negligent retention, negligent maintenance, negligent hiring, and negligent training). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-9.) In Section B of their motion, Defendants seek summary judgment on the following four damage claims: (1) any claim for the Decedent's future wages asserted by the Estate as part of the survival action, (2) any claim related to the Decedent's pain and suffering, (3) any claim for the Decedent's future wages asserted by Mother or Wife as part of their respective wrongful death actions; and (4) any claim for punitive damages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In response, Plaintiffs clarified that \"[m]ost of the Motion is not opposed.\" (Doc. 84 at 1.) Specifically, Plaintiffs stipulated to the dismissal and/or non-existence of all five of the causes of action specified in Part A of Defendants' motion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.) Plaintiffs further stated that \"Plaintiffs Manion and Blyler are not making claims for economic losses as part of their action for wrongful death\" and that \"Plaintiffs stipulate to the dismissal of their claim for punitive damages.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) Finally, in a separate response, the Estate stated that \"no Plaintiff has made a claim for pain and suffering.\" (Doc. 82 at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Given these concessions and clarifications, the only disputed issue for the Court to resolve is the challenge to the Estate's ability to recover future wages as part of the survival action. In a nutshell, Defendants argue that such damages are unavailable for two reasons: (1) an estate cannot, as a matter of law, recover future economic losses in a survival action where the decedent died immediately, and (2) alternatively, the Estate's claim for future loss of income is too speculative. (Doc. 73 at 9-12; Doc. 87 at 2-7.) For the following reasons, the Court disagrees and denies the motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A party moving for summary judgment \"bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of\n   'the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,' which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

Supp. 2d 1085\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1086 (D. Ariz. 2006). Both types of claims are being asserted in this case: Wife and Mother have each asserted a wrongful death claim under A.R.S. \u00a7 12-611 and the Estate (acting through Wife) has separately asserted a survival claim under A.R.S. \u00a7 14-3110. In their motion, Defendants don't dispute the Estate's ability to assert a survival claim but argue the Estate should be barred from seeking one particular category of damages as part of that claim-economic damages arising from the loss of Decedent's future wages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Before addressing Defendants' argument, it is helpful to provide some background concerning the nature of survival and wrongful death actions under Arizona law. Both are creatures of statute. First, the Arizona survival statute provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Every cause of action, except a cause of action for damages for breach of promise to marry, seduction, libel, slander, separate maintenance, alimony, loss of consortium or invasion of the right of privacy, shall survive the death of the person entitled thereto or liable therefor, and may be asserted by or against the personal representative of such person, provided that upon the death of the person injured, damages for pain and suffering of such injured person shall not be allowed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 14-3110. \"Under Arizona law, a claim under the survival statute may be\n   brought only by a decedent's estate.\"\n   <em>\n    Gotbaum v. City of Phoenix\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4225059\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/617/878/#p883\">\n    617 F. Supp. 2d 878\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 883 (D. Ariz. 2008). The enactment of the survival statute \"extended the right of a decedent's personal representative to pursue the decedent's personal injury claim against a tortfeasor.\"\n   <em>\n    Quintero v. Rogers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4046136\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/221/536/\">\n    221 Ariz. 536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4046136\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/221/536/\">\n    212 P.3d 874\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 877 (2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Second, the Arizona wrongful death statute provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   When death of a person is caused by wrongful act, neglect or default, and the act, neglect or default is such as would, if death had not ensued, have entitled the party injured to maintain an action to recover damages in respect thereof, then, and in every such case, the person who or the corporation which would have been liable if death had not ensued shall be liable to an action for damages, notwithstanding the death of the person injured, and although the death was caused under such circumstances as amount in law to murder in the first or second degree or manslaughter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 12-611. The Arizona courts have explained that \"[a] wrongful death action is an original and distinct claim for damages sustained by the statutory beneficiaries and is not derivative of or a continuation of a claim existing in the decedent.\"\n   <em>\n    Barragan v. Superior Court of Pima Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1211234\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz-app/12/402/\">\n    12 Ariz.App. 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1211234\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz-app/12/402/\">\n    470 P.2d 722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 724 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1970). Such an action \"is for the wrong to the beneficiaries, confined to their loss because of the death.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 725.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendants argue that, at least in cases (like this case) where a decedent dies upon impact, the wrongful death statute provides the only avenue for seeking damages based upon the decedent's lost future wages. (Doc. 73 at 9-11; Doc. 87 at 2-4.) In support of this position, they cite cases from an array of other jurisdictions that \"have concluded that the damages recoverable under the survival statute do not include an amount for the loss of the decedent's future earnings.\" (Doc. 73 at 10-11 &amp; 11 n.1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   This argument is unavailing. As an initial matter, Defendants' reliance on cases from jurisdictions outside Arizona is misplaced. \"[A] federal court interpreting state law is bound by the decisions of the highest state court.... Where the state supreme court has not spoken on an issue presented to a federal court, the federal court must determine what result the state supreme court would reach based on state appellate court opinions, statutes, and treatises.\"\n   <em>\n    Vernon v. City of Los Angeles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10535142\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/27/1385/#p1391\">\n    27 F.3d 1385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1391 (9th Cir. 1994) (citations omitted). Here, Defendants haven't identified any decision by the Arizona Supreme Court (or, indeed, by any Arizona state court) adopting their position that future wages are unavailable in a survival claim under A.R.S. \u00a7 14-3310. Moreover, the Arizona Court of Appeals has specifically noted that \"because survival statutes and the interpretation of them vary greatly from state to state, [it does] not find a survey of the law in other jurisdictions particularly enlightening in interpreting \u00a7 14-3110.\"\n   <em>\n    Quintero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4046136\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/221/536/\">\n    212 P.3d at 877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Given this backdrop, the proper place to begin the analysis is with the statutory text of A.R.S. \u00a7 14-3110. The plain language of the statute does not support Defendants' position. Notably, the statute only identifies one category of damages that is unavailable in a survival action-\"damages for\n   <em>\n    pain and suffering.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4046136\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/221/536/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). This strongly suggests the Arizona Legislature didn't intend to exclude other categories of damages, like future economic damages.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    TRW Inc. v.

Thus, as in\n   <em>\n    Quintero\n   </em>\n   , where the Arizona Court of Appeals allowed a punitive damage claim to be pursued in a survival action because the \"survival statute does not preclude punitive damages,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4046136\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/221/536/\">\n    212 P.3d at 878\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Court concludes that damages for future economic losses may be recovered in a survival action because the survival statute does not expressly exclude such damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendants cite\n   <em>\n    Gandy v.

Supp. 2d 1085\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Ariz. 2006), for the proposition that \"Arizona courts have held survival action loss of earnings must be limited to those incurred between the decedent's injury and death because to allow post-death recovery would be double-recovery with a wrongful death action.\" (Doc. 73 at 10.)\n   <em>\n    Gandy\n   </em>\n   did indeed come to this conclusion. But Defendants are mistaken in claiming that \"Arizona courts\" have so held-Defendants did not cite, and the Court is unaware of, any Arizona state court cases addressing this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Moreover, the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Gandy\n   </em>\n   were attempting to recover future-income damages\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   as part of the estate's survival action\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   as part of the beneficiaries' wrongful death action.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5663389\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/437/1085/#p1086\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5663389\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/437/1085/#p1086\">\n    at 1089\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These parallel claims created a risk of double recovery, and the\n   <em>\n    Gandy\n   </em>\n   opinion can be read as an attempt to avoid double recovery by funneling all of the future-income claims into a single cause of action.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5663389\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/437/1085/#p1086\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5663389\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/437/1085/#p1086\">\n    at 1088\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    To prevent double recovery under the wrongful death and survival statutes\n   </em>\n   , recovery for Decedent's loss of future earnings in the survival claim is limited to the time between her injury, September 9, 1999, to her death, May 22, 2005.\") (emphasis added). In this case, however, there is no risk of double recovery-Wife and Mother have agreed not to \"mak[e] claims for economic losses as part of their action for wrongful death.\" (Doc. 84 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Finally, in addition to lacking any support in the statutory text or relevant state-court case law, Defendants' position also fails because it could lead to illogical results. Although double recovery is a legitimate concern where both survival and wrongful death claims are brought in the same case, it is unclear why the best way to address that concern is to arbitrarily decide that a claim for damages for future economic losses must be made under the wrongful death statute, rather than the survival statute. The consequences of this arbitrary rule are that defendants will often benefit when they kill, rather than injure, or when they kill those who were not supporting others at the time of their death.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   For these reasons, some courts have expressly declined to adopt the rule proposed here by Defendants.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Criscuola v.

Matthew Sims (\"Sims\"), assumed that if Decedent had not died in the collision, he would have become a sixth grade \"Social Science\" teacher beginning in summer 2016. (Doc. 83-1 at 24.) In support of this assumption, Plaintiffs cite Wife's deposition testimony that (1) at the time of his death Decedent was teaching sixth grade social studies; (2) Decedent was awarded his Master's Degree in Elementary Education posthumously; (3) Decedent would have been immediately certified to teach in Arizona after completing his student teaching and presenting his diploma to the Arizona Department of Education; and (4) the window for applying for teaching positions the following year had not yet opened. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendants raise several objections to Sims's analysis. First, Defendants contend that Wife lacked foundation regarding statements three and four, above. (Doc. 88 at 2.) Second, Defendants also highlight the undisputed facts that, at the time of his death, (1) Decedent had not yet completed his student teaching or the follow-up classwork for his degree; (2) Decedent had not yet applied for any jobs; and (3) Decedent was not employed. (Doc. 74 at 7.) Given these undisputed facts, Defendants more broadly argue that the \"claims regarding the amount of decedent's future estate and earnings are not supported by any evidence,\" as Sims had no basis to \"assume that if not for this incident, [Decedent's] new new career would have begun in the summer of 2016.\" (Doc. 73 at 11, citing Doc. 74-22 at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"[F]uture lost wages are an appropriate measure of damages under Arizona law.\"\n   <em>\n    Lewis v.

At the time of his death, Decedent was student teaching and would have been close to graduating, evidenced by the fact that he was awarded his Master's Degree in Elementary Education posthumously. (Doc. 83-1 at 15-18.)\n   <em>\n    Rascon\n   </em>\n   is instructive. There, the court declined to exclude an expert's testimony on economic loss where that expert assumed the plaintiff would finish his Commercial Driver's License training and obtain employment as a full-time truck driver.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20739696\">\n    2018 WL 739696\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *4-5. Defendants have not presented any evidence disputing Wife's statement that Decedent was planning to start a teaching job using the degree he was seeking. (Doc. 83-1 at 15-16.)
