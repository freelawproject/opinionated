Plaintiff Deanna Pierce, a Native-American woman, claimed the City discriminated against her on the basis of race when it did not promote her, then retaliated against her because she complained of discrimination. A jury found the City did not discriminate against Pierce but did retaliate against her; it awarded nominal damages. Pierce filed three post-trial motions. One seeks judgment as a matter of law-or in the alternative, a new trial-on her discrimination claims and a new trial on municipal liability and damages. (ECF No. 86.) The other seeks equitable\n   and injunctive relief from retaliation. (ECF No. 78.) The most recent motion seeks a new trial on the grounds that the City failed to produce certain evidence during discovery. (ECF No. 101.) The Court denies all three motions in their entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Pierce applied for three promotions within the PDP in 2015, 2016 (the \"HSPA positions\") and 2017 (the \"CJO position\"). She interviewed against Adrienne Lyde, Jennifer Albandoz and Leroy Pendleton. Both Lyde and Pendleton are African-American; Albandoz is Hispanic. Pierce was not selected for any of the promotions. She filed her lawsuit on December 11, 2017 (Compl., ECF No. 1), alleging claims of race discrimination for the City's failure to promote her in 2015, 2016 and 2017, hostile work environment and retaliation in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act and the Philadelphia Fair Practices Ordinance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In her Second Amended Complaint,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed on June 25, 2018, she added a sixth claim of disability discrimination. (ECF No. 18.) She withdrew the disability claim on July 17, 2018. (ECF No. 25.) She withdrew the discrimination claims regarding the 2015 promotion on November 1, 2018. (ECF No. 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Pierce moved for partial summary judgment on her discrimination claims over Albandoz's promotion to the HSPA position in 2016. (ECF No. 32.) The City moved for summary judgment on all claims. (ECF No. 34.) The Court denied Pierce's motion, (ECF Nos. 63, 64), and also denied the City's motion as to the discrimination claims regarding Albandoz's 2016 promotion and the retaliation claims under Title VII, the PHRA and the PFPO. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It granted the City's motion as to the discrimination and retaliation claims regarding Pendleton's promotion to the CJO position in 2017, the hostile work environment claims and the retaliation claims under \u00a7 1981. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Trial began on January 8, 2019 on the remaining claims: race discrimination for the City's failure to promote Pierce to the HSPA job in 2016 (in violation of \u00a7 1981, the Equal Protection Clause, Title VII, the PHRA and the PFPO) and retaliation (in violation of Title VII, the PHRA and the PFPO). (ECF No. 67.) On January 11, the jury returned a verdict for the City on the discrimination claims and for Pierce on the retaliation claims. The jurors awarded Pierce one dollar in nominal damages. (ECF No. 73.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Pierce moves for judgment as a matter of law on her race discrimination claim regarding Albandoz's 2016 promotion. She argues that under the mixed-motive discrimination analysis, which requires her to establish that race was a motivating factor in the City's decision, a reasonable jury could not have had a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the City. To the contrary, the evidence provided the jurors with ample basis to conclude as they did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50 permits the Court to enter judgment as a matter of law where \"a party has been fully heard on an issue during a jury trial and the court finds that a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary\n   basis to find for the party on that issue.\" Fed.

(\"Jan. 8 Tr.\") 46:2-4). Social work supervisors report directly to Human Services Program Administrators (\"HSPAs\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48:21-49:2.) The PDP has two HSPAs; both are civil service positions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 119:22-24). Of particular relevance to Pierce's discrimination claims, to apply for a promotion to a civil service position, City employees must take a civil service examination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 119:25-120:4; Jan. 9, 2019 Hr'g Tr. (\"Jan. 9 Tr.\") 86:24-87:3.) Under the \"civil service rule of two,\" if there is one vacancy for a position, the City must interview the two interested candidates with the highest exam scores. (Jan. 8 Tr. 121:4-7; Jan. 9 Tr. 86:24-87:16.) The Commissioner of the PDP has final decision-making authority with respect to hiring and promotions. (Jan. 9 Tr. 175:24-176:3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Pierce took the civil service exam for the HSPA position in 2014, along with Adrienne Lyde, Dawn Hall and Jennifer Albandoz. (Jan. 8 Tr. 49:6-8; Trial Ex. 11.) Lyde scored highest, followed by Pierce, Hall and Albandoz, respectively. (Trial Ex. 11.) Pursuant to the civil service rule of two, Lyde and Pierce interviewed for the HSPA position when one became vacant in 2015. (Jan. 8 Tr. 52:17-22.) Lyde received the promotion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53:10.) Pierce thought the City failed to promote her because of her race and filed an EEOC charge of discrimination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 118:10-119:7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In January of 2016, Philadelphia Mayor James Kenney took office. Blanche Carney was appointed Commissioner of the PDP several months later. (Jan. 9 Tr. 96:10-20.) In May of 2016, another HSPA position became available. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 97:18-98:20.) Pursuant to the rule of two, Dawn Hall and Pierce were slotted to interview for the position, but shortly before the interview Hall decided not to pursue the job.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 144:9-17, 158:8-9; Jan. 10, 2019 Hr'g Tr. (\"Jan. 10 Tr.\") 175:3-176:16.) As the person with the next-highest test score, Albandoz became eligible for consideration and she and Pierce were both interviewed for the HSPA position on June 24, 2016. (Jan. 8 Tr. 60:23-61:7; Jan. 10 Tr. 175:3-176:16.) The interview panelists-Commissioner Carney, former Acting Commissioner Michael Resnick, Deputy Commissioners Karen Bryant and Terrell Bagby and Human Resources Manager Tracey Delaney-each took contemporaneous notes on an interview evaluation form.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Trial Exs. 27, 29-32). Albandoz received the promotion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Jan. 8 Tr. 62:17-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Each panelist testified at trial and every interview evaluation form was admitted into evidence. The panelists' testimony was consistent with their contemporaneous notes. Delaney told the jury that Pierce began her interview by stating she did not feel well and \"it took her a minute to gather her thoughts and answer the questions.\" (Jan. 9 Tr. 67:21-68:3.) Bagby testified that Pierce \"had a hard time concentrating on the questions that [he] asked her,\" (Jan. 10 Tr. 72:6-7), and that the interview \"was one of the weirdest ... [he'd] ever participated on\" because he had \"never had someone who just completely said they just couldn't keep the questions in their head....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 73:3-7.) Resnick told the jury that Pierce's interview was \"awful. She was horrible.... [S]he couldn't formulate responses to [the panelists'] questions.... It just seemed like she was not focused.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 131:19-132:1.) Carney, Resnick and Bryant all testified that no one from the panel recommended Pierce for the position. (Jan. 9 Tr. 176:24-177:1, 207:2-3; Jan. 10 Tr. 135:7-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Carney, the ultimate decisionmaker, was kinder in her assessment of Pierce's performance but explained why she too favored Albandoz after the interviews. She testified that \"Ms. Albandoz fully answered and responded to the questions, she was better prepared. She came with ... big goals and visions to expand service delivery in the prisons.... She gave good eye contact, engaged the board.\" (Jan. 9 Tr. 176:14-23.) \"It wasn't that Ms. Pierce performed bad, she performed well, but when compared and competing for a position, Ms. Albandoz was the better candidate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 162:10-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Pierce's own testimony was in material part consistent with the panel members' assessment of her interview performance. She told the jury she was \"extremely, extremely ill\" on the day of her interview. (Jan. 8 Tr. 61:10.) She stated that during the interview, she was \"focused on not throwing up and making sure that [she], you know, didn't have any accidents.\" (Jan. 9 Tr. 5:21, 6:6-8.) \"Unfortunately or fortunately, [she] was able to push through, but [she] didn't feel like [her]self.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:10-12.) Moreover, it was Pierce's decision to interview even though she was, by her own account, far from her best that day. She stated that she has \"great relationships with every one of\" the panelists and Commissioner Carney testified that \"had Ms. Pierce made [a] request [to reschedule], [it] would've been afforded to her.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:14-15, 153:25-154:1.) Pierce, however, never asked to have the interview rescheduled because she was leaving for a vacation shortly after the interview \"so there wasn't a whole lot of timeframe for to [sic] reschedule.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:20-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Albandoz further confirmed that Pierce interviewed poorly-on account of illness as well as a negative attitude-and that Pierce knew it. She testified that Pierce was \"kind of, upset before she went into the interview\" because she thought the interview was a \"setup.\" (Jan. 10 Tr. 176:25-177:1.) According to Albandoz, Pierce was also \"very upset\" after the interview and said, \"this is a setup, I didn't do well, I was not feeling well.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 177:13-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In support of her theory that race was a factor in the City's decision to not promote\n   her, Pierce pointed to two emails and a letter from various City officials recommending Albandoz for positions other than the HSPA job. First, she cited to an email from City Councilwoman Maria Qui\u00f1ones-Sanchez to Brian Abernathy, the City's former First Deputy Managing Director, which stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Brian, as you finalize the selection of the Prison Commissioner, I wanted to bring your attention to a highly qualified Latina in the system. We have no high ranking Latino in the Prisons.... When I spoke with Mayor Kenney yesterday, we discussed how we really need to try to get his Latino appointments up. This may work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (Trial Ex. 15.) Albandoz's resume was attached to the email. Abernathy forwarded the email to Carney, who responded, \"Thanks and I have supervised Mrs. Albandoz.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Second, Pierce relied on a letter to Abernathy from Rafaela Colon, one of former Mayor Rendell's employees:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   It has come to my attention that for several years now, the [PDP] has lacked Latino representation.... I am challenging the new city administration and its departments to utilize their position in city government to impact real change in diversity by appointing a qualified, competent, and experienced Latino to the position of Deputy Commissioner for Restorative and Transitional Services. Furthermore, I strongly urge you and those in the respective departments to consider Ms. Jennifer Albandoz for the position.... I am a firm believer that the position should be filled with a person who knows the system and can navigate it with expertise....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (Trial Ex. 16.) Abernathy forwarded the letter to Carney and asked her for a list of the highest-ranking Latino employees in the PDP. Delaney prepared a list, which Carney sent to Abernathy. Abernathy drafted a response to Colon's letter and sent the draft to Carney for review. The response stated, in part, \"we will do what we can to promote Latinos within the confines of civil service regulations.\" (Trial Ex. 21.) Abernathy explained that this statement was meant \"to telegraph to Ms. Colon that civil service is very restrictive and that there wasn't much that we could actually do to promote Latinos within that system.\" (Jan. 10 Tr. 44:21-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Third, Pierce cited to an email to Carney from City Transition Director Steve Preston, inquiring whether Carney had \"filled the position that [she] previously held in the prison system.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Trial Ex. 24.) Albandoz's resume was attached to the email.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Carney told the jury that \"[i]t's not uncommon for folks to forward recommendations and resumes on behalf of constituents ... but [that] in no way influences [her] decision to fill the position.\" (Jan. 9 Tr. 136:11-14.) She continued, \"Different council members send information and recommendation[s]. It's not important to me in making my decision. I'm looking to fill positions with the best qualified candidate....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 137:1-3.) Abernathy also testified that these sort of recommendations \"happen[ ]all the time.\" (Jan. 10 Tr. 24:2.) He explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   It is not something we encourage but we accept it as something that has and will continue to happen.... [T]o my knowledge I've not had a commissioner ... feel pressured or feel obligated to place someone in a position just because they received [a] recommendation from city\n   council or any, anyone else. What we have done is figured out how to maneuver through those issues and make sure that the council member feels that their recommendation was taken seriously, but there's been no sense of requirement or obligation to follow those recommendations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24:2-4, 24:21-25:3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   A reasonable jury could have credited Carney and Abernathy's testimony that the emails and letter from Qui\u00f1ones-Sanchez, Colon and Preston did not influence Carney's decision to promote Albandoz to the HSPA position instead of Pierce. First and foremost, none of the recommendations were for the HSPA job. They were all for different (indeed higher-ranking) positions within the PDP. Pierce apparently wanted the jurors to conclude that because Carney, Abernathy and perhaps others disappointed Councilwoman Qui\u00f1ones-Sanchez, Ms. Colon and Mr. Preston by\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   awarding Albandoz the jobs which were the subjects of their requests, Carney, Abernathy,\n   <em>\n    et al.\n   </em>\n   orchestrated Albandoz's promotion to the HSPA position to mollify Albandoz's supporters. The jurors apparently didn't see it that way, a view that was not controverted by the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Pierce's strongest argument that race played a role in the decision to promote Albandoz to the HSPA job depended on the extent, if any, to which the jurors were going to credit the testimony of former PDP Deputy Commissioner Robert Tomaszewski. Before Tomaszewski took the stand, Pierce told the jury about a conversation she had with him:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [He] told me that he basically knew why I didn't get the position ... that he knew that the city was looking to promote Latinos, he told me he had a conversation with Commissioner Carney and that during that conversation Commissioner Carney had shared with him that she was getting pressure, she was not comfortable even making decision [sic] because I had more experience than Ms. Albandoz.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   (Jan. 8 Tr. 64:11-17.) Tomaszewski then augmented Pierce's story, testifying that Francine McCain, a social worker in the PDP, heard he had his own lawsuit against the City and asked him to meet with Pierce over lunch. (Jan. 9 Tr. 221:16-222:8.) He said that he told Pierce during that lunch that Carney \"was being pressured to hire a Hispanic individual to the HSPA position.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 222:15-17.) For her part, Commissioner Carney testified that she was not pressured to promote a Hispanic candidate to the HSPA position and she denied ever telling Tomaszewski otherwise. (Jan. 10 Tr. 257:16-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The jurors learned that Tomaszewski is also suing the City for race and gender discrimination and is being represented in that litigation by the same lawyers representing Pierce.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Jan. 9 Tr. 223:5-22.) The City drew attention to the fact that some of the exhibits Pierce offered into evidence had Tomaszewski's name printed on them, an indication of shared efforts between the litigants and their attorneys.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 232:17-233:5; Trial Exs. 73, 84). Pierce herself viewed her and Tomaszewski's cases as something of a team effort, telling Sergeant Miguel Rios, a PDP Office of Professional Compliance Investigator who did not sustain her internal hostile work environment claim, \"don't worry, because I\n   have Tomaszewski's lawyer.\" (Jan. 10 Tr. 237:16-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In sum, the only evidence that race played a role in the decision to promote Albandoz was Tomaszewski's testimony, which Carney contradicted. The Court, in denying Pierce's Rule 50 motion after the parties rested, described it in this way:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   The only testimony that ... gets you there [on the discrimination claim], if anything, is Tomaszewski and Tomaszewski and his believability is within the purview of the jury.... [T]he Commissioner has denied [Tomaszewski's allegations] and the jury is going to decide who to believe.... [T]he jury heard a lot of evidence from which a reasonable juror could conclude that the decision was not based on race at all.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   (Jan. 10 Tr. 275:16-25, 278:23-25.) At the end of the day, that is exactly what happened. The jurors evaluated all of the evidence, including testimony by the members of the interview panel and their interview notes, along with Pierce, Tomaszewski and Carney's testimony. The jurors, as they were instructed to do, assessed the credibility of all witnesses, including Tomaszewski and Carney-their manner while testifying, whether they had an interest in the outcome of the case and any other factors that bear on believability-and gave Tomaszewski's testimony the weight they felt it deserved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The jurors' verdict on the discrimination claim was firmly supported by the evidence they saw and heard. Pierce still insists that she \"presented to the jury overwhelming undisputed evidence that race was a motivating factor in Defendant's decision not to promote her to HSPA.\" (Mem. Supp. Mot. 10, ECF No. 86.) The jurors saw and heard no such evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the jurors were presented anything that was \"undisputed,\" it was that Pierce bombed the job interview that the \"rule of two\" required. She didn't feel well, she had a bad day and she went before the interview panel and laid an egg. She promptly admitted as much to her competitor for the position. She knew she could have asked to have the interview rescheduled, but she chose not to because she didn't want the interview to interfere with her vacation. That was her choice-she had every right to go through with the interview when she was not at her best. She now has to live with the consequences of the jurors' assessment of her performance that day and its effect on the City's decision to promote Albandoz instead. Drawing all reasonable inferences in the City's favor and disregarding all evidence favorable to Pierce that the jury was not required to believe, a reasonable jury would-and did-have a sufficient evidentiary basis to conclude that race was not a motivating factor in the City's decision to not promote Pierce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Court may grant a new trial under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59 \"for any reason for which a new trial has heretofore been granted in an action at law\n   in federal court.\" Fed.

She also contends a new trial is warranted because: (1) the Court erred when it wouldn't allow Pierce to depose Mayor Kenney after discovery had ended, (2) the City's counsel made improper statements during closing argument, (3) the Court erred when it held that evidence suggesting that Carney was promoted on the basis of race (the issue before Judge DuBois in the\n   <em>\n    Tomaszewski\n   </em>\n   case) was inadmissible, (4) the Court erred when it admitted evidence that Pierce believes she was discriminated against when she was not promoted in 2015 and (5) the jury instructions and verdict form should have asked the jurors to consider whether Pierce was discriminated against on the basis of \"her race (non-Hispanic),\" rather than \"her race.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   i\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The great weight of the evidence does not cut against the jury's verdict that race was not a motivating or determinative factor in the City's decision to not promote her. In support of her motion for a new trial, Pierce makes essentially the same arguments as in her motion for judgment as a matter of law. As discussed in Section II,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the jury's verdict on the discrimination claims was firmly supported by the evidence it saw and heard during trial. The Court cannot grant a new trial simply because a jury could have weighed the evidence differently-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , by perhaps giving more credit to Robert Tomaszewski's testimony and less to that of Commissioner Carney and the other members of the City interview panel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   ii\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Pierce is not entitled to a new trial on municipal liability, either. To hold the City liable under \u00a7 1983, Pierce was required to show both that the City deprived her of a federal right and that it did so pursuant to municipal policy or custom. Because the jury reasonably found that Pierce was not discriminated against on the basis of race, she is not entitled to a new trial on the second prong of the inquiry, whether the City had a policy or custom of discrimination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   iii\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Finally, the jury's decision to award Pierce nominal damages on her retaliation claims is not against the weight of the evidence. At trial, Pierce argued that\n   the City retaliated against her by issuing two Employee Violation Reports in 2017 and 2018, subjecting her to a retaliatory hostile work environment by treating her in a more dismissive manner than other employees and denying her support staff, overtime and lunch breaks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Pierce testified that when Albandoz issued her an Employee Violation Report in 2017:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   It affected me horribly. I had never been so scared in my entire life. I had never had my job put on the line or recommended to be terminated. I, I was having a really, really hard time functioning. I believe around the same time I actually started my family medical leave. It was just an absolutely horrible three months of waiting to find out what was going to happen.... I was suffering from anxiety, depression, headaches, [and] horrible stress which was aggravating my irritable bowel symptoms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   (Jan. 8 Tr. 74:7-19.) She also stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   I have been having severe panic attacks, chest pains, to the point where I have thought I was having a heart attack.... And, all of this is because I felt that Ms.-because Ms. Albandoz was harassing me. I've been taking medication and seeing a therapist. Or, was seeing a therapist at that time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 87:16-21.) With respect to the second Employee Violation Report, Pierce said, \"It affected me worse than ... the first time because now I'm feeling, okay, they're really coming after me.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 101:10-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Pierce also testified before Albandoz was promoted, she \"saw [her] future pretty successful\" at the PDP, but now, \"I don't see a-much of a future at the prisons ... I feel that my, my upward growth has been stopped.... I don't feel that I have any upward mobility left.\" (Jan. 8 Tr. 111:20-112:8.) When asked what has been \"the worst part of all th[is],\" at the end of her direct examination, Pierce said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   ... [T]he whole thing has been the worst, worst I've ever experienced or really been through in my life to, to the mental health part, the depression, anxiety.... It just really took a toll on me physically and I felt hopeless, I still feel hopeless.... I think what has, what has been the hardest part and the worst part of this for me and I'll be honest has been being away from my family and being away from my children. I have been absent for almost two years because I have just not been able to interact with my family, I've not been able to do things with my kids because I've been depressed. Because I feel like I'm a burden because people are always wondering how I'm feeling, so I can't get that time back.... I've missed so much of [my children's] lives, I can't get that time back.... I'm hoping to make a change, but I can't get that time back....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 112:12-114:1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Pierce's wife, Roberta Sellack, testified that when Pierce did not receive the HSPA promotion, \"she started coming home and she would be frustrated ... she just seemed depressed.\" (Jan. 10, 2019 Hr'g Tr. 49:7-11.) Sellack said that Pierce \"[a]t some point ... realized how unhealthy this was and she decided to get help.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49:11-12.) Her doctor \"put her on anxiety medication and she started seeing a therapist.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49:13-14.) Sellack's only testimony pertaining specifically to Pierce's retaliation claims was that the Employee Violation Reports were \"particularly stressful. [Pierce] was afraid ... that she might lose her job.... [and] losing that job would've caused a pretty good financial hardship for us.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50:16-51:6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   To support her damages claim, Pierce introduced into evidence a health care provider form (Trial Ex. 90) on which Pierce's physician wrote that Pierce suffers from anxiety, depression and panic attacks which are \"exacerbated while under supervision of Jennifer Albandoz.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Pierce submitted this form to the City along with a request to be transferred from Albandoz's supervision. (Jan. 8, 2019 Hr'g Tr. 89:21-25.) Pierce acknowledged on cross-examination, however, that she has been on blood pressure medication for seven years, has had irritable bowel syndrome for ten years and took anxiety medication in 2012 for six or seven months, long before the retaliation began. (Jan. 9 Tr. 58:13-59:12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Court has no reason to question the jurors' conclusion that Pierce failed to prove actual injury and accordingly award her one dollar. The jury was properly instructed to consider all evidence and decide what weight, if any, to assign to it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   With respect to Pierce's health care provider form, it was within the jury's province to give little or no weight to the unidentified physician's statements.

On October 2, 2018, after the close of discovery, Pierce's counsel asked the Court for permission to depose Mayor Kenney, Councilwoman Qui\u00f1ones-Sanchez, Steve Preston and Brian Abernathy and to re-depose Commissioner Carney.

After a telephone conference with counsel for both parties, the Court permitted counsel to depose Abernathy and re-depose Carney and limited the scope of the depositions to the two emails and letter. (ECF No. 30.) The Court denied Pierce's request to depose Mayor Kenney, Qui\u00f1ones-Sanchez and Preston.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ.

The email does not show that Mayor Kenney's testimony was likely to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence or that his testimony was essential (or for that matter, even relevant) to Pierce's case. The email does not, as Pierce's counsel now argues, \"show that Mayor Kenney was directly involved in the promotion of Ms. Albandoz because of her race.\" (Pl.'s Reply Def.'s Mem. Opp'n 13, ECF No. 94.) It does not indicate that the Mayor was involved in any way in Albandoz's promotion to the HSPA job or that he had any other personal knowledge pertinent to Pierce's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Pierce's request to depose the Mayor of Philadelphia with an argument that relied on a reed as thin as the Qui\u00f1ones-Sanchez email seemed to the Court a superficial attempt to harass the Mayor, and the trial confirmed the propriety of the Court's view. Pierce did not present any evidence linking Mayor Kenney to her claims other than Qui\u00f1ones-Sanchez's reference, pertaining to the Commissioner's job which Pierce never sought, and the Mayor's purported desire to increase his \"Latino appointments\" to high ranking PDP positions. At trial, Commissioner Carney testified that she never communicated with Mayor Kenney about promoting Latino employees or about Jennifer Albandoz. (Jan. 9 Tr. 172:1-6.) Abernathy, who works \"very closely\" with the Mayor, said that he did not know who Albandoz was when he received Qui\u00f1ones-Sanchez's email. (Jan. 10 Tr. 7:2-4, 23:2-7.) In short, Pierce presented no extraordinary circumstances justifying the Mayor's deposition and absent any evidence linking\n   Mayor Kenney to the case, the Court protected the public interest by ensuring that the Mayor could perform his official tasks without disruption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   ii\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Pierce argues that the City's counsel made improper statements during her closing argument and that those statements warrant a new trial. Pierce contends specifically that it was inappropriate for counsel to: (1) refer in her closing to her own personal experience, (2) refer critically to Pierce's counsel and (3) discuss Mayor Kenney's absence from the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   First of all, counsel waived her right to now assert the first and second species of impropriety at trial and no exceptional circumstances justify a new trial on those grounds in any event. \"[I]t is clear that a party who fails to object to errors at trial waives the right to complain about them following trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Burlington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201221426\">\n    2016 WL 1221426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *8 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Waldorf v.

The Court, skeptical as to the bases for the objections, nonetheless told Pierce's counsel that if she could gather legal support for her positions over an impending break, he would further consider the objections before charging the jury. (Jan. 11 Tr. 89:24-90:5.) When the parties reconvened, the Court asked Pierce's counsel to state her objections to the City's closing argument on the record. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 90:19-20 (\"Let's elaborate on your, your objection now. Take them again.\").) Counsel objected to the City's reference to Mayor Kenney's absence from trial; the Court agreed that the City's counsel had gone too far in pointing out the Mayor's absence and told the parties he would give a curative instruction on that issue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 90:22-91:22, 97:1-6.) Pierce's counsel then stated, \"I will end my objections on that, Your Honor[,] the reference to the mayor. I, I think that, that was the one that is the most, you know, the prejudicial issue....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 90:23-91:1.) The Court asked again:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Q: And that's ... your only objection to the closing?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   A: Yes, your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   Q: You sure?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   A: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 93:1-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Pierce's counsel pursues in her post-trial briefing a curious argument purportedly intended to excuse her decision to forgo her other objections to the City's closing argument. She now claims to have been rattled by the Court's \"hostility\" to her objections and, more specifically her own closing and rebuttal arguments to the jury. (Reply Supp. Mot. 5, ECF No. 94; Reply Supp. Mot. Ex. C.) Counsel confuses hostility with disappointment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Going back to the rule of two, the City was required to consider for the HSPA vacancy the two interested candidates with the highest civil service exam scores. That initially meant that Dawn Hall, who is African-American, was Pierce's competition for the spot. Ms. Hall, however withdrew\n   from consideration shortly before the interview, elevating Albandoz to be considered, and interview against Pierce, because she had the next highest test score.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section II.A. That fact, of course, constituted a significant challenge to Pierce's theory of the case, which was that the City effectively jerry-rigged the entire process to get Albandoz into position for the interview panel to recommend her and Commissioner Carney to promote her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   To get around this roadblock, Pierce's counsel crossed the line separating zealous advocacy from improper argument. She told the jurors things for which not only there was no basis in the evidence at trial, but which counsel knew from the underlying discovery to be false. Neither side called Ms. Hall to testify at trial. Counsel, and the Court from its review of the record at the summary judgment stage, knew from the deposition testimony of both Pierce and Albandoz that Hall chose not to pursue the HSPA job for reasons completely unrelated to the City-and related solely to her child. When deposed, Pierce testified Hall didn't want the job because \"I think it had something to do with her son, and not just wanting the responsibility, and the hours.\" (Pl.'s Resp. Summ. J. Ex. A (\"Pierce Dep.\") 66:7-9, ECF No. 40-2.) Albandoz echoed that, stating in her deposition that Hall \"... said because of the reasons of her son and because of so much work that needs to be done at HSPA she would not have the time to be actually with her son. So she was going to withdraw the position.\" (Def.'s Mot. Summ J. Ex. M (\"Albandoz Dep.\") 55:9-13, ECF No. 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Such an innocuous narrative was not going to suffice, so Pierce's lawyer simply changed it. In her closing argument, she said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   Ms. Pierce is number two and Ms. Albandoz is number four [on the civil service list]. Ms. Albandoz wasn't even in the running when that [HSPA] position became available. It should've been Ms. Pierce verse [sic] Ms. Hall, Ms. Hall was number three. Ms. Hall is not Hispanic and somehow, curiously, Ms. Hall declined that job right before the interviews which pushed Ms. Albandoz into the running.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   (Jan. 11 Tr. 55:22-56:3.) She went even further in her rebuttal, stating, \"[Hall] was on the fence and then at some point she was pushed off the fence at the last minute. And the Defendant doesn't have an explanation for that.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 84:8-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Court (at sidebar out of the hearing of the jury and later while the jurors were not in the courtroom) admonished counsel for her tactics and, perhaps worse, for arguing that her conduct was appropriate-something she continues to do.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Reply Supp. Mot. 9, ECF No. 94 (\"Plaintiff's counsel inference was\n   <em>\n    properly\n   </em>\n   made based on the facts and testimony at trial and Ms. Hall's failure to testify.\" (emphasis in original))). The Court tried to give counsel an out, telling her when she continued to defend the indefensible that \"I think the best thing you can do is say, Your Honor, I wanted to win really bad and I went too far and I'm sorry and I won't do it again.\" (Jan. 11 Tr. 94:19-21.)

It is not reasonably probable, considering the City's closing argument as a whole, that the jury's verdict was influenced by two references to counsel's personal experiences and one allegedly \"vituperative\" reference to Pierce's counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the contrary, the basis for the jury's verdict appeared to rest on the absence, in their view, of any evidence that race was a motivating factor in the City's decision to promote Albandoz instead of Pierce.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section II.C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   3\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Pierce did preserve her objection to the City's reference to Mayor Kenney.

Plaintiff has been very thorough in excavating all of the information that is relevant to her case. You didn't hear from the mayor[,] did you? That's because the mayor does not know Jennifer Albandoz.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   (Jan. 11 Tr. 62:13-21.)

The \"cumulative thrust\" of the City's closing was not an invitation to draw inferences from the Mayor's absence. Instead, the comment about the Mayor was isolated and promptly cured by the Court's instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   iii\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Before trial, the City moved to exclude \"all testimony and evidence regarding rumors, innuendos, or gossip about the City's alleged discriminatory hiring practices pertaining to\" Blanche Carney's appointment to PDP Commissioner. (ECF No. 47 at 8.) During oral argument on the motion, Pierce argued that evidence of the alleged discriminatory nature of Carney's appointment is relevant to show that the City has a policy or custom of considering race in personnel decisions. (Jan. 3, 2019 Hr'g Tr. (\"Jan. 3 Tr.\") 16:25-17:2.) Pierce's counsel told the Court that, if permitted to do so, Abernathy and Resnick would testify that they discussed the City's desire to appoint an African-American female to the Commissioner position before Carney was asked to interview. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18:20-19:1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   As discussed in Section III.A.ii,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Pierce is not entitled to a new trial on whether the City discriminated against Pierce pursuant to a policy or custom because the jury reasonably found that race was not a motivating factor in the decision to not promote her. Accordingly, Pierce's claim that the Court erred when it excluded evidence probative of a policy or custom of discrimination is not grounds for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Regardless, the Court properly excluded the evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 403. This was an issue tailor made for that Rule. The purported probative value of the evidence-an African-American woman's appointment to PDP Commissioner over a white man-to Pierce's claim that the City has a policy or custom of considering race in hiring decisions is minimal at best. It was also substantially outweighed by Rule 403's express considerations. It would have necessitated a mini-trial on Tomaszewski's separately filed discrimination case because the City would have had to be allowed to explain why Carney was promoted over Tomaszewski. The process by which Carney was appointed was \"completely different\" than the civil service rule of two appointment procedure for the HSPA job.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Jan. 3 Tr. 20:10-17). The undue delay, confusion of the issues and waste of time, among other things, inherent in allowing this entirely separate debate to play out were obvious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The Court could not, consistent with Rule 403, allow Pierce's counsel to turn her trial into a trial on Tomaszewski's discrimination claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20:18-21.) The Court instructed counsel that Tomaszewski could testify that he brought discrimination claims against the City, but not that he believes Carney was appointed on the basis of race. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21:7-12);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 27:7-10). If evidence of the alleged discriminatory nature of Carney's appointment was admitted, the Court observed, the jury would be \"wondering whose case we're trying.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28:1-2.) In sum, the Court ruled that \"any relevance with respect to the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim is in my view, going to be greatly outweighed by jury confusion, unfair prejudice, and the time that [the City] is going to need to explain why they hired Carney.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28:5-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   iv\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Before trial, Pierce moved to exclude \"evidence related to Plaintiff's withdrawn claim of race [discrimination] pertaining to [the City's] failure to promote [her] to the HSPA position in 2015.\" (ECF No. 49. (\"Plaintiff's withdrawal of her claim has nothing to do with her remaining claims of discrimination, harassment and retaliation. Specifically, Ms. Pierce's decision not to pursue this claim in no way relates to her ability to prove her remaining claims.\").) During oral argument on the motion, the City clarified that it would not offer evidence \"that [Pierce] had a claim [regarding the 2015 promotion] and withdrew it,\" (Jan. 3 Tr. 41:9), but would \"simply hav[e] plaintiff testify that she believes she didn't get [the 2015 promotion] because she was discriminated against by the City.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42:18-20.) Pierce's counsel responded, \"All right. We'll take that. If it ends there.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43:11-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The Court discussed the acceptable parameters of this inquiry with all counsel on the record. The Court noted that it was fair for the City to elicit that Pierce thought she should have received the 2015 HSPA promotion over Lyde even though Lyde scored higher on the civil service exam, given Pierce's belief that she should have been promoted over Albandoz for the other HSPA spot in 2016 in part because she scored higher than Albandoz on the exam.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Jan. 8 Tr. 53:24). The Court invited Pierce's counsel to redirect Pierce on this issue and object during trial if any confusion arose regarding \"how this [evidence] is going to play out.\" (Jan. 3 Tr. 49:10-25, 50:1-3.) Pierce's counsel agreed to these parameters. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49:24-25, 50:4, 50:15-17.) Ultimately, the Court granted Pierce's motion to exclude evidence of her withdrawn discrimination claim. (ECF No. 66.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Pierce now moves for a new trial on the grounds that the Court should not have permitted the City to elicit testimony that Pierce believes she was discriminated against when she was not promoted in 2015. On cross-examination, counsel for the City asked Pierce:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   Q: ... [Y]ou didn't receive the [2015] promotion?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   A: No, I did not receive the promotion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   Q: And you didn't think the interview process was fair?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   A: I, I don't ever recall stating that I thought the interview process was unfair.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   Q: But you thought that they discriminated against you base on your race?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   A: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   Q: Despite the fact that [Adrienne Lyde] was ranked number one and you were ranked number two [on the civil service exam], you believed you should have been promoted over her?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   A: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   Q: And, this was the beginning of time [sic] that ... you believe the City began discriminating against you, because you're Native American?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   A: This is the first time that I felt, yes. I'm gonna answer, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   (Jan. 8 Tr. 118:20-119:5, 121:15-18, 123:1-6.) Counsel later asked Pierce whether she had filed an EEOC charge of discrimination regarding the 2015 promotion. (Jan. 9 Tr. 12:2-5.) Pierce answered, \"Yes.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Pierce's counsel never objected, nor did she redirect Pierce after her cross-examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   A new trial would not be warranted even if Pierce had objected to the City's cross-examination. The City's questions were well within the acceptable (and agreed upon by the parties) parameters of the\n   City's inquiry into the 2015 promotion. To Pierce, discrimination was the only possible explanation for losing out to Albandoz because Pierce viewed herself (the interview apparently notwithstanding) as far more qualified for the HSPA job. Her purportedly superior qualifications of course included the fact that she scored higher on the civil service exam than Albandoz. In 2015, however, her competitor for the first HSPA position, Adrienne Lyde, had the higher exam score-yet Pierce felt she was more qualified than Lyde. The inherent contradiction in these positions was fair game for the City to point out. Pierce's counsel did not disagree at the hearing on the motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   (which explains why counsel did not object to the questioning at trial) and she never redirected her client on the topic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   v\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Finally, Pierce argues that the jury should have been instructed that Pierce claimed she was denied a promotion because of \"her race (non-Hispanic),\" rather than, as the Third Circuit's model instruction recommends, because of \"her race.\" She contends that the verdict form should have also included this language, in order to specify that she claimed she was not promoted because she is not Hispanic. Pierce cites no legal support for her theory, but nonetheless argues that the Court made a \"significant error of law.\" (Pl.'s Mem. 23, ECF No. 86.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Parties are entitled to jury instructions that \"accurately and fairly set[ ] forth the current status of the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Douglas v.

With the exception of Preston's December 12, 2016 email, the emails in question were exchanged roughly two years after Carney's decision to promote Albandoz to the HSPA position. Carney, the person who made the decision to promote Albandoz, did not send or receive any of them. Moreover, the City's Diversity Initiative pertains specifically to exempt employees, executive exempt employees and new hires.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Albandoz and Pierce competed for the HSPA job, a civil service position; Albandoz's promotion would not have increased the percentage of Hispanic exempt employees or new hires in the PDP.
