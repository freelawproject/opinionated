The petitioner also alleges that the respondents failed to provide the petitioner with adequate medical care -- specifically, adequate discharge planning -- in violation of his constitutional rights. However, the petitioner has failed to show how the injunctive relief that he seeks could remedy this past alleged harm, and the petitioner has not cited any cases that present similar circumstances to support such relief. Similarly, the petitioner has not shown that ICE's alleged failure to follow the procedures set forth in its Performance Based National Detention Standards would be redressed by an order returning the petitioner to the United States. The same is true of the petitioner's claims under the APA. Although the petitioner does not specifically identify the agency action that he challenges under the APA, he has not shown that any action could be redressed by the equitable relief that he seeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Indeed, at oral argument, counsel for the petitioner acknowledged that even if the petitioner were brought back to the United States, ICE could validly remove him again, and he would find himself in the same position as he finds himself now.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   When asked about redressability, the petitioner's attorney hypothesized that the petitioner's injuries would be redressed if the petitioner were returned to the United States but then re-removed in a way that is procedurally sound and with a medical discharge plan. However, there is no way that such a process could cure the alleged harm that has already occurred from the first removal, and indeed, such a process would be burdensome for the petitioner, who would be forced to travel back to the United States only to be removed to St. Vincent again. Moreover, it is not clear how the petitioner would undergo this travel, because one of the bases for his claims is that he is not medically fit to fly. The mismatch between the relief that the petitioner seeks and the harm he alleges makes a petition for a writ of habeas corpus an improper vehicle for his claims.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Preiser v.

However, the cases on which the plaintiff relies are plainly distinguishable. In each of these cases, there was a colorable claim that the petitioner would not have been removed but for the procedural error. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Calderon v.

Indeed, the petitioner concedes that if he were to return to the United States, the respondents could lawfully remove him again. Although the procedural errors alleged in this petition call into question the manner of the petitioner's removal, they do not bear on whether the petitioner ultimately would have been removed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Similarly, where a petitioner is removed in violation of a court order staying that removal, courts have required that the petitioner be returned to the United States so that the court orders would be enforced.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Blake v.

At the time that the petitioner was removed from the United States, the immigration authorities had received medical authorization for the petitioner to fly, and neither the petitioner nor his attorneys had provided the respondents with Dr. Pendyal's letter, which, in any event, did not state that the petitioner was not medically cleared to fly, but that Dr. Pendyal would be \"reluctant\" to place the petitioner on an airplane. Am. Pet. Ex. 2. At the time that the petitioner was removed, the respondents had a final order of removal -- one that the petitioner does not dispute was valid and lawful -- and medical clearance for the petitioner to fly. Unlike the situation in\n   <em>\n    Ragbir\n   </em>\n   , there is no allegation that the petitioner was targeted by the immigration authorities for an unlawful reason. Accordingly, the alleged conduct in this case does not rise to the level of \"outrageousness\" in\n   <em>\n    Ragbir\n   </em>\n   , a case in which the respondents were alleged to have intentionally retaliated against the petitioner by attempting to remove him from the United States specifically because the petitioner exercised his constitutional right to engage in political speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The petitioner also seeks a preliminary injunction, seeking essentially the same relief as he does on the merits of his habeas petition. A party seeking a preliminary injunction must show: \"(1) a likelihood of irreparable harm in the absence of the injunction; and (2) either a likelihood of success on the merits or sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation, with a balance of hardships tipping decidedly in the movant's favor.\"\n   <em>\n    Doninger v.

The Government initially argued that the petition is improper because the petitioner is no longer \"in custody.\" However, jurisdiction for the purpose of habeas corpus is measured at the time that the petition is brought.\n    <em>\n     Reyes-Sanchez v.
