(Doc. 70, \u00b6 6.) Plaintiffs subsequently entered into two more HELOC agreements, increasing their line of credit by $50,000 and $183,800, respectively. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8, 10.) All three HELOCs were consolidated and secured by deeds of trust on Plaintiffs' home in Tucson, Arizona.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 6, 8, 10.)

(Doc. 72, \u00b6 18.) Plaintiffs made timely minimum payments until defaulting on a monthly minimum payment due on October 19, 2009. (Doc. 70, \u00b6 16.) Defendant sent Plaintiffs a letter on October 4, 2017, stating that a foreclosure would occur if Plaintiffs did not show the debt was invalid or pay the debt within 30 days. (Doc. 72, \u00b6 33.) On November 27, 2017, Defendant filed a Notice of Trustee's Sale. (Doc. 72, \u00b6 34.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Statute of Limitations\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant contends that it is entitled to summary judgment because the statute of limitations on its right to foreclose did not begin running until it accelerated the debt in November 2017, through the initiation of foreclosure proceedings. Plaintiffs assert that Defendant's right to foreclose accrued no later than May 2011, which puts Defendant's October 2017 demand for payment outside of Arizona's six-year statute of limitations. Summary judgment will be granted in favor of Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   There is a threshold legal question on which the parties disagree: when does the statute of limitations begin running on a claim for a borrower's default on a HELOC that has a defined maturity date? Plaintiffs argue that the statute begins running on the entire outstanding debt when the borrower first fails to make a full minimum monthly payment. They rely exclusively on the Arizona Supreme Court's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Mertola, LLC v.

For two related reasons, their argument is unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   First,\n   <em>\n    Mertola\n   </em>\n   did not announce a bright-line \"open-end account versus closed-end account\" rule. Although the court distinguished between the two types of accounts, it did so only to explain how the\n   <em>\n    Navy Federal\n   </em>\n   rule would give creditors of a certain type of open-end account (i.e., credit cards) the unfair ability to unilaterally extend the statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12568735\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/422/1028/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12568735\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/422/1028/\">\n    at 1031-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, because the date when the entire debt becomes due on a credit-card account is uncertain, application of the\n   <em>\n    Navy Federal\n   </em>\n   rule \"would vest the creditor with unilateral power to extend the statutory limitation period,\" thereby \"functionally eliminat[ing] the protection provided to [borrowers] by the statute of limitations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12568735\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/422/1028/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12568735\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/422/1028/\">\n    at 1032\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This risk is not present with Plaintiffs' HELOC debt because their HELOC agreement clearly states a final maturity date. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 56-1 at 1 (April 9, 2024).) And although the ultimate amount of debt is not certain, because the total debt \"must be paid in full ... by an agreed-on date, a cause of action for the entire balance owed\n   will accrue no later than that date,\" which means \"the creditor may not prevent the statute of limitations from running simply by refusing to accelerate the debt.\"\n   <em>\n    Mertola\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12568735\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/422/1028/\">\n    422 P.3d at 1032\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, the HELOC's defined due date eliminates the very risk that led the\n   <em>\n    Mertola\n   </em>\n   court to create a new rule for credit-card accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs' argument largely ignores the terms of their HELOC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12568735\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/422/1028/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12568735\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/422/1028/\">\n    at 1033\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Parties remain free to contractually define default and otherwise negotiate repayment of debt.\"). Defendant does not exaggerate in arguing that, to apply the\n   <em>\n    Mertola\n   </em>\n   rule, the Court would need to ignore the parties' clear contractual intent. Plaintiffs agreed that they would repay the entire outstanding principal \"in a single payment\" \"[a]t maturity,\" and that, if they missed an interest payment, Defendant could, but was not required to, accelerate the principal. (Doc. 56-1 at 1-2; Doc. 56-2 at 1-2; Doc. 56-3 at 1-2.)

None of their analysis, save one statement, is supported by citation to the record. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 71 at 9-10.) This statement cites to a paragraph in their controverting statement of facts, asserting that the paragraph recites \"the overt events that clearly and unequivocally signaled to the Plaintiff, as it would to any other reasonable borrower, that Defendant had exercised\" the acceleration clause. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.) The cited paragraph, however, is comprised of improper argument, none of which is supported with citation to evidence. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 72, \u00b6 11.1.) Plaintiffs' summary judgment motion is no more helpful, as it is devoted entirely to their argument that the\n   <em>\n    Mertola\n   </em>\n   rule applies. Because invocation of an acceleration clause is not necessary under that rule, Plaintiffs do not argue when the debt was accelerated (or even that Defendant accelerated it). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 54 at 12-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiffs draw the Court's attention to the declaration of Plaintiff William Donges, who asserts that he called Defendant in September 2010 and spoke to an unnamed employee, who told Plaintiff that \"the only payment accepted would be the entire $284,301.27.\" (Doc. 73, \u00b6 13.) As a matter of law, however, no reasonable juror could find that this\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff-initiated\n   </em>\n   conversation was an \"affirmative act\" by Defendant to accelerate the debt.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Navy Fed.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"806888\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/187/493/\">\n    930 P.2d at 1008-09\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding creditor accelerated by sending written notice);\n   <em>\n    Wheel Estate Corp. v.

The 1099-C states \"289,691.63\" as the \"amount of debt discharged.\" (Doc. 72-5.) Plaintiffs allege that although they knew the 1099-C did not extinguish their debt, it nevertheless constituted an enforceable promise from Defendant to not attempt to collect the debt. (Doc. 35 at 20.) They allege that they reasonably relied on that promise by \"undert[aking] several measures to preserve long term residency in the property securing the cancelled debt and ... under[taking] several measures to improve [their] financial condition, such as efforts to obtain a reverse mortgage.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Under Arizona law, \"[p]romissory estoppel provides an equitable remedy that renders a promise enforceable, where a promise has been made which the promissor should reasonably foresee would cause the promisee to rely, and upon which the promisee actually relies to his detriment.\"\n   <em>\n    Sholes v.

To support their argument, Defendant points to evidence that Plaintiffs attempted to negotiate a settlement of the debt\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   issuance of the 1099-C. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 65-2, Ex. C, at 19; Doc. 73, \u00b6\u00b6 20-23.) Plaintiffs' claim of detrimental reliance is belied by their attempt to settle (for a very substantial sum, 50% of $280,000) what they allegedly thought was an uncollectable debt. Thus, this evidence is sufficient to shift the burden on summary judgment to Plaintiffs, who have the ultimate burden of persuasion at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fritz Cos.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11533921\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/210/1099/#p1106\">\n    210 F.3d at 1106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiffs offer no evidence on which a reasonable jury could find that they reasonably relied to their detriment. They merely deny, both in their argument and in the cited documents that purportedly support their argument, that their settlement offer is linked to whether they relied on the 1099-C. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 71 at 13-14 (citing Doc. 72, \u00b6\u00b6 27.1-27.3, 28.1-28.2).)

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 35 at 21; Doc. 67.) Because they failed to \"improve [their] financial condition,\" they remained\n   in the same position they were in prior to the issuance of the 1099-C (i.e., in significant financial debt).

J, at 9.) On November 15, 2017, Defendant sent a second default notice. (Doc. 72, \u00b6 35.) The second notice states that Defendant \"will assume the debt to be valid unless [Plaintiffs], within thirty days after receipt of th[e] notice, dispute the validity of the debt or a portion thereof.\" (Doc. 65-4, Ex.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 73, \u00b6 28.) Defendant, through its attorneys, failed to respond to the letter. (Doc. 35, \u00b6 123; Doc. 73, \u00b6 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In their claim for \"estoppel by inaction,\" Plaintiffs allege that Defendant's failure to respond to their dispute letter \"can only be interpreted in favor of\" their claim that the notice of default was defective. In their equitable estoppel claim, they allege that Defendant misrepresented in the second notice that they had 30 days to dispute the debt, since Defendant planned to and did initiate foreclosure proceedings less than two weeks later. Plaintiffs also allege that both acts were a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As an initial matter, Plaintiffs have not stated a claim for violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, much less offered any evidence that Defendant violated the Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Snyder v.

As Defendant points out, the facts belie Plaintiffs' claims. First, Plaintiffs\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   receive 30 days to dispute the debt. They received the first notice of default on October 4, 2017, and sent a dispute letter on October 25, and Defendant initiated foreclosure proceedings on November 27. Next, Plaintiffs misread the second notice; it states only that Plaintiffs had 30 days to dispute the debt, not that Defendant would wait 30 days before filing the Notice of Trustee's Sale. (Doc. 65-4, Ex. K, at 12.) Thus, Defendant has offered evidence that it did not make a misrepresentation or act inconsistently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Additionally, Plaintiffs acknowledge that the heart of their claims is that Defendant denied them the opportunity to dispute the validity of Defendant's right to foreclose. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 71 at 15 (complaining that Defendant never responded to their dispute letter and stating that \"Defendant should be estopped because the default letter sent to Plaintiff[s] did not give Plaintiff[s] the mandated time to dispute the debt\").) Thus, assuming Defendant made a misrepresentation or acted inconsistently, for two reasons, there is no evidence of injury: first, Defendant's right to foreclose is not barred by the statute of limitations; second, Plaintiffs received the opportunity to dispute the debt by means of this litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The foregoing is sufficient to shift the burden to Plaintiffs, who must come forward with evidence to show a genuine factual dispute.
