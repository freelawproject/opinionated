Supp. 2d 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 697 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) ). Although the court in\n   <em>\n    Morrison\n   </em>\n   applied the heightened pleading standard of Rule 8(a),\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1318, the defense is also insufficient under the notice standard adopted by this Court. Because of the Defendants' failure to identify the particular FLSA exemption(s) that apply, Defendants' affirmative defense does not provide Plaintiff adequate notice to permit Plaintiff to properly litigate this issue. Thus, Defendants should amend this defense to identify the applicable exemption(s) to the FLSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Additionally, Plaintiff argues that the statement, \"Plaintiff was not individually engaged in interstate commerce,\" is a mere denial. Defendants do not contest the point, yet assert that the proper remedy is not to strike the relevant affirmative defenses, but to treat them as specific denials. ECF No. [21] at 3. Courts generally treat denials mislabeled as affirmative defenses as specific denials rather than striking the defenses in cases where a defendant is not permitted to replead its answer and affirmative defenses.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Home Mgmt.

However, because this Court has given Defendants leave to amend, there is no need to keep incorrectly labeled affirmative defenses in Defendants' Answer. The Court will strike every denial incorrectly pled as an affirmative defense. As such, the statement should not be repled as an affirmative defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Fifth Affirmative Defense\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendants' Fifth Affirmative Defense states, \"The action and/or damages claimed in this action are barred by Plaintiff's failure to provide notice of any alleged unlawful pay practice and/or alleged overtime hours worked.\" ECF No. [11] at 7. Plaintiff argues that Defendants' assertion is not an affirmative defense and \"[t]here is no requirement under the FLSA for a plaintiff to have provided notice of an alleged wage violation prior to bringing suit.\" ECF No. [14] (citing\n   <em>\n    Morrison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3168182\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/434/1314/#p1318\">\n    434 F. Supp. 2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1319 ). Defendants counter that in the Eleventh Circuit \"there is no FLSA violation where an employee performs uncompensated work while deliberately preventing his employer from learning about it.\" ECF No. [21] at 5 (referring to the case\n   <em>\n    Allen v. Board of Public Educ.

In reply, Plaintiff emphasizes that the affirmative defense applies only if the employee\n   <em>\n    deliberately\n   </em>\n   prevents his employer from knowing and reiterates that the defense provided by Defendants is \"legally and factually insufficient.\" ECF No. [22] at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   This Court recognizes the Eleventh Circuit decision that deliberately preventing an employer from learning about uncompensated work is a proper affirmative defense to the FLSA. However, that is not the affirmative defense that Defendants have pled here. Parties are confined to their own pleadings. The Court declines Defendants' invitation to construe the affirmative defense to mean something other than what is plainly stated in their Answer. Therefore, the Court grants Plaintiff's Motion to Strike Defendants' Fifth Affirmative Defense without prejudice and with leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Seventh Affirmative Defense\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendants' Seventh Affirmative Defense states, \"The action and/or the damages claimed in this action are barred by res judicata, waiver, estoppel (collateral or otherwise), laches, satisfaction, release or agreement.\" ECF No. [11] at 7. Plaintiff argues in her Motion that: (1) Defendants improperly combined several defenses; (2) each defense lacks the necessary specificity; (3) each doctrine pled requires the Defendants to set forth facts that satisfy each element of the doctrine; (4) waiver, estoppel and laches are not affirmative defenses under the FLSA; and (5) though\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   , satisfaction, release and agreement could be affirmative defenses under the FLSA, without any facts or specificity, the defenses remain improper as written. ECF No. [14] at 6. Defendants counter that \"[i]t simply cannot be said at this stage of the\n   proceedings that Defendants can prove no set of facts to support these defenses.\" ECF No. [21] at 6. As to estoppel, Defendants insist that whether or not the affirmative defense of estoppel may be used will become evident throughout the course of discovery.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3562685\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/495/1306/#p1319\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As previously discussed, discrete defenses that have been improperly combined should be pled separately. Therefore, the Court grants Plaintiff's Motion to Strike Defendants' Seventh Affirmative Defense without prejudice and with leave to amend only those affirmative defenses that are appropriate under the FLSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court now turns to the adequacy of each individual defense.

Moreover, Defendants should not be permitted to list numerous defenses in a single affirmative defense to preserve said defenses. If repled separately as presently written, Defendants' affirmative defenses of estoppel,\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   , satisfaction, release and agreement would be stricken.
