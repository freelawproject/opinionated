The plaintiff requested that the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index be supplemented to include additional information that would help him match the records in the index with the records he received, and the defendant complied. Francis Decl. \u00b6 32, Ex. N. While the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index was being revised, SDNY personnel identified approximately sixty-one pages of records withheld in full or in part in the third release of records that needed further review.

The records were further reviewed and released to the plaintiff, with some information withheld pursuant to FOIA exemptions (b)(5) and (b)(6).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The plaintiff picked up a flash drive containing these additional records and the revised\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index at SDNY during August 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.

No. 68. The defendant then refiled its motion for summary judgment on September 28, 2018. After the plaintiff filed his opposition brief to this motion, the defendant voluntarily undertook an additional search for records responsive to the plaintiff's FOIA request. Dkt. No. 84. The SDNY records manager searched SDNY's storage space and located\n   additional records, twenty pages of which were deemed responsive, nonduplicative records. Gelbke Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-5. These records were then provided to the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The defendant represents that, in total, it produced over 2,000 pages of documents to the plaintiff pursuant to his request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The plaintiff offers several arguments in support of his claim that the defendant has not responded sufficiently to his FOIA request.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff contends that records of three particular speeches allegedly made by U.S. Attorney Bharara were not contained in the defendant's production: (1) a speech delivered in Saratoga Springs, New York, at a New York Press Association convention; (2) a speech made at John Jay College for a Tina Brown event; and (3) a press conference conducted in January 2015 regarding the prosecution of Sheldon Silver, the longtime leader of the New York State Assembly. According to the plaintiff, the fact that the defendant did not produce records related to these speeches indicates that its search was incomplete and executed in bad faith. The plaintiff also contends that he requested notes related to, and incomplete drafts of, speeches given by U.S. Attorney Bharara but that the defendant has not produced such material.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The plaintiff next argues that the defendant's\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index improperly refers to documents withheld as \"nonresponsive\" without further explanation. The plaintiff adds that because the defendant produced other nonresponsive documents, it must produce these documents identified in the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index as nonresponsive, as well as others. In addition, the plaintiff contends in his sur-reply that the defendant withheld several documents or parts of documents pursuant to FOIA exemptions (b)(5) and (b)(6) without a valid basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Moreover, the plaintiff argues that the defendant's search for records was inadequate because the declarations submitted in support of the search do not indicate that \"paper files\" or the \"National Archives and Records Administration\" (\"NARA\") were searched. The plaintiff also argues that the Court cannot rely upon these declarations because the individuals who made the declarations do not have personal knowledge of the defendant's search and because the declarations do not describe the search adequately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Finally, the plaintiff argues that because the defendant executed a voluntary search after it filed its motion for summary judgment, and located additional responsive records, it follows that the initial search was inadequate and conducted in bad faith. The plaintiff adds that he has not been provided with an updated\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index accounting for the records the defendant provided after its voluntary search.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \"In order to prevail on a motion for summary judgment in a FOIA case, the defending agency has the burden of showing that its search was adequate and that any withheld documents fall within an exemption to the FOIA.\"\n   <em>\n    Carney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10511083\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/19/807/#p812\">\n    19 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   812 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(B) ).

Moreover, as discussed in further detail below, there is no evidence that the defendant conducted its search in bad faith such that the Court could reasonably infer that records relating to the three speeches exist and were improperly withheld.

The plaintiff does not specify which \"paper files\" were not searched, and the Francis and Hodge declarations indicate that the defendant conducted a comprehensive search that included all places where responsive documents might be located.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Francis Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 17-18; Hodge Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 13-18.

The defendant confirmed that it delivered all such records to the plaintiff; but it did not provide the plaintiff with notes and drafts related to speeches that were\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   given, because the plaintiff did not request those materials. The defendant's representation on this point is consistent with the expansive search efforts detailed in the declarations attached to the defendant's motion and described above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Therefore, the Court concludes that the defendant did search for and produce notes and other information in incomplete form related to complete speeches given by U.S. Attorney Bharara.

First, the plaintiff contends that the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index improperly refers to some withheld documents as \"nonresponsive\" without further explanation. Relatedly, the plaintiff adds that because the defendant produced other nonresponsive documents, including redundant documents, it must produce these documents identified in the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index as nonresponsive, as well as others. Second, the plaintiff argues that the defendant has failed to produce an updated\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index accounting for the records the defendant provided after its voluntary search of SDNY's storage space.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   A\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index \"must adequately describe each withheld document, state which exemption the agency claims for each withheld document, and explain\n   the exemption's relevance.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

The fact that a responsive record is redundant does not render it nonresponsive. And the allegedly redundant records likely stem from the defendant's attempt to accommodate the plaintiff's complaint that he could not access all the documents in the first release of records, or the plaintiff's own request for additional copies. Nothing in the record indicates that the defendant carried out its responsiveness determinations improperly,\n   <em>\n    Leopold v. Cent.

The defendant's voluntary production of records - made after it provided the plaintiff with the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index - did not involve any withholdings based on a FOIA exemption. Therefore, it was unnecessary to make any revisions to the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index that the plaintiff possessed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Finally, the plaintiff purports to \"renew[ ] his request for an impartial judge\" in his papers opposing the defendant's summary judgment motion.
