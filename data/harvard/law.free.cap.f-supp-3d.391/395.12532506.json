He previously complained about this roof leak to his supervisors. After evaluating all the evidence, the jury found in favor of the Secretary, awarding Mr. Zettlemoyer compensatory damages, back pay, and punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Secretary moves for a back pay award in excess of the jury's advisory verdict; interest on the back pay award; a tax gross up on the back pay award; reinstatement of Mr. Zettlemoyer or, alternatively, an award of front pay; and other equitable relief. Fairmount Foundry seeks post-trial relief asking us to deny all injunctive or equitable relief to Mr. Zettlemoyer, vacate the jury's award of punitive damages and its finding of liability, and, alternatively, order a new trial arguing we erred by failing to instruct the jury on the meaning of at-will employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Finding ample evidence to support the jury's finding of liability and to support a punitive damages award, and finding no error in our jury instructions, we deny Fairmount Foundry's motion in its entirety. We grant in part and deny in part Secretary Acosta's motion by awarding some measure of equitable relief including reinstatement and back pay in accord with accompanying Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Mr. Zettlemoyer testified when he accrued forty-five points in March 2008, Fairmount Foundry did not discharge him. He testified Fairmount Foundry \"fired and rehired\" him, he did not \"punch out\" of work, and \"went back to the floor, finished [his] shift, just came in the next day at the regular time and started as a new man\" meaning he returned to the job as a probationary employee with no points and with the same pay rate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In October 2, 2008, Fairmount Foundry issued four \"employee discipline action notice[s]\" to Mr. Zettlemoyer for various points violations between thirty and forty-five points and imposed penalties ranging from a second written warning to discharge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Zettlemoyer testified Mr. Smith did not explain why he issued four different notices and penalties on the same day and, notwithstanding the penalty of discharge, Mr. Zettlemoyer \"just went back to zero points the next day\" as a probationary employee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Mr. Vaughn testified he fired Mr. Zettlemoyer in 2008 for accumulated attendance points issues and then rehired him. Notwithstanding the foundry's past practice of firing and rehiring Mr. Zettlemoyer for attendance issues, Mr. Vaughn admitted\n   he did not rehire Mr. Zettlemoyer in October 2015, marking him \"ineligible\" for rehire, and admitted October 2015 is the first time Fairmount Foundry marked Mr. Zettlemoyer ineligible for rehire.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Vaughn testified he previously fired and rehired Mr. Zettlemoyer because the foundry considered him valuable and productive and always remained willing to rehire him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Mr. Zettlemoyer's hourly wage at Fairmount Foundry in 2015 and employment history after termination.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In 2015, Mr. Zettlemoyer worked at Fairmount Foundry from January 1 to April 9 and again from July 23 to October 8.

Fairmount Foundry points to testimony (without citation to the transcript), no one at the foundry \"ever treated [Mr.] Zettlemoyer with anything less than general respect as a person and as a worker\" and \"[e]ach member of management expressed some level of regret that his circumstances in October, 2015 warranted termination.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    105\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fairmount concludes there is no evidence on which a reasonable jury could find the decision to terminate Mr. Zettlemoyer is motivated by anything other than his habitual and chronic attendance issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Secretary disagrees, citing a litany of evidence supporting a finding of pretext,\n   including the timeline between Mr. Zettlemoyer's OSHA complaint and his termination.

After four days of evidence, the jury made credibility determinations and found Fairmount Foundry's reason for terminating Mr. Zettlemoyer-the accumulation of attendance points violations-a pretext for retaliatory discharge. There is ample evidence from which the jury could reasonably disbelieve Fairmount Foundry's articulated legitimate reason or believe retaliatory animus was more likely than not a motivating or determinative cause of Fairmount Foundry's conduct. Fairmount Foundry is unhappy with the jury's credibility findings; this is not a basis for a Rule 50(b) motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b) is granted only, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Secretary and giving him the advantage of every fair and reasonable inference, there is insufficient evidence from which a jury reasonably could find liability.

The Act's prohibition on retaliation applies when the adverse action occurs because the employee has engaged in protected activity. An employee's engagement in activities protected by the Act does not automatically render him immune from discharge or discipline for legitimate reasons or from adverse action dictated by non-prohibited considerations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   At the same time, to establish a violation of the Act, Mr. Zettlemoyer's engagement in protected activity need not be the sole consideration behind a discharge or other adverse action. If the protected activity was a substantial reason for the action or if the discharge would not have taken place but for his engagement in protected activity, the Act has been violated. Ultimately, the issue is whether a discharge was because of protected activity will have to be determined on the basis of the facts in the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   Fairmount Foundry has given a non-retaliatory reason for terminating Mr. Zettlemoyer. If you disbelieve Fairmount Foundry's explanation for its conduct, then you may but not need find the Secretary has proved retaliation. In determining whether Fairmount Foundry's stated reasons for its actions were a pretext or excuse for retaliation, you may not question Fairmount Foundry's business judgment. You cannot find retaliation simply because you disagree with the business judgment of Fairmount Foundry or believe it is harsh or unreasonable. You are not to consider Fairmount Foundry's wisdom. However, you may consider whether Fairmount Foundry's reason is merely a cover-up for retaliation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    120\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The issue never hinged on Mr. Zettlemoyer's status as a probationary employee or a member of the Union. Fairmount Foundry could not have terminated him under either status because of a complaint to OSHA. Even if we gave an at-will employment instruction explaining Mr. Zettlemoyer could be terminated for any reason or for no reason at all, Fairmount Foundry could not have terminated him for engaging in protected activity. Fairmount Foundry does not explain how an instruction on at-will employment prejudiced it and, given our charge on the elements of a retaliation claim and pretext, we see no prejudice.

To the extent evidence of \"financial harm\" is required, as suggested by Fairmount, Mr. Zettlemoyer testified as a result of his termination he could not financially care for his children, his girlfriend \"had to pick up more hours,\" and the family needed to move back to his mother's home.\n   <footnotemark>\n    131\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   We award prejudgment interest computed at the IRS overpayment rate in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206621\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   on the $ 25,000 back pay award. The Secretary does not provide us with this calculation. Under Section 6621(a)(1), the overpayment rate \"shall be the sum of - (A) the Federal short-term rate ..., plus (B) 3 percentage points (2 percentage points in the case of a corporation).\" Our accompanying Order requires the Secretary promptly provide us with this calculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    3. We deny a tax \"gross up\" on the back pay award.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The Secretary next argues we should award a tax \"gross up\" on the back pay award to offset the tax liability to Mr. Zettlemoyer of a lump back pay award taxable as ordinary income. In this Circuit, \"an award to compensate a prevailing employee for [his] increased tax burden as a result of a lump sum award will, in the appropriate case, help to make a victim whole.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    132\n   </footnotemark>\n   Unlike prejudgment interest, a prevailing plaintiff is not presumptively entitled to \"an additional award to offset tax consequences above the amount to which [he] would otherwise be entitled.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    133\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our Court of Appeals cautioned \"[e]mployees will continue to bear the burden to show the extent of the injury they have suffered.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    134\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The Secretary seeks a back pay award from October 2015 to March 2019, wages Mr. Zettlemoyer would have earned in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. The Secretary argues a lump sum award paid entirely in one tax year will push Mr. Zettlemoyer into a higher tax bracket requiring a \"gross up\" to offset the tax consequence. The Secretary \"suggests\" increasing any award above $ 38,700 by 12.8% to account for the tax burden on Mr. Zettlemoyer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    135\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The Secretary concedes, however, \"[no] adjustment is needed for the first $ 38,700.00 in back wages and prejudgment interest awarded, because that amount will be taxed in the first or second tax bracket, which is how the vast majority of Mr. Zettlemoyer's earnings were taxed while he worked at Fairmount Foundry.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    136\n   </footnotemark>\n   As previously discussed, we find a back pay award of $ 25,000 appropriate plus an\n   award of prejudgment interest. We have no basis to find this recovery will exceed the $ 38,700 threshold advanced by the Secretary making a tax gross-up award unnecessary. Accordingly, we deny the Secretary's motion seeking a tax gross-up subject to revisiting this analysis should the prejudgment interest exceed $ 13,700.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    4. We order reinstatement of Mr. Zettlemoyer to his job at Fairmount Foundry.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The Secretary seeks reinstatement of Mr. Zettlemoyer to his job at Fairmount Foundry or, alternatively, an award of front pay. The Secretary does not advocate one remedy over the other. \"Should [we] conclude\" reinstatement is the appropriate remedy, the Secretary asks for an order of reinstatement at Fairmount Foundry with the \"same union membership, seniority, sick pay, vacation pay, and other benefits he would have received if he had remained continuously employed at Fairmount Foundry since October 2015\" as well as the removal of attendance points and restoration of union seniority as of July 23, 2015 when his last period of employment began.\n   <footnotemark>\n    137\n   </footnotemark>\n   Alternatively, the Secretary seeks a front pay award of at least $ 275,662.40, a calculation based on an award of 360 weeks of front pay at a $ 708.09 weekly rate used to calculate back pay plus $ 250 per month credit in lieu of health insurance benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Fairmount Foundry responds we should not award front pay to Mr. Zettlemoyer because he failed to mitigate his damages, again arguing he \"fully mitigated\" his damages as of July 25, 2016 when he obtained a job at Veritas Medical Solutions. Fairmount Foundry cites Mr. Zettlemoyer's work history after Veritas: he worked at Veritas only a month when he quit and stayed out of the job market for approximately one year; re-entering the job market in July 2017, he found a job but quit after ten months working there; he found another job in July 2018 at a rate of $ 22.50 per hour but his employer fired him after two weeks; and he has been out of work since July 2018. Fairmount Foundry argues Mr. Zettlemoyer worked only sixteen months during the forty-three months since his termination in October 2015; his post-termination conduct shows he is not entitled to relief in equity; and Mr. Zettlemoyer is able to find a job and could be employed, but he simply has no interest in doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Reinstatement, and its alternative remedy front pay, are a part of the \"make whole\" relief available to a prevailing plaintiff in an employment discrimination case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    138\n   </footnotemark>\n   Reinstatement \"advances the policy goals of make-whole relief and deterrence in a way which money damages cannot.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    139\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[W]hile the availability of money damages may have significance in the district court's consideration of remedies, reinstatement is the preferred remedy in the absence of special circumstances militating against it.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    140\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[A] denial of reinstatement is unwarranted unless grounded in a rationale which is harmonious with the legislative goals of providing plaintiffs make-whole relief and deterring employers\n   from unconstitutional conduct.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    141\n   </footnotemark>\n   Front pay is an alternative to the remedy of reinstatement \"which would be inappropriate where there is a likelihood of continuing disharmony between the parties or unavailable because no comparable position exists.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    142\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   After carefully considering the record evidence, we order Fairmount Foundry reinstate Mr. Zettlemoyer. The jury found Fairmount Foundry liable for retaliation, finding it terminated Mr. Zettlemoyer in October 2015 \"because of his complaint to OSHA or ... his complaint to OSHA [was] a substantial reason for his termination.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    143\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although Mr. Vaughn testified he would not rehire Mr. Zettlemoyer,\n   <footnotemark>\n    144\n   </footnotemark>\n   he also agreed Mr. Zettlemoyer is a productive, valuable employee, and a hard worker and it is \"difficult to find good help. And we had invested time and money in training the man.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    145\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Mr. Zettlemoyer testified he had a \"really good\" relationship with Mr. Smith and Mr. Vaughn.\n   <footnotemark>\n    146\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Zettlemoyer also testified he \"loved\" his job.\n   <footnotemark>\n    147\n   </footnotemark>\n   On cross-examination, Mr. Zettlemoyer testified he tried to provide Fairmount Foundry with a doctor's note after his termination in an effort to explain an unexcused absence because he wanted his job back at the foundry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    148\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Mr. Block testified he had a \"very good working relationship\" with Mr. Zettlemoyer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    149\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Block testified he felt an obligation to give Mr. Zettlemoyer \"fatherly advice\" and it \"pained\" him to terminate Mr. Zettlemoyer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    150\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Block testified to the reasons Fairmount Foundry consistently rehired Mr. Zettlemoyer, explaining \"we liked Zach. We really did.... He worked very well for us. He did his job. He did a very good job for the whole foundry. He was like the go-to guy. He had very good in-depth knowledge of the patterns and molds that we make and very helpful in putting those things together to get them into the production line. He was usually always very mild mannered. He kept things flowing on the production side. His position was what he knew. He brought a great deal of advantageous production work to the floor, and you know, when he was gone, we missed him. And you don't' realize sometimes how much you miss a guy until he's gone. And he - we brought him back because he came back to us and asked us if we would consider rehiring him. So after some thought and ... looking at his history, once again we gave him another opportunity to prove himself.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    151\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   By all accounts, Fairmount Foundry valued Mr. Zettlemoyer's work and Mr. Zettlemoyer enjoyed working there. We recognize Mr. Zettlemoyer's history of attendance issues and those may be the subject of future employment concerns should he continue missing work. We expect Fairmount Foundry will not retaliate in any way against Mr, Zettlemoyer for exercising his rights to seek relief under federal law, including succeeding at trial. As in\n   every case, the past relationship may affect their ability to now work together. But we heard several witnesses compliment Mr. Zettlemoyer. While there may be some tension arising from the Secretary's lawsuit, we do not find \"extraordinary tension or strife within the workplace causing reinstatement to be unfeasible,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    152\n   </footnotemark>\n   particularly where Fairmount Foundry did not respond to the Secretary's motion for reinstatement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   We order Mr. Zettlemoyer reinstated to his position at Fairmount Foundry as of the time of his termination on October 8, 2015. We decline to reinstate with the status advocated by the Secretary: \"same union membership, seniority, sick pay, vacation pay, and other benefits that he would have received if he had remained continuously employed by Fairmount Foundry since October 2015,\" a zero attendance points balance, and union seniority beginning July 23, 2015. To make Mr. Zettlemoyer whole, we reinstate him to the position and employment status as of his termination. Restoring him under the terms advocated by the Secretary would do more than make Mr. Zettlemoyer whole. Having ordered reinstatement, we need not address front pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    5. We permanently enjoin Fairmount Foundry from retaliating against whistleblowers under Section 11(c), order Fairmount Foundry to post an anti-retaliation notice for 60 days, expunge Mr. Zettlemoyer's personnel file, and provide a neutral reference upon request.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The Secretary seeks to permanently enjoin Fairmount Foundry under Section 11(c) from retaliating against other OSHA whistleblowers in the future and seeks other \"appropriate relief\" under Section 11(c) including an order directing Fairmount Foundry to expunge Mr. Zettlemoyer's personnel record of any adverse references to his discharge; post a copy of the Court's Order for sixty days; and provide a neutral or positive employment reference upon request.\n   <footnotemark>\n    153\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Fairmount Foundry responds the Secretary states no basis, and there is no basis in the record, to find equitable relief appropriate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    154\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fairmount Foundry argues there is \"no indication\" it knew Mr. Zettlemoyer engaged in protected activity when he made his OSHA complaint. It further argues because it is now aware of Rule 11(c) \"[i]n light of this extensively litigated case, there is no need for any further notice to Fairmount of the rights afforded to workers under OSHA.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    155\n   </footnotemark>\n   This speculation misses the point, as we understand the Secretary's request for posted notice is to advise other foundry workers of their right to a safe workplace.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Under Section 11(c)(2), we have jurisdiction to \"restrain violations\" of the anti-retaliation provision and \"order all appropriate relief.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    156\n   </footnotemark>\n   When it enacted the Act, \"Congress declare[d] it to be its purpose and policy, through the exercise of its powers to regulate commerce among the several States and with foreign nations and to provide for the general welfare, to assure so far as possible every working man and woman in the Nation safe and healthful working conditions and to preserve our human resources-\" including \"(2) by providing\n   that employers and employees have separate but dependent responsibilities and rights with respect to achieving safe and healthful working conditions.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    157\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   \"Section 11(c) exists to protect whistleblowers and support the purpose of the Act, namely creating a safe and healthy working environment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    158\n   </footnotemark>\n   To advance this purpose, we may grant \"broad permanent injunctions against employers\" who violate Section 11(c) and where, as here, the Secretary \"seek[s] to vindicate a public right (established by Congress) for employees to be free from retaliation for seeking safe workplaces,\" intended by Congress to be broadly construed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    159\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Although there is a dearth of cases, we find support for the imposition of equitable remedies requested by the Secretary. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Marshall,\n   </em>\n   our sister district court found the employer violated Section 11(c) of OSHA after terminating employees who complained about safety and health problems in the workplace.\n   <footnotemark>\n    160\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court ordered reinstatement, permanently enjoined the employer from violating the provisions of Section 11(c), expunged the employees' personnel records of any adverse references resulting from their discharge, and required the employer to post the court's order in a conspicuous area of the workplace for sixty days, finding these remedies appropriate and authorized by the Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    161\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Clearwater Paper,\n   </em>\n   the court found an employer terminated its employee for filing an OSHA complaint in violation of Section 11(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    162\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court found the Secretary entitled to a permanent injunction preventing the company from violating Section 11(c). The court declined to award additional equitable relief, including posting of anti-discrimination notices in all nationwide facilities, distribution to all employees nationwide a statement of whistleblower rights, and to compel all managers and supervisors attend training on whistleblower rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    163\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court declined to award such equitable remedies because the evidence did not show a \"corporate-wide animus towards employees who filed OSHA complaints.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    164\n   </footnotemark>\n   We find this case factual distinguishable as the employer there is a corporation with nationwide facilities and the company sold the facility where the retaliation occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Perez v. U.S. Postal Service,\n   </em>\n   the court found the Postal Service retaliated against an employee for filing a complaint with OSHA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    165\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court permanently enjoined the Postal Service from violating Section 11 (c) limited in scope to the facilities where the Secretary adduced evidence of retaliatory treatment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    166\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Our diligent jury found Fairmount Foundry terminated Mr. Zettlemoyer either because of his safety complaint to OSHA, or because his complaint was a substantial reason for his termination. The Secretary is charged with enforcing Mr.\n   Zettlemoyer's right to be free from retaliation after making a safety complaint. To advance the purposes of the Act, we permanently enjoin Fairmount Foundry from violating Section 11(c) and order Fairmount Foundry; expunge from Mr. Zettlemoyer's personnel record any adverse reference to discharge on October 8, 2015; post a court-approved anti-retaliation notice in a common area for a period of sixty days; and, provide a neutral reference regarding Mr. Zettlemoyer's employment with it to date if requested by subsequent employers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
