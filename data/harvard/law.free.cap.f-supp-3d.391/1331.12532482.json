Toray Chemical Korea Inc. (\"TCK\") requested to be examined as a voluntary respondent. TCK Request for Voluntary Resp't Selection, J.A. Tab 12 (Aug. 7, 2017). Immediately thereafter, Huvis informed Commerce that it did not intend to participate in the investigation. Huvis's Notice of Intent Not to Participate, J.A. Tab 13 (Aug. 10, 2017). The Department then selected TCK as a third mandatory respondent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Selection of an Add'l Mandatory Resp't Mem., J.A. Tab 15 (Aug. 18, 2017).

Tab 5 (Dec. 18, 2017) (\"PDM\"). TCK received a\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   rate and Commerce preliminary calculated an all-others rate of 30.15 percent, reflecting an average of the rates assigned to all three mandatory respondents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PDM at 11 (\"[W]e preliminarily determine that it is reasonable to calculate the all-others rate based on a simple average of the zero percent dumping margin and the two dumping margins based totally on AFA.\"). Commerce did not make any major\n   changes to these rates in its Final Determination and continued to assign the average rate of 30.15 percent from all three mandatory respondents to all-others rate companies, including Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs (Solianus and Consolidated Fibers) are Korean exporters of fine denier polyester staple fiber not individually investigated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Today, Plaintiffs raise a challenge before this court concerning the Department's all-others rate assignment.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Br. Specifically, Plaintiffs claim that because two of the mandatory respondents (Down Nara and Huvis) did not participate in the investigation, they were not \"individually investigated\" within the meaning of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(c)(1)(B)(i), and therefore, should not be included in Commerce's calculation. As a result, Plaintiffs maintain that Commerce's all-others rate was improperly calculated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. Instead, Plaintiffs argue, Commerce should have calculated the all-others rate using only TCK's\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   margin.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9. The Government defends the Department's position as consistent with the Federal Circuit's interpretation of an \"individually investigated\" respondent.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp. to Pls.' Mot., ECF No. 28 (Mar. 22, 2019) (\"Def.'s Br.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ultimately, the Department's methodology in calculating the all-others rate was legally sound and did not produce an unfair result. The court upholds the resulting 30.15 percent all-others antidumping rate assigned to Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201581\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) and will sustain Commerce's determinations unless they are \"unsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(1)(B)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(a)(1), Commerce is required to make a final determination of whether certain merchandise is sold in the United States at less than its fair value. In so doing, the antidumping duty law generally requires that Commerce establish an antidumping duty margin for each exporter for which review is requested. Specifically, the Department must (i) determine the estimated weighted average dumping margin for each exporter and producer individually investigated; and (ii) determine the estimated all-others rate for all exporters and producers not individually investigated. \u00a7 1673d(c)(1)(B)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Because it would be practically impossible to examine\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   producers and exporters of all relevant merchandise, the statute contains a built-in all-others rate calculation-which allows Commerce to assign an antidumping rate to non-investigated firms. Section 1673d(c)(5) governs the method for determining the all-others rate. Generally, the estimated all-others rate is equal to the weighted average of the estimated weighted average dumping margins for exporters and producers that were individually\n   investigated, excluding any zero or\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   margins, or margins based entirely upon facts available. \u00a7 1673d(c)(5)(A). However-foreshadowing the issue at hand-the statute also recognizes an exception to the general rule for calculating all-others rates: if all margins are zero,\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   , or based entirely on facts available, the statute permits Commerce to use \"any reasonable method to establish the estimated all-others rate for exporters and producers not individually investigated.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201581\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   According to the Statement of Administrative Action accompanying the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, the \"expected method in such cases will be to weight-average the zero and\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   margins and margins determined pursuant to facts available.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Statement of Administrative Action, H.R.

Commerce may use other reasonable methods.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201581\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Here, Commerce had assigned two of the mandatory respondents (Down Nara and Huvis) total AFA because they refused to participate in the investigation, and the remaining mandatory respondent, TCK, received a\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   rate-thereby triggering the \"exception\" under section 1673d(c)(5). Commerce then calculated the all-others rate by averaging the rates assigned to these three respondents, including the AFA rates assigned to Down Nara and Huvis. I &amp; D Mem. at 14-18. Plaintiffs challenge the Department's methodology because \"it does not rely upon the margin calculated for the only individually investigated exporter for purposes of determining the all-others rate for Solianus.\" Pls.' Br. at 8. Implicit in (and integral to) Plaintiffs' argument, however, is the claim that because Down Nara and Huvis failed to participate in the investigation, the only \"individually investigated\" exporter was TCK-which received a\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   rate. Essentially, Plaintiffs assert, a company cannot be \"individually investigated\" unless it places\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   information on the record for Commerce to actually examine. Moreover, according to Plaintiffs, Commerce abandoned the \"expected method\" of calculating the separate rate (that is, weight-averaging the margins) without first establishing that the method was not \"feasible\" or would result in a margin that is not \"reasonably reflective of potential dumping margins.\" Pls.' Br. at 8-9. Ultimately, Plaintiffs request that Commerce, on remand, re-calculate the all-others rate using only TCK's\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   margin.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Br. at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   What is the meaning of \"individually investigated,\" in the context of section 1673d ? The statute permits Commerce to \"use any reasonable method to establish the estimated all-others rate for exporters and producers not individually investigated, including averaging the estimated weighted average dumping margins determined for the exporters and producers\n   <em>\n    individually investigated\n   </em>\n   .\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(c)(5)(B). Plaintiffs are pointedly refraining from arguing that the term \"individually investigated\" is ambiguous. Pls.' Reply Br. at 4. That is the correct approach, based on controlling precedent that, \"as a matter of the plain meaning of words, there is no ambiguity in the word 'individually' or in the word 'investigated.' \"\n   <em>\n    MacLean-Fogg v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5920940\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/753/1237/#p1243\">\n    753 F.3d 1237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1243 (Fed. Cir. 2014). Indeed, the phrase \"individually investigated\" \"must be understood to be a term of art,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5920940\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/753/1237/#p1243\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5920940\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/753/1237/#p1243\">\n    at 1244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The issue before the court\n   today boils down to whether firms that were assigned a rate based entirely on AFA (due to a total refusal to cooperate with the investigation) are still considered \"individually investigated,\" so as to be included in the all-others calculation. Plaintiffs assert that entirely non-cooperating firms cannot be \"individually investigated\" unless they place at least some information on the record for Commerce to examine. Pls.' Br. at 8-9. Based on the plain language of the statute and Federal Circuit precedent, the court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The antidumping statute creates two categories of importers or producers: those that are \"individually investigated\" and those that are not. The statute explicitly states that the estimated all-others rate is the rate applied to \"exporters and producers not individually investigated,\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(c)(5)(B). Based on statutory context, then, producers that are \"not individually investigated\" represent the \"all-other\" firms that, \"[a]s a practical matter,\" were \"not selected for examination,\" SAA at 4200.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Changzhou Hawd Flooring Co., Ltd. v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277850\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/1006/#p1011\">\n    848 F.3d 1006\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1011 (Fed.

On the other hand, firms that are \"individually investigated\" fall into the category of producers or exporters wherein Commerce initiated an investigation and made a determination \"based upon the information available to it at the time of the determination, or whether there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that the merchandise is being sold ... at less than fair value.\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673b(b)(1)(A). In other words, \"there is no possible doubt that a [ ] respondent who receives his individual rate has undergone 'individual investigation.' \"\n   <em>\n    MacLean-Fogg Co\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5920940\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/753/1237/#p1243\">\n    753 F.3d at 1243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Neither the statute nor the regulation makes a distinction between mandatory respondents who put forward information for Commerce to evaluate, and mandatory respondents that refuse to do so. In either circumstance, so long as a mandatory respondent received an \"individual rate\"-zero,\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   , based on facts available, or otherwise-that respondent has undergone individual investigation sufficient for section 1673d.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MacLean-Fogg Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5920940\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/753/1237/#p1243\">\n    753 F.3d at 1244-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The legislative history confirms that those who are 'individually investigated' receive an 'individual countervailable subsidy rate' and those who are 'not individually investigated' receive an 'all-others' rate.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiffs' suggestion that it is the submission of evidence or documents that is necessary to fulfill the statutory definition of \"individually investigated\" is not supported by either the statute's text or precedential case law. Indeed, if rates determined entirely under AFA fell outside of the scope of individually investigated respondents (but zero or\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   margins did not), Congress could have easily\n   included that distinction in either the plain language of the statute or in the legislative history.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rosewell v.

There, the Federal Circuit addressed the Department's calculation of a \"separate rate\" for eligible non-mandatory respondents for a proceeding in a non-market economy (China)-the calculation of which follows the same statutory method outlined in section 1673(d). In\n   <em>\n    Bestpak\n   </em>\n   , Commerce selected two exporters as mandatory respondents for investigation, one of which completely failed to cooperate and was assigned the AFA China-wide rate while the other cooperated and was assigned a\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   margin. Because all dumping margins in the investigation were either\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   or AFA rates, Commerce applied the exception found in section 1673d(c)(5)(B) in order to calculate a separate rate for twelve additional exporters that submitted applications. In so doing, Commerce took a simple average of both the\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   rate and the AFA China-wide rate, yielding a 123.83 percent margin. Thereafter, one of the twelve additional exporters and separate rate respondent, Bestpak, challenged the separate rate determination, arguing that the simple average methodology was contrary to law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3569450\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/716/1370/#p1374\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3569450\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/716/1370/#p1374\">\n    at 1375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
