The rule offers little guidance on the degree of relatedness required to circumvent the normal random assignment system to make a direct assignment to a particular judge, including how much factual overlap is needed, how similar the underlying facts must be, or how to define the relevant event or transaction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dakota Rural Action\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201440134\">\n    2019 WL 1440134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 ;\n   <em>\n    Comm. on Ways &amp; Means\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12532553\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/391/93/#p97\">\n    391 F.Supp.3d at 96-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%203388537\">\n    2019 WL 3388537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As support for its Notice of Related Case, the House Judiciary Committee points out that the instant McGahn Subpoena Case and\n   <em>\n    HJC's GJ Materials Application\n   </em>\n   concern \"the same Judiciary Committee investigation being conducted pursuant to the same legal authorities,\" and for the same purpose of obtaining evidence \"to assess whether to recommend articles of impeachment based on the same underlying obstructive acts by President Trump,\" including evidence concerning \"actions taken by\" McGahn. HJC's OSC Resp. at 3, 4. Thus, at first blush, the House Judiciary Committee's view that the related case rule applies is understandable due to these factual connections between the two cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Nonetheless, closer examination demonstrates that these connections between the two cases are too superficial and attenuated for the instant McGahn Subpoena Case to qualify, under Local Civil Rule 40.5(a)(3), as related to\n   <em>\n    HJC's GJ Materials Application\n   </em>\n   .

This McGahn Subpoena Case is a congressional subpoena enforcement action, based on Congress's powers under Article I of the Constitution. Compl. at 52 (Specific Claim for Relief). According to the House Judiciary Committee, \"McGahn's testimony is necessary for the Judiciary Committee to fulfill its constitutional functions,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%203388537\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 II.B (capitalization omitted), to \"address[ ] presidential misconduct,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3, conduct \"oversight and hearings,\" as well as contemplated \"remedial legislation and amendments to existing laws,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57. The Complaint fronts some of the legal issues involving immunity, various privileges and waiver,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 8, 87-95, 112, that likely will arise in this case due to McGahn's unique position as White House counsel, which, according the House Judiciary Committee, gave him a \"central role\" and provided him with the opportunity to \"witness[ ] multiple serious acts of potential obstruction of justice by the President,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. Resolution of those legal issues will turn on the particularized facts pertinent only to McGahn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In contrast,\n   <em>\n    HJC's GJ Materials Application\n   </em>\n   is an ancillary grand jury action requesting the release of grand jury material protected by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   House Judiciary Committee's Appl. for Release of Grand Jury Materials (\"HJC's GJ Appl.\") at 1, ECF No. 1 (No. 19-gj-48). Specifically, in\n   <em>\n    HJC's GJ Materials Application\n   </em>\n   , the House Judiciary Committee seeks \"an order pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e) authorizing the release to the Committee\" of redacted grand jury material in the Special Counsel's Report, and \"access to all underlying grand jury materials that bear directly on President Trump's knowledge of any potential misconduct during the 2016 election campaign and afterward,\" since the \"Committee seeks to use them\" for its \"investigation to determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, 2, 3.\n   <em>\n    HJC's GJ Materials Application\n   </em>\n   principally concerns the scope of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure Rule 6(e)(3)(E)(i), and whether the House Judiciary Committee's investigation to determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment is \"preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. As such, the relief sought in\n   <em>\n    HJC's GJ Materials Application\n   </em>\n   likely turns on the proper interpretation and reach of a federal procedural rule. Those legal issues are entirely absent from the instant McGahn Subpoena case, which, in turn, raises legal issues that turn on particularized facts different from any that will be at issue in\n   <em>\n    HJC's GJ Materials Application\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Consequently, these distinct claims present discrete \"issues of fact\" to be resolved making a related case designation wholly inappropriate.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Singh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12123968\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/187/152/#p154\">\n    187 F.

HJC's GJ Appl. at 13. Indeed, due to the secrecy accorded to the grand jury materials sought in\n   <em>\n    HJC's GJ Materials Application\n   </em>\n   , the House Judiciary Committee has outlined \"Grand Jury Handling Procedures,\" which have been adopted to protect any such materials released to the Committee, that require \"any grand jury materials obtained by the Committee to be stored in a secure area with access limited to Members of the Committee, certain designated staff, and Members of [the House Permanent and Select Committee on Intelligence] and their designated staff.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11447584\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/211/157/#p159\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These special handling procedures being proffered for the grand jury materials sought in\n   <em>\n    HJC's GJ Materials Application,\n   </em>\n   compared to the demand for compelled public testimony by McGahn in the instant case, only highlight the divergent sets and types of evidence sought that set the two cases apart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In short, rather than \"involve common issues of fact,\" the different claims in each case present distinct \"issues of fact\" to be resolved.

The purpose behind the House Judiciary Committee filing both actions, however, is insufficient to support a claim of relation because a litigant's reason for filing two cases begs the crucial question whether the two cases involve \"common issues of fact.\" The principle behind the related case rule is that in certain instances, the strong presumption of random case assignment is outweighed by the interests of judicial efficiency in narrow circumstances, such as when virtually identical and highly overlapping issues of fact are likely to be resolved in two cases. In such a truly related case, resolution of the cases by the same judge would promote just and efficient resolution of legal claims. As McGahn points out, a litigant's purpose \"says nothing about whether the cases are related from the perspective of the adjudicative process, which asks whether the two cases require resolution of sufficiently common issues such that efficiency would favor adjudication by a single judge.\" McGahn's Obj. at 4. Relation based on a litigant's purpose simply sweeps too broadly.

Even though the House Judiciary Committee filed this case and\n   <em>\n    HJC's GJ Materials Application\n   </em>\n   to seek evidence for its ongoing investigation, this congressional subpoena enforcement action \"arises out of the Judiciary Committee's efforts to enforce a duly authorized, issued, and served Congressional subpoena to McGahn.\" Compl. at 1. The issuance of the McGahn Subpoena, and McGahn's refusal to comply, is the event or transaction that uniquely precipitated this action.\n   <em>\n    HJC's GJ Materials Application\n   </em>\n   , in contrast, grows out of the House Judiciary Committee's other efforts to obtain grand jury materials in and underlying the Special Counsel's Report.
