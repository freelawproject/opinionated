BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The fundamental allegations of the amended complaint, taken in the light most favorable to Camco, show the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Camco manufactures equipment for recreational vehicles (\"RVs\"), including electrical adapters (sometimes called \"dogbones\") and electrical extension cords used to connect to power sources. (Doc. 16 \u00b6 8.) Its cords are black with yellow ends, heads, or receptacles, which it asserts is an ornamental trade dress. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) Camco sells its products through stores, catalogs, and the internet, and has sold its products with its trade dress since approximately March 2005. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9, 12.) Defendants sell similar products that Camco alleges will likely cause confusion among consumers, because the products are of the same type, sold through the same channels of trade, and have \"identical or nearly identical colors and color combinations of a black cord with yellow ends, heads, or receptacle.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24, 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

A federal claim for trade dress infringement arises under Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act when \"(1) the trade dress is primarily non-functional; (2) the trade dress is inherently distinctive or has acquired a secondary meaning; and (3) the alleged infringement creates a likelihood of confusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Tools USA &amp; Equip.

Therefore, Camco's allegations that its trade dress is inherently distinctive (Doc. 16 \u00b6\u00b6 18, 47) fail as a matter of law. Camco acknowledges as much by not responding directly to this argument, but rather making its arguments about secondary meaning.

Trek Power's argument is not persuasive. Camco has alleged sufficient facts that Defendants have directly and intentionally copied Camco's trade dress and that consumer confusion is likely to result.
