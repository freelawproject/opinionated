Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This is a trademark-infringement case in which Plaintiff Reinalt-Tire Corporation (\"RTC\"), which operates various \"Discount Tire\" stores, alleges that Defendant Mavis Tire Supply, LLC has infringed its registered \"Discount Tire\" mark. Mavis operates various stores under the name \"Mavis Discount Tire.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   RTC was started in 1960 and currently employs over 22,000 people in over one thousand stores in thirty-five states. In 2018, it ranked 95th on Forbes's list of America's Largest Private Companies. RTC operates its Discount Tire stores primarily in the southeast.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Until 2018, Mavis was concentrated in the northeast and did not operate any Mavis Discount Tire stores in the southeast. However, beginning in 2018, Mavis purchased various Kaufman Tire and Sun Tire stores in Georgia and Florida. It converted these stores into Mavis Discount Tire stores. Therefore, according to RTC, Mavis is now infringing its mark in the same geographic market in which RTC operates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On December 26, 2018, RTC filed this lawsuit, asserting the following counts: (1) federal trademark infringement in violation of Lanham Act \u00a7 32; (2) unfair competition in violation of Lanham Act \u00a7 43(a); (3) trademark dilution in violation of O.C.G.A. \u00a7 10-1-451(b) ; (4) violation of the\n   Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act; (5) unfair competition in violation of O.C.G.A. \u00a7 23-2-55 ; and (6) common-law trademark infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Before the Court is RTC's motion [5] for a preliminary injunction, which pertains to its claims for trademark infringement and trademark dilution. RTC seeks to prevent Mavis from using the Mavis Discount Tire mark in Georgia or Florida while this suit is pending.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following the parties' agreement on a discovery and briefing schedule, the motion is now ripe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Preliminary Injunction Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   To obtain a preliminary injunction, RTC must demonstrate that (1) its claims have a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) it will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction; (3) the harm it will suffer in the absence of an injunction would exceed the harm suffered by Mavis if the injunction is issued; and (4) an injunction would not disserve the public interest.\n   <em>\n    Johnson &amp; Johnson Vision Care, Inc. v. 1-800-Contacts, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11453698\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/299/1242/#p1246\">\n    299 F.3d 1242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1246-47 (11th Cir. 2002).

However, the examiner ultimately approved the mark after RTC submitted (1) declarations regarding public recognition of the mark; (2) a declaration from a linguistics expert that the mark is not generic; and (3) a survey to demonstrate that consumers principally understand \"Discount Tire\" to be a brand name.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The parties present a variety of evidence regarding whether the mark is descriptive or generic, which the Court examines below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Linguistics\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Much of the parties' argument involves linguistics evidence, including that presented to the PTO examiner and additional evidence provided for the purpose of this case. RTC essentially argues that there is no such thing as a \"discount tire\" but that, instead, it sells tires that are discounted. In other words, RTC argues that \"discount\" is a descriptive term used to modify \"tire\" and that the phrase as a whole is descriptive, not generic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   RTC's experts Dr. Ronald Butters and Dr. Robert Leonard have provided opinions, based on their assessment of dictionaries, articles, advertisements, websites, and consumer reviews, that the phrase is not generic. Butters has opined that \"discount tire\" is a descriptive phrase, with \"discount\" serving as an adjective to modify \"tire.\" Based on its experts' testimony, RTC argues that \"discount tire\" is, linguistically, the same as \"flat tire\" or \"rear tire\" in that each describes a quality, not a type or category, of tire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   RTC further points to the\n   <em>\n    Consumer Reports\n   </em>\n   tire-buying guide that lists various tire categories, but no category of \"discount tires.\" RTC notes that no publication in evidence has such a category. Further, RTC was awarded \"Brand of the Year\" in the category of automotive services, not \"discount tire\" services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   RTC also points to testimony from Mavis's advertising executive and CEO that Mavis did not refer to a type of tire as a \"discount tire\" and from Mavis's vice president for Georgia and Florida that he knew of no trade organization or publication that refers to a category of service as \"discount tire\" or retailer that sold a tire called a \"discount tire.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Court concludes that the linguistics evidence weighs against finding the phrase generic. The argument that there is no category of tire that is a \"discount tire\" but, instead, that a tire may be discounted (whether temporarily or permanently) appears to have substantial merit. This would lead the Court to conclude that the phrase as a whole describes a characteristic or quality of the product sold, not the identity of the product sold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Other Use\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Mavis places heavy emphasis on historical uses of the phrase \"discount tire\" by tire dealers and manufacturers in advertisements and articles since at least 1914 (in other words, well before RTC used the phrase).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the study of its expert Dr. Edward Finegan, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. ran an advertisement in 1914 stating that \"the same money he would be asked for some discount tire would buy a bigger, better Goodyear.\" [62-42] at 59. Continuing into the 1920s, Goodyear advertised, \"After you have used discount tires buy GOODYEARS for Quality and Service.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The United States Rubber Company ran advertisements in 1921 asking, \"Why ... are they offered such hodge-podge stocks of 'discount tires,' 'odd lots,' 'seconds,' 'retreads' and other so-called bargains of uncertain origin?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77.

For instance, a California store referred to itself (in 1959) as the \"World's Largest Discount Tire Dealer,\" and an Arizona store referred to itself (in 1960) as \"Arizona's Largest Independent Discount Tire and Seat Cover Distributor.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 103-09.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   RTC responds, based on Dr. Leonard's analysis, that these advertisements (the number of which, it contends, is small in comparison to the amount of material Finegan reviewed) use the phrase descriptively (in other words, as a characteristic or feature of a tire, not the name of a particular item). Further, it argues, isolated examples should not be determinative of genericness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Mavis also argues that third-party retailers have used the phrase \"Discount Tire\" in their names for years. It points to various sources, one identifying 283 businesses in thirty-nine states and another pointing to 292 businesses in forty-two states. These include Devonshire Discount Tire, Auto Body &amp; Repair Center in New York (operating for sixty years) and Bear Alignment Discount Tire in Pennsylvania (since 1935). At least fifty-two of them are in Georgia or Florida, including Johnny Myers Discount Tires and Auto Repair, which has operated in Fort Myers, Florida\n   for forty-three years. Mavis argues that this evidence of unaffiliated businesses incorporating the phrase in their names supports genericness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller's Ale House, Inc. v.

RTC obviously concedes descriptiveness; indeed, its argument is just that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Mavis also argues that RTC's own use of the term supports a finding that it is generic. Specifically, Mavis points to RTC's statement that the name is \"a promise for low [tire] prices\" and that its stores are discount tire stores. [63-1] at 18. It also points to RTC's branding expert, Erich Joachimsthaler, who testifies that the founder believed the name told customers they could get a good deal at his store. RTC's executive vice-president Dean Muglia stated that he originally asked what was \"the name of this company that sells discount tires\" only to be told, \"No, Discount Tire Company\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   the company name.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37. Muglia has stated that the words inform customers that they can get a competitive price on tires.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Importantly, however, these examples are not customer-facing. Even so, \"a small number of casual, isolated generic name references by the trademark owner will usually not be enough to prove that the term has become a generic name to the public.\" MCCARTHY ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 1269 n.2, \u00a7 12:13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Ultimately, although the Court concludes that the evidence regarding third-party usage supports Mavis's position, it is not dispositive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Survey Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Much of the parties' argument focuses on their competing survey experts and these experts' reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   RTC's expert is Matthew Ezell. His report attaches a survey conducted in 2013 by the late Gerald Ford, who founded the firm for which Ezell works. Ford conducted the 2013 survey (across more than thirty-five U.S. markets, including Georgia and Florida) in support of RTC's federal trademark application. Ford's survey concluded that 80% of relevant consumers recognize Discount Tire as a brand name. Based on this, he concluded that the principal significance of \"discount tire\" was as a brand name or trademark, rather than a generic term or designation, and that the mark was strong and famous among potential tire purchasers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Ezell ran a similar survey in 2019, resulting in a finding that between 76% and 84% of consumers recognize Discount Tire as a brand name for retail tire services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Ezell and Ford conducted their consumer surveys under the \"\n   <em>\n    Teflon\n   </em>\n   \" research design model employed in\n   <em>\n    E.I.

This, Mavis contends, is because\n   <em>\n    Teflon\n   </em>\n   surveys do not account for multiple businesses using the term in their brand names, and thereby provide the possibility of false positives, in which a consumer may recognize that \"Discount Tire\" is a brand name but associate the name with a different business also including the phrase in its name.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Although the\n   <em>\n    Teflon\n   </em>\n   survey did originate in the context of a party attempting to show that a coined term had\n   <em>\n    become\n   </em>\n   generic over time, RTC responds by pointing out that numerous courts (including some in this circuit) have relied on\n   <em>\n    Teflon\n   </em>\n   surveys in cases regarding non-coined terms.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Booking.com B.V. v.

McCarthy has opined that the view that consumer perception is irrelevant for a non-coined term \"is to assume the result before making an analysis of that which is to be decided.\" MCCARTHY ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 1269 n.2, \u00a7 12:17.50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Mavis's survey expert is Yoram (Jerry) Wind, Lauder Professor Emeritus and Professor of Marketing at the Wharton School, and a member of the Marketing Hall of Fame. Wind designed his own study of past and future tire buyers both nationwide and throughout Georgia and Florida.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   This study allowed participants to choose one or more of the following responses regarding the phrase \"discount tire\": (1) used by only one company; (2) used by more than one company as part of the company's name or as a product name; and (3) used by more than one company generally to refer to a type of business. The results demonstrated that only roughly 23% of participants associated the phrase \"Discount Tire\" with a single company.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   RTC critiques Wind's survey methodology as inappropriately novel and flawed. It points to Ezell's testimony that Wind's survey design is \"confusing, biased, and fails to reliably measure the primary significance\" of the term. [67] at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   RTC further contends that Wind improperly combines the genericness inquiry (which, it states, should be a dichotomous choice between brand or common name) with secondary-meaning questions (whether consumers associate the term with one company or multiple companies). This leads, according to RTC, to descriptive terms that are used by multiple companies being improperly characterized as generic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Court finds that a\n   <em>\n    Teflon\n   </em>\n   survey is not inherently inappropriate in this context. Wind's survey indeed appears to be directed largely toward secondary meaning rather than whether the mark at issue is generic or descriptive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Mavis also contends that RTC's surveys are flawed because they are limited to areas in which RTC stores are located. Specifically, Ford's survey was conducted in thirty-seven markets in the continental United States with three or more Discount Tire stores within a three-mile radius. Ezell's survey was conducted in Atlanta, Jacksonville, and Orlando metropolitan areas, all of which have seven or more Discount Tire stores within a twenty-five-mile radius.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   This, according to Mavis, inappropriately biases RTC's surveys. Mavis points out that RTC asked Google to perform a survey in 2015, and the results of that survey showed that 40% of nationwide respondents had not heard of Discount Tire. Further, Wind has concluded that Ford's and Ezell's conclusions cannot be extrapolated nationwide or even throughout Georgia or Florida.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   However, Ezell has testified that such a survey must be performed in markets in which consumers would have had the opportunity to be exposed to the plaintiff's use of the term at issue. Further, RTC contends, because Ezell's survey was conducted in connection with the preliminary injunction motion, it was appropriate to conduct it in cities where the alleged confusion is occurring. It argues that Mavis has not provided any data to suggest that consumers in other parts of Georgia and Florida view the terms differently.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Ultimately, the survey evidence conflicts. The parties dispute which type of survey is appropriate and point to purported flaws in each other's surveys. However, the Court finds that the survey evidence as a whole favors RTC. Courts have considered\n   <em>\n    Teflon\n   </em>\n   surveys to be appropriate in the context of a non-coined term such as that at issue here. By contrast, Mavis has provided no authority that the entirety of its survey should be used for the generic-versus-descriptive inquiry (as opposed to secondary meaning). Further, the Court sees no reason why a survey conducted in the relevant market for the preliminary injunction is inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    iv. Conclusion: Descriptive\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Ultimately, the Court is faced with conflicting evidence regarding whether the phrase \"discount tire\" is generic or descriptive. The Court finds particularly persuasive that \"discount\" is used as an adjective to describe \"tire\" but that there is no such thing as a permanent \"discount tire.\" Rather, a tire may be discounted for a period, or even for its life-span, but there is not a particular \"discount tire.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Regarding the survey evidence, the Court finds Ford's and Ezell's surveys persuasive. Although courts have disagreed on whether a\n   <em>\n    Teflon\n   </em>\n   survey is appropriate in the context of a non-coined term, the Court finds that it, in combination with the other evidence, supports a finding that the mark is likely not generic. Although Mavis argues that the surveys were inappropriately limited in geographic scope, it has not provided the results of a nationwide\n   <em>\n    Teflon\n   </em>\n   survey to combat Ford's and Ezell's results. Further, although Wind's survey produced results that would support a finding of genericness, the Court is not persuaded that his survey is directed entirely to the generic versus descriptive inquiry. As RTC points out, Wind's survey pertains to whether a customer associated the \"discount tire\" phrase with one or more companies. This inquiry meanders into the secondary-meaning inquiry, which the Court will address next. However, for\n   purposes of determining whether the mark is generic, the Wind survey does not sufficiently rebut the findings of the Ford and Ezell survey findings that the mark is heavily associated in the mind of customers with a business, as opposed to a common noun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Although Mavis points to other businesses and entities that have used \"discount tire\" to refer to goods and services, the Court does not find this usage dispositive. Some uses appear to be more descriptive than generic, for instance, advertisements that appear to use \"discount\" as a modifier for \"tire\" rather than advertising an item known as a \"discount tire.\" Some usage (other businesses, etc.) weighs slightly against finding the term to be descriptive. However, given the minimal instances to which Mavis points, the Court is not persuaded that this usage overcomes the evidence that weighs in favor of concluding that the term is descriptive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Court also notes that its conclusion is based in part on the fact that RTC has a registered word mark, so Mavis bears the burden of demonstrating that the mark is not valid by a preponderance of the evidence. The Court concludes that it has failed to carry that burden. The outcome might be different if no registration existed and the burden were solely RTC's, but the Court holds at this stage that RTC is likely to prevail in demonstrating that its mark is descriptive, not generic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Secondary Meaning\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Having concluded that RTC has demonstrated that it is likely to show its mark to be descriptive rather than generic, the Court now turns to the question of whether the mark, assumed to be descriptive, has acquired secondary meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   RTC contends that its mark has developed secondary meaning based on its \"longstanding exclusive use in the Southeast, in combination with substantial advertising and sales ....\" [5-1] at 20.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    St. Luke's Cataract &amp; Laser Inst., P.A. v. Sanderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048542\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/573/1186/#p1209\">\n    573 F.3d 1186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1209 (11th Cir. 2009). RTC also points to various awards its brand has received, such as Discount Tire receiving Harris Poll/EquiTrend's \"Brand of the Year\" in the \"Automotive Service Center\" category for five consecutive years (2013 through 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In addition, Dr. Butters performed a study of Yelp reviews of tire dealers. According to this study, although the 435 reviewers mentioning \"snow tires\" and 230 reviewers mentioning \"all-season\" tires treated those terms as generic, the preponderance of usage of the term \"discount tire\" by consumers was as a compound proper noun to refer to RTC's business. In one database (in fact, the largest database) that Dr. Butters reviewed, between 97 and 98% of the usage of the phrase \"discount tire\" was as a trademark. Yelp and Atlanta tire-store customer reviews of RTC also, per Dr. Butters, demonstrated that the primary significance was as a trademark.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   RTC has, over the past fifty-eight years, spent over one billion dollars promoting its marks, and has a television commercial still running that originally aired in 1975 (that was named \"The World's Best Broadcasting Advertisement\" by the Hollywood Radio and Television Society in 1976 and\n   set a Guinness World Record for the longest-running television commercial in 2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   RTC promotes its \"discount tire\" mark in various ways, including the internet, on a Nascar car, and in its retail stores. It provided evidence to the PTO in 2014 of secondary meaning based on evidence of billions of dollars of sales and over $1 billion in advertising. Since that time, it asserts, its sales have nearly doubled and its advertising spending has increased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Based on the evidence, the Court finds that RTC is likely to succeed on the merits of its argument that it has demonstrated secondary meaning. Specifically, RTC is particularly likely to prevail because Mavis has not met its burden to show by a preponderance of the evidence that RTC's mark is not valid for lack of secondary meaning. Although the Court has considered Dr. Wind's survey report in the context of secondary meaning (where it seems more appropriate), this does not meet Mavis's burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Therefore, the Court will proceed to analyze likelihood of confusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

An arbitrary mark is a word or phrase that bears no relationship to the product (e.g., \"Sun Bank\" is arbitrary when applied to banking services).

RTC contends that harm will occur because the two brands have different associations. Mavis's expert Dr. Joel Steckel has opined that if the mark is valid and there is a likelihood of confusion, a disruption of the brand association networks possibly would be harmful and that it would be difficult to calculate the financial injury of rendering the mark generic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Mavis argues that the delay precludes relief. A delay, though not inherently fatal, can weigh against finding irreparable harm.\n   <em>\n    Wreal, LLC v.

Mavis points to the fact that RTC also has ignored other businesses in Georgia and Florida that use the phrase \"discount tire\" in their names.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   The Court concludes that any purported delay by RTC does not defeat a finding of irreparable injury.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ga.

Ga. 1989) (finding irreparable harm despite two-year\n   delay by the plaintiff, noting that there was no evidence that such delay had prejudiced the defendant).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Here, as discussed in more detail above in the context of Mavis's laches argument, the purported delay resulted from the fact that Mavis originally used the Mavis Discount Tire mark in a market that did not overlap with RTC's. Once the markets began to overlap, RTC promptly filed this action and the motion for a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Balance of the Equities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Mavis argues that an injunction \"would strip [it] of its ability to use its decades-old name to identify its stores in Georgia and Florida, thus inhibiting Mavis's ability to communicate the nature of its business to consumers, jeopardizing the goodwill built up with customers, and wasting the millions expended on rebranding and advertising, not to mention the millions more it would cost to rebrand yet again if Mavis ultimately prevails.\" [63-1] at 49-50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   RTC contends that Mavis may continue to do business in its Georgia and Florida stores under its prior marks, but allowing it to use the \"Mavis Discount Tire\" name while this suit is pending would cause significant damage to RTC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   In light of RTC's likelihood of success on the merits and demonstration that irreparable harm is likely, the Court concludes that the balance of the equities favors granting injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Public Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Mavis argues that the primary public-interest factor here is the potential effect on competition, both for Mavis and other retailers in Georgia and Florida that use \"discount tire\" to identify their businesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   RTC responds that the public interest is served by preventing confusion in the marketplace and guaranteeing consumers the product they desire.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Express Franchise Servs., L.P. v.

The public interest is served by protecting valid trademarks from infringement or dilution and preventing confusion in the marketplace.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   RTC's motion for a preliminary injunction will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   As the parties undoubtedly are aware, a preliminary injunction requires the moving party to post a security bond. FED. R. CIV. P. 65(c). RTC has indicated in its briefing that it is prepared to post a bond. However, the parties have not discussed in briefing what amount of bond would suffice. Because the Court requires more information to adequately set bond, it will provisionally set bond at a nominal amount of $5000, to be potentially revised if either party files an objection to that amount.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Builder's World, Inc. v.

Supp. 2d 1065\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1078 (E.D. Wis. 2007). If neither party files an objection within seven days, the Court will deem any objections to be waived. RTC will then have to post a bond of $5000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, RTC's motion [5] for a preliminary injunction is granted. Mavis is ordered not to use the \"Mavis Discount Tire\" mark in Georgia or Florida until further order of this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   This Order is stayed until RTC has posted bond. Once it has posted nominal bond of $5000 (if no objections are filed) or the Court has ruled on any objections to the\n   $5000 bond amount, the stay will terminate and Mavis will comply with this Order within fourteen days of the termination of the stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   Mavis's motion [70] to strike is denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED this 10th day of July, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-191\">\n    RTC does not seek similar relief regarding Mavis's northeastern stores.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-192\">\n    RTC also has two registrations for marks that include design elements. Because RTC seeks to stop Mavis from using the very phrase \"Discount Tire\" in its name, those design marks are not relevant for the Court's purposes in ruling on RTC's motion for a preliminary injunction. Mavis argues that the fact that RTC disclaimed in those applications the exclusive right to use the words \"Discount Tire\" apart from the mark as shown in the relevant designs supports the conclusion that the words alone are generic. However, disclaimers concede only descriptiveness, not genericness.

RTC contends that it does, and points out that dictionaries include entries for various compound nouns using \"discount\" or \"tire\" as one word of the phrase. Mavis argues that each of the two terms is in the dictionary and anyone can determine the meaning of the combination.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     E. Air Lines, Inc. v. N.Y.

Mavis argues that RTC's reliance on Google searches fails because its methodology is nothing more than Hoffman's speculation. However, because the Court concludes that RTC has met its burden regarding descriptiveness without Dr. Hoffman's testimony, it need not reach the merits of Mavis's objections.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-201\">\n    Dr. Joachimsthaler's report relies in part on EquiTrend.
