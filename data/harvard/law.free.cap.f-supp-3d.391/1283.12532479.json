Before verification, the Department understood that Linyi Chengen's documents, such as its raw material ledgers, inventory movement worksheets, warehouse-out slips, and accounting vouchers, supported the quantity of logs that Linyi Chengen purchased and consumed during the period of investigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2053%2C460\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2053%2C460\">\n    at 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Commerce considered Linyi Chengen's reporting of the log quantity to be \"imprecise\" based on observations made at verification, such as how the suppliers marked and measured the log diameter, how the production manager verified the log supply through spot checks, and whether Linyi Chengen used the Chinese National Standard conversion table.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2053%2C460\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   When describing the intermediate input methodology, Commerce stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   In some cases, a respondent may report factors used to produce an intermediate input that accounts for an insignificant share of total output. When the potential increase in accuracy to the overall calculation that results from valuing each of the [factors of production] is outweighed by the resources, time, and burden such an analysis would place on all parties to the proceeding, the Department has valued the intermediate input directly using a [surrogate value]. Also, there are circumstances in which valuing the [factors\n   of production] used to yield an intermediate product would lead to an inaccurate result because the Department would not be able to account for a significant cost element adequately in the overall factors buildup. In this situation, the Department would also value the intermediate input directly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Final IDM at 23 (footnotes omitted).

Linyi Chengen's Rule 56.2 Motion for Judgment on the Agency Record\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Linyi Chengen, one of the mandatory respondents in this investigation, contests\n   three aspects of Commerce's findings and actions in this investigation: (A) Commerce's handling of the record evidence; (B) Commerce's use of the intermediate input methodology to value Linyi Chengen's log inputs; and (C) Commerce's selection of the veneer input surrogate values.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Commerce's Handling of Record Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Commerce \"made observations\" at verification \"that called into question the accuracy of [Linyi] Chengen's log purchase and consumption records, and its ability to substantiate such records.\" Final IDM at 24. These observations include Commerce's finding that Linyi Chengen's \"reporting of the log quantity is imprecise\" because Linyi Chengen spot-checks to confirm the accuracy of measurements for log deliveries and uses the diameter of the small end of the log and its length to calculate the logs' volume.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25. Commerce also took issue with Linyi Chengen's claims that the formula it uses to measure log volume is the Chinese National Standard, which was allegedly provided at verification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 25. Commerce observed further that Linyi Chengen was unable to provide supplier invoices for its purchases of poplar log, which is Linyi Chengen's \"most significant input.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Linyi Chengen contends that Commerce mishandled the administrative record and acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Linyi Chengen's Br. 13. Linyi Chengen argues that Commerce \"made several factual misrepresentations\" in the\n   <em>\n    Final Determination\n   </em>\n   , \"which in turn became the basis for applying\" Commerce's intermediate input methodology.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   These alleged factual misrepresentations \"contradict findings in the verification report and ignore observations and information provided at verification.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Specifically, Linyi Chengen takes issue with (1) Commerce's rejection of Linyi Chengen's method of spot-checking to confirm the accuracy of measurements for log deliveries, even though that is the exact same method that Commerce's representatives used at verification; (2) Commerce's finding that Linyi Chengen's conversion table and formula are \"inherently imprecise\" because they rely only on the diameter of the smaller end of the log and its length; (3) Commerce's conclusion that \"there is no evidence that the conversion table and formula\" that Linyi Chengen relies upon is the Chinese National Standard; and (4) Commerce's finding that Linyi Chengen's reported log consumption is unreliable because it cannot be cross-checked with supplier invoices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   13-23. Linyi Chengen argues that it attempted to correct these alleged errors that first appeared in the\n   <em>\n    Final Determination\n   </em>\n   , but Commerce acted arbitrarily in refusing to accept the corrections.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendant counters that \"[a]ny variance between [Linyi] Chengen's interpretation of the verification report and Commerce's\n   <em>\n    Final Determination\n   </em>\n   does not constitute arbitrary and capricious handling of record evidence, but rather reflects Commerce's weighing of the evidence.\" Def.'s Resp. 43.

The conversion table and formula on the record is partially translated.

Commerce's verifiers allegedly detached the title page and accepted only the second page with the conversion table and formula. The court is troubled by the varying accounts of events at verification presented by the Parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Commerce found also that it was \"unable to cross-check [Linyi] Chengen's reported consumption of poplar against any third-party sources (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , supplier invoices).\" Final IDM at 25. The\n   <em>\n    Final Determination\n   </em>\n   does not address the delivery sheets provided by suppliers (\"warehouse-in tickets\") or the copies of invoices provided by Linyi Chengen to its suppliers for official value-added tax purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Linyi] Chengen Verification Exhibit 26, at 9, 32-53, CD 628, bar code 3622212-27 (Sept. 22, 2017) (titled \"Poplar Log Cost Package Part 1\").

The court finds that Commerce's conclusion that Bayley provided incomplete information was reasonable because under United States law, Bayley should have provided information about the affiliated relationship of Person C and Person B who are lineal descendants. Commerce satisfied its burden under section 1677m(d) both to inform Bayley that Bayley's affiliation response was deficient and to allow Bayley to correct its response after Commerce issued the first supplemental questionnaire.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NSK Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3868712\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/481/1355/\">\n    481 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1360 n.1. Bayley contends also that Commerce must provide a party with an opportunity to remedy or explain a deficiency \"regardless of whether the Department, the respondent, or any other party first brings such a deficiency to the Department's\" attention. Bayley's Br. 33;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(d). Bayley relies on\n   <em>\n    China Kingdom Import &amp; Export Co. Ltd v.

Supp. 2d 1337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007), as support for this proposition. Commerce applied AFA for failure to comply after Bayley did not include all affiliation information in response to the initial questionnaire and first supplemental questionnaire and it therefore did not need to consider Bayley's submission regarding Company D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Bayley contends further that Commerce's disregard of Bayley's proffered information regarding Company D is arbitrary and capricious.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bayley's Br. 41-43. Commerce addressed Bayley's argument that it reported all suppliers in this antidumping investigation as opposed to the parallel countervailing duty investigation and noted that \"this does not change the fact that Company D represents an affiliate that should have been reported. By not reporting Company D on the record of this investigation, Bayley has withheld necessary information that was\n   requested.\" Final IDM at 15. Commerce requested information from Bayley, which Bayley withheld at the outset. It was reasonable for Commerce to rebuff Bayley's later attempts because of Bayley's failure to cooperate and comply with Commerce's requests, and the court finds that Commerce's decision here was not arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   For the aforementioned reasons, the court concludes that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   1. Commerce's actions regarding the administrative record were arbitrary and capricious;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   2. Commerce's application of the intermediate methodology is reserved for remand;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   3. Commerce's valuation of veneer inputs is reserved for remand;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   4. Commerce's calculation of the antidumping margins assigned to Consolidated Plaintiffs and other separate rate respondents should be reconsidered on remand based on any changes to Linyi Chengen's margin on remand;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   5. Commerce's determination to apply AFA to Bayley regarding an alleged affiliation with one of its customers was supported by substantial evidence and in accordance with the law;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   6. Commerce's decision not to conduct verification on Bayley is supported by substantial evidence and in accordance with the law; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   7.
