S. Ellis, III, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This removed action is a dispute over whether plaintiffs-seven employers seeking to withdraw from a pension plan-must pay a multi-million-dollar withdrawal liability to defendants-the trade association that offers the plan and the plan\n   trustee. Plaintiffs object to defendants' imposition and calculation of the withdrawal liability. To vindicate their view, plaintiffs filed suit in Virginia state court, claiming that defendants' imposition and calculation of withdrawal liability violate Virginia law. Defendants then removed this case to federal court on the ground that plaintiffs' state law claims involve an important, disputed federal question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   At issue now is plaintiffs' Motion to Remand the case to state court. For the reasons that follow, the motion must be denied; plaintiffs' state law claims require adjudication of a federal issue that is necessarily raised, actually disputed, substantial, and capable of resolution in federal court without disrupting the federal-state balance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   According to the Complaint, plaintiffs are seven telecommunications companies\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   that are members of the National Telecommunications Cooperative Association (\"NTCA\"), a trade association that represents approximately 800 independent telecommunications companies operating in rural areas of the United States. The NTCA offers its members access to a multiple employer pension plan (\"the Plan\"), and plaintiffs have elected to participate in the Plan for the benefit of their employees. Defendant NTCA Retirement and Security/Savings Plan Trustee Committee (\"NTCA Committee\") serves as the plan fiduciary. Importantly, the Plan is governed by the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs seek to withdraw from the Plan and transfer their employees' pension funds to a different plan because they contend the Plan has become increasingly costly. The NTCA informed plaintiffs that if they withdraw from the Plan, they must pay approximately $10 million in withdrawal liability. Defendants contend that the imposition of this withdrawal liability is authorized-indeed, mandated-by the document establishing the Plan, which is entitled \"Specifications of the Retirement and Security Program for Employees of NTCA [a]nd Its Members\" (\"Program Specifications\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs disagree with this contention. According to plaintiffs, contract provisions that violate a state or federal statute are unenforceable under Virginia law.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blick v. Marks, Stokes &amp; Harrison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2098068\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/234/60/\">\n    234 Va. 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=360%20S.E.2d%20345\">\n    360 S.E.2d 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 348 (1987) (\"Generally, a contract based on an act forbidden by [state] statute is void and no action will lie to enforce the contract.\"). Plaintiffs further contend that the provisions of the Program Specifications authorizing the imposition of withdrawal liability violate ERISA. This, plaintiffs argue, is because ERISA permits the imposition of withdrawal liability on employers participating in\n   <em>\n    multiemployer\n   </em>\n   plans, but contains no such authorization with respect to\n   <em>\n    multiple employer\n   </em>\n   plans.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs also contend that defendants' method for calculating the withdrawal liability violates ERISA. As such, plaintiffs allege that both\n   defendants' planned imposition of withdrawal liability and method of calculating that liability are invalid and unenforceable under Virginia law because they are contrary to ERISA. Accordingly, plaintiffs brought this action in the Circuit Court for Arlington County, Virginia, seeking a declaration that defendants are barred from imposing withdrawal liability and, alternatively, a declaration that defendants are barred from calculating the withdrawal liability as they propose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendants subsequently removed the action to federal court, alleging that both federal question and diversity jurisdiction supported removal. Defendants have since abandoned their diversity jurisdiction argument and now proceed solely on the theory that jurisdiction exists pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiffs concede that this first factor is satisfied because plaintiffs cannot succeed on either of their claims without resolution of the ERISA issue. Specifically, plaintiffs' first claim alleges that the Program Specifications are unenforceable under Virginia law insofar as they authorize withdrawal liability because the imposition of such withdrawal liability violates ERISA. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 50-54. Simply put, plaintiffs cannot succeed on this claim without resolving whether imposition of the withdrawal liability violates ERISA. Similarly, plaintiffs' second claim alleges that the method defendants used to calculate the withdrawal liability is invalid under Virginia law because this calculation method also violates ERISA. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 56-61. Simply put, plaintiffs cannot succeed on this claim without resolving whether the method defendants used to calculate withdrawal liability violates ERISA. Accordingly, every legal theory supporting plaintiffs' claims requires the resolution of a federal issue-namely, whether the imposition of withdrawal liability on an employer in a multiple employer plan or the method defendants used to calculate that liability violates ERISA. As such, the federal issue is necessarily raised.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Second, there is no doubt that the federal issue is actually disputed.\n   <em>\n    Gunn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407443\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/251/#p257\">\n    568 U.S. at 258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407443\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/251/#p257\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1059\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs' argument that the issue is not actually disputed is meritless. Specifically, plaintiffs argue that the parties agree that ERISA is silent with respect to the imposition of withdrawal liability on an employer in a multiple employer plan. According to plaintiffs, the federal issue is not actually disputed because they contend that ERISA does not authorize withdrawal liability for multiple employer plans and defendants argue that withdrawal liability is authorized by the Program Specifications. This artful characterization of the issue and the parties' positions attempts to mask the true dispute between the parties. Yet, a straightforward and accurate description of the dispute plainly reveals an actual dispute over the federal issue. Plaintiffs contend that defendants' planned imposition of withdrawal liability, and proposed method of calculating that liability, violates ERISA. Defendants respond that neither\n   the imposition of withdrawal liability nor the method they used to calculate that liability violates ERISA. Indeed, defendants argue that ERISA requires them to impose withdrawal liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201104\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(D) (requiring a fiduciary such as the NTCA Committee to \"discharge [its] duties with respect to a plan ... in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan\").

Plaintiffs argue that defendants have failed to demonstrate that the ERISA issue presented here meets this high bar of substantiality. Plaintiffs are incorrect. Contrary to plaintiffs' argument, the ERISA issue presented here is sufficiently important to the federal system to support arising under jurisdiction, as evidenced by (i) ERISA's purpose, (ii) ERISA's broad preemptive effect, (iii) judicial recognition of ERISA's importance, and (iv) the real-world consequences of this purely legal issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The importance of the ERISA issue presented here is first confirmed by ERISA's purpose. As the Supreme Court has explained, \"[t]he purpose of ERISA is to provide a\n   <em>\n    uniform regulatory regime\n   </em>\n   over employee benefit plans.\"\n   <em>\n    Aetna Health Inc. v.

To achieve this uniformity, Congress made \"employee benefit plan regulation ... exclusively a federal concern.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2525905\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/200/#p208\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). To allow state courts to decide core ERISA issues risks disrupting the uniformity ERISA was enacted to achieve. And the issue in dispute here-namely, whether and how a multiple employer plan may impose withdrawal liability on an employer-is such a core ERISA issue. Inconsistent answers to this question by states will prevent ERISA plan trustees from being able to protect employees fully and will prevent employers from being able to predict accurately the consequences of their actions. A plan that appears adequately funded may suddenly be underfunded by millions of dollars when an employer withdraws and unexpectedly escapes withdrawal liability, and an employer that moves its employees to a more advantageous plan may suddenly learn it owes the former plan millions of dollars, if either is haled into court in an unexpected state. ERISA was enacted precisely to eliminate this inconsistency and uncertainty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aetna Health Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2525905\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/200/#p208\">\n    542 U.S. at 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2525905\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/200/#p208\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Defendants contend that ERISA preempts plaintiffs' state law claims, and plaintiffs disagree.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Notwithstanding this dispute, however, ERISA's \"deliberately expansive\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   preemption provision indicates that the ERISA issue presented here is substantial. The existence and breadth of ERISA's preemption provision evinces a congressional judgment regarding the importance of ERISA to the federal system. And the particular issue here-whether imposition of withdrawal liability on an employer in a multiple employer plan, or defendants' method of calculating that liability, violates ERISA-is important to ERISA. As defendants argue, imposing withdrawal liability may be necessary to ensure a plan is adequately funded for the remaining participants. And, as plaintiffs argue, withdrawal liability-particularly when, as here, it is millions of dollars-may serve as a powerful disincentive to an employer wishing to move their employees to a less costly or otherwise more advantageous plan. As such, even if plaintiffs' claims are not preempted by ERISA, these claims nonetheless inescapably raise an issue that is important to ERISA, a statutory scheme\n   with a \"deliberately expansive\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   preemption provision that is \"conspicuous for its breadth.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   This indicates that the issue presented is important to the federal system and thus substantial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Moreover, the substantiality of the issue is underscored by the fact that ERISA is one of the few areas in which complete preemption applies. Ordinarily, federal preemption is a defense to a state law claim and does not, pursuant to the well-pleaded complaint rule, provide a basis for removal to federal court.\n   <em>\n    Metro.

As the Supreme Court has concluded, Congress has \"so completely pre-empt[ed] [this] particular area that any [state] civil complaint raising th[e] select group of claims [in ERISA \u00a7 502(a) ] is necessarily federal in character.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209261\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/58/#p63\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209261\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/58/#p63\">\n    at 63-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209261\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/58/#p63\">\n    107 S.Ct. 1542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, Congress clearly provided for complete preemption under ERISA. The Conference Report on ERISA describing the civil enforcement provisions of \u00a7 502(a) contains \"a specific reference to the\" complete preemption doctrine in the Labor Management Relations Act (\"LMRA\"), \"and the rest of the legislative history consistently sets out this clear intention to make \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) suits ... federal questions for the purposes of federal court jurisdiction in like manner as ... the LMRA.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209261\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/58/#p63\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209261\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/58/#p63\">\n    at 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209261\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/58/#p63\">\n    107 S.Ct. 1542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the complete preemption of state law claims under ERISA is firmly rooted in congressional intent and reflects the importance of ERISA to the federal system. Because Congress viewed ERISA as so important, any state law claim that may be recharacterized as a claim pursuant to ERISA \u00a7 502(a) provides a basis for federal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209261\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/58/#p63\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209261\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/58/#p63\">\n    at 63-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209261\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/58/#p63\">\n    107 S.Ct. 1542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In essence, Congress sought to provide a federal forum for disputes that involve ERISA even where a plaintiff does not make a claim under ERISA. It is difficult to imagine clearer evidence of ERISA's importance to the federal system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As plaintiffs are quick to point out, complete preemption does not apply to their claims. This is because plaintiffs' claims cannot be recharacterized as claims pursuant to \u00a7 502(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Yet even though complete preemption may not apply here, complete preemption is nonetheless relevant to the substantiality inquiry here because it reveals ERISA's importance to the federal system and Congress's desire to resolve ERISA issues in federal court. And, as discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the ERISA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   issue presented here implicates whether multiple employer plans will be adequately funded and what barriers employers may face when seeking to move to plans more advantageous for their employees.

Although plaintiffs' lack of a cause of action under ERISA is relevant to the substantiality inquiry, it is not dispositive. And, for the reasons discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , other factors outweigh it and counsel in favor of finding the issue sufficiently substantial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Previously, plaintiffs' lack of a cause of action would have appeared to preclude arising under jurisdiction.

And the relevant part of\n   <em>\n    Mulcahey\n   </em>\n   , in turn, relied primarily on\n   <em>\n    Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. v.

Accordingly,\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   can no longer be read as foreclosing arising under jurisdiction over a state law claim where the plaintiff is barred from bringing a federal cause of action. Indeed, the Fourth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Burrell v. Bayer Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520423\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/918/372/#p376\">\n    918 F.3d 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 2019), recognized just that. There, the Fourth Circuit noted that \"[t]he Court in\n   <em>\n    Grable\n   </em>\n   took the opportunity to clarify that\n   <em>\n    Merrell Dow\n   </em>\n   does not establish a bright-line rule that there can be no jurisdiction in contexts in which Congress has declined to provide a private right of action for enforcement of a\n   federal statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Burrell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520423\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/918/372/#p376\">\n    918 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   387 n.5. Accordingly, plaintiffs' lack of a federal cause of action, although relevant, does not bar federal jurisdiction here. And, for the reasons discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the ERISA issue embedded in plaintiffs' state law claims is nonetheless sufficiently substantial to warrant federal jurisdiction over those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that arising under jurisdiction cannot lie because the ERISA issue presented here is not as significant as the federal issues in cases where the Supreme Court has found arising under jurisdiction exists over state law claims. Plaintiffs are correct that the federal issue here may not be as significant as the issues in those cases. In\n   <em>\n    Grable\n   </em>\n   , for example, the meaning of a federal tax provision was at issue and its resolution would affect the government's \"strong interest in the prompt and certain collection of delinquent taxes, and the ability of the IRS to satisfy its claims from the property of delinquents.\"\n   <em>\n    Grable &amp; Sons Metal Prods., Inc. v.

The question whether the imposition of withdrawal liability on an employer in a multiple employer plan violates ERISA is arguably not as significant as these issues. But that does not mean it is insufficiently substantial to warrant arising under jurisdiction. The Supreme Court has decided cases that clearly satisfy, and clearly fail to satisfy,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   the requirements for arising under jurisdiction over a state law claim. But the Supreme Court has had little occasion to decide cases that do not fall at the extremes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Yet, significantly, various circuit courts-including the Fourth Circuit-have had such occasion. And these circuits-again, including the Fourth Circuit-have found arising under jurisdiction over state law claims in circumstances more akin to those here. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Ormet Corp. v. Ohio Power Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7650073\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/98/799/#p807\">\n    98 F.3d 799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 1996), the Fourth Circuit found \u00a7 1331 jurisdiction over a state action that raised the disputed federal issue of whether the plaintiff was a part \"owner,\" as defined by the Clean Air Act, and thus entitled to a proportionate share of emission allowances issued by the Environmental Protection Agency. The Fourth Circuit concluded that the issue was sufficiently substantial because freely transferrable emission allowances were crucial to the Acid Rain Program and \"state variations of interpretation about the nature and initial title to allowances could create uncertainty in the market and thereby undermine the very device that Congress created for reducing pollution.\"\n   <em>\n    Ormet Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7650073\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/98/799/#p807\">\n    98 F.3d at 807\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And in\n   <em>\n    NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. v.

But, importantly, circuit courts, including the Fourth Circuit, have made clear that a federal issue like the ERISA issue presented here can be sufficiently substantial to warrant arising under jurisdiction over a state law claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiffs arc correct that there is only a \"special and small category of cases in which arising under jurisdiction still lies\" over state law causes of action.\n   <em>\n    Gunn v.

As relevant here, the Supreme Court concluded that federal jurisdiction did not lie with respect to a declaratory judgment claim that would require \"a construction of ERISA and/or an adjudication of its preemptive effect and constitutionality.\"\n    <em>\n     Franchise Tax Bd.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190266\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/1/#p3\">\n     463 U.S. 1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 14,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190266\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/1/#p3\">\n     103 S.Ct. 2841\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190266\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/1/#p3\">\n     77 L.Ed.2d 420\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1983). In essence, the Supreme Court concluded that the dispute-the validity of a state tax-levying regulation-lacked the requisite federal character needed to fall within the limited scope of federal question jurisdiction.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190266\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/1/#p3\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190266\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/1/#p3\">\n     at 15-28\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190266\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/1/#p3\">\n     103 S.Ct. 2841\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In contrast, the suit here contains the requisite federal character.
