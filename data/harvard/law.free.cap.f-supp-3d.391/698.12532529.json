Plaintiff J.D. Fields and Company, Inc. (\"J.D. Fields\") responded. Dkt. 12. Shoring replied, and J.D. Fields filed a sur-reply. Dkt. 14 (Shoring's reply); Dkt. 15-1 (J.D. Field's sur-reply). Having considered the motions, responses, replies, and applicable law, the court is of the opinion that the motion to dismiss (Dkt. 5) should be DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This is a breach of contract case. Shoring is incorporated and has its principal place of business in California, while J.D. Fields is incorporated and has its principle place of business in Texas. Dkt. 1 at 2. In January 2017, Shoring requested that J.D. Fields locate and supply specially fabricated steel piling for a project at the Los Angeles International Airport. Dkt. 1-1 at 3; Dkt. 5 at 5. J.D. Fields subsequently sent Shoring a price quote for the piling on company letterhead, which included J.D. Fields's Houston office address. Dkt. 1-1 at 4; Dkt. 5 at 5. The price quote expressly stated that \"[o]nly a fully executed purchase agreement shall be binding.\" Dkt. 12-4 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 20, 2017, a Shoring representative emailed J.D. Fields and asked what Shoring would need to do for J.D. Fields to \"hold that pipe.\" Dkt. 12-3 at 3. A J.D. Fields representative responded that if Shoring replied to the quote with a signature, J.D. Fields would hold the piling until Shoring produced a formal purchase order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A Shoring representative signed the quote, wrote \"ACCEPTED\" on the document, and sent the document back to J.D. Fields. Dkt. 12-4. However, Shoring never executed a formal purchase order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Shortly after receiving the signed quote, J.D. Fields sent Shoring a credit application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Shoring executed the credit application, also on J.D. Fields letterhead, and returned the application to J.D. Fields. Dkt. 5 at 27. On March 24, J.D. Fields notified Shoring that Shoring's credit application had been approved. Dkt. 12-5 at 2. The credit notification included J.D. Fields's General Terms and Conditions of Sale (\"GTCs\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The GTCs expressly provided, in bold type, that \"every sale by [J.D. Fields] shall in every case be subject to these terms and conditions to the exclusion of any other terms.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. The GTCs also included the following forum-selection clause:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   2.1 CHOICE OF FORUM\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   All actions or proceedings either directly or indirectly arising from or related to this contract or transaction, regardless of whether grounded in contract, tort, or any other legal theory,\n   <strong>\n    shall be brought only in State or Federal Court in Harris County in the State of Texas\n   </strong>\n   , and Buyer hereby consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts for the purpose of such actions or proceedings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). On April 13, a J.D. Fields representative emailed Shoring on same email chain that Shoring used to send the March 20 signed quote. Dkt. 24-8 at 2. J.D. Fields asked if Shoring was \"still good on\" the pipe for which Shoring had previously signed. Dkt. 12-2 at 4; Dkt. 24-8 at 2. Shoring replied that \"[y]es, the other pipe is still good.\" Dkt. 12-2 at 4; Dkt. 24-8 at 2. On April 19, J.D. Fields paid a third-party distributor, JCD International Services (\"JCD\"), approximately $193,000 as a partial up-front payment to fill Shoring's order. Dkt. 12-2 at 5; Dkt. 24-2 at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the following months, Shoring made multiple requests for changes to the order and provided fabrication instructions in furtherance of the contract. Dkt. 12 at 11. However, in July 2017, Shoring informed J.D. Fields that Shoring was repudiating the contract and would not take delivery of the pilings as previously agreed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   To date, Shoring has paid J.D. Fields $50,019 in damages. Dkt. 12-2 at 5. J.D. Fields alleges that this payment only covers a \"fraction\" of its damages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   J.D. Fields filed suit in the 269th Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas, alleging breach of contract and promissory estoppel. Dkt. 1. Shoring removed the action to this court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Shoring then filed\n   a Rule 12(b) motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and improper venue. Dkt. 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Rule 12(b)(2) Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A court must dismiss an action when it lacks personal jurisdiction over the defendant. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2). When a non-resident defendant moves to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, the resident plaintiff has the burden of establishing personal jurisdiction over the non-resident.\n   <em>\n    Lewis v.

When a district court rules on personal jurisdiction without an evidentiary hearing, the plaintiff must make a prima facie showing of jurisdiction, and the court may consider the entire contents of the record, including affidavits.\n   <em>\n    Quick Techs., Inc. v.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Contract Formation and Interpretation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As a threshold matter, the parties disagree as to whether the GTCs-and therefore the forum-selection clause-became part of the contract. Shoring contends that it never agreed to the GTCs, and that therefore the forum-selection clause does not function as Shoring's consent to jurisdiction in Texas. Dkt. 5 at 7. Without the forum-selection clause, Shoring argues that this court lacks personal jurisdiction and is an improper venue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. Accordingly, Shoring requests that the court dismiss the case entirely or transfer the case to the Central District of California.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    1. Whether the Clause Became Part of the Contract\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The parties agree that a contract existed. Dkt. 5 at 7; Dkt. 12 at 14. However, the parties disagree as to whether the GTCs were part of the contract. Shoring argues that the parties entered into a binding contract on March 20, when Shoring signed and returned J.D. Fields's price\n   quote. Dkt. 14 at 3. Thus, Shoring contends that the GTCs-sent March 24-were merely proposals for alterations to the contract under UCC \u00a7 2-207. Dkt. 5 at 6-7;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%202.207\">\n    Tex. Bus. &amp; Comm. Code Ann. \u00a7 2.207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, J.D. Fields argues that the parties did not have a binding contract until April 13, when Shoring confirmed that it still wished to proceed with the pipe order. Dkt. 12 at 14. Because J.D. Fields had previously sent the GTCs to Shoring, and Shoring's April 13 acceptance was unconditional, J.D. Fields contends that the GTCs became part of the contract.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%202.207\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Here, because the court is sitting in diversity, state substantive law applies; because the contract at issue is for the sale of goods, the Uniform Commercial Code (\"UCC\") applies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    J.D.

The UCC \"supplements\" the four basic elements of an enforceable contract: (1) offer; (2) acceptance; (3) a \"meeting of the minds\" as to subject matter and essential terms; and (4) consideration or mutuality of obligation.\n   <em>\n    Omni USA, Inc. v.

Although the UCC does not define \"offer,\" the Fifth Circuit has held that an offer is \"an act that leads the offeree reasonably to believe that assent (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , acceptance) will conclude the deal.\"\n   <em>\n    Axelson, Inc. v.

Here, Shoring could not have reasonably believed that assent to the price quote would form a contract for the sale of the piling. The quote itself states that it is \"non-binding\" and that \"[o]nly a fully executed purchase agreement shall be binding.\" Dkt. 12-4 at 2. Moreover, J.D. Fields's email correspondence made clear that Shoring's signature would only \"hold\" the pilings until Shoring \"[got] a [purchase order] written up.\" Dkt. 12-3 at 3. Given J.D. Fields's repeated statements that a\n   purchase order was necessary to conclude the deal, no one in Shoring's position could have reasonably believed that signing the price quote would form a contract for the sale of the piling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. Steel Int'l\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3535440\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/426/271/#p276\">\n    426 F. App'x at 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (reasoning that a price quote was an offer, but only because the quote was \"void of any conditional language\" and \"did not limit acceptance to a specified manner\"). Thus, as a matter of law, J.D. Fields's March 20 price quote was not an offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The earliest communication that could have been an offer occurred on April 13, when J.D. Fields followed up with Shoring to confirm that Shoring was still \"good\" for the pipe. Dkt. 12-2 at 4; Dkt. 24-8 at 2. J.D. Fields's April 13 email, unlike its previous communications, did not require a purchase order or otherwise limit acceptance to a particular method.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. Steel Int'l\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3535440\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/426/271/#p276\">\n    426 F. App'x at 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the parties had previously agreed on the details of the transaction, including price and quantity. Dkt. 12-4. Under these circumstances, an offeree in Shoring's position could have reasonably believed that assent to J.D.

Thus, the earliest date the parties could have had a contract for the sale of pipe was April 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Further, the GTCs were part of J.D. Fields's offer. Shoring received the GTCs on March 24, well before the parties entered the contract. Dkt. 12-5. The GTCs expressly stated that \"every sale by [J.D. Fields] shall in every case be subject to these terms and conditions\" and that they displaced any previously offered terms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. The GTCs also expressly objected to any additional terms proposed by the buyer under UCC \u00a7 2-207.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, J.D. Fields made clear to Shoring that any offer from J.D. Fields would be subject to the GTCs. However, Shoring failed to object to the GTCs and unqualifiedly accepted J.D. Fields's April 13 offer. Dkt. 12-2 at 4; Dkt. 24-8 at 2. Taking the record as a whole, the court concludes that the parties' communications demonstrate an objective \"meeting of the minds\" with regard to GTCs, regardless of whether Shoring subjectively assented.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Omni USA, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4258878\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/798/831/#p846\">\n    798 F.
