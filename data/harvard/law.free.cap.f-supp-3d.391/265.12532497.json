(\"collectively\", \"Ferring\")-the same three plaintiffs in the present lawsuit-sued Dr. Seymour Fein, a former Ferring consultant, along with two entities he formed, Serenity Pharmaceuticals, LLC (\"Serenity\") and Reprise Biopharmaceutics LLC (\"Reprise\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ferring B.V. et al. v. Allergan, Inc. et al.,\n   </em>\n   No. 12 Civ. 2650 (S.D.N.Y.) (hereinafter referred to as the \"2012 Action\"). Among other things, Ferring alleged that Dr. Fein \"did not invent any subject matter\" covered by two patents for which he applied and obtained patent protection-\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%207%2C405%2C203\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 7,405,203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the \"'203 Patent\") and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%207%2C579%2C321\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 7,579,321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the \"'321 Patent\") -and therefore sought to \"correct the inventorship\" of those two patents, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20256\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , to replace Dr. Fein with Ferring scientists. (12 Civ. 2650 Dkt. No. 73 \u00b6\u00b6 112, 127.) On August 31, 2015, the Hon. Robert W. Sweet granted summary judgment dismissing Ferring's correction of inventorship claims. He concluded that Ferring was equitably estopped from challenging Dr. Fein's status as the inventor of the '203 and '321 Patents, because it unduly \"delayed advancing [its] claims in this litigation in order to impose the risks and costs of drug development on [Dr. Fein and his co-defendants] and then to obtain patent correction in [its] favor[.]\" (12.

R. Civ. P. 12(c), in which they ask the Court to dismiss Ferring's inequitable conduct claim (Count V) as well as Ferring's allegation, offered in support of its patent invalidity claim (Count I), that Dr. Fein did not invent the '203 and '321 Patents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The question presented by Defendants' motion is whether Ferring is foreclosed from asserting those claims in light of the findings of fact and conclusions of law that are contained in the Equitable Estoppel Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The answer to this question is yes. Defendants' motions are granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background and Prior Proceedings\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Patents in Suit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This action-unlike the 2012 Action-solely concerns the '203 and '321 Patents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On July 29, 2008, the PTO issued the '203 Patent, which is titled \"Pharmaceutical Compositions Including Low Dosages of Desmopressin.\" (Am. Compl. Ex. C.) It lists Dr. Seymour Fein as the sole inventor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Reprise is the lawful owner of all right, title, and interest in the '203 Patent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) Serenity is an exclusive licensee of the '203 Patent, with the right to enforce it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) Avadel is an exclusive sublicensee of the '203 Patent, with the right to enforce it. (Ferring's Answer and Countercl. (\"Ferring's Counter.\"), dated July 19, 2018, \u00b6 8, Dkt. No. 115.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On August 25, 2009, the PTO issued the '321 patent, which also is titled \"Pharmaceuticals Compositions Including Low Dosages of Desmoproessin.\" (Am. Compl. Ex. D.) Again, Dr. Fein is the sole inventor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The same ownership arrangement that applies to the '203 Patent applies to the '321 Patent as well: Reprise is the lawful owner of all right, title, and interest in the '321 Patent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) Serenity is an exclusive licensee of the '321 Patent, with the right to enforce it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) And Avadel is an exclusive sublicensee of the '321 patent, with the right to enforce it. (Ferring's Countercl. \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Desmopressin is a synthetic hormone that is used to treat a variety of disorders related to excessive urine production, including nocturia. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 75.) While effective, it also poses a risk of having reduced sodium levels in the blood, a condition also known as hyponatremia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Ferring is an innovator in the field of desmopressin. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 75.) In 1972, Ferring developed the world's first industrial scale pharmaceutical desmopressin products by launching desmopressin as a treatment for central diabetes insipidus. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80.) It continues to conduct research and\n   development on desmopressin to this day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Dr. Fein, a board-certified internist and medical oncologist, is-as noted-the named inventor of the '203 and '321 Patents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14; Countercl. \u00b6 26.) Dr. Fein and his other business partners formed Serenity, Reprise, and Avadel to commercialize his alleged inventions. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Dr. Fein's Consulting Work for Ferring\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In the late 1990s, Ferring sought to develop an \"orodispersible\" (meaning orally disintegrating) desmopressin tablet. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   During that period, Dr. Fein worked as a consultant for Ferring. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Equitable Estoppel Opinion \u00b6\u00b6 30-51.) Among other things, he was responsible for assisting in the research and development of desmopressin-related products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Dr. Fein alleges that he discovered that desmopressin could be effective in much lower doses than previously known, which would also reduce the risk of hyponatremia. (Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 26-27.) He purportedly communicated this discovery to Ferring to help it design clinical studies to test his ideas. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He further alleges that he \"suggested\" to Ferring that desmopressin could be delivered \"sublingually,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , absorbed under the tongue by way of a dissolvable tablet, and that this particular method would improve \"bioavailability and allow for a greater percentage of desmopressin in the formulation to reach the bloodstream.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On May 7, 2002, Ferring filed a patent application in Great Britain, Patent Application No. 0210397.6 (\"GB '397\"), for an orodispersible desmopressin formulation. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 57.) GB '397 disclosed a dosage form of desmopressin adapted for sublingual absorption. (Equitable Estoppel Opinion \u00b6\u00b6 1-2). There was no requirement that this early priority document identify or name any inventors, and so none was listed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 57.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On September 20, 2002, Ferring filed a Patent Cooperation Treaty (\"PCT\") application, PCT/1B02/04036 (\"PCT '036\"), claiming priority to GB '397. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 58.) PCT '036 listed Dr. Fein among the inventors of the patent. (Equitable Estoppel Opinion \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Dr. Fein's Termination and Efforts to Secure Intellectual Property Protection\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On November 7, 2002, Ferring formally terminated Dr. Fein's consulting agreement after he declined to retroactively assign his inventions to Ferring. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) Dr. Fein then proceeded to take certain steps to assert his purported intellectual property rights in the subject matter claimed by Ferring's patent applications. Specifically, over the ensuing six months, Fein's attorney, William Speranza, engaged in a back-and-forth correspondence with Ferring through its counsel, Patricia Barclay. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Equitable Estoppel Opinion;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 143 Ex. B (Speranza-Barclay correspondence).) That correspondence, which served as the factual basis for Judge Sweet's Equitable Estoppel Opinion, is detailed below.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On November 21, 2002, Speranza sent a letter to Ferring on Dr. Fein's behalf, stating that Dr. Fein considered himself the inventor of a \" 'sublingual, transmucosal route of delivery which affords a number\n   of advantages ... including enabling the effective use of formulations having reduced concentrations of desmopressin.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30-31.) Speranza further asserted that Dr. Fein had not assigned any inventorship rights to Ferring during his consultancy and therefore retained ownership rights in any patents that might develop from Ferring's patent applications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On January 30, 2003, Speranza sent a second letter to Ferring, reiterating that Dr. Fein \" 'possessed ownership rights in the invention, the pending application therefor and any patents that may issue on his invention.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34-35.) He also stated that Dr. Fein was considering whether he would \" 'take steps independent of Ferring' \" to protect his patent rights if Ferring did not acknowledge Fein's interests in Ferring's existing patent applications and promise not to take any actions that \" 'would in any manner affect, limit, or compromise [Fein's] inventorship rights and ownership interests.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Barclay responded to Mr. Speranza's letter on April 9, 2003. She advised that Ferring decided to drop the feature \"adapted for sublingual administration\" from PCT '036 because sublingual administration \" 'does not in this context confer a delimitation\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   [,] novelty.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-38.) Consequently, she stated, Ferring planned to remove Dr. Fein as an inventor from PCT '036. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On April 17, 2003, Speranza sent an email in response. He acknowledged that Dr. Fein did not object to Ferring's decision to drop Dr. Fein as an inventor from PCT '036. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40-41.) He also clarified that Dr. Fein believed that he had invented a \" 'sublingual, transmucosal route of delivery which affords a number of advantages in the efficacy and safety of desmopressin administration, including enabling the effective use of formulations having reduced concentrations of desmopressin.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.) Accordingly, he stated, \" 'Dr. Fein is planning to proceed with pursuing patent protection covering the sub-lingual administration route and the associated low dosage possibilities enabled by same which he invented, all at his own expense going forward and with the understanding that Ferring relinquishes any ownership claims thereto.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.) \"He plans to claim priority to the same UK application [GB '397], as is of course proper. In order to do this, however, we need the particulars of the UK filings, namely the application number and confirmation of the 7 May 2002 filing date thereof.\" (Dkt. No. 142 at AGN_FER000002769.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On April 29, 2003, Barclay acknowledged receipt of Speranza's earlier letter and advised that Ferring believed that Dr. Fein's purported invention was \" 'already in the public domain[,]' \" and thus was not subject to patent protection. (Equitable Estoppel Opinion \u00b6\u00b6 44-46.) She added, \" 'I cannot of course say now that Ferring will not make any claim as to ownership of any other material Dr. Fein may include in any patent application as without seeing the text and knowing what claims for novelty or inventive steps he has in mind[;] I cannot be sure that this does not cover matters to which employees of the Ferring Group have contributed or regarding which Dr. Fein is bound to us by terms of confidentiality.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.) Consequently, she stated that Ferring would not pursue any claims directed at \" 'the low dosage possibilities enabled by the sublingual administration route.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.) She did, however, provide Speranza with the date and application number for GB '397, ensuring him that this information would suffice to enable Dr. Fein to claim priority. (Dkt. No. 143 Ex. B. at AGN_FER000002772 (\"I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   believe this is sufficient to claim priority.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    e. Dr. Fein's Patent Applications\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On May 7, 2003-approximately one week after Barclay's latest correspondence-Dr. Fein filed PCT Patent Application No. PCT/US03/14463, claiming priority to GB '397. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On November 12, 2003, Dr. Fein filed continuation-in-part U.S. Patent Application 10/706,100, based off his PCT Patent Application No. PCT/US03/14463. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15; Equitable Estoppel Opinion \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On December 9, 2004-nearly eighteen months removed from the parties' earlier communication-Barclay sent a letter to Speranza expressing her \" 'tru[e] surprise[ ] ... that Dr. Fein had proceeded with [his PCT] application to which we believe he has no entitlement and which in particular discloses information confidential and proprietary to Ferring to which Dr. Fein had confidential access during his engagement as [a] consultant.' \" (Equitable Estoppel Opinion \u00b6 50.) She added, \" 'Ferring will take all necessary steps to protect its rights and interests,' \" and concluded by warning Dr. Fein that Ferring would \" 'commence formal action' \" if it \" 'did not receive a full and satisfactory explanation within 14 days[.]' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Mr. Speranza sent two letters in response. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In the first, he referred Barclay to the parties' \" 'dealings and communications throughout 2003' \" with Ferring that \" 'made clear that Ferring made no claim to low dosage desmopressin as its invention.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55.) He also reminded Barclay that his April 17, 2003 email specifically informed her that \" 'Fein is planning to proceed with pursuing patent protection covering the sub-lingual administration route and the associated low dosage possibilities enabled by same.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54.) He concluded, \" 'We trust this response will put this matter to rest.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In his second letter-which he sent later that same day-Speranza sent Barclay a copy of Dr. Fein's continuation-in-part U.S. patent application. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Following this final exchange of correspondence between Ferring and Dr. Fein's counsel, Ferring took no direction action in connection with Dr. Fein's patent applications (and later patents) for over seven years. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    f.

Among other things, he sponsored and conducted various clinical studies; filed an Investigational New Drug (\"IND\") application with the Food and Drug Administration (the \"FDA\"); met with the FDA regarding his IND application; and formed Serenity and Reprise for the purpose of commercially developing his invention and protecting his intellectual property rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 59-83,) In so doing, he provided the Speranza-Barclay correspondence to his business partners to assist in their due diligence, and they, in turn, relied on that correspondence in doing business with him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 65-66, 75, 78.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As noted earlier, during the period in which Dr. Fein sought to commercialize his inventions, Dr. Fein's patents issued in the United States-specifically, the '203 and '321 Patents issued in the summers of 2008 and 2009, respectively.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   at 270.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   When all was said and done, from 2003 to 2012, Dr. Fein and his business partners invested over $60 million dollars in, among other things, design, clinical research, and manufacturing, all in order to develop a desmopressin product protected by Dr. Fein's patents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    g. The 2012 Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   On April 4, 2012, Ferring brought suit in this District, naming Dr. Fein, Serenity, and Reprise, among others, as defendants. (12 Civ. 2650 Dkt. No. 1.) It claimed,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   that two Ferring employees made \"significant inventive contributions\" to the '203 and '321 Patents (12 Civ. 2650 Dkt. No. 73 (First Amended Complaint) \u00b6 95), and that Dr. Fein, in turn, \"did not invent any subject matter covered\" by those two patents (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 112 ( '203 Patent), \u00b6 127 ( '321 Patent).) Therefore, Ferring sought to replace Dr. Fein as the named inventor of those patents, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20256\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   On April 17, 2015, the defendants in the 2012 Action moved for summary judgment on Ferring's inventorship claims. (12 Civ. 2650 Dkt. No. 132.) They argued that Ferring was equitably estopped to assert those claims, because it sat on the sidelines for seven years while Dr. Fein, relying upon the Speranza-Barclay correspondence (and Ferring's silence thereafter), invested millions in developing his desmopressin products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Judge Sweet agreed. He concluded that Ferring's conduct in corresponding with Speranza was \"misleading;\" its efforts to replace Dr. Fein as the named inventor of the '203 and '321 Patents \"contradict[ed] [the] earlier position\" that Barclay conveyed to Dr. Fein-that Ferring would not pursue claims against Dr. Fein challenging his purported inventions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Equitable Estoppel Opinion at 27;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   22-28.) Judge Sweet further determined that the defendants \"relied upon Ferring's inaction by spending several years commercializing [Dr. Fein's invention],\" including by forming Reprise and Serenity (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 29), and that Ferring's misleading conduct, which caused the defendants millions to invest tens of millions of dollars in developing Dr. Fein's product, amounted to prejudice (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 34). Accordingly, he ruled that Ferring was equitably estopped from seeking to \"correct\" the inventorship shown on the '203 and '321 Patents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The 2012 Action is ongoing. A bench trial (once begun but interrupted, for reasons having nothing to do with this decision) is scheduled for July 24, 2019, before the Hon. P. Kevin Castel. (12 Civ. 2650 Dkt.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D. Del. 17 Civ. 479 Dkt. Nos. 11-12.) The Delaware court granted the motion to transfer. (D. Del. 17 Civ. 479 Dkt. No, 58). However, the Court's Assignment Committee ruled that the cases were not \"related\" in the technical sense of our Court rules, in that they concerned different patents. The 2017 case was initially assigned to Judge Hellerstein. The case ended up before Judge Sweet, pursuant to Rule 14 of the Southern District of New York's Rules for the Division of Business Among Judges, after Ferring vigorously argued that it should not be sent to Judge Sweet despite his superior\n   knowledge of the Fein-Ferring dispute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 270-74.

Both motions arise out of Judge Sweet's Equitable Estoppel Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    First,\n   </em>\n   Defendants argue that Ferring's claim of inequitable conduct (Count V) must be dismissed, because Judge Sweet already determined, in the course of granting Defendants' motion for summary judgment on equitable estoppel grounds, that Dr. Fein reasonably believed that Ferring did not dispute his ownership. It follows, they argue, that a trier of fact could not reasonably infer that Dr. Fein either knowingly or intentionally misled the PTO, which is an element of the inequitable conduct claim. (Am.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 116.)

(Am.

Q, R (Combined Declaration submitted in support of 203 and '321 Patents, respectively).) The Combined Declaration, which Fein resubmitted on July 26, 2007 and July 15, 2008 during prosecution of the '203 and '321 Patents, respectively, states that Dr. Fein is the sole inventor of the Patents in Suit. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 141-42.) According to Ferring, Dr. Fein had a duty to disclose material information related to patentability, including information about inventorship conflicts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 141, 146-48 (citing Manual Patent Examining Procedure \u00a7 2001.04 &amp;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201.56\">\n    37 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).) Dr. Fein's failure to make that disclosure and representation that he solely invented the '203 and '321 Patents, Ferring avers, was misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   But Judge Sweet expressly determined the opposite, He found that Dr. Fein reasonably believed that he was sole owner of the Patents in Suit as a result of the Speranza-Barclay correspondence, and therefore was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   aware of an inventorship conflict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The only time that Ferring expressed concern with Dr. Fein's pursuing patent protection for his inventions was on December 9, 2004, (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Equitable Estoppel Opinion \u00b6\u00b6 50-52.) It was then that Barclay alerted Speranza that she believed that Dr. Fein's PCT application US2003/014463 \" 'contain[s] an invention to which we believe he has no entitlement[,] and which in particular discloses information confidential and proprietary to Ferring to which Dr. Fein had confidential\n   access during his engagement as consultant.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.) Just days later, Speranza responded to that claim, reminding Barclay that his earlier email, dated April 17, 2003, had apprised her (and Ferring) that, \" 'Fein is planning to himself proceed with pursuing patent protection covering the sub-lingual administration route and the associated low dosage possibilities enabled by the same.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54.) The parties' \" 'dealings and communications throughout 2003' \" made \" 'clear that Ferring had no claim to low dosage desmopressin as its invention.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55.) Speranza concluded his letter by saying, \" 'We trust this response will put this matter to rest.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.) He then sent a follow-up letter referencing and attaching \"for [Barclay's] convenience\" Dr. Fein's continuation-in-part U.S. patent application in the \"interests of completeness.\" (Dkt. No. 143 Ex. B at AGN_FER000002786.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Following this exchange of correspondence between Speranza and Ferring, \"Ferring took no direct action on Dr. Fein's patent applications, and later patents, for over seven years.\" (Equitable Estoppel Opinion \u00b6 58.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Judge Sweet reached a number of conclusions on the basis of these undisputed facts. First, he found, as a matter of fact, that Dr. Fein \"inferred\" \"that he was free to independently pursue patent protection for his invention without interference[ ]\" from Ferring's silence after Speranza sent his last message. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 58-59.) Second, he determined, \"Until Ferring began asserting its inventorship claims, none of the Defendants [including Dr. Fein] had reason to believe Ferring would dispute inventorship of the low-dosage inventions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30.) Third, he concluded, \"Defendants ... reasonably rel[ied] on Ferring's acquiescence to Dr. Fein pursuing his own patents[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In short, Judge Sweet concluded, as a matter of undisputed fact, that Dr. Fein reasonably believed, in the face of Ferring's silence (and seeming acquiescence) in his application, that Ferring did not dispute his inventorship of the subject matter claimed in the Patents in Suit. In the face of Judge Sweet's finding, no trier of fact could possibly draw the inference that Ferring seeks-namely, that Dr. Fein had the specific intent to mislead the PTO about his being the sole inventor of the Patents in Suit. That inference is fundamentally incompatible with facts found by Judge Sweet, because \"reasonable reliance\" on Ferring's seemingly acquiescent conduct is incompatible with the scienter needed to sustain a claim of inequitable conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   According to Ferring, \"At most Dr. Fein could have only reasonably believed that he invented 'sub-lingual administration' and the 'associated low dosage possibilities enabled by sub-lingual administration' of desmopressin\"-not the full subject matter of the '203 and '321 Patents. (Ferring's Opp. to Def.'s First Mot. for J. on the Pleadings, dated Aug. 28, 2018, (\"Ferring's First Opp.\"), at 10-11, Dkt. No. 168.) Ferring further argues that Judge Sweet's\n   <em>\n    Markman\n   </em>\n   decision, dated January 22, 2019 (Dkt. No. 421), supports this interpretation, because Judge Sweet's construction of the Patents in Suit-which he construed as not containing a \"low dose\" limitation-differs from the invention that Speranza and Barclay discussed in their correspondence-an invention, Ferring submits, that\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    limited to low dose\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ferring's Supp. Mem. of Law in Opp. to Defs.' Mots. J. on Pleadings, dated Feb. 5, 2019 (\"Ferring's Supp. Mem.\"), at 6, Dkt. No. 456-1) (emphasis in original).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Ferring's interpretation of the Equitable Estoppel Opinion is incorrect. In his Equitable Estoppel Opinion, Judge Sweet recognized\n   that the inventions that were the subject of conversation between Barclay and Speranza included the inventive feature of establishing low plasma/serum levels of desmopressin. He stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   The low-dosage invention as described in the PCT at issue in the Speranza correspondence [PCT application US2003/014463]\n   <em>\n    is the same subject matter detailed in the patents-in-suit, down to the specific numerical quantity of desmopressin to be used.\n   </em>\n   \" ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Despite having threatened immediate legal action with respect to the patent application, Ferring did not disagree or otherwise challenge Mr. Speranza's assertion that low dosage development was Fein's intellectual property. Ferring was aware of two Fein patent applications that include claims for low desmopressin doses\n   <em>\n    and low desmopressin plasma concentration levels.\n   </em>\n   Ferring's December 9, 2004 letter reflects that the parties were discussing Dr. Fein's 2003 PCT application. Then, on December 14, 2004, Mr. Speranza sent Ms. Barclay Dr. Fein's first U.S. patent application. Both of those applications contained claims for specific low doses\n   <em>\n    and specific low plasma concentration levels.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   (Equitable Estoppel Opinion at 27-28 (emphases added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   This passage illustrates that Judge Sweet specifically recognized that the inventions for which Dr. Fein sought patent protection in 2003 (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , those embodied in PCT application US2003/014463 and U.S. patent application 10/706,100 ) included claims directed to low plasma concentrations without specific numerical dosage limitations. ( U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0138098 ; International Publication No. WO2004/041153.) Moreover, these applications identified several routes of administration-not just sublingual-including intravenous infusion, subcutaneous, and transdermal.

According to Ferring, GB '397 embodied Ferring's work-not Fein's-and Fein had no right to claim priority to an application that he did not initially file, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20119\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Dr. Fein passed off Ferring's disclosures as his own work throughout the prosecution of the [P]atents in [S]uit, leading to the reasonable inference that Dr. Fein claimed priority to Ferring's work with an intent to deceive the PTO.\" (Ferring's First Opp. at 13;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 142-46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Viewed alongside the Speranza-Barclay correspondence and Judge Sweet's findings, this inference is also implausible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Ferring's contention ignores the fact that Barclay-in response to an explicit request from Speranza explaining that Dr. Fein planned to file a patent application claiming priority to GB '397-provided Speranza with information about GB '397 in order to facilitate Dr. Fein's priority claim. The Equitable Estoppel Opinion incorporated a key exchange between Speranza\n   and Barclay about Dr. Fein's intention to claim priority to GB '397. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Equitable Estoppel Opinion \u00b6\u00b6 40-48.) On April 12, 2003, Speranza informed Barclay that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   Dr. Fein is planning himself to proceed with pursuing patent protection covering the sub-lingual administration route and the associated low dosage possibilities enabled by the same which he invented, all at his own expense going forward and with the understanding that Ferring relinquishes any ownership claims thereto. He plans to claim priority to the same UK application [GB '397] as is of course proper. In order to do this, however, we need the particulars of the UK filing, namely, the application number and confirmation of the 7 May 2002 filing date thereof. At some point we will also need a certified copy of the UK application as filed.\n   <em>\n    WOULD YOU PLEASE GET THIS INFORMATION TO ME JUST AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE\n   </em>\n   , for otherwise there is risk of not being able to timely and properly claim priority to the UK application.... We will also need to formalize Ferring's relinquishment of any ownership rights in Dr. Fein's inventions, Dr. Fein's corresponding agreement as an inventor in your planned PCT application and relinquishment of any ownership rights in the subject matters you will be claiming, and the like. But in the meantime, the first order of business is for you to provide us with the requested information about the UK application.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   (Dkt. No. 143 at AGN_FER000002769 (emphasis in original).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Barclay responded twelve days later by conveying Ferring's belief that, \"The low dosage possibilities enabled by the sublingual administration route are already available in the public domain.... This is the reason as we have explained that we will not be pursuing this claim.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AGN_FER000002772.) She then declined to give Speranza a copy of GB '397-but only because she did not believe Dr. Fein was entitled to review Ferring's own patentable subject matter \"disclosed therein.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) But, she concluded, \"I can none the less [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] advise that the initial filing was made in the UK on 7 May 2002 and was assigned number UK 02.10397.6.\n   <em>\n    I believe this is sufficient to claim priority.\n   </em>\n   \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The rest, as they say, is history. Dr. Fein filed PCT application PCT/US03/14463 one week later, claiming priority over GB '397, and then filed a continuation in part U.S. patent application 10/706,100 based off that PCT application. Eighteen months later, Barclay expressed surprise, then Speranza promptly responded-and Ferring was not heard from again for seven years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Judge Sweet interpreted this exchange to mean that Ferring, while believing that the low dosage administration of desmopressin was not patentable (because it was already in the public domain), nevertheless \"acquiesce[d] to Dr. Fein pursuing his own patents.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34.) The process of obtaining his own patents entailed claiming priority to GB '397-which Speranza explicitly told Ferring he intended to do on April 12, 2003. Judge Sweet recognized this fact, writing, \"Ferring did not disagree or otherwise challenge Mr. Speranza's assertion [in the April 12, 2003 letter] that low dosage development was Fein's intellectual property.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28.) This \"assertion\" was made as part of an explicit request for information about Ferring's Great Britain application. Barclay gave Speranza the information that Dr. Fein needed in order to assert priority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Moreover, as Judge Sweet recognized, Ferring itself filed PCT '036 on September 20, 2002, in which it claimed priority to\n   GB '397 and listed Dr. Fein among the inventors on that patent. (Equitable Estoppel Opinion \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.) Ferring cannot now plausibly claim that Dr. Fein sought to mislead the PTO by referring back to GB '397 when Ferring itself listed Dr. Fein as an inventor of GB '397.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Taken together, the Speranza-Barclay correspondence, Ferring's own PCT application, and Judge Sweet's broader conclusion that Dr. Fein reasonably believed that Ferring did not dispute his inventorship are \"inconsistent with [the] knowledge of illegality\" that is needed to sustain an inequitable conduct claim under Federal Circuit law and Rule 9(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Exergen,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4035540\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/1312/#p1326\">\n    575 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1329 n.5 (internal citation omitted). No trier of fact could draw the factual inference necessary to a finding of scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3. Example 8\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Ferring alleges that Dr. Fein misled the PTO by including \"Example 8\" in the Patents in Suit. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 144-46.) Example 8 describes a clinical study designed to evaluate the \"antidiuretic effect of three low doses of desmopressin administered via intravenous infusion for 2 hours in over-hydrated, healthy, non-smoking male and female volunteers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. C. at col. 20:39-42.) According to Ferring, Dr. Fein knew that there was an inventorship dispute over Example 8, and nevertheless withheld that information from the PTO because it was crucial to the patentability of the Patents in Suit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 146.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Once again, this allegation is directly at odds with Judge Sweet's findings concerning the Speranza-Barclay correspondence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   As noted (both above and in the Equitable Estoppel Opinion), Speranza sent a letter to Barclay on December 14, 2004 (to which Ferring never responded) further addressing Barclay's concerns about Dr. Fein's patent application. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Equitable Estoppel Opinion \u00b6 57.) Speranza's letter is remarkably illuminating. He wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   Given your apparent concern with the content of Dr. Fein's published applications, we note in the interests of completeness that Dr. Fein filed a \"continuation-in-part\" U.S. patent application.... It is possible that you already know about this application, but in any event we have attached a copy of this published application for your convenience.\n   <em>\n    You will note that this published U.S. application, like the published PCT application, to which your letter related, repeats data as was set forth in the original Ferring UK application\n   </em>\n   [GB '397].\n   <em>\n    For the reasons given in our earlier letter of this date, the inclusion of that data by Dr. Fein was in all respects proper\n   </em>\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   You will also note that Dr. Fein's published U.S. application contains data beyond that included in the original Ferring UK application.\n   <em>\n    See in particular\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Example 8\n   </em>\n   \" and \"Figures 1-9\"\n   <em>\n    of the published application. We trust that you will be able to quickly determine for yourself that the new data did not emanate from Ferring.\n   </em>\n   In any event, we can assure you that the new data in the application came from an independent clinical evaluation commissioned by Dr. Fein and conducted at his own expense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   (Dkt. No. 143 Ex. B AGN_FER000002786-87) (emphases added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Because Ferring failed to respond to this letter, or to suggest that anything in it was incorrect, for seven years, Judge Sweet concluded that Dr. Fein reasonably believed that Ferring did not dispute the subject matter of the Patents in Suit. (Equitable Estoppel Opinion at 15, 30, 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   As Speranza's December 14, 2004 letter illustrates, the subject matter of the Patents in Suit encompassed, among other things, Example 8. Speranza specifically\n   directed Barclay's attention to Example 8, and invited her to \"determine for [her]self [whether] the new data [ ] emanate[d] from Ferring.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) But Barclay (and Ferring) elected not to, leading Judge Sweet to conclude that Fein reasonably believed that Ferring did not object to his patent application. In the face of that conclusion, the Court cannot now infer that Dr. Fein\n   <em>\n    fraudulently\n   </em>\n   concealed from the PTO that Example 8 was subject to an ownership dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Finally, Ferring argues that, even accounting for the Equitable Estoppel Opinion, there are disputed facts that render its inequitable conduct claim plausible, because Judge Sweet-in granting Ferring's motion for summary judgment dismissing the defendants' counterclaims for a correction of inventorship in the 2012 Action-found that Dr. Fein was not the sole inventor on a\n   <em>\n    different\n   </em>\n   set of Ferring patents, Patent Nos. 7,560,429 and 7,947,654 (the \"'429 and '654 Patents\"). (Dkt. No. 13 Ex. 12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt No. 12 Civ. 2650 Dkt. No. 212 (hereinafter referred to as the \"2012 Summary Judgment Opinion\").) Ferring argues that 2012 Summary Judgment Opinion is \"instructive\" because Dr. Fein's alleged inventive contributions to the '429 and '654 Patents and the Patents in Suit here (the '203 and '321 Patents ) are the same. This, they suggest, means that Dr. Fein knowingly misled the PTO about inventorship of the '203 and '321 Patents. (Ferring's First Opp. at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The 2012 Summary Judgment Opinion has no bearing on the present motions. When it sought to prevent this case from being transferred to Judge Sweet, Ferring previously represented to Judge Hellerstein that the technologies at issue in the two sets of patents are different. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 63.) The Patents in Suit are \"broadly directed to the clinical properties of drug products, including the levels of active ingredients in patients' bloodstreams, and are not limited to particular dosage forms.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) By comparison, the '429 and '654 patents are \"formulation patents, directed to specific tablet formulations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The issue contemplated by the 2012 Summary Judgment Opinion, therefore, was whether Dr. Fein was a sole inventor on claims directed to specific tablet formulations-an issue entirely different from the one encompassed by Ferring's present claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Defendants' motion to dismiss Count V of the Amended Complaint is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

Compl. \u00b6 116.) Counts I and II of Ferring's first amended complaint in the 2012 Action sought correction of inventorship, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20256\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , of the '203 and '321 Patents on the same basis-that \"Fein did not invent any subject matter covered by\" those patents. (12 Civ. 2650 Dkt. No. 73 \u00b6\u00b6 112 ( '203 Patent), 127 ( '321 Patent).) In other words, while the claims may be different, the issues presented by the two are identical,\n   <em>\n    viz,\n   </em>\n   whether Fein, the named inventor, is the inventor of the '203 and '321 Patents. It follows, Defendants argue, that Ferring is collaterally estopped from litigating that issue here, since Judge Sweet determined that Ferring was equitably estopped from contesting the same underlying issue-Dr. Fein's inventorship-in the context of a different claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The doctrine of collateral estoppel, which is also known as issue preclusion, bars a party from re-litigating in a\n   second proceeding a factual or legal or issue that has already been decided against him in a prior proceeding.\n   <em>\n    Poindexter v.

(Ferring's Opp. to Def.'s Second Mot. for J. on the Pleadings, dated Oct. 5, 2018, (\"Ferring's Second Opp.\"), at 2, Dkt. No. 241 (emphasis in original).) Having framed the issue in this manner, Ferring has made what might appear at first blush a compelling argument-because Judge Sweet, indeed, did not assess the degree of Dr. Fein's inventive contributions to the '203 and '321 Patents in the Equitable Estoppel Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   But Ferring's characterization is a classic straw man. Defendants' motion is not based upon whether Judge Sweet reached the merits of the parties' inventorship dispute; it is based upon whether Ferring can even dispute inventorship now-in the context of a different claim and in a different action-in light of Judge Sweet's earlier determination that Ferring delayed unduly in challenging Dr. Fein's inventorship status.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Having now defined the \"issue\" to be considered for preclusion, the Court can proceed to applying the four collateral estoppel factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The issue of Ferring's undue delay in challenging Dr. Fein's inventorship of\n   the '203 and '321 Patents was raised in the 2012 Action. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Equitable Estoppel Opinion \u00b6 58). That issue was \"actually litigated and decided\" in the 2012 Action. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-37.) Ferring had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue; indeed, Judge Sweet even granted Ferring's motion for an extension of time to respond to its adversaries' briefing on equitable estoppel. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   12 Civ. 2650 Dkt. No. 143.) And the issue of Ferring's undue delay in challenging inventorship of the '203 and '321 Patents was necessary (indeed, crucial) to Judge Sweet's ultimate decision to grant Defendants' motion for summary judgment on Ferring's correction of inventorship claims (\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Equitable Estoppel Opinion). Ferring does not (and, indeed, cannot reasonably) dispute any of these conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The motion nonetheless raises three significant issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The first is that different statutory bases underlie Ferring's earlier and present inventorship claims. In the 2012 Action, Ferring asserted claims under 35 U.S.C \u00a7 256, seeking to correct inventorship of the '203 and '321 Patents. Here, Ferring seeks a declaration that the '203 and '321 Patents are invalid under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20102\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Patent invalidity is a defense to patent infringement; as Ferring argues, it could not have raised that defense \"until the approval of its NOCDURNA\u00ae product was imminent.\" (Ferring's Second Opp. at 3.)

Permitting Ferring to challenge Dr. Fein's inventorship anew, albeit in the context of a different claim, would undermine every one of the rationales underlying collateral estoppel. By contrast, Ferring will not be substantially prejudiced if the Court were to grant Defendants' motion, because it can still assert (and, indeed, it has asserted) other bases for invalidating the Patents in Suit-none of which is affected by the issue of inventorship. Collateral estoppel simply precludes Ferring from making one of its several arguments in support of invalidity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The second issue relates to the consequences, if any, of Judge Sweet's recent\n   <em>\n    Markman\n   </em>\n   decision in this action. Ferring argues that the\n   <em>\n    Markman\n   </em>\n   decision precludes the Court from applying the doctrine of collateral estoppel, because it establishes that the Patents in Suit \"contain claims 'different in scope' compared to the alleged 'low dosage' invention that Dr. Fein purportedly relied upon (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , as defined in the Speranza[-Barclay] correspondence)[.]\" (Ferring's Supp. Mem. at 6.) This is the same argument it raised earlier in opposing Defendants' motion directed at Count V-namely, that the \"invention\" that was contemplated by Speranza and Barclay when they corresponded was limited to a \"low dosage\" of desmopressin, not the broader inventions that are the subject of the Patents in Suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   For the reasons discussed earlier, the Court rejects Ferring's interpretation of the Equitable Estoppel Opinion, as well as its suggestion that the\n   <em>\n    Markman\n   </em>\n   decision precludes this Court from applying the doctrine of collateral estoppel.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   at 277-79. Both the '203 and '321 Patent claims and the claims in the patent applications that Speranza sent to Barclay on December 14, 2004 included the inventive features of establishing low plasma/serum levels and contemplated various routes of desmopressin administration. The Equitable Estoppel Opinion was not limited to a \"low dose\" invention, so Judge Sweet's\n   <em>\n    Markman\n   </em>\n   decision does not foreclose Defendants' present motion. (Ferring's Supp. Mem. at 4-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The final and most difficult issue is whether the Equitable Estoppel Opinion constitutes a \"final\" judgment for collateral estoppel purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flood,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518649\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/219/#p236\">\n    904 F.3d at 236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (collateral estoppel requires both \"valid\" and \"final\" judgment on the merits).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Neither party considered this particular issue in the first three rounds of briefing they exchanged; Ferring finally raised this argument to the Court in a letter, dated May 14, 2019, in which it advised this Court that it had filed a motion to vacate the Equitable Estoppel Opinion, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b), in the 2012 Action. It argues that this should cause me to find that the Equitable Estoppel Opinion lacks preclusive effect. (Dkt. No. 497;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   12 Civ. 2560 Dkt. No. 373 (Ferring's motion to vacate Collateral Estoppel Opinion).) At the Court's direction, the parties then filed a fourth round of briefs-both of which\n   were heavy on argument but thin on case law analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   As the parties well know, the 2012 Action is ongoing; a bench trial in that case-previously interrupted and postponed, for reasons not relevant here-is scheduled to recommence in July 2019. This means that Ferring has not had an opportunity to appeal the Equitable Estoppel Opinion.

In\n   <em>\n    Kay-R Electric,\n   </em>\n   the Second Circuit (applying\n   <em>\n    Lummus\n   </em>\n   and the Restatement) held that an order denying a motion for summary judgment was not entitled to preclusive effect, principally because it was not subject to review.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10502772\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/23/55/\">\n    23 F.3d at 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . According the court in\n   <em>\n    Paone,\n   </em>\n   the logic of that case applied with equal force in the scenario before it, where there had been a\n   <em>\n    grant\n   </em>\n   of summary judgment in the earlier proceeding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   It seems to me that this reasoning applies with equal force to a partial grant of summary judgment that forms the basis for a settlement.

It reasoned that Broadcom would not be prejudiced by the denial of its motion, because the court would afford substantial deference to the factual findings of the judge who presided\n   over the earlier Paone-Microsoft dispute, and only allow Paone's case against Broadcom to proceed if he could demonstrate that the earlier judge erred in some fashion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Despite certain factual similarities-both cases are patent infringement cases where the defendant seeks to prevent the plaintiff from re-litigating an issue previously decided against it-\n   <em>\n    Paone\n   </em>\n   is not persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   For one thing, the notion that courts outside this Circuit have treated appealability as the\n   <em>\n    sine quo non\n   </em>\n   of collateral estoppel is, in view of\n   <em>\n    Lummus\n   </em>\n   and its progeny, not persuasive to this Court, which must apply Second Circuit law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   For another, the Court rejects the suggestion that\n   <em>\n    Kay-R Electric\n   </em>\n   extends to the circumstances presented in here. It goes without saying that the denial and grant of summary judgment mean two very different things. Where a judge denies summary judgment, she is impliedly withholding a decision on a given issue because there is a genuine issue of material fact. In contrast, a grant of summary judgment reflects that there is no genuine dispute of material fact on any issue. One can readily imagine why the former does not have any preclusive effect. But it hardly follows that, since the former is not final, the latter is not either. If there is no genuine issue of fact, the facts necessary to the decision in granting summary judgment are\n   <em>\n    ipso facto\n   </em>\n   final-and, therefore,\n   <em>\n    do\n   </em>\n   have preclusive effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Finally, the circumstances underlying this case and\n   <em>\n    Paone\n   </em>\n   are markedly different. Where, as here, the same set of parties have been embroiled in seven years of litigation in this District (which is to say nothing of the legal battles the parties are waging in other forums), fairness and judicial efficiency are not served by disturbing what strikes me as a manifestly \"final\" decision on the issue of inventorship. This is especially so in light of the fact that the Court has under taken the rigorous task of reviewing\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   the Equitable Estoppel Opinion and has independently arrived at the same legal conclusions as Judge Sweet.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walker,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267845\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/239/738/#p741\">\n    239 F.
