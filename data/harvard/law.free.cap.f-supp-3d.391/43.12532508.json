The interviews of interest were FBI interviews of former President Barack Obama, former presidential Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, and former Senior Advisor to the President Valerie Jarrett.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After the FBI searched its records, it informed Judicial Watch that all records it had located would be withheld under various FOIA exemptions. Judicial Watch filed suit and both parties moved for summary judgment. This Court granted the government's Motion for Summary Judgment under FOIA Exemption 7(A), which protects law enforcement records, as the prosecution and conviction of Mr. Blagojevich was still subject to further appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch, Inc. v.

Law enforcement agents operating in their independent investigatory capacities are not usually considered attorney agents\n   whose notes are protected as attorney work product, but once they are acting in a supportive role to an attorney preparing a case for indictment or prosecution, the attorney work-product protection applies to their work product under FOIA Exemption 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   After considering the circumstances surrounding the interviews and preparation of the Forms 302, this Court finds that the FBI agents were acting as agents of attorneys in the Chicago Office of the United States Attorney when they drafted the Forms 302 and, therefore, that those records are protected from release under FOIA by the attorney work-product doctrine recognized in Exemption 5. As explained by Ms. Bonamici:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   During December 2008, the USAO, FBI, and other investigative agencies continued to collaborate in selecting, planning, and conducting interviews and gathering additional evidence ... in support of the USAO's effort to indict, and subsequently try, Blagojevich and others....

However,\n   <em>\n    New York Times\n   </em>\n   did not revolve around whether the Forms 302 were drafted or edited by an attorney.

Pl.'s Reply at 5. But Judicial Watch understates the similarities.

Judicial Watch suggests a new limit on the scope of the attorney work-product doctrine, arguing that the government does not claim that attorneys specifically directed the FBI agents to prepare Forms 302 after the interviews.
