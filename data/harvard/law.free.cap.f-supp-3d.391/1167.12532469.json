(\"ST Metals\") and Robert Escobio for violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (the \"CEA\"). In addition to affirming the Court's findings of liability under all four counts of the CFTC's Complaint, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the Court's issuance of injunctive relief, civil penalties, and $ 1,543,892 in restitution for the leveraged-metals scheme at issue in Counts 1 through 3 of the CFTC's Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    S.

The Parties' Submissions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On remand, the Court entered an order directing the parties to file briefs addressing (1) the appropriate remedy for Defendants' registration violations and (2) the appropriate amount to be awarded.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 267.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The CFTC submitted its brief on March 5, 2019.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 279. The CFTC argues that disgorgement is the appropriate remedy, and that $ 360,337 is the appropriate amount.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. The CFTC notes that, unlike restitution, which is restricted to \"losses proximately caused\" by the violation, disgorgement may be ordered upon a showing of \"gains received in connection with\" a violation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7 (quoting \u00a7\u00a7 13a-1(d)(3)(A), (B) ). Applying that \"gains received\" language here, the CFTC contends that disgorgement in the amount of $ 360,337 is appropriate based on the Court's finding that ST Metals charged commissions to its futures customers in the amount of $ 360,337.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 (citing Aug. 29, 2016 Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law at 10, DE 166).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On March 22, 2019, Defendants filed their opposing brief arguing that disgorgement is improper and that no other remedies should be imposed for their registration violations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Br., DE 294. Defendants first argue that the CFTC waived the right to pursue disgorgement by only including restitution in its proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Defendants also contend that Escobio cannot be held jointly and severally liable for disgorgement with ST Metals because there was no record evidence\n   showing that Escobio himself received any of the commissions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-8. Also, Defendants argue that disgorgement cannot be ordered against ST Metals either, because, under their reading of the case law, \"proximate cause must be shown in every federal cause of action,\" and the CFTC cannot satisfy the proximate cause requirement for disgorgement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In addition to challenging disgorgement as a remedy, Defendants contest the amount proposed by the CFTC. According to Defendants, disgorgement is measured by \"net gains, taking account of expenses,\" and here, the CFTC \"presented no evidence to demonstrate Southern Trust Metals' net gains, accounting for expenses associated with the transactions and commissions split with brokers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11. Finally, Defendants argue that such an award would amount to an excessive fine in violation of the Eighth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Disgorgement Under the Commodity Exchange Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Section 13a-1(d)(3) of the CEA codifies the equitable remedies that may be imposed for violations of the statute. It reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   In any action brought under this section, the Commission may seek, and the court may impose, on a proper showing, on any person found in the action to have committed any violation, equitable remedies including--\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (B) disgorgement of gains received in connection with such violation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   7 U.S.C. \u00a7 13a-1(d)(3)(B).

Count 4, DE 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the Court's factual findings described the \"losses\" and \"gains\" stemming from this unregistered futures scheme.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 166 at 9-10. Although the Court's findings focused primarily on customer losses, the Court also described gains received by ST Metals in finding that it charged commissions to its futures customers in the amount of $ 360,337.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Final Judgment at 6 (describing \"the total monetary gain to Defendants of $ 360,337\" as the amount that ST Metals \"charged its[ ] futures customers in connection with the violations ... described in Count 4 of the Complaint\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Accordingly, the Court's prior orders and findings support the conclusion that the commissions charged to ST Metals's futures customers constitute ill-gotten gains received in connection with Defendants' registration violations, and that $ 360,337 is a \"reasonable approximation of [those] ill-gotten gains,\"\n   <em>\n    Amerman,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4318060\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/645/938/#p943\">\n    645 F.

In\n   <em>\n    Honeycutt,\n   </em>\n   the Supreme Court held that a criminal forfeiture statute did not permit a defendant to be held jointly and severally liable for property that his co-conspirator derived from the crime, but that the defendant himself did not acquire.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604669\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1626/#p1635\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604669\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1626/#p1635\">\n    at 1630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Br. 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendants' reliance on\n   <em>\n    Honeycutt\n   </em>\n   is misplaced. Unlike the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Honeycutt\n   </em>\n   , the record supports the finding that Escobio\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   receive monetary gains in connection with the registration violations.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Aug. 29, 2016 Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law at 24 (finding that \"\n   <em>\n    Defendants'\n   </em>\n   monetary gain from the transactions at issue\" includes \"\n   <em>\n    the commissions charged in connection with the unregistered futures sales\n   </em>\n   \") (emphasis added); Apr. 7, 2016 Order Granting Partial Summary Judgment at 10 (finding Escobio liable as the controlling person of ST Metals, noting that he was \"the largest shareholder in the Holding Company, which owns both ST Metals and Loreley\" and \"a signatory to ST Metals and Loreley's bank accounts, and had authority to transfer money to and from those accounts\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In any event, the Court does not agree that the criminal forfeiture statute discussed in\n   <em>\n    Honeycutt\n   </em>\n   is analogous to the CEA's disgorgement provision at issue here. Unlike the forfeiture statute, which applies only to the particular defendant who obtained the tainted property, the CEA's disgorgement provision applies to \"any person found in the action to have committed any violation\"-regardless of whether that person was also the one who personally \"received\" the ill-gotten gains.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20853\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   7 U.S.C. \u00a7 13a-1(d)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Even assuming disgorgement could be considered \"punishment\" subject to the Excessive Fines Clause, ordering Defendants to return the commissions they charged while acting as an unregistered futures merchant is hardly \"excessive.\" As the Court found after holding a three-day bench trial, Defendants' violations were \"egregious, systematic, and calculated.\" Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law at 24. Indeed, while courts in this Circuit have issued penalties representing\n   <em>\n    triple\n   </em>\n   the monetary gain to defendants in comparable cases,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12623902\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/682/#p688\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing cases), this Court imposed a penalty totaling just\n   <em>\n    one-third\n   </em>\n   of Defendants' monetary gain, in part because Defendants were already required to make full restitution to their victims. A significant portion of that restitution obligation has now been vacated, however, and a $ 360,337 disgorgement order is still far less than triple the monetary gain that could have been imposed as a civil penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
