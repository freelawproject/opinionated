(DE 34). Plaintiff Dennis Haynes (\"Plaintiff\") filed his Response on December 15, 2017 (DE 42), to which Defendant replied on December 20, 2017 (DE 43). For reasons stated below, Defendant's Motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 30, 2017, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against Defendant alleging a violation of Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012181\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (DE 1). On October 25, 2017, the Court granted in part Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint, finding that Plaintiff failed to state a claim \"because he did not plead sufficient facts to demonstrate that he was denied access to the benefits of Defendant's physical stores due to the inaccessibility of Defendant's website.\" (DE 25 (hereinafter, \"Dismissal Order\")). Consistent with the Court's Dismissal Order, Plaintiff timely filed an Amended Complaint on November 8, 2017, which re-alleged the same cause of action and sought the same relief, but added factual allegations to support his claim. (DE 27 (\"Compl.\")).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that he \"is blind and therefore unable to engage in and enjoy the major life activity of seeing,\" constituting a disability as defined by the ADA. (Compl. \u00b6 1). As a result, \"Plaintiff is unable to read computer materials and/or access and comprehend internet website information without software specifically designed for the visually impaired ... [s]pecifically, ... JAWS Screen Reader software.\" (Compl. \u00b6 2). Plaintiff alleges that Defendant \"owns, operates, or leases a chain of stores throughout the United States, the State of Florida, and Broward County,\" which are places of public accommodation as defined by the ADA. (Compl. \u00b6 4). Plaintiff alleges that Defendant's website, www.kohls.com, is required by law to be in compliance with the ADA, but that it is not. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that he \"attempted to access and/or utilize Defendant's website, but was unable to, and continues to be unable to, enjoy full and equal access to the website and/or understand the content therein because numerous portions of the website do not interface with and are not readable by SRS.\" (Compl. \u00b6 10). Plaintiff avers that since \"Defendant's website contains graphics, links, headings, forms and text with information that is not fully readable and/or compatible with SRS,\" Plaintiff was prevented \"from enjoying the following benefits of Kohl's physical stores: access to the location of the physical stores, including which physical store is nearest or more convenient to the Plaintiff; the ability to obtain discount coupons to be applied to purchases; the ability to obtain information on items are [sic] being offered for sale at a reduced or clearance price; the opportunity to place an order through the website for free pickup at a designated store of Plaintiff's choice.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff alleges that he has suffered and will continue to suffer injuries as long as Defendant's website remains non-compliant with the ADA and inaccessible to him as an individual with blindness. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 12-16). Plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, and an award of attorney's fees and costs. (Compl. at 11-12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant filed a motion to dismiss claiming: (1) its website is not required to comply with the ADA as a matter of law, and therefore Plaintiff's Complaint fails to state a claim pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) ; (2) even if Plaintiff states a claim, that requiring Defendant to make its website comply with the ADA would violate Defendant's due process rights; and (3) that the Complaint should be dismissed\n   under the primary jurisdiction doctrine. (DE 34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) challenges the legal sufficiency of a complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ.

Plaintiff alleges that Defendant's place of public accommodation is the chain of stores that it owns, operates, or leases throughout the United States, Florida, and Broward County. (Compl. \u00b6 4). Plaintiff avers that since \"Defendant's website contains graphics, links, headings, forms and text with information that is not fully readable and/or compatible with SRS,\" Plaintiff was prevented \"from enjoying the following benefits of Kohl's physical stores,\" which included \"the opportunity to place an order through the website for free pickup at a designated store of Plaintiff's choice.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl. \u00b6 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   By alleging that (1) Defendant's website gives individuals \"the opportunity to place an order through the website for free pickup\" at Defendant's physical stores, and that (2) Plaintiff was prevented from using that portion of the website because it was not compatible with SRS and inaccessible to him as an individual with blindness, Plaintiff pled facts sufficient to plausibly state a claim under the nexus theory. Because this portion of the website is alleged to be incompatible with SRS, the website acts as an \"intangible barrier\" to at least one benefit of Defendant's physical stores. Accordingly, Plaintiff states a claim under Title III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Due Process\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendant argues that even if Plaintiff stated a claim under Title III of the ADA, Plaintiff's claim must be dismissed because it violates Defendant's due process rights to hold it liable for failing to make its website accessible to individuals with visual impairments. Defendant argues that its due process rights would be violated in two ways. First, Defendant contends that \"because neither the statute nor its implementing regulations give any guidance whatsoever as to whether a website is covered by the ADA at all,\" it would violate Defendant's due process rights to hold it liable for not making its website ADA-compliant. (DE 42 at 1-2). Second, Defendant argues that \"[h]olding Kohl's liable for failing to make its website compatible with a privately developed software program, in the absence of any laws or regulations giving Kohl's any guidance at all about what a website must do to comply with the ADA, would violate the most basic notions of due process.\" (DE 42 at 10). Although Defendant is correct that the ADA and its regulations do not specifically mention websites, and that there are no specific government guidelines for Title III ADA-compliant websites, Defendant's arguments fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"Due process requires 'that the law must be one that carries an understandable meaning with legal standards that courts must enforce.' \"\n   <em>\n    Harris v.
