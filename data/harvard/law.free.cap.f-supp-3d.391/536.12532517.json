Having considered PLAINTIFF OLIVER HOLMES' SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF REGARDING SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION (ECF No. 49), DEFENDANTS' JOINT SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF REGARDING SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION (ECF No. 50), and PLAINTIFF OLIVER HOLMES' SUPPLEMENTAL REPLY BRIEF REGARDING SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION (ECF No. 51), the Court concludes that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the claims asserted in the FAC.

R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6). In reviewing that Motion, and the parties' supporting and opposing memoranda thereto (ECF Nos. 30, 36, 37), it appeared that the Court might lack subject matter jurisdiction over the case because: (1)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20501\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) requires that \"[n]o such proceeding [for violations of fiduciary duties under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20501\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ] shall be brought except upon leave of the court obtained upon verified application and for good cause shown,\" and Holmes did not seek leave of court to file the action; and (2) the FAC alleged that supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims in Counts II through V was proper under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201343\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but that statute pertains to \"civil rights and elective franchise.\" The FAC made no reference to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the statute pertaining to supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims. Because of these concerns, the Court ordered additional briefing on whether it had subject matter jurisdiction over all five Counts in the FAC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The parties have submitted their supplemental briefing on subject matter jurisdiction. ECF Nos. 49, 50, 51. Having considered the supplemental briefing, the Court is satisfied that the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the Court; and that, therefore, oral argument would not aid the decisional process. The matter is ripe for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Legal Framework\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Count I of the FAC is based on the LMRDA, 29 U.S.C \u00a7 501. Section 501 (a) establishes that certain union officials owe their union fiduciary duties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   If a covered union official violates the provisions of Section 501(a), then subsection (b) comes into play. Subsection (b) is entitled \"Violation of duties; action by member after refusal or failure by labor organization to commence proceedings;\n   <em>\n    jurisdiction\n   </em>\n   ; leave of court; counsel fees and expenses\" (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In relevant part, Section 501(b) reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   When any [covered union official] is alleged to have violated the duties declared in subsection (a) and the labor organization or its governing board or officers refuse or fail to sue or recover damages or secure an accounting or other appropriate relief within a reasonable time\n   <em>\n    after being requested to do so by any member of the labor organization\n   </em>\n   , such member may sue such [covered union official] in any district court of the United States or in any State court of competent jurisdiction to recover damages or secure an accounting or other appropriate relief for the benefit of the labor organization.\n   <em>\n    No such proceeding shall be brought\n   </em>\n   except upon\n   <em>\n    leave of the court\n   </em>\n   obtained upon\n   <em>\n    verified application\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    for good cause shown\n   </em>\n   , which application may be made ex parte.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (emphasis added). Based on the plain text of the statute, Section 501(b) imposes three requirements of a plaintiff who files suit thereunder. First, the plaintiff must make certain demands on the union, its governing board, or its officers that are refused or ignored. Second, the plaintiff must receive \"leave of the court obtained upon verified application\" before bringing such an action. Third, to secure leave of court to sue, the plaintiff must demonstrate \"good cause.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20501\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"[C]ourts, including [the Supreme Court], have an independent obligation to determine whether subject matter jurisdiction exits, even in the absence of a challenge from any party.\"\n   <em>\n    Arbaugh v.

Like a COA in the habeas context, Section 501(b) mandates a necessary step that must occur before jurisdiction vests. Further, the caption of Section 501(b) uses the term \"jurisdiction.\" While the caption may not, on its own, tip the scales towards finding a clear indication of Congressional intent, it is certainly (especially in combination with the statutory text) evidence of Congress' intent that \u00a7 501(b) deals with a jurisdictional, rather than a claims-processing, requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Henderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6023194,12457263\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/428/\">\n    562 U.S. at 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6023194,4151926,12457263\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/1197/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Second, an assessment of the statutory structure supports the conclusion that Section 501 (b) is jurisdictional. Title 29, Chapter 11 of the United States Code contains the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act. Section 501(b) is located in \"Subchapter VI-Safeguards for Labor Organizations.\" The other subchapters deal with different topics, like elections (Subchapter V) and the Bill of Rights of Members of Labor Organizations (Subchapter II). Many of these other subchapters have jurisdictional provisions. For example,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20412\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (located in Subchapter II) is titled \"Civil action for infringement of rights; jurisdiction\" and\n   gives a broad right to sue in federal district court for violations of Subchapter II.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 440 (jurisdiction for the Secretary of Labor to sue for violations of Subchapter III); \u00a7 482(b) (setting a 60-day limitations period for the Secretary to sue a labor organization under subchapter V).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Thus, the statutory scheme teaches that Congress intended that the subchapters of Title 29, Chapter 11 were to have different jurisdictional requirements. There is not a \"catch-all\" jurisdictional section that applies to the entire Chapter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Henderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6023194,12457263\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/428/\">\n    562 U.S. at 439-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6023194,4151926,12457263\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/1197/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Congress elected not to place the 120-day limit in the VJRA subchapter entitled 'Organization and Jurisdiction.' \");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arbaugh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5937941\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/500/#p513\">\n    546 U.S. at 514-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5937941\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/500/#p513\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (placement of a provision in a \"definitional\" portion of the statute militates towards that provision being non-jurisdictional). And, compared to other provisions of Chapter 11, Congress wrote Section 501(b) in a more restrictive way.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20412\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Any person whose rights secured by the provisions of this subchapter have been infringed by any violation of this subchapter may bring a civil action in a district court of the United States for such relief (including injunctions) as may be appropriate\")\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20501\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (union \"member may sue...in any district court of the United States....No such proceeding shall be brought except upon leave of the court obtained upon verified application and for good cause shown, which application may be made ex parte\"). In other words, comparing provisions throughout Chapter 11, it is reasonable to conclude that Congress intended different jurisdictional provisions to apply to Chapter 11 actions and that Section 501(b) provides a restrictive grant of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Finally, the purpose of Section 501(b) also teaches that Congress intended to limit this Court's jurisdiction over suits such as the one filed by Holmes. As the Second Circuit held in\n   <em>\n    Dinko\n   </em>\n   , \"the requirements of section 501 (b) were designed 'to protect union officials from unjust harassment.'...[W]e take that statutory purpose very seriously.\"\n   <em>\n    Dinko v.

In other words, Congress' intention was to insulate union officials from meritless claims by requiring certain predicate procedural steps to be taken. The purpose underlying the statute suggest a \"limitation on a class of cases a court may entertain,\"\n   <em>\n    Fort Bend\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12620151\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/1843/#p1849\">\n    139 S.Ct. at 1848\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , or, in other words, the articulated statutory purpose supports the conclusion that Section 501(b) is a jurisdictional rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In sum, Section 501(b) is properly understood as a limitation on the Court's subject matter jurisdiction. So now, it is necessary to determine whether Holmes satisfied the statute's requirements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

The parties devoted their briefing largely to arguing about whether Holmes has satisfied these requirements of Section 501(b). However, it is unnecessary to determine whether Holmes has satisfied the first or third prerequisites or the verification aspect of\n   the leave of court requirement. That is so because, as he acknowledges, Holmes never sought \"leave of court\" before filing suit. Because he has not satisfied the key jurisdictional requirement, Holmes has failed to establish that the Court has subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Holmes acknowledges that he never sought leave of court before he filed the FAC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 4 9 at 6.

He argues instead that, considering his attached verification, \"the First Amended Complaint is verified, and Mr. Holmes respectfully requests the Court determine that filing the Complaint with this Court constitutes a request for leave to file a verified complaint, pursuant to Section 501(b).\" ECF No. 49 at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Holmes relies on the Third Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Sabolsky v.

In\n   <em>\n    Sabolsky\n   </em>\n   , over 100 coal miners had filed a verified complaint with the district court, alleging that their union had violated fiduciary duties under LMRDA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"733925\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/457/1245/#p1249\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"733925\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/457/1245/#p1249\">\n    at 1247-48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, he ignores the fact that, in\n   <em>\n    Sabolsky\n   </em>\n   (and the\n   <em>\n    Horner\n   </em>\n   case cited therein), the plaintiff (s) had filed a \"verified complaint\" and the courts there excused the plaintiff's failure to seek leave of court. Here, Holmes neither sought leave of court nor filed a \"verified complaint.\" Instead, after learning of the Court's concern about jurisdiction, he filed his \"verification\" (ECF No. 49-1) as an attachment to his brief on jurisdiction. In other words, he asks the Court to excuse not one, but two jurisdictional failures on his part.\n   <em>\n    Sabolsky\n   </em>\n   does not support that position, and Holmes has cited no authority to the contrary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Austin Trandell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9410251\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/207/616/#p622\">\n    207 F.

Proceeding as Holmes suggests forecloses the opportunity for union officials to present their views on that topic. That is no mean deprivation. To the extent that\n   <em>\n    Sabolsky\n   </em>\n   may hold otherwise, the Court declines to follow\n   <em>\n    Sabolsky\n   </em>\n   because it is at odds with the clear text of Section 501(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   That the statute permits an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   filing of the motion for leave to file the Complaint does not mean that an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   filing is appropriate.

Indeed, the Court rarely allows\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   hearings and then only in cases of genuine general emergency, such as the need to stop theft or to preserve the Court's jurisdiction. And even then, the adverse party (here the Union officials) are given notice and an immediate opportunity to be heard about whether the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   action should stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Courts must remember that \"statutes extending federal jurisdiction, such as Section 501(b), are narrowly construed so as not to reach beyond the limits intended by Congress.\"\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2129382\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/403/826/#p828\">\n    403 F.2d at 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
