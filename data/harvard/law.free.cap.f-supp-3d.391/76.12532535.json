Plaintiffs are Indonesian citizens who claim that Exxon's security forces engaged in extrajudicial\n   killing; torture; cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment; and arbitrary detention in violation of the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) and committed various common law torts. Now before the Court is Exxon's motion to dismiss the ATS claims. Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss the ATS Claims, ECF No. 634. For the reasons set forth below, the Court declines to recognize domestic corporate liability under the ATS in circumstances where, as here, the claims have caused significant diplomatic strife. The Court will therefore dismiss plaintiffs' ATS claims against Exxon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs only remaining claims are the claims for wrongful death; battery; assault; arbitrary arrest, detention, and false imprisonment; negligence, negligent hiring; negligent supervision; and conversion.

Security at the facilities was an enormous concern at the time, as there was an ongoing internal conflict in the Aceh Province. Exxon and its subsidiaries, which were incorporated at the time of the first complaint in New Jersey and Delaware, retained these soldiers as guards for its natural gas facility even though Exxon was allegedly aware that the Indonesian military had committed human rights abuses in the past and that performing the security contract would lead to human rights violations by the Indonesian soldiers against the Aceh residents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33-55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   According to the complaint, the Indonesian military's actions could be attributed to Exxon because they were committed by a unit dedicated solely to providing security for Exxon, and Exxon had the authority \"to direct[ ] and control\" the soldiers' actions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34-41.

First, corporate liability under the ATS is not essential to serve the. goals of the statute.\n   <em>\n    Jesner,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611257\" index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1386/\">\n    138 S. Ct. at 1405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs can still sue individual corporate employees responsible under the ATS for a violation of international law. If courts allow corporations to be liable under the ATS for violations of international law, \"then plaintiffs may well ignore the human perpetrators and concentrate instead on multinational corporate entities.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611257\" index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1386/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Second, allowing plaintiffs to sue corporations under the ATS could discourage U.S. corporations from investing abroad, including in developing economies where the governments may have histories of alleged human-rights violations. \"And, in consequence, that often might deter the active corporate investment that contributes to the economic development that so often is an essential foundation for human rights.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611257\" index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1386/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611257\" index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1386/\">\n    at 1406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Third, Congress is better suited than the Judiciary to examine the difficult and complex policy questions about whether to impose liability on corporations. As the plurality in\n   <em>\n    Jesner\n   </em>\n   pointed out, \"natural persons can and do use corporations for sinister purposes, including conduct that violates international law ... [s]o there are strong arguments for permitting the victims to seek relief from corporations themselves.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611257\" index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1386/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The multifaceted nature of this issue makes it especially important that Congress determine whether corporations can be sued for violating international law. \"Congress, not the Judiciary, is the branch with 'the facilities necessary to make fairly such an important policy decision where the possibilities of international discord are so evident.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611257\" index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1386/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Kiobel,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697039\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/108/#p120\">\n    569 U.S. at 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697039\" index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/108/#p120\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

This is the type of foreign relations tension the First Congress sought to avoid when passing the ATS. Plaintiffs have caused foreign relations tensions by using the ATS as a sword in this case, but the ATS was enacted to shield the U.S. from such diplomatic imbroglios. As the Supreme Court stated in\n   <em>\n    Jesner,\n   </em>\n   \"judicial caution under\n   <em>\n    Sosa\n   </em>\n   'guards against our courts triggering ... serious foreign policy consequences, and instead defers such decisions, quite appropriately, to the political branches.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1407 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Kiobel,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697039\" index=\"230\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/108/#p120\">\n    569 U.S. at 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697039\" index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/108/#p120\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Therefore, under\n   <em>\n    Sosa\n   </em>\n   's second question, this Court finds that caution requires the political branches to grant specific authority before domestic corporate liability against Exxon can be imposed. Recognizing corporate liability under the ATS in this case could have adverse foreign policy consequences and raises significant separation of powers concerns. The Court declines to extend liability under the ATS to corporate defendants absent congressional instructions in circumstances where, as here, the claims have cause significant diplomatic strife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Supreme Court's prior precedents counsel against creating a private right of action in this case. International law has not extended the scope of liability to corporations. Accordingly, there is not a specific, universal, and obligatory norm of corporate liability under currently prevailing international law as required by\n   <em>\n    Sosa\n   </em>\n   for ATS cases. Also, separation of powers and foreign relations concerns lead the Court to decline to recognize domestic corporate liability under the ATS in circumstances where, as here, the claims have caused significant diplomatic strife. The Court will\n   <strong>\n    DISMISS\n   </strong>\n   plaintiffs' ATS claims against Exxon. Plaintiffs only remaining claims are therefore the claims for wrongful death; battery; assault; arbitrary arrest, detention, and false imprisonment; negligence, negligent hiring; negligent supervision; and conversion. These tort claims are governed by Indonesian law. A separate order will follow.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
