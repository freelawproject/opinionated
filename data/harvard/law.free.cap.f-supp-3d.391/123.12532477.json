Plaintiff Keith L. Miller, an attorney, is the trustee of the MRFS Living Trust, which owns land near the proposed cell tower site. He alleges that Defendants SBA Towers V, LLC and New Cingular Wireless PCS, LLC (the \"Wireless Defendants\") and the City of Gloucester intentionally deprived him of statutorily required notice of the Zoning Board of Appeals proceedings concerning a variance needed to build the cell tower.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that all three Defendants violated\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Count I) and that the Wireless Defendants violated Mass.

The Wireless Defendants also move to dismiss the 93A claim based on Massachusetts's anti-SLAPP statute (Docket No. 48). Defendants move for Rule 11 sanctions against Miller for statements made in his verified complaint (Docket No. 51). After hearing, the Court\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ALLOWS\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   the motions to dismiss (Docket Nos. 44 and 48) and\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ALLOWS\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   Defendants' motion for sanctions (Docket No. 51).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following background comes from the First Amended Verified Complaint (\"FAC\") (Docket No. 39).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Foley v.

Plaintiff has not objected to the consideration of these emails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Miller is the trustee of the MRFS Living Trust, which owns real property located in Gloucester, Massachusetts (the \"Miller Property\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Petition for a Variance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Gloucester Zoning Ordinance 5.13 (the \"Ordinance\") governs the construction of cell towers in the City. The Ordinance establishes certain height restrictions depending on whether the proposed cell tower location is within an overlay district as designated on the City's zoning map. Under the Ordinance, and pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40A, \u00a7 10, the Gloucester Zoning Board of Appeals (\"ZBA\") has jurisdiction to hear and vote on petitions for variances from the requirements of the ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On September 5, 2014, the Wireless Defendants filed a petition with the ZBA seeking a variance to construct a 150-foot cell tower at 250 Concord Street in Gloucester. The real property at 240/250 Concord Street is owned by the Donald L. Fryklund Living Trust (the \"Fryklund Property\"). The petition included a list of abutters to 250 Concord Street who were entitled to notice of any hearing and any decision of the ZBA as \"parties in interest\" under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40A, \u00a7 11. The abutters report, which was prepared by the City's Assessors Office for the purpose of notifying abutters as required, does not list the Miller Property as abutting 250 Concord Street.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Miller did not receive notice as an abutter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Neighborhood Emails\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   From October 2014 through December 2014, Miller received emails from his neighbors in Gloucester concerning the Wireless Defendants' petition for a variance to build the cell tower. On November 15, 2014, Sue Klem emailed a group of neighbors, including Miller, the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   For those of you who did not attend the ZBA hearing on November 13 on the Fryklund cell tower:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The ZBA said they do not have experience with cell towers and seemed to feel that it was not their role/jurisdiction to make decisions on such potentially controversial projects as the Fryklund's cell tower height .... They would like the City Council to handle this.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The ZBA will take up the Fryklund cell tower at their next meeting on Thursday, December 11 at 7pm. It sounds like this meeting will deal with technicalities of moving the decision to the City Council.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Docket No. 51-2 at 67. Miller responded to Klem via email that same evening: \"Thanks. I was away on thursday [sic], but will plan on coming to next meeting.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10507731\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/987/1/#p3\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10507731\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/987/1/#p3\">\n    at 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On December 8, 2014, Miller received another email from Klem stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   The Zoning Board of Appeals hearing has been moved to Thursday, December 18 at Gloucester Town Hall in the second floor auditorium. The Fryklund cell tower will be discussed at 7pm, at the beginning of the meeting. The ZBA and the City Council seem to want the request by [the Wireless Defendants] for variances to the city cell phone tower ordinance to be taken up by the City Council, most likely starting in January. So the December 18 ZBA meeting will likely be more of formality [sic].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10507731\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/987/1/#p3\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10507731\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/987/1/#p3\">\n    at 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On December 18, 2014, the ZBA issued an opinion denying the Wireless Defendants' request for a use-variance to build the tower but granting their request for a procedural variance to appear before the Gloucester City Council and request a cell tower special permit, pursuant to Ordinance Section 5.13.3.1(c). In its opinion on the petition, the ZBA expressly stated that the \"decision granting the petitioners zoning relief is made solely for the purpose of allowing them to appear before City Council, which is the proper and exclusive forum for determining whether a special permit should be granted for the Cell Tower.\" Docket No. 39-5 at 7. Miller received no notice of the ZBA's decision granting the variance and asserts he had no \"actual knowledge that the ZBA had rendered a decision with legal significance.\" FAC \u00b6\u00b6 17-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Petition for Special Permit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On March 4, 2015, relying on the variance from the ZBA, the Wireless Defendants filed an application with the City Council seeking a special permit to build a 150-foot cell tower. The City Council and the its Planning and Development Committee held several public hearings related to the application in 2015. FAC On June 23, 2015, the City Council conducted a public hearing to vote on the application, which Miller attended and spoke at.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On August 11, 2015 the City Council issued a written opinion granting the Wireless Defendants a special permit to construct a 130-foot cell tower on the Fryklund Property. The decision was filed with the City Clerk on August 13, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Prior Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Miller challenged the City Council's decision to grant the special permit in both Massachusetts Superior Court and Massachusetts Land Court. In superior court, Miller asserted two counts against the City and Wireless Defendants. On January 15, 2016, the superior court granted the Wireless Defendants' motion to dismiss Count I, which sought declaratory relief pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231A, \u00a7 1, holding: \"To the extent that Miller seeks to use Count I to challenge the ZBA's December Decision, which he did not appeal, the claim must be dismissed.\" Docket No. 39-6 at 4. On January 11, 2018, the superior\n   court also allowed the Defendants' motion to dismiss Count II for lack of standing. The Court held Miller was not a \"person aggrieved\" under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40A, \u00a7 17 and thus lacked standing to challenge the issuance of the special permit. Docket No. 45-1 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In the land court case, the Court granted judgment on the pleadings for the City based on preclusion from the judgment of the superior court. The land court also held that an appeal under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40A, \u00a7 17 was the exclusive remedy available to Miller. Miller filed notices of appeal from both judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Withdrawal of Intent to Build\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On July 10, 2018, the Wireless Defendants sent a letter to the City stating their intent not to pursue construction of the cell tower on the Fryklund Property. The letter stated in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The [Wireless Defendants] hereby surrender all rights and interests under the special permit ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Accordingly, the [Wireless Defendants] will not be constructing, operating, or maintaining the proposed [cell tower] at [the Fryklund Property] as authorized by the special permit. However, the [Wireless Defendants] reserve the right to seek authorization for a [cell tower] at that same (or any other Gloucester) location in accordance with the provisions of the now applicable Zoning By-Law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Docket No. 39-7 at 2. Due to the letter, Miller voluntarily withdrew his appeals in both cases \"on the basis of mootness.\" FAC \u00b6 28. Miller subsequently filed his initial complaint in this case on August 7, 2018 (Docket No. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In analyzing whether a complaint states a claim sufficient under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a court must set aside any statements that are merely conclusory and examine only the pleader's factual allegations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

Additionally, Miller knew about the purpose of the ZBA's December 18, 2014 meeting because Klem informed him that the \"meeting will deal with technicalities of moving the decision to the City Council.\" Docket No. 51-2 at 67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Miller admitted before this Court that he knew he was not receiving statutory notice well before the ZBA issued its final decision.

Okay, I said, 'Okay, I guess I'm not an abutter because maybe there are two deeded parcels.' \" Docket No. 71 at 41:20-23.

The ZBA issued its decision on December 18, 2014. It was docketed with the City Clerk on January 12, 2015. The Wireless Defendants filed an application with the City Council seeking a special permit, which was\n   <em>\n    premised\n   </em>\n   on the variance from the ZBA, on March 4, 2015. Miller knew about the application because he spoke at one of the City Council meetings in the early spring of 2015. He would have at least been on inquiry notice then to determine the content of the ZBA's decision. Miller filed this suit on August 7, 2018, more than three years after he knew or had reason to know of any injury arising from the failure to get notice of the ZBA proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

Even if Miller is a party in interest, he cites no case law to support the proposition that the requirement to provide statutory notice creates a\n   transactional relationship in the business context. Miller is correct that chapter 93A does not require contractual privity. \"Nonetheless, some business, commercial, or transactional relationship is required even for a claim brought under section 9.

Second, the burden shifts, and the nonmoving party must show \"that the special movant's petitioning activities upon which the challenged claim is based lack a reasonable basis in fact or law, i.e., constitute sham petitioning, and that the petitioning activities at issue caused it injury.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20N.E.3d%2021\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Third, the \"nonmoving party [must show] that its own claim - the one being challenged by the special motion - is itself colorable ....

Second, Miller has not shown that these petitioning activities constituted a sham.

Based on the history of litigation between the parties, the statement of the Wireless Defendants that they reserve the right to re-petition the City, and the frivolous nature of this suit, the Court concludes with \"fair assurance\" that the purpose of the suit is to chill the Wireless Defendants' right to re-petition the City of Gloucester to build a cell tower.\n   <em>\n    Blanchard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20N.E.3d%2021\">\n    75 N.E.3d at 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Examination of the record shows that Miller was copied on numerous emails between October 6, 2014 and December 11, 2014, in which opponents of the proposed tower discussed, in detail, the ZBA hearing schedule for the proposed tower.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 51-2 (Def.

Miller\n   does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   deny that the emails alerted him to the existence of the petition or hearings for the proposed cell tower.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 55-1 \u00b6\u00b6 8, 12-15. Rather, he states in his affidavit that, \"[r]elying on [Klem's emails], and various conflicts, [he] did not attend the next ZBA meeting, or any subsequent meetings, including the final hearing,\" and that the emails never discussed \"the true purpose of the Application, or the substance of the [d]ecision.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-16. Miller further asserts that \"the record before the Court is devoid of any constructive or actual notice to [him] of (a) what was before the ZBA for consideration regarding the proposed cell tower and/or (b) the substance of the ZBA's [d]ecision during any relevant appeal period.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   This argument is head-spinning. The emails clearly show that Miller had actual notice that the ZBA was holding hearings on the Wireless Defendants' application and that it would likely be issuing an opinion to transfer the ultimate decision to the City Council.
