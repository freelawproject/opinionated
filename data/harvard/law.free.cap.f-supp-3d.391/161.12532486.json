Following the introduction, Mr. Sullivan and Dumont agreed (the \"Cook Agreement\") that, if Mr. Cook purchased an aircraft from Dumont, Dumont would pay Mr. Sullivan a commission of $50,000 plus 5% of future charter sales on the aircraft.\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12530045\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/364/63/\">\n    364 F.

Consequently, I considered only whether Dumont's failure to pay Mr. Sullivan any residual payments for revenue generated by Cook aircraft commissions after December 2015 constituted a breach of contract independent of the Employment Agreement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 88 n. 14. In doing so, I concluded that the Cook Agreement had not been superseded by or incorporated into the Term Sheet which provided the basis for the Employment Agreement; the parties concededly provided no evidence to the contrary.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n    at 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   I also concluded that, under the terms of the Cook Agreement, Mr. Sullivan was entitled to receive residual payments for revenue generated by the Cook Aircraft after December 2015. Because the Cook Agreement did not specify an end date and because Dumont pointed to no record evidence indicating that the parties agreed to terminate the Cook Agreement, Mr. Sullivan was entitled to unpaid commissions on the Cook Aircraft through August 22, 2017.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n    at 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Supp. 2d 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 202 (D. Mass. 2012) (internal quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    III. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   I note at the outset that Dumont does not argue that it has discovered new evidence or that there has been a change in the law that would require me to reconsider my original judgment with respect to the Cook Agreement. Instead, it argues that my judgment reflects a \"manifest error of law or was clearly unjust\" because the question whether the termination of Mr. Sullivan's employment with Dumont also terminated the Cook Agreement raises a genuine question of fact that must be decided by a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Though certainly available to Dumont at the time, this argument was not squarely presented to me at the summary judgment stage in the context of the breach of contract claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dumont Aircraft Charter, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12530045\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/364/63/\">\n    364 F. Supp. 3d 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 89 n. 15 (D. Mass. 2019). At most, the Defendants appeared to argue that Mr. Sullivan was not entitled to commissions in perpetuity because\n   <em>\n    the Term Sheet\n   </em>\n   did not expressly contemplate such commissions and because Dumont did not agree to pay post-employment commissions to Mr. Sullivan in its conversations regarding the termination of his employment. Indeed, Dumont consistently argued that the Cook Agreement fell outside the scope of Mr. Sullivan's employment and therefore outside the scope of the Wage Act and the FLSA. Yet, Dumont now seeks to have the Cook Agreement treated as having been incorporated into the Term Sheet, though there was no evidence of record to suggest this was the Parties' shared intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Apart from its failure to meet the requirements for a motion for reconsideration, Dumont's refocused argument with respect to termination fails on the merits. To be sure, Dumont is correct that \"where a contract is to be gathered from talk between the parties, and especially from talk on more than one occasion, the question what the contract was, if controverted, must usually be tried by the jury, as a question of fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Gassett\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Glazier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"817601\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/165/473/\">\n    165 Mass. 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20N.E.%20193\">\n    43 N.E. 193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 195 (1896). But the terms of the Cook Agreement are not controverted here. Instead, Dumont argues only that the Cook Agreement was either incorporated into the Term Sheet or was separately terminated when Mr. Sullivan and the Defendants agreed to part ways in February 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Both scenarios would require mutual asset by the parties to be effective and there is no evidence here of a\n   <em>\n    meeting\n   </em>\n   of the minds or of\n   <em>\n    mutual assent\n   </em>\n   to either.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sea Breeze Estates, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jarema\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=94%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%20210\">\n    94 Mass.App.Ct. 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12539652\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/113/355/#p361\">\n    113 N.E.3d 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 361 (2018) (holding that written conversations between the parties did not modify an oral contract because there was no \"meeting of the minds.\");\n   <em>\n    Puma\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3960239\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/9/489/\">\n    9 Mass.App.Ct. 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=402%20N.E.2d%20110\">\n    402 N.E.2d 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 115 (1980). I recognize that \"[a]n agreement to rescind a contract need not be made in any formal, express terms,\" and that \"mutual asset to a rescission may be inferred from the attendant circumstances.\" (citing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flaherty\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Goldinger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3816696\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/249/564/\">\n    249 Mass. 564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=144%20N.E.%20374\">\n    144 N.E. 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 375 (1924) ). No such inference is appropriate here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   For its part, Dumont points to Mr. Wargo's deposition to show that the parties did, in fact, agree to terminate the Cook\n   Agreement when Mr. Sullivan stopped working for Dumont, but the deposition transcript supports only the conclusion that Mr. Wargo\n   <em>\n    believed\n   </em>\n   that the Cook Agreement had been terminated. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 119-1 at 22, 44]. There is no evidence of record that the parties mutually agreed to terminate the Cook Agreement or even that Mr. Sullivan believed the parties' mutual agreement to terminate the employment relationship without any past or future obligations extended to terminate the Cook Agreement. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 119-1 at 44; Dkt. No. 119-2 at 21].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Even drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of Dumont, then, I cannot say as a matter of law that the Cook Agreement was terminated along with Mr. Sullivan's employment in February 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Salem Laundry Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    New England Teamsters and Trucking Industry Pension Fund\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1758385\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/829/278/#p280\">\n    829 F.2d 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 280 (1st Cir. 1987) (\"Parties do not become contractually bound until they mutually asset to bind themselves to an agreement.... Courts determine that mutual assent, not on the basis of what goes on inside the parties' heads, but rather on the basis of what they say and do.\" (internal citations omitted)). I cannot say that a reasonable jury could conclude that Mr. Sullivan, by failing to mention the Cook Agreement in his communications with Mr. Wargo in February 2016, assented to the termination of that Agreement. Because Dumont has not pointed to any evidence to suggest that the Cook Agreement had a specified end date or was formally terminated, it has failed to demonstrate that my original judgment with respect to the breach of contract claim was \"based on a manifest error of law or was clearly unjust.\"\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673520\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/573/42/#p53\">\n    573 F.3d at 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Resolution of the question of termination necessarily resolves the amount in damages Mr. Sullivan can recover under his breach of contract claim.

Thus, if I were to find, as Dumont urges, that the Cook Agreement was terminated in February 2016, when Mr. Sullivan left Dumont's employment, Dumont is still liable for breach of contract for failing to pay Mr. Sullivan any residual commissions to which he was entitled under the Cook Agreement for January and February 2016.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    As noted,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    note 2, in advance of trial, the parties stipulated to the damages calculations if liability is established. Only questions of liability on which summary judgment was denied are being presented to the jury.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
