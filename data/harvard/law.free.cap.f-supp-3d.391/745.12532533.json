(Doc. 11 at 198-99). The ALJ denied her application on May 30, 2018. In his decision, the ALJ found that Gilbert suffers from multiple severe impairments but has the residual functional capacity to perform light work with certain limitations and, within that RFC, can perform past relevant work.

ECF Dkt. #1 at 1.

ECF Dkt. #1. The first claim alleges that the ALJ who issued the May 30, 2018 decision in her social security case was not properly appointed pursuant to the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution in Article 2, Section 2, Clause 2.

ECF Dkt. #12 at 2. Plaintiff counters that issue exhaustion is not required in Social Security cases and even if it were, it would have been futile to raise this claim at the administrative level because the Social Security Administration issued an Emergency Message informing the ALJs that they could not discuss or make findings related to Appointments Clause challenges because such challenges were outside the scope of adjudication.

In\n   <em>\n    Lucia v. Securities and Exchange Commission\n   </em>\n   , the United States Supreme Court (\"USSC\") held that the appointment of ALJs by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") to preside over adversarial hearings violated the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution because the ALJs were appointed by SEC staff members and not by the SEC itself, or by the President, or a court of law. --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612807\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2044/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 2044\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2053,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612807\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2044/\">\n    201 L.Ed.2d 464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018).
