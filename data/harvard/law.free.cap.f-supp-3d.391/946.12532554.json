Dkt. No. 1. The parties later stipulated to transfer venue to the Northern District of California. Dkt. No. 13.

Breach of Contract Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The amended complaint asserts that Apple breached a confidentiality agreement between the parties \"by using Confidential Information provided by Zomm to Apple for impermissible purposes, including Apple's own benefit, in direct contravention of the terms of the Agreement.\" FAC \u00b6 92. Apple moves to dismiss this cause of action because \"(1) Zomm identifies no confidential information allegedly exploited in violation of the Agreement, and (2) the Agreement contemplates independent development by Apple, rendering insufficient under\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   the allegation that Apple launched the purportedly similar Emergency SOS feature.\" Mot. at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In response, Zomm frames the purportedly confidential information exploited by Apple as follows: (1) Zomm employees \"shared details of what they were planning for the then-unreleased iOS version of the Wireless Leash\"; and (2) \"Zomm executives also disclosed in those meetings that they intended to create a watch, bracelet and other wearables.\" Opp. at 14.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Zomm then contends that \"Apple violated the Agreement by using Zomm's Confidential Information for its own benefit, by developing a product similar to Zomm's Emergency SOS feature in a wearable form, after Zomm disclosed this idea to Apple in discussions pursuant to the parties' Confidentiality Agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Zomm further contends that by submitting the confidentiality agreement as an exhibit to the pending motion, Apple demonstrated its \"willingness to violate the Agreement,\" because \"the Agreement itself constitute[s] Confidential Information.\" Opp. at 16. This argument is misplaced, however, as Apple's duty to protect the confidentiality of the agreement expired years ago.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Reply at 11 (citing Dkt. No. 46-3 (\"Confidentiality Agreement\") \u00a7 8).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    Undermining Zomm's breach-of-contract claim is that the amended complaint alleges that Apple began to exploit Zomm's confidential information in December 2011. FAC \u00b6 25 (\"Beginning in December 2011 and continuing through November 2016 ....\"). December 2011 however, was\n    <em>\n     after\n    </em>\n    both the Wireless Leash Plus's release and the '895 Patent's publication.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    FAC \u00b6 20 (noting the Wireless Leash Plus's November 2011 release), '895 Patent (noting a March 10, 2011 prior publication date). And under the terms of the confidentiality agreement, information either reverse engineerable from the Wireless Leash Plus product or contained in the '895 Patent no longer constituted confidential information.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Confidentiality Agreement \u00a7 1 (providing that \"Confidential Information shall not include information that (a) is now or subsequently becomes generally available to the public through no fault or breach on the part of [Apple] ... [or] (c) is independently developed by [Apple] without the use of any Confidential Information\").\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    Because the amended complaint fails to allege exploited confidential information-the only alleged breach of the confidentiality agreement in the amended complaint-dismissal of Zomm's breach-of-contract claim is warranted. At the hearing on this motion, however, Zomm stated that it could add specificity in a further amended complaint to detail pre-December 2011 conduct. The Court thus finds that leave to amend is warranted.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    <strong>\n     C. CLUC Claim\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    The amended complaint alleges that Apple engaged in common-law unfair competition. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 94-98. Specifically, it alleges that \"Apple misappropriated and is using Zomm's intellectual property and technology\" related to the Wireless Leash and Wireless Leash Plus \"for Apple's own benefit.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 96-97. Zomm additionally states that \"Apple baited Zomm into signing the Confidentiality Agreement to obtain access to Zomm's confidential information, despite having no intention of abiding by its terms.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 97.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    Apple moves to dismiss on a number of grounds: (1) Zomm does not allege any \"passing off\"; (2) Zomm's claim is preempted under federal patent law, superseded by California's Uniform Trade Secrets Act (\"CUTSA\"), and otherwise fails to state a claim; and (3) the allegation that Apple \"baited\" Zomm into signing the agreement \"sounds in promissory fraud\" and fails Rule 9(b)'s pleading requirements. The Court need not address Zomm's \"passing off\" argument because dismissal is warranted on other grounds.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    Although Zomm does not identify what \"intellectual property and technology\" Apple purportedly misappropriated, the Court finds that the only fair reading of the amended complaint is that the underlying intellectual property and/or technology is either patentable or subject to trade secrecy. But to the extent Zomm's CLUC claim is based on alleged infringement of the '895 Patent, the claim is preempted by federal patent law.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Medina v.

Accordingly, the Court finds that this consideration weighs against a stay, at least as to Apple's recently submitted petition for IPR.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    <strong>\n     b. Status of Proceedings\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    At the time of filing the pending motion, Apple did not dispute that this consideration weighed against a stay because,\n    at that time, \"the PTO [had] yet to rule on Apple's IPR petitions.\" Mot. at 23. An institution decision has since been issued as to Apple's first two IPR petitions, but a decision on Apple's third IPR petition is pending. Thus, this factor weighs in favor of a stay, at least as to Apple's first two IPR petitions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    <strong>\n     c. Relationship of the Parties\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Where parties are direct competitors, the risk of prejudice to the non-moving party is higher than it would be otherwise.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     TPK Touch Sols.

Here, Apple argues \"there is no evidence that Zomm competes with Apple,\" because although Zomm accuses Apple's watch products of infringement, \"Zomm does not allege that it has ever sold a smartwatch or any other type of wearable, smart device.\" Mot. at 22. And even assuming the parties are direct competitors, Apple contends that \"Zomm does not allege that any of its products practice any invention claimed in the asserted patent.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%206021324\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Zomm responds that its \"Wireless Leash Plus product ... that included a feature at the heart of Zomm's patent infringement cause of action\" is on sale. Opp. at 23. And Zomm adds that \"[h]ad Apple not introduced the Emergency SOS feature, consumers would need to purchase Zomm's Wireless Leash Plus product (or another similar product, if one exists) to achieve the same functionality.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 24.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    In its reply brief, Apple notes that \"Zomm has admitted that none of its products practice the claimed inventions.\" Reply at 14;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 62-3 at 4 (January 11, 2019 \"Asserted Claims and Infringement Contentions,\" stating that \"Zomm does not presently assert any of its own products practice the claimed inventions\"). Given that Zomm admits its products do not practice the claimed inventions, the Court finds that the parties are not direct competitors as it relates to the patent at issue in this suit. In turn, the Court finds that this consideration weighs in favor of a stay.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    <strong>\n     d. Conclusion as to Prejudice\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Balancing the sub-factors, the Court finds that the prejudice and disadvantage factor weighs in favor of a stay, at least as to Apple's first two IPR petitions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    <strong>\n     4. Motion to Stay Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Having considered the relevant factors in their entirety, the Court finds within its discretion that a stay pending\n    <em>\n     inter partes\n    </em>\n    review is warranted, at least as to Apple's first two IPR petitions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    <strong>\n     III.

If and when Zomm states a viable non-patent cause of action, the Court will set a further case management conference, to discuss setting a case schedule for any non-patent claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    As to the stay of the patent cause of action, the Court will consider lifting the stay upon the issuance of final written decisions on Apple's first two petitions for IPR, at which point the USPTO Director will have decided whether to institute review of Apple's third petition. And the parties shall file a joint status report within five days of the issuance of such final written decisions. At that point, the Court will issue an order addressing further proceedings in the case. As the Court explained at the hearing on this motion, the\n    Court will not continue the stay pending any appeal of final written decisions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    <strong>\n     IT IS SO ORDERED.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"2\">\n    <p id=\"p-74\">\n     The Court finds that it may incorporate the confidentiality agreement into the operative complaint by reference.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Knievel v.
