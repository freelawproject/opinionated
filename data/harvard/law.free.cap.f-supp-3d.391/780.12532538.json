BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Jeannette Conrad brings this action against Defendants for age discrimination and retaliation under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (\"FMLA\")\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and Ohio state law. Conrad was employed by Defendant U.S. Bank as a Senior Compliance Officer from July 2014 until she was terminated on or about July 29, 2017. (Doc. 1 \u00b6 16). Defendant Douglas was Conrad's supervisor at U.S. Bank. During the relevant time period, Plaintiff was 44 years old. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Conrad alleges that she was subjected to scrutiny and harassment based on her age by her supervisors, primarily Douglas. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23). Conrad expressed a desire to transfer after being placed under Douglas, but was then placed on a performance improvement plan (\"PIP\") on or around March 2017 by Douglas. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20, 25). Conrad states she was placed on a PIP even though she was an above-average performer and had no attendance issues. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25). Conrad was blocked from applying for a transfer because she was placed on the PIP. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Conrad alleges that Douglas extended the PIP because Conrad took an approved disability leave under the FMLA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27). Conrad states that she submitted complaints about Douglas' alleged discrimination and harassment to human resources and Douglas' manager before and after being placed on the PIP. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31-32). Conrad alleges that she was retaliated against for making complaints and was ultimately terminated in July 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34-35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Conrad later applied for unemployment benefits, which U.S. Bank opposed. The Unemployment Commission found that U.S. Bank did not have just cause in its termination of Conrad. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41). Conrad alleges she was in fact terminated due to her age and/or in retaliation for making complaints of discrimination and harassment in the workplace. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42). Conrad alleges that she has suffered severe emotional distress, anxiety, and depression. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Conrad filed the initial complaint on November 6, 2018 asserting the following five claims: (1) age discrimination in violation of Ohio Revised Code (\"R.C.\") \u00a7\u00a7 4112.02 and 4112.99 ; (2) wrongful termination based on age discrimination; (3) retaliation in violation of R.C. \u00a7 4112.02(I) ; (4) retaliation in violation of the FMLA; and (5) intentional infliction of emotional distress. (Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 44-80). On December 18, 2018, Defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings asserting that Plaintiff's state-law claims-Counts I, II, III, and V-should be dismissed. (Doc. 11 at 2). In particular, Defendants argued that Counts I and III are barred by the 180-day statute of limitations set forth in R.C. \u00a7 4112.02(L). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). Subsequently, Conrad filed an amended complaint, without seeking leave of court, to address the issues raised in Defendants' first motion for partial judgment on the pleadings. (Doc. 12).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the amended complaint, Plaintiff reasserts the same five grounds, but changes the statutory basis for her state-law age discrimination claim. Accordingly, the amended complaint asserts the following five counts: (1) age discrimination in violation of R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4112.14 and 4112.99 ; (2) wrongful termination based on\n   age discrimination; (3) retaliation in violation of R.C. \u00a7 4112.02(I) ; (4) retaliation in violation of the FMLA; and (5) intentional infliction of emotional distress. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44-83).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants then filed a second motion for partial judgment on the pleadings reasserting that Counts I, II, III, and V should be dismissed and arguing that Plaintiff should not be permitted to amend her complaint. (Doc. 16). Conrad did not timely respond to Defendants' motion for partial judgment on the pleadings. One week after the deadline to file a response, Conrad filed a motion for leave to respond,\n   <em>\n    instanter\n   </em>\n   , to the Defendants' motion. (Doc. 17). Conrad's motion attached the proposed response to Defendants' second motion for judgment on the pleadings. (Doc. 17-1). Defendants opposed Conrad's motion for leave to respond (Doc. 18) and attached a reply in further support of the motion for partial judgment on the pleadings. (Doc. 18-1). The pending motions are ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. MOTION FOR LEAVE TO RESPOND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Before analyzing the motion for partial judgment on the pleadings, the Court must determine whether it will consider Plaintiff's untimely response in opposition to the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Pursuant to Local Rule 7.2(a)(2), Plaintiff's response brief should have been filed on February 5, 2019. However, \"due to excusable neglect on [Plaintiff's] counsel's part, counsel inadvertently calendared the wrong date for his response.\" (Doc. 17 at 1). Plaintiff filed the motion to file a response to Defendants' motion for partial judgment on the pleadings out of time, including her response, on February 12, 2019-one week after the deadline under the Local Rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6 provides that a court may, for good cause, extend the time to file a \"motion made after the time has expired if the party failed to act because of excusable neglect.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(b)(1)(B). The Sixth Circuit has described the standard, commonly referred to as the \"\n   <em>\n    Pioneer\n   </em>\n   factors,\" for determining whether counsel's neglect is excusable:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [T]he governing legal standard for excusable-neglect determinations is a balancing of five principal factors: (1) the danger of prejudice to the nonmoving party, (2) the length of the delay and its potential impact on judicial proceedings, (3) the reason for the delay, (4) whether the delay was within the reasonable control of the moving party, and (5) whether the late filing party acted in good faith.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Nafziger v.

As a general rule, \"excusable neglect\" does not require that counsel have been faultless, and \"inadvertence, mistake, or carelessness\" can fall within the rule.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 388,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6527745\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/113/1489/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 1489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is clear that incorrectly calendaring a response date constitutes neglect, so the Court must determine if that neglect is excusable by applying the\n   <em>\n    Pioneer\n   </em>\n   factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The first factor weighs in favor of Plaintiff because Defendants are not prejudiced by Plaintiff's late response-Defendants do not even argue that they are prejudiced. The second factor also weighs in favor of Plaintiff because the late response was filed only seven days after the deadline and in no way has impacted this\n   judicial proceeding. The third\n   <em>\n    Pioneer\n   </em>\n   factor weighs slightly against Plaintiff because her only reason for the delay was a calendaring error. Defendants cite to several cases where this reason has been rejected by other courts. (Doc. 18 at 2). Plaintiff's reason for the late response is not a good one, but it still falls within the \"inadvertence, mistake, or carelessness\" that can constitute excusable neglect.\n   <em>\n    Pioneer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6229999\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/380/#p395\">\n    507 U.S. at 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6527745\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/113/1489/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 1489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The fourth\n   <em>\n    Pioneer\n   </em>\n   factor also weighs against Plaintiff because the delay at issue was clearly within Plaintiff's counsel's control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The fifth\n   <em>\n    Pioneer\n   </em>\n   factor weighs in favor of Plaintiff because the Court finds that Plaintiff's counsel has acted in good faith. Defendants seem to argue that Plaintiff did not act in good faith because she filed the motion for leave to file response before contacting Defendants. (Doc. 18 at 1). However, Plaintiff's counsel notes that she filed the motion as soon as she realized her error in order avoid delaying proceedings. (Doc. 19 at 3-4). The Court finds that this does not demonstrate that Plaintiff's counsel was acting in bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Upon balancing the five\n   <em>\n    Pioneer\n   </em>\n   factors, the Court finds that Plaintiff's counsel's neglect is excusable. Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff's motion for leave to respond,\n   <em>\n    instanter\n   </em>\n   (Doc. 17), and will consider her response (Doc. 17-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

(Doc. 16 at 2). More specifically, Defendants assert that Plaintiff should not be permitted to \"re-plead\" her state age-discrimination claim in an amended complaint under R.C. \u00a7 4112.14, which provides a more generous six-year statute of limitations, after originally \"electing\" R.C. \u00a7 4112.02 in her initial complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 3-6). In response, Plaintiff states that the original complaint inadvertently listed R.C. \u00a7 4112.02, rather than R.C. \u00a7 4112.14 ; a \"clerical error\" that is corrected by the amended complaint. (Doc. 17-1 at 1, 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Ohio law provides several distinct avenues for challenging age discrimination. One such avenue is R.C. \u00a7 4112.02, a general anti-discrimination statute that prohibits employers and employment agencies from discriminating on the basis of \"race, color, religion, sex, military status, national origin, disability, age, or ancestry.\" R.C. \u00a7 4112.02(A) - (B). In addition, R.C. \u00a7 4112.02(I) prohibits retaliation based on a person's challenge to an unlawful discriminatory practice. The statute of limitations for age-discrimination claims brought under R.C. 4112.02, including retaliation claims premised on age discrimination, is 180 days.

(Doc. 1 \u00b6 48). After Defendants argued in their first motion for judgment on the pleadings that this claim is barred by R.C. \u00a7 4112.02(L)'s 180-day statute of limitations, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint asserting age discrimination in Count I under R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4112.14 and 4112.99. (Doc. 12 \u00b6 50). Thus, Plaintiff does not contest that an age discrimination claim based on R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4112.02 and 4112.99 would be barred by the 180-day statute of limitations, but rather, seeks to take advantage of the longer, six-year statute of limitations by amending her complaint to assert age discrimination under \u00a7\u00a7 4112.14 and 4112.99.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Yet, Defendants advocate for a strict reading of the election requirement and assert that because Plaintiff \"filed a civil action\" under R.C. 4112.02, she may not \"institute\" an action under R.C. \u00a7 4112.14 by later amending the complaint. (Doc. 16 at 5). In short, Defendants argue that because Plaintiff originally brought her age discrimination claim under \u00a7 4112.02 (and did not alternatively plead \u00a7 4112.14 ), she is locked in with \u00a7 4112.02 due to the election requirement.

By filing the amended complaint, Conrad has made clear her intention to pursue her state age-discrimination claim in Count I under R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4112.14 and 4112.99, rather than under \u00a7\u00a7 R.C. 4112.02 and 4112.99, and she does so at the appropriate time-in\n   response to Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In their reply brief, Defendants cite to\n   <em>\n    Juergens v.

However, this Court is convinced that the Supreme Court of Ohio would not set forth a hard-and-fast rule prohibiting a plaintiff from amending her complaint at the motion-to-dismiss (or motion-for-judgment-on-the-pleadings) phase in order to assert age discrimination under a different statutory provision that originally pleaded.\n   <em>\n    Ziegler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11098414\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/249/509/#p518\">\n    249 F.3d at 517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Such a rule would be contrary to existing Ohio precedent permitting a plaintiff to wait to elect a provision and contrary to R.C. \u00a7 4112.08's instruction to \"construe[ ] [Chapter 4112] liberally for the accomplishment of its purposes....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11098414\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/249/509/#p518\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Furthermore, in\n   <em>\n    Juergens\n   </em>\n   the plaintiff filed the motion to amend in response to the defendant's motion for summary judgment, and thus, the state court was assessing the motion to amend under a different procedural posture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Finally, this Court must also apply Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 and Sixth Circuit precedent to assess whether Plaintiff should be permitted to amend her complaint. Rule 15 requires that \"leave to amend be freely granted when justice so requires.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). Moreover, the Sixth Circuit has held that \"where a more carefully drafted complaint might state a claim, a plaintiff must be given at least one chance to amend the complaint before the district court dismisses the action with prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

Shortly thereafter, Defendants filed a second motion for judgment on the pleadings specifically directed at Plaintiff's amended complaint. This all occurred prior to the parties' deadlines to amend the pleadings and for motions directed at the pleadings, and well in advance of the discovery deadline. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 15). In addition, although Plaintiff changes the statutory provision from \u00a7 4112.02 to \u00a7 4112.14 in the amended complaint, she does not otherwise alter the nature of her allegations. Thus, there is no concern of surprise to the Defendants. Although Defendants insinuate that Plaintiff seeks to amend the complaint in bad faith by engaging in \"litigation\n   gambling,\" as discussed above, it is permissible for a plaintiff asserting age discrimination to wait to \"elect\" the statutory provision she is relying upon until prompted to do so by the defendant. Furthermore, allowing Plaintiff to amend her complaint at this early stage does not prejudice the Defendants-nor do Defendants allege prejudice. Finally, because Plaintiff's amended complaint remedies the statute of limitations issue raised by Defendants with respect to Count I, the amendment is not futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Accordingly, the Court\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   grants Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint in order to assert age discrimination in Count I under \u00a7\u00a7 4112.14 and 4112.99 and denies Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings to the extent that it seeks dismissal of Count I as untimely. The Court grants Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint, albeit retroactively, and considers the amended complaint previously filed by the Plaintiff (Doc. 12) to be the operative complaint in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   However, Plaintiff's amended complaint does not salvage Count III, which alleges retaliation under 4112.02(I) in both the original and amended complaints. (Doc. 1 \u00b6 64; Doc. 12 \u00b6 67). Retaliation claims based on age discrimination brought pursuant to 4112.02(I) are subject to the 180-day statute of limitations contained in 4112.02(L).\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%202002470\">\n    2004 WL 2002470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 ;\n   <em>\n    Rosecrans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20165450\">\n    2016 WL 165450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5.

Thus, Plaintiff's deadline to file a retaliation claim based upon 4112.02(I) was January 25, 2018. However, Plaintiff did not file the instant action until November 6, 2018.

(Doc. 16 at 6). Count II specifically alleges that Conrad was terminated on basis of age, and cites R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4112.14 and 4112.99. (Doc. 12 \u00b6\u00b6 53-61). Defendants interpret this claim as asserting the common-law tort of wrongful discharge in violation of Ohio's public policy against age discrimination. (Doc. 16, at 6). Based on this interpretation, Defendants argue that the claim should be dismissed because the Supreme Court of Ohio has found that \"[a] common-law tort claim for wrongful discharge based on Ohio's public policy against age discrimination does not exist, because the remedies in R.C. Chapter 4112 provide complete relief for a statutory claim for age discrimination.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (citing\n   <em>\n    Leininger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=875%20N.E.2d%2036\">\n    875 N.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   44 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Plaintiff does not refute Defendants' characterization of Count II,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   nor does Plaintiff respond in any way to Defendants' argument that this claim should be dismissed.

To establish a common-law wrongful termination claim, Plaintiff must prove that: (1) a clear public policy exists; (2) dis-missing employees under circumstances like Plaintiff's would jeopardize the public policy; (3) causation; and (4) the employer lacked overriding legitimate business justification for the dismissal.\n   <em>\n    Collins v.

Plaintiff's claim appears to be based upon the clearly established public policy against age discrimination established by Chapter 4112.

In the fact section of the amended complaint, Plaintiff elaborates that she \"was subjected to harassment based on her age,\" \"scrutinized and harassed for her age by her supervisors,\" unnecessarily placed on a performance improvement plan, denied a raise or bonus, blocked from transferring, and ultimately terminated. (Doc. 12 \u00b6\u00b6 14-43).
