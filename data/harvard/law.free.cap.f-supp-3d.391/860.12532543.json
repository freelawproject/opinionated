Citizens' is an Illinois corporation with its principal place of business in Itasca, Illinois. Plaintiff Erin is a Michigan citizen. Minor Plaintiffs Fiona and Jane Doe are Indiana citizens.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The Underlying Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Farnham's Criminal Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Farnham formerly served in the Illinois House of Representatives from 2009 until 2014. In May 2014, Farnham was charged with violating certain federal criminal child pornography statutes. On December 5, 2014, Farnham was indicted and pled guilty to knowingly transporting child pornography. In his plea agreement, Farnham admitted to possessing images and videos depicting child pornography. These images included sex images of both the Plaintiffs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Farnham also admitted to using an email address to receive, trade, and distribute child pornography.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Plaintiffs' Civil Lawsuit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On February 6, 2016, Erin and Fiona filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, alleging, among other things, invasion of privacy. The Plaintiffs allege that Farnham sought defense and indemnification from Citizens for the civil lawsuit, but he was denied coverage. On December 1, 2016, Farnham allegedly executed an affidavit, admitting that he:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Traded, distributed and possessed child pornography depicting the Plaintiffs;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Viewed the child sex images of the Plaintiffs without their consent;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Intended to invade the privacy of the Plaintiffs\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Intentionally intruded upon the solitude and seclusion of the Plaintiffs in their most devastating private affairs and concerns; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   His intrusion would be highly offensive to any reasonable person.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Farnham also confessed in the same affidavit to a $ 2 million judgment in favor of the Plaintiffs. On June 18, 2017, Farnham died while an inmate at the Federal Medical Center in Butner, North Carolina. On September 21, 2017, the district court entered judgement against Farnham for $ 2 million. On July 24, 2018, Plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that the homeowners' insurance policy covers the Plaintiffs'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   claims and that Citizens provide defense and indemnification for the Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In relevant part, the Homeowners' Policy states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   If a claim is made or a suit is brought against an \"insured\" for damages because of \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" caused by an \"occurrence\" to which this coverage applies, we will:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Pay up to our limit of liability for the damages for which [Farnham] is legally liable ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Homeowners' Policy defines \"occurrence\" as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions, which results, during the policy period, in:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   a. \"Bodily Injury\"; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   b. \"Property Damage\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Bodily injury is defined as \"bodily harm, sickness or disease, including required care, loss of services, and death that results.\" By endorsement, \"bodily injury\" is amended to include \"personal injury.\" \"Personal injury\" is defined as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   ... injury arising out of one or more of the following offenses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   1.

Whether The Homeowners' Insurance Policy Covers the Plaintiffs' Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   We look to the Plaintiffs' argument that the underlying action was covered in the insurance agreement between Farnham and Citizens. Allegations that, having putatively occurred in 2013, would have triggered Citizen's defense obligations under the Homeowners' Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Plaintiffs contend that its amended complaint is sufficiently pled to trigger Citizen's duty to defend because they alleged a personal injury caused by an occurrence. The Homeowners' Policy applies to \"personal injury\" that is caused by an \"occurrence.\" \"Personal injury\" includes an \"invasion of privacy\" claim. \"Occurrence\" is defined as \"an accident,\" including \"continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Citizens argues that the Plaintiff's claims are not sufficiently pled because sexual mistreatment of a minor is not an \"occurrence\" under the Homeowners' Policy. Moreover, even if the sexual mistreatment of the Plaintiffs constituted a \"bodily injury\" caused by an \"occurrence,\" the Penal Law Exclusion precludes coverage. We evaluate each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Sexual Mistreatment of a Minor is not an \"Occurrence\" Under the Homeowners' Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Citizens first argues that no coverage should be afforded to the Plaintiffs because sexual mistreatment of a minor is not an \"occurrence\" under the policy. Specifically, Citizens articulate that because Farnham intentionally harmed the Plaintiffs, there is no \"occurrence\" which triggers coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Homeowners' Policy provides coverage for damages because of \"personal injury\" caused by an \"occurrence.\" \"Occurrence\" is defined as \"an\n   <em>\n    accident\n   </em>\n   , including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\" (emphasis added). \"Personal injury\" includes an invasion of privacy claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In Illinois, \"an insurance company's obligation to provide ... for its insured depends upon the allegations of the complaint and the applicable provisions of the insurance policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Hartford Ins.

Ill. 1995) (finding no coverage was owed under two occurrences-based liability policies for sexual allegations against a priest as his \"intent to cause bodily harm takes his actions outside the coverage of both [policies].\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Plaintiffs erroneously contend that their allegations fall under the purview of the Homeowners' Policy because: (1) the amended complaint unequivocally establishes that Farnham invaded their privacy; and (2) the Homeowners' Policy contains an ambiguity that must be construed against the insurer. Specifically, the Plaintiffs contend that the Homeowners' Policy contains both an exclusion for intentional acts (ie: an alleged \"occurrence\") and an endorsement specifically providing coverage for the intentional act of invasion of privacy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Based on our reading of the Homewoners' Policy, we find that no ambiguity exists. The Homeowners' Policy explains that under Coverage E, the \"definition 'bodily injury' is amended to include personal injury.\" Therefore, when we swap the term \"personal injury\" for \"bodily injury\" into the language of Coverage E, the policy reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   \"[i]f a claim is made or a suit is brought against an 'insured' for damages because of ['personal injury'] or 'property damage' caused by an 'occurrence' to which this insurance applies ...\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   \"Personal injury\" means \"injuries arising out of ... invasion of privacy.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Homeowners' Policy unambiguously asserts that the policy provides \"personal injury\" coverage for an \"injury arising out of ... invasion of privacy ...\" if caused by an \"occurrence.\" Indeed, the policy unambiguously asserts that the \"personal injury\" must still be predicated on an \"occurrence.\" Therefore, although Farnham's actions were clearly repugnant and crossed every line of human decency, the Plaintiffs have failed to plausibly allege an \"occurrence\" under the Homeowners' Policy because the action was not accidental. However, even if the Plaintiffs had plausibly alleged an \"occurrence,\" their claim would still fail because the Penal Law Exclusion precludes coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Penal Law Exclusion Precludes Coverage\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As an independent basis to defeat the underlying action, Citizens relies on the Penal Law Exclusion. The Plaintiffs contend that the Penal Law Exclusion is inapplicable because (1) the judgment against Farnham was civil, and not criminal; and (2) the exclusion is only applicable if the violation as one of the offenses listed in the insuring agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Penal Law Exclusion excludes coverage where the \"personal injury\" is \"caused by a violation of a penal law or ordinance committed by or with the knowledge or consent of an 'insured.' \" We agree\n   with Citizen's contention that the Plaintiffs' injuries (invasion of privacy) were caused by a violation of the penal law (federal child pornography statutes). It is undisputed that \"Farnham was charged with, and ultimately pled guilty to knowingly transporting child pornography ... possessing images and videos depicting child pornography ... [and] using an email address to receive, trade, and distribute child pornography.\" Based on the plain language of the Penal Law Exclusion, we find the exclusion applicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   To rescue their claim, the Plaintiffs first argue that the exclusion is inapplicable because the judgment against Farnham was civil, and not criminal. However, the language of the Penal Law Exclusion doesn't support the Plaintiffs' contention that the judgment for which coverage is sought be criminal. Second, the Plaintiffs argue that the Penal Law Exclusion only applies if the violation is expressly enumerated in the insuring agreement. However, the Penal Law Exclusion fails to articulate any such limitation, and the Plaintiffs do not introduce any case law to support its interpretation. Instead, the language unambiguously precludes coverage for \"[i]njury caused by violation of a penal law or ordinance.\" Accordingly, we find that the Plaintiffs has failed to plausibly allege a claim under the purview of the Homeowners' Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Count II - Duty to Defend and Indemnify\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Count II seeks a declaration ordering Citizens to defend and indemnify the civil judgment entered against Farnham. \"[T]he duty to indemnify arises if the insured's activity and the resulting loss or damage\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   fall within the ... policy's coverage.\"\n   <em>\n    Outboard Marine Corp. v.

Therefore, because the Plaintiffs' allegations do not fall within the purview of the Homeowners' Policy, Count II is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   For the aforementioned reasons, the Court grants Citizens' motion to dismiss in its entirety.
