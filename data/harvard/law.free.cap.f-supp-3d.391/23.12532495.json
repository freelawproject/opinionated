Mehta, United States District Court Judge\n </judges>\n <opinion id=\"p-9\">\n  <strong>\n   I. INTRODUCTION\n  </strong>\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-10\">\n  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") awards grant money and enters into cooperative agreements with various child welfare organizations to perform services for unaccompanied refugee children who have entered the United States. HHS grantees include religiously affiliated organizations, such as Defendant U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (\"USCCB\"). The child welfare services that HHS grantees provide include foster care, residential placement, and adoption services.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-11\">\n  Plaintiffs Fatma Marouf and Bryn Esplin live in Fort Worth, Texas. They wish to become foster parents for an unaccompanied refugee child. In February 2017, they sought out information about foster care programs from Catholic Charities of Fort Worth, a sub-grantee of USCCB. Plaintiffs quickly learned that they would not be approved as foster parents. The reason: they are a married lesbian couple. Catholic Charities of Fort Worth would not qualify them as foster parents because of its religious beliefs regarding same-sex marriage and raising a child within a traditional family structure.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs then brought this action. They assert violations of the Establishment Clause and the Equal Protection Clause and a deprivation of Substantive Due Process. Plaintiffs allege that HHS unconstitutionally awarded grant money to USCCB, despite knowing that USCCB and its sub-grantees, due to their religious beliefs,\n   would use taxpayer funds in a manner that discriminates against same-sex couples.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The merits of Plaintiffs' case are not yet before the court. Instead, Defendants challenge Plaintiffs' standing to bring suit. For the reasons that follow, the court grants Defendants' Motions to Dismiss in part. The court agrees with Defendants that no Plaintiff has taxpayer standing to assert a violation of the Establishment Clause. Because the sole cause of action brought by Plaintiff National LGBT Bar Association is the Establishment Clause claim, it is dismissed from this case. On the other hand, the court finds that Plaintiffs Marouf and Esplin have sufficiently pleaded individual standing to pursue all three causes of action. The court therefore denies the remainder of Defendants' Motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    1. The Unaccompanied Refugee Minor Program and the Unaccompanied Alien Children Program\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At issue in this case are two federal programs whose purpose is to provide support for the \"thousands of unaccompanied refugee children\" under the care of the federal government: (1) the Unaccompanied Refugee Minor Program (\"URM Program\") and (2) the Unaccompanied Alien Children Program (\"UC Program\"). Am. Compl., ECF No. 21 [hereinafter Am. Compl.] \u00b6\u00b6 16-18. These programs are administered through the Office of Refugee Resettlement (\"ORR\"), which is housed within HHS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Two pieces of legislation authorize the URM and UC Programs: the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (\"TVPRA\") and the Refugee Act of 1980. The TVPRA authorizes ORR to \"award grants to, and enter into contracts with, voluntary agencies to carry out [the UC Program].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201232\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i). The Refugee Act authorizes ORR \"to provide assistance, reimbursement to States, and grants to and contracts with public and private nonprofit agencies\" to carry out the URM Program.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201232\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1522(d)(2)(A). Neither Act expressly mandates that ORR contract with or award grants to religiously affiliated organizations, or even requires ORR to engage with private entities at all. Nevertheless, ORR has chosen to administer the Programs by awarding grants to, and signing cooperative agreements with, various child welfare organizations. Such organizations are tasked with, among other things, \"matching children in their care with qualified families\" for fostering and adoption. Am. Compl. \u00b6 20. \"Religiously affiliated organizations are among the providers of federally funded care for children under the URM Program and the UC Program.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201232\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201232\">\n    \u00b6 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Though Congress established these programs by statute, it has not funded them through specific line items. Instead, for the last four years, Congress simply has appropriated a lump-sum amount to the Administration for Children and Families-the component of HHS in which ORR is located-to carry out refugee and entrant assistance activities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, Pub. L. No. 115-141, Div. H, Tit. II,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=132%20Stat.%20348\">\n    132 Stat. 348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 728 (Mar. 23, 2018) (appropriating approximately $1.86 billion); Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, Pub.

II,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=129%20Stat.%202242\">\n    129 Stat. 2242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2612-13 (Dec. 18, 2015) (appropriating approximately $1.67 billion); Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, Pub. L. No. 113-235, Div. G. Tit. II,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=128%20Stat.%202130\">\n    128 Stat. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2479 (Dec. 16, 2014) (appropriating approximately\n   $1.56 billion). Thus, funding for the URM and UC Programs comes from a general budget appropriation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    2. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, or USCCB, is a long-time grantee of ORR and, in fact, is the largest recipient of URM and UC Program grants. Pls.' Mem. in Supp. of Pls.' Opp'n to Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 34 [hereinafter Pls.' Opp'n], at 17. As relevant to this case, USCCB did not itself use the grants to provide child welfare services. Instead, it disbursed the funds to a sub-grantee in Fort Worth, Texas, who in turn directly delivered services under the URM and UC Programs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In its HHS grant applications for both programs, USCCB made known its Catholic identity and how that identity would affect its use of grant funds. In its URM Program grant application, USCCB represented that it \"must ensure that services provided under this application are not contrary to the authentic teaching of the Catholic Church, its moral convictions, or religious beliefs.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 30. Similarly, in its UC Program grant application, USCCB stated that it \"must ensure that services provided under this application are not contrary to the authentic teaching of the Catholic Church, its moral convictions, and religious beliefs in an approach that is consistent with\" the agency's Policy on Grants to Faith-Based Organizations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   USCCB also made clear that its sub-grantees would \"ensure\" delivery of services consistent with the Catholic faith. USCCB notified ORR that sub-grantees would have to comply with an agreement provision titled \"Catholic Identity,\" under which the sub-grantee promised \"[to] ensure that services provided to those served under this Agreement are not contrary to the authentic teaching of the Catholic Church, its moral convictions, and religious beliefs. Accordingly, [USCCB] expects that the Sub-recipient will provide services under this Agreement within certain parameters ...\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At the time it submitted these grant applications, USCCB's position on same-sex marriage was unequivocal and a matter of public record. For instance, USCCB's Fact Sheets concerning adoption and foster care services, which have appeared on USCCB's website \"since at least 2013,\" state that \" '[w]hen placing children with couples, Catholic Charities ensures those children enjoy the advantage of having a mother and a father who are married.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35 (citing Discrimination Against Catholic Adoption Services, USCCB, http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/religious-liberty/discrimination-against-catholic-adoption-services.cfm (last visited Feb. 16, 2018)). Another section of the website, titled \"Frequently Asked Questions About the Defense of Marriage,\" states that \"[p]lacing a child in the care of two men or two women may be well-intentioned, but ultimately deprives the child of that which best serves his or her interests - a mother and a father.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36 (citing Frequently Asked Questions About the Defense of Marriage, USCCB, http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/marriage-andfamily/marriage/promotion-and-defense-of-marriage/frequently-asked-questions-ondefense-of-marriage.cfm (last visited Feb. 16, 2018)). Notwithstanding these clear positions on same-sex marriage and placing children with same-sex couples, year-upon-year ORR continued to award grant funding to USCCB to administer the URM and UC Programs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    3. Plaintiffs Fatma Marouf and Bryn Esplin\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs Fatma Marouf and Bryn Esplin are a same-sex married couple living in\n   Fort Worth, Texas. Am.

They pay federal taxes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Married since 2015, Plaintiffs aver that they are \"eager to bring a child into their family\" and have been actively exploring different options to do so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In February 2017, Plaintiffs approached Catholic Charities of Fort Worth (\"CCFW\"), a sub-grantee of USCCB, about fostering an unaccompanied refugee child.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46. After exchanging emails with CCFW about their foster care programs and the process for becoming a foster parent, CCFW scheduled an initial telephone interview with Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   During that call, a CCFW representative advised that prospective foster parents must \"mirror the holy family.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48. Plaintiffs made clear they were a same-sex couple. The CCFW representative then advised them that did not \"qualify\" to foster a child.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The representative also stated that none of the children that CCFW serves is a member of the LGBT community.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49. At the time, there were no other child welfare organizations in the Fort Worth area with whom HHS had an agreement to provide child placement services under either the URM Program or the UC Program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. (draft), Nov. 30, 2018, at 14.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiffs immediately lodged a complaint with ORR. On or about February 22, 2017, Plaintiff Marouf wrote to the general email address for ORR and informed the agency that CCFW had discriminated against them on the basis of their same-sex marital status.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51. Marouf did not receive a response until April 14, 2017. Even then, ORR simply asked for \"the names of the individuals at CCFW\" who had advised her that Plaintiffs would not qualify as foster parents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After inquiring with CCFW, Marouf learned the name of the representative with whom she and Esplin had spoken and, on May 1, 2017, forwarded the name to ORR.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52-53. Other than a return email thanking Marouf for the information, Plaintiffs received no additional communication from ORR.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs filed this case on February 20, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1. Along with USCCB, they named as defendants HHS; Alex Azar, in his official capacity as the Secretary of HHS; Steven Wagner, in his official capacity as Acting Assistant Secretary of the Administration for Children and Families; the Administration for Children and Families; Scott Lloyd, in his official capacity as Director of ORR; and ORR (\"Federal Defendants\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   On March 22, 2018, Plaintiffs amended their complaint to add the National LGBT Bar Association as a plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am.

The National LGBT Bar Association is a non-profit with more than 10,000 members who are \"supportive of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender ('LGBT') rights,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7, and it specifically brought this \"action on behalf of its members who are federal taxpayers,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint advances three claims: (1) violation of the Establishment Clause, (2) violation of the Equal Protection Clause, and (3) violation of substantive rights under the Due Process Clause.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 58-91. Each claim, at its core, alleges that the Federal Defendants are unlawfully \"funding [ ] certain child\n   welfare organizations that perform federal taxpayer-funded services relating to unaccompanied refugee children in federal care and custody in a manner that impermissibly discriminates against same-sex couples who are prospective foster and adoptive parents.

Pls.' Opp'n at 16 (emphasis added). Plaintiffs' repeated use of the word \"certain\" is telling. It reveals the absence of any specific designation of funds by Congress for any religious purpose or organization.

First, USCCB's very ability to make decisions regarding the eligibility of same-sex couples as foster parents under the URM and UC Programs is enabled by their selection as a federal grantee, whereas the Republican Party's nominating process was put in place decades before it ever received federal funding. In other words, unlike a political party's creation of a nominations process, USCCB would have no say in qualifying persons to be a foster parent to unaccompanied refugee minors but for its receipt of federal funds. Second, unlike the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Freedom Republican\n   </em>\n   who called on the FEC to adopt regulations to force the party to alter its nominating process, Plaintiffs here do not seek to use the levers of federal power to change USCCB's position on same-sex marriage. Instead, they seek injunctive relief requiring the Federal Defendants to ensure that they may apply to be foster or adoptive parents under the URM Program or the UC Program without disfavoring them based on their sexual orientation.

The plaintiffs claimed that the Revenue Ruling \"encouraged\" hospitals to deny services to indigent patients.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174426\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/426/26/#p28\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174426\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/426/26/#p28\">\n    at 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174426\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/426/26/#p28\">\n    96 S.Ct. 1917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court held that the plaintiffs lacked standing because \"[i]t is purely speculative whether the denials of service specified in\n   the complaint fairly can be traced to petitioners' 'encouragement' or instead result from decisions made by the hospitals without regard to the tax implications. It is equally speculative whether the desired exercise of the court's remedial powers in this suit would result in the availability to respondents of such services.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174426\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/426/26/#p28\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174426\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/426/26/#p28\">\n    at 42-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174426\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/426/26/#p28\">\n    96 S.Ct. 1917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, by contrast, a positive finding of causation and redressability requires no speculation at all. As discussed, the Federal Defendants caused Plaintiffs' injury both by creating a system that permits religiously affiliated grant recipients to deny federally funded services to same-sex couples\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   by failing to take any action after Plaintiffs gave notice of what happened to them. Moreover, the relief that Plaintiffs seek requires no speculation. Ordering the Federal Defendants to develop a system that removes barriers to same-sex couples becoming foster parents and evaluates their eligibility by the same criteria as any heterosexual couple or person will make Plaintiffs whole. \"No speculative inferences are necessary here to conclude that the relief requested will result in the Plaintiffs receiving the dignity and equal treatment they seek.\"\n   <em>\n    Dumont\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528031\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/341/706/#p726\">\n    341 F.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   For the reasons discussed in this Memorandum Opinion, the court grants in part and denies in part Defendants' Motions to Dismiss. Plaintiff National LGBT Bar Association is dismissed from this case for lack of standing. Plaintiffs Marouf and Esplin have standing not as taxpayers, but as individuals. Plaintiffs Marouf and Esplin therefore may pursue each of their constitutional claims.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    In the interim, at the court's suggestion, HHS has identified and is in the process of contracting with a child welfare organization that is willing to place children with same-sex couples.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Jt. Status Rpt., ECF No. 44; Notice and Unopposed Mot. for Status Conference, ECF No. 46. Though this agreement is not yet final, the court very much appreciates the agency's efforts.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    In their prayer for relief, Plaintiffs suggest as injunctive relief placement of a child on a non-discriminatory basis through USCCB or stripping USCCB of funding.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Am. Comp. at 24. Plaintiffs have since backed off such demand for relief.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pls.' Opp'n at 11 (\"Plaintiffs do\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    demand that USCCB necessarily render the determination as to Fatma and Bryn's eligibility to be foster parents, or make the decision to place a child with Fatma and Bryn.\"). Indeed, Plaintiffs have signaled openness to relief that \"accomodat[es] the religious views of URM and UC grantees,\" so long as it does not \"ultimately restrict placement options based solely on USCCB's religious doctrine and does not impose materially unequal burdens, stigma, or indignity on religiously disfavored applicants relative to favored ones.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528031\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/341/706/#p726\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
