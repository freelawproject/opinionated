Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Patrick Weckesser, a cable installation technician, filed this class and collective action on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated against Defendant Knight Enterprises S.E., LLC, alleging violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\") and the South Carolina Payment of Wages Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. No. 1.) The Court granted conditional class certification on August 27, 2018. (Dkt. No. 36.) Thirty-three individuals have joined the case as opt-in plaintiffs, for a total of thirty-four plaintiffs. (See Dkt. Nos. 5, 8, 14, 46 - 61.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that they and all other similarly situated cable installation technicians who worked for the Defendant were misclassified as independent contractors and deprived of overtime and minimum wage in violation of federal law. Plaintiffs were all hired as independent contractors to perform cable installation work, and therefore were not paid for any hours worked overtime. (Dkt. Nos. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 26, 32; 6-2; 34-1 at \u00b6 5; 99-2 at 3 - 4; 99-3 at 3, 9; 99-8 at 8.) Each Plaintiff allege that they provided the same cable installation services for Time Warner customers, and all performed their work under policies, and a schedule, set by Defendant. (Dkt. Nos. 99-2 at 3; 99-3 at 4.) Each Plaintiff was allegedly required to perform the jobs assigned to them by Defendant Knight, were required to use certain equipment, such as computer programs, provided by Defendant, were required to wear Knight uniform, were required to have a Knight logo on their truck, and were not able to work for other companies. (Dkt. Nos. 99-3 at 3, 11; 99-4 at 8 - 9; 99-5 at 4; 99-6 at 16; 99-11 at 6, 8; 99-12 at 4.) Most notably, each Plaintiff were required\n   to sign the same Independent Contractor Services Agreement, which declared that each Plaintiff was an independent contractor and not an employee. (Dkt. No. 6-2; 34-1 at \u00b6 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs now move for final certification, and Defendant opposes. (Dkt. Nos. 99, 111.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The FLSA allows that a collective action for unpaid minimum wages may be maintained \"by any one or more employees for and in behalf of himself or themselves and other employees similarly situated.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20216\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). After the district court has conditionally certified the class, the potential class members have been identified and notified, and discovery has been completed, generally, a defendant is permitted to move \"to decertify the collective action, pointing to a more developed record to support its contention that the plaintiffs are not similarly situated to the extent that a collective action would be the appropriate vehicle for relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Pelczynski v.

Both Parties correctly identify the test, but the Defendant's argument misses the fact that there is a clear, undisputed policy common to each Plaintiff. Namely, each Plaintiff was required to sign the Independent Contractor Services Agreement, which declared that each Plaintiff was an independent contractor and not an employee. (Dkt. No. 6-2; 34-1 at \u00b6 5.)\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Rehberg v.

Plaintiffs have shown that these factors will substantially be assessed the same across the Plaintiffs, and submitted evidence that the Plaintiffs were: subject to the same policy of being treated as independent contractors, received their work assignments and schedules from Defendant, required to invest in certain equipment, required to wear and use Defendant's logos, provided the same training, had long-standing work relationships with Defendant, and performed services that were central to Defendant's business. Further, the Plaintiffs all performed work in North Carolina or South Carolina, had the same job position, were subject to similar supervision (though by different supervisors), and were paid according to the same piece-rate system. While the Court does not assess the merits or credibility of this evidence, it notes that the evidence presented easily permits assessment of the economic realities test on a class wide basis.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    Defendants have identified some differences among the collective action members: some had a different supervisors,\n    some contracted as individuals and others as sole proprietorships,\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    others realized more profit from their work, and some worked longer hours. (Dkt. No. 111 at 11 - 13.)

Indeed, Defendant's defense under the economic realities test is based largely on class-wide arguments regarding the manner in which Defendant structured their relationships with all of their installation technicians. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 111 at 1 - 3.) Given the well-established company policy of classifying all installation technicians as contractors, the case is well-suited for collective treatment and the Plaintiffs are similarly situated with similar factual and employment settings.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Rehberg\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201346125\">\n     2015 WL 1346125\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *17 (\"Defendants...ignore the larger picture of the issue at hand-that all distributors are subject to Defendants' uniform [contractor] policies.\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    <strong>\n     B. Defenses\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    Defendant asserts that two individualized defenses prevent this matter from proceeding collectively: First, Defendant asserts they will argue equitable estoppel regarding Plaintiffs who reported income and business expenses to the IRS as a sole proprietor, and; Second, there is a lack of a case and controversy given certain employees who have no potential unpaid overtime based on Defendant's calculations. However, Plaintiff cites no FLSA case indicating that a Plaintiff cannot claim misclassification where he previously reported income as a sole proprietor rather than an employee, instead relying on a Second Circuit case regarding breach of fiduciary duty,\n    <em>\n     Ginor v. Landsberg\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=159%20F.3d%201346\">\n     159 F.3d 1346\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2d Cir. 1998), and multiple bankruptcy cases. Instead, as previously held, liability here will turn on a class-wide assessment of the economic realities test regardless of whether a plaintiff was paid as a legal entity rather than as an individual. The Court is further dubious on the merits of Defendant's argument, as it would undermine the purpose of the FLSA and recognition of misclassification claims, permitting employers who misclassify employees to evade liability because of their own impropriety in requiring employees to falsely identify as employers or sole proprietorships. Regardless, \"[t]he presence of defenses that require individualized inquiries does not necessarily require decertification if common issues and facts predominate....\"\n    <em>\n     Rehberg, LLC\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201346125\">\n     2015 WL 1346125\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *17. Further, as a legal issue for the court to determine, this defense does not render the class unmanageable.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    Regarding the alleged lack of a case and controversy, Defendant's argument highlights\n    the nature of the class-wide controversy. Defendant asserts it has presented an economic analysis by an expert showing that at least three Plaintiffs worked zero overtime hours, and therefore are not entitled to damages. (Dkt. No. 111 at 13.) Therefore, as certain Plaintiffs have \"no possibility of recovering any damages,\" Defendant argues there is no case in controversy for these particular Plaintiffs. However, this argument goes to the heart of the dispute, as Plaintiffs contend Defendant's calculations are incorrect, and instead argue that Plaintiffs' hours were typically closer to a minimum of 10 hours per day, with a minimum of 14 or more hours of overtime every week. (Dkt. No. 99-5 at 11, 16; 99-9 at 3, 106 at 7.) Therefore, regardless of Defendant's expert's opinion, there is a case and controversy regarding whether these Plaintiffs are entitled to damages and, as noted above, the fact that a case may require some assessment of individual damages does not defeat collective certification.\n    <em>\n     Butler\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5739138\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/47/300/#p311\">\n     47 F.

No. 111 at 22).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    <strong>\n     AND IT IS SO ORDERED.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"3\">\n    <p id=\"p-40\">\n     Which, here, has been initiated by Plaintiff's motion and Defendant's response in lieu of a motion for decertification.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"4\">\n    <p id=\"p-41\">\n     The fact that a plaintiff formed a corporation does not automatically defeat a misclassification claim, and instead, regardless of whether Plaintiffs contracted individually or as some form of legal entity, the Court is required to -assess the economic realities test.\n     <em>\n      See, e.g.\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Gustafson v.
