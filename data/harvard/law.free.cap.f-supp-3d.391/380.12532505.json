The question presented by the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment, therefore, is whether to classify Mr. Jimenez as an employee-entitled to back pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act-or an independent contractor-unprotected under the FLSA. Looking to the economic realities, the Court concludes that Mr. Jimenez was effectively an employee and is entitled to $8,170.75 in back pay. Separately, the Court concludes that summary judgment is improper on Mr. Jimenez's Pennsylvania Wage Payment Collection Law claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    UNDISPUTED FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Best Behavioral Healthcare is a mental health provider for individuals with special needs, and Amarilis LaFontaine is a doctor and the president and CEO of BBH. Ramon Jimenez worked as a psychotherapist at BBH from October 27, 2016 until April 10, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Scope of Mr. Jimenez's Role at BBH\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When retained by BBH, Mr. Jimenez (1) was told that he was \"going to be an independent contractor,\" Defs. Mot. for Summary Judgment, Ex. A at 26:10-12 (Jimenez Depo. Tr.), and (2) understood that he was a Form 1099 employee, or contractor, for BBH's tax purposes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 90:20-22. Specifically, BBH retained Mr. Jimenez as a psychotherapist. Mr. Jimenez's \"responsibilities\" were as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Initial assessment, comprehensive treatment plan, update and reviews. Progress notes based on regular follow-up of patients, individual, couple, family and group therapy as clinically indicated, psychosocial assessment. Referral for services, and Discharge planning. The psychiatrist heading the treatment team controls the activities concerning patient treatment. The psychotherapists report to the Medical Director concerning clinical duties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defs. Motion for Summary Judgment, Ex. 5 to Ex. A (Job Description, Psychotherapist).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Mr. Jimenez also executed a Service Agreement, which described Mr. Jimenez's compensation and some of his responsibilities at BBH. According to the Service Agreement, Mr. Jimenez would earn $28 \"per patient hour billed.\" Pltff. Mot. for Summary Judgment, Ex. A at 1 (Service Agreement). The Service Agreement also provided that Mr. Jimenez:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 Agreed to \"comply faithfully with the rules and regulations of BBH and its various subdivisions\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 Agreed to \"adhere strictly to the instructions and directions of BBH's president, directors, department coordinators and assistants, their designees and/or [Mr. Jimenez's] chief of service\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 Agreed not to \"engage in any medical or mental health services activities, nor directly or indirectly, to own, manage, or invest in or be associated in any way with the practice of psychotherapy or counseling other than through BBH, except with the written permission of BBH\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 Agreed not to, upon his resignation (and for one year after), \"engage in the business of [being a] psychotherapist, counselor, or related field within a radius of five miles of BBH's clinic\"; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 Agreed not to, upon his resignation or termination, \"contact [his] former clients.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Mr. Jimenez signed several other documents, each of which also addressed the terms of BBH's relationship with its psychotherapists. The documents included a Receipt and Acknowledgement of the terms of BBH's Employee Manual,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   a Disciplinary Agreement, a Dress Code/Professional Appearance Policy, and a Professional Code of Ethics. Finally, BBH required that psychotherapists comply with more than 30 \"Policies and Procedures.\" Among other things, those materials:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 prohibited BBH psychotherapists from \"[l]eaving work before the end of a workday or not being ready to work at the start of a workday without approval\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 prohibited BBH psychotherapists from \"[l]eaving [their] work station during [their] work hours without the permission of [their] supervisor, except to use the restroom\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 prohibited BBH psychotherapists from \"seek[ing] any professional or political gain at the expense of the agency or client's interest\"; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 established procedures for writing and submitting session notes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pltff.

Mr. Jimenez's Tenure at BBH\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   During Mr. Jimenez's approximately six months working at BBH, he estimated that he worked eight hours a day, five days a week, with another four to six hours on weekends. Although the BBH Employee Manual placed limitations on when employees could-or could not-leave work, BBH in practice did not keep track of Mr. Jimenez's comings and goings and did not require nor permit Mr. Jimenez to clock in or out. Mr. Jimenez paid his own insurance premiums during the time he worked at BBH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Dr. LaFontaine was Mr. Jimenez's supervisor at BBH. Dr. LaFontaine hired Mr. Jimenez and signed or authorized most of Mr. Jimenez's onboarding paperwork. During her time as Mr. Jimenez's supervisor, Dr. LaFontaine disciplined Mr. Jimenez on several occasions for taking incomplete notes during appointments. Mr. Jimenez also routinely turned in his appointment notes late. According to Dr. LaFontaine and other BBH employees, BBH did not pay Mr. Jimenez because of the issues with his session notes. Dr. LaFontaine eventually terminated Mr. Jimenez because of those same issues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Jimenez never received any payment from BBH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   A court will grant a motion for summary judgment \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). An issue is \"genuine\" if there is a sufficient evidentiary basis on which a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party.\n   <em>\n    Kaucher v.

After the moving party has met its initial burden, the non-moving party must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuinely disputed factual issue for trial by \"citing to particular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations ..., admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials\" or by \"showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute.\" Fed.

D at 31:19-32:14 (Dr. LaFontaine Depo. Tr.). In other words, BBH controlled both the manner in which Mr. Jimenez maintained notes for billing purposes\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the way that Mr. Jimenez actually conducted himself while providing therapy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Because BBH controlled Mr. Jimenez administratively and clinically, this case is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Leffler v.

Pa. Sept. 29, 2017). In\n   <em>\n    Leffler\n   </em>\n   , the Court commented that, with regards to therapists, employers' control is limited because therapists can \"determine[ ] the professional aspects of their therapies and set their own schedules [and] '[s]upervision' [i]s limited to billing issues (such as keeping proper records) to ensure that [the owner] and other therapists w[ill] be paid.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7. But here, supervision was not \"limited to billing issues;\" BBH actually controlled a number of the \"professional aspects\" of Mr. Jimenez's provision of therapy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   On balance, BBH's right to control and its exercise of control weigh in favor of employee status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Mr. Jimenez's Opportunity for Profit or Loss Based on His Managerial Skill.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The undisputed fact that Mr. Jimenez worked for BBH for about six months\n   without ever receiving a paycheck strongly shows that his managerial skill did not affect his opportunity for profit and loss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs. Opp. to Pltff. Mot. for Summary Judgment, Stmt. of Facts \u00b6 90. The defendants argue that because Mr. Jimenez was not paid a set salary, and instead could earn varying amounts depending on how many hours he worked, this indicates Mr. Jimenez controlled his opportunities for profit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Safarian v. Am. DG Energy Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. CV 10-6082,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%2012698441\">\n    2015 WL 12698441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (D.N.J. Nov. 24, 2015),\n   <em>\n    aff'd\n   </em>\n   , 729 Fed. App'x 168 (3d Cir. 2018) (\"Given that Plaintiff was not paid a set salary and had the opportunity to take on more work to make a larger profit, this indicates that Plaintiff had a meaningful opportunity for profit or loss.\"). But unlike in\n   <em>\n    Safarian\n   </em>\n   , there was an additional obstacle to payment here; even though Mr. Jimenez could work additional hours if he chose, he could not be paid without getting his notes approved by BBH. As previously described, BBH's review of Mr. Jimenez's notes was substantive rather than perfunctory, and so Mr. Jimenez's \"opportunity for profit\" was entirely contingent on BBH. Even if Mr. Jimenez saw patients all day every day, he was still beholden to BBH to approve and then submit his notes in order to be paid. This factor weights in favor of employee status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Mr. Jimenez's Investment in Equipment or Materials or Employment of Helpers.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Mr. Jimenez was responsible for paying his insurance. Pltff. Mot. for Summary Judgment, Stmt. of Facts \u00b6 63. The defendants also assert that Mr. Jimenez maintained his own license status and paid for his participation in continuing professional education. However, the deposition testimony from Dr. LaFontaine directly contradicts that Mr. Jimenez had a professional license, and instead suggests that BBH was indirectly responsible for covering licensure costs associated with Mr. Jimenez. Pltff. Mot. for Summary Judgment, Ex. D at 31:19-32:14 (Dr. LaFontaine Depo. Tr.) (\"In our case, Ramon [Jimenez] didn't have [a] license, so he's an unlicensed clinician, so he has to be under my license supervision basically.\"). Mr. Jimenez also could not hire co-workers or support staff-only BBH could-and BBH paid for all office supplies, paid for the office in which Mr. Jimenez worked, and paid for bill collection. Defs. Opp. to Pltff. Mot. for Summary Judgment, Stmt. of Facts \u00b6\u00b6 58-61, 65 (admitting BBH's operational costs and control over staffing). Even though, as noted by the defendants, psychotherapy may not be a profession requiring the provision of much in terms of \"equipment or materials,\" BBH's investment was far more significant than that of Mr. Jimenez. This factor weighs in favor of employee status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Whether Psychotherapy Is a Special Skill.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The parties do not dispute that psychotherapy is a special skill and that this factor weighs in favor of independent contractor status. But, as Mr. Jimenez points out (and the defendants do not refute), an employee's training carries less weight where the worker \"depended entirely on referrals to find job assignments\" and the company \"controlled the terms and conditions of the employment relationship.\"\n   <em>\n    Brock v. Superior Care, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10548996\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/840/1054/#p1060\">\n    840 F.2d 1054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1060 (2d Cir. 1988) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Selker Bros.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11944473\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/949/1286/#p1292\">\n    949 F.2d at 1295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he use of special skills is not itself indicative of independent contractor status, especially if the workers do not use those skills in any independent way.\"). Because BBH controlled the terms of Mr. Jimenez's employment, including its complete control over compensation, the impact of Mr. Jimenez's\n   skill on the Court's analysis is therefore minimal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Additionally, the defendants argue that because Mr. Jimenez was a psychotherapist, he is a \"learned professional,\" exempt from FLSA coverage under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20213\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). The exemption does not apply here, however. Under the implementing regulations, a qualifying \"learned professional\" must satisfy certain requirements, including that the employee be compensated \"on a salary or fee basis.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20541.300\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). But Mr. Jimenez's salary was indeterminate. Although Mr. Jimenez had a set hourly rate of pay, his take-home income would vary depending on the number of patients he saw in a given day. As such, Mr. Jimenez was not paid on a salary or fee basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cuttic v. Crozer-Chester Med. Ctr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180780\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/760/513/#p515\">\n    760 F. Supp. 2d 513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 515-16 (E.D. Pa. 2011) (employee paid on \"hourly basis and, accordingly, [whose] wages are wholly dependent upon how much time [he] works\" was \"not compensated on a salary or fee basis\" and did not qualify for learned professional exemption).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    5. The Degree of Permanence of the Working Relationship.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The permanence factor turns on two considerations: (1) whether the employee had a set term with the employer, and (2) whether the employee also took outside work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Donovan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"317318\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/757/1376/#p1385\">\n    757 F.2d at 1387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Donovan\n   </em>\n   , the court held that this factor weighed in favor of employee status because the alleged employees \"did not transfer their services from place to place, as do independent contractors. Each worked continuously for the defendant, and many did so for long periods of time.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"317318\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/757/1376/#p1385\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"317318\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/757/1376/#p1385\">\n    at 1385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). Likewise, in\n   <em>\n    Selker Bros.\n   </em>\n   , the court affirmed that the at-issue workers were employees because they \"worked exclusively for [the employer] and their tenure appeared to have the length and continuity characteristic of employment.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11944473\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/949/1286/#p1292\">\n    949 F.2d at 1295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   First, Mr. Jimenez did not have a predetermined term of employment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs. Opp. to Pltff. Mot. for Summary Judgment, Stmt. of Facts \u00b6 34 (admitting that Mr. Jimenez's employment term was \"open-ended, and not for a set period of time\"). And although Mr. Jimenez worked at BBH for six months, several other therapists in the same position are still with BBH and have worked there for years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Second, it is not clear from the record whether Mr. Jimenez worked with outside clients. BBH explicitly prohibited outside work (absent BBH's written approval). Pltff. Mot. for Summary Judgment, Ex. A at 2-3 (Service Agreement). Dr. LaFontaine testified that Mr. Jimenez confided in her that he was taking outside clients. Defs. Mot. for Summary Judgment, Ex. E at 147:5-7, 148:14-16 (\"[Mr. Jimenez] told me he was working ... in Journey of Recovery ... bring[ing] clients from Puerto Rico for recovery.\"). A second BBH employee, Ms. Salcedo, who worked at BBH in payroll, separately testified that she saw vans of patients being dropped off at BBH, and these patients indicated they were there to see Mr. Jimenez. Defs. Mot. for Summary Judgment, Ex. C at 80:7-82:8 (Salcedo Depo. Tr.). It is unclear from Ms. Salcedo's testimony, however, in what capacity Mr. Jimenez may have been seeing those patients. Mr. Jimenez submitted a rebuttal declaration stating he \"did not have any of [his] own patients, and all clients [he] saw were supplied by BBH. No vans of patients ever came to see [him].\" Pltff. Opp. to Defs. Mot. for Summary Judgment, Ex. A \u00b6 9 (Jimenez Declaration). Mr. Jimenez also denied working for any other facility while working at BBH, including Journey of Recovery.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Neither Dr. LaFontaine's own self-serving deposition testimony that Mr. Jimenez took outside patients nor Mr. Jimenez's self-serving denial provides persuasive evidence as to whether Mr. Jimenez engaged in outside work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Irving v.

Dr. LaFontaine does not explain, for example, why, if she knew Mr. Jimenez was seeing outside patients in violation of the Service agreement, she did not reprimand Mr. Jimenez or otherwise prohibit him from continuing this practice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, Ms. Salcedo's testimony, about Mr. Jimenez seeing vans full of patients at BBH, appears to lack personal knowledge as to the origin of the patients (Ms. Salcedo merely guesses that the patients were from an outside organization), and is also inconsistent. Ms. Salcedo first stated that she was \"not aware of any other issues ... with Mr. Jimenez's work,\" Pltff. Reply in Support of Mot. for Summary Judgment, Ex. B at 25:14-16 (Salcedo Depo. Tr.), before much later adding that she saw vans of patients coming to BBH and that she believed those patients were coming to visit Mr. Jimenez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Because the facts are disputed about whether Mr. Jimenez engaged in outside work, the Court does not weigh outside work in Mr. Jimenez's favor or in the defendants' favor. Instead, the other aspects of Mr. Jimenez's term at BBH, particularly that he was not hired for a limited term and other psychotherapists have worked at BBH for extended periods, suggest that there was a degree of permanence to Mr. Jimenez's position, weighing in favor of employee status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    6. Whether Psychotherapy Is an Integral Part of BBH's Business.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The parties do not dispute that psychotherapy is an integral part of BBH's business. This factor weighs in favor of employee status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    7. Whether Mr. Jimenez was Dependent on BBH for Continued Employment.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   In addition to the six-factor test, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals has also described an additional factor: whether the alleged employee was dependent on the employer for continued employment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Donovan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"317318\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/757/1376/#p1385\">\n    757 F.2d at 1385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (examining \"whether the workers are dependent on a particular business or organization for their continued employment\"). Here, Mr. Jimenez's Service Agreement dictated that Mr. Jimenez worked exclusively for BBH and included a non-compete clause that limited his ability to work as a therapist even after he left the company. And although the defendants assert that Mr. Jimenez voluntarily left the therapy field after leaving BBH, there is no evidence supporting this statement. The limitations in Mr. Jimenez's employment agreement indicate that he was dependent on BBH for continued employment and, therefore, support employee status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Balancing the Economic Realities Factors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In considering the above factors, the Court must look to the circumstances overall rather than focusing on any one factor. Here, the balance of factors tilts significantly towards determining Mr. Jimenez was an employee. Mr. Jimenez was a skilled worker. But that aside, Mr. Jimenez was subject to BBH's will. Mr. Jimenez could only see BBH patients, Mr. Jimenez could only use BBH facilities, and-perhaps most importantly-Mr. Jimenez could only be paid after BBH substantively reviewed his work product. BBH had the right to control Mr. Jimenez, and it exercised that control, including directing clinical aspects of the position. Additionally, it is significant that Mr. Jimenez was not a term employee and permanence (or long-term employment) appears to have been the rule rather than the exception for BBH psychotherapists. Based on a wholistic analysis of the terms of Mr. Jimenez's employment at BBH, Mr. Jimenez was an employee rather than an independent contractor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Mr. Jimenez's Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   When an employee brings a claim under the FLSA,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   \"he ordinarily bears the burden of proving that he performed work for which he was not properly compensated.... Such a burden becomes difficult to meet, however, where an employer has not maintained its records.

They offer only that Mr. Jimenez was out of the office for several weeks dealing with family issues and saw his own clients at BBH's office three days a week, but no evidence supports these assertions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, although the defendants' corporate representative testified that BBH kept at least some computer records that may have showed when employees were present at BBH, Pltff. Mot. for Summary Judgment, Ex. F at 168:10-19 (Nelson Depo. Tr.), the defendants did not produce those records. In short, the defendants barely make any effort to rebut Mr. Jimenez's testimony about the amount of time he worked while employed by BBH. They certainly have met no burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The Court determines that Mr. Jimenez is entitled to $8,170.75 for 23 weeks of work at BBH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Whether the Defendants Are Entitled to Summary Judgment on Mr. Jimenez's Wage Payment Collection Law Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The defendants argue, briefly, that the Court should grant summary judgment on Mr. Jimenez's claim under the Pennsylvania Wage Payment Collection Law. \"The WPCL applies only to [unpaid] wages already earned[.] Whether the particular monies sought are 'wages or compensation' depends upon the term of the contract between the parties. The contract between the parties also determines whether the wages or compensation have been earned.\"\n   <em>\n    Allende v. Winter Fruit Distributors, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088931\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/709/597/#p599\">\n    709 F. Supp. 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 599 (E.D. Pa. 1989) (citations and quotations omitted). According to the defendants, \"[t]here is no allegation nor record that [Mr.] Jimenez was not paid the compensation set forth in his Independent Contractor Agreements.\" Defs. Mot. for Summary Judgment at 22. But the unrefuted record shows that Mr. Jimenez was never paid\n   <em>\n    at all\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs. Opp. to Pltff. Mot. for Summary Judgment, Stmt. of Facts \u00b6 90, meaning that Mr. Jimenez was not paid $28 per patient hour, pursuant to his Service Agreement with BBH. Because the defendants' argument rests entirely on their incorrect assertion that there is no allegation about unpaid wages, summary judgment is improper on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The economic realities of Mr. Jimenez's time at BBH allow only one conclusion: Mr. Jimenez was BBH's employee. The Court grants Mr. Jimenez's Motion for\n   Summary Judgment on his FLSA claim for back pay. The Court also denies the defendants' request for summary judgment on Mr. Jimenez's Pennsylvania Wage Payment Collection Law claim. An appropriate order follows.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    BBH argues that many of the provisions of the Employee Manual did not apply to independent contractors. But the Employee Manual, by its own terms, states that \"[u]nless otherwise specified, the\n    <em>\n     benefits\n    </em>\n    described in this Manual apply only to full-time employees.\n    <em>\n     All other policies\n    </em>\n    described in this manual and communicated by [BBH] apply to\n    <em>\n     all employees\n    </em>\n    , with the exception of certain wage, salary and time off limitations applying only to 'non-exempt' (see the definition that follows) employees.\" Pltff. Mot. for Summary Judgment, Ex. J at 11 (BBH Employee Manual) (emphasis added). The distinction between \"exempt\" and \"non-exempt\" employees refers to entitlement to overtime pay.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 12. The fact that BBH required Mr. Jimenez to\n    <em>\n     sign\n    </em>\n    a Receipt and Acknowledgement of the terms of the Employee manual undermines BBH's argument that the manual did not bind Mr. Jimenez.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    Pltff.

E 147:5-148:16 (Deposition of Amarilis LaFontaine). Because this fact is disputed and the parties do not present documentary evidence supporting their opposing assertions, the Court does not credit either side's argument on this point. In other words, the Court will not weigh in Mr. Jimenez's favor that he\n    <em>\n     did not\n    </em>\n    see outside patients, nor will the Court weigh in BBH's favor that Mr. Jimenez\n    <em>\n     did\n    </em>\n    see outside patients.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    For this reason, it is of no moment that Mr. Jimenez initially believed he was being hired as an \"independent contractor.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    at pp. 384-85.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    To the extent that the defendants assert that Dr. LaFontaine gave Mr. Jimenez \"tacit consent\" to see outside patients,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Defs.
