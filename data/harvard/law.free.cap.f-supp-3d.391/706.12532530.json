Previously, the Court rejected all of plaintiffs' claims except its breach of contract claim, in part because the parties agreed that the breach of common law fiduciary duty and the HCFCA claims were preempted by ERISA. However, the parties agreed to reinstate the common law fiduciary duty and HCFCA claims in the wake of the Sixth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe of Mich. v.

Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court provided a complete factual background of the underlying claims in its previous opinion and order granting in part and denying in part defendant's motion to dismiss, which it reincorporates fully here. (Dkt. 99 at 2-6.) For clarity, the Court summarizes the background and notes new developments in the case's procedural history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Tribe is federally-recognized. The Tribe maintains a self-funded employee welfare plan, the Plan, which covers three groups of participants: members of the Tribe who are employed by the Tribe (Group #01010); members of the Tribe who are not employed by the Tribe (Group #01020); and employees of the Tribe who are not members of the Tribe (#48571). BCBSM has been the Plan administrator since 2000. (Dkt. 90-2 at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2007, new federal regulations went into effect which provided that \"[a]ll Medicare-participating hospitals ... must accept no more than the rates of payment under the methodology described in this section as payment in full for all terms and services authorized by [Indian Health Service], Tribal, and urban Indian organization entities,\" and even if the parties had negotiated different rates, tribes would \"pay the lesser of\" the amount determined by the methodology and the negotiated amount.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20136.30\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 136.30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (f). These are known as the \"Medicare-Like Rates\" (\"MLR\") regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that they asked BCBSM to ensure that they were receiving MLR for the Tribe member groups, Groups #01019 and #01020. (Dkt. 90 at 14). BCBSM claimed that \"it could not adjust its entire system to calculate MLR on those claims eligible for MLR discounts,\" but could provide a rate that would be close to MLR by providing a discount for plaintiffs' claims for services at the Munson Medical Center to Group #01020, the non-employee Tribe members. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.) This led the parties to enter into the Facility\n   Claims Process Agreement (\"FCPA\") with Munson Medical Center, effective on March 1, 2009. (Dkt. 90 at 6; Dkt. 90-4.) However, in 2012, plaintiffs obtained a third-party audit and discovered that they were \"not paying anything 'close to MLR' on claims.\" (Dkt. 90 at 16.) They state that they \"did not discover the full extent of BCBSM's\" conduct until 2013.

(Dkt. 1.) On January 24, 2019, plaintiffs were permitted to file an amended complaint, alleging breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA, violations of the HCFCA, breach of contract and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the alternative, breach of common law fiduciary duty, fraud and misrepresentation, and silent fraud. (Dkt. 90.) BCBSM filed a motion to dismiss those claims (Dkt. 94), which the Court granted in part and denied in part. (Dkt. 99.) The Court dismissed all claims except for the breach of contract claim, noting that the parties agreed that the breach of common law fiduciary duty and HCFCA claims were preempted by ERISA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22, 25.) Plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration (Dkt. 101) and a motion to file a second amended complaint (Dkt. 102), and both were denied. (Dkt. 107.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In August 2018, the Sixth Circuit held that the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe of Michigan's Welfare Benefit Plan was not an ERISA plan when it covered non-employee Tribe members.\n   <em>\n    Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe of Mich. v.

Because this undermined the parties' previous agreement that all claims for violations of HCFCA and breach of common law fiduciary duty were preempted by ERISA, the parties agreed to reinstate those claims as to Group #01020, the non-employee Tribe members, for the purpose of testing that legal theory in this case.

Plaintiffs have statutory standing under the HCFCA. However, their breach of fiduciary duty claim, although cognizable, is barred by the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Therefore, \"is ... providing\" here means to continuously supply or make available health care benefits to employees. This much is agreed upon by the parties, but plaintiffs and defendant both argue that the plain-text reading of \"is ... providing\" favors their respective positions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant argues that a plain-text reading of \"is ... providing\" means that self-insured entities like plaintiffs are only health care insurers when or while they are providing benefits to their employees (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 117 at 11-12; Dkt. 120 at 2-6),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   but this argument is unpersuasive. As illustrated by the Court's explanation, defendant's interpretation is contrary to the plain text because it rewrites the provision to read \"while providing\" or \"when providing.\" However, this turns \"providing\" into a participial preposition that modifies \"health care insurer.\" This interpretation changes the grammatical function of \"providing\" from modifying \"is\" to modifying \"health care insurer.\" This gives \"providing\" a restrictive or limiting function that it did not previously have. In other words, \"providing\" goes from being a verb to a modifier. For these reasons, defendant's interpretation is not grammatically sound, and the Court cannot rewrite the statute and must assume the legislature did not mean what it did not say.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In contrast, plaintiffs argue that the \"providing\" clause should be read as a threshold requirement, meaning that as long as plaintiffs are continuously supplying health care benefits to employees, they are health care insurers for all purposes under the HCFCA (Dkt. 119 at 12), and the Court agrees. This interpretation does not rewrite the statute in any way or change the grammatical function of any words. Moreover, this interpretation also gives meaningful force to every word and phrase. Once a self-insured entity offers health care benefits to employees continuously, it is a health care insurer. This reading avoids rendering the phrase \"is ... providing\" a restrictive, prepositional phrase when it is not written that way. Therefore, interpreting \"providing\" as a threshold requirement is the plain text definition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Out of an abundance of caution, however, the Court considers the best-case scenario for defendant-that the plain text is ambiguous, and so it is necessary to consider the legislative purpose and other canons of construction. However, the legislative\n   purpose and scheme and canon against absurdity demonstrate that \"providing\" is best interpreted as a threshold requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   First, the legislative purpose and scheme counsel in favor of reading \"providing\" as a threshold requirement.

Reading \"providing\" as a threshold requirement best effectuates the purpose of the HCFCA to prevent fraud and provide a remedy for it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Under defendant's reading, plaintiffs would receive no special protection or redress against healthcare-based fraud even though they offer health care benefits and insurance. Defendant offers no reasonable explanation, nor can the Court think of one, why the legislature would exclude tribes and their plans from the HCFCA's protection, or why health care fraud is less concerning when tribes are the insurer. Generally, entities self-insure as a matter of convenience, i.e. there is a large enough number of members to evenly distribute the costs of the policy. Employers are often self-insured because they have access to large, organized groups that permit them to offer group health insurance at a rate that is not prohibitively high. It also happens that tribes are similarly positioned with respect to their own members. The Court could not find another entity in Michigan other than employers and tribes that self-insure. It is doubtful that the Michigan Legislature would draft a statute that would grant a remedy to nearly all self-insured employers except the non-employee Tribe members of the twelve\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   or fewer self-insured tribes in Michigan. Consequently, reading \"providing\" as a threshold requirement, not a durational requirement, evinces the state legislature's intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Second, interpreting \"providing\" as a durational requirement would lead to absurd results because plaintiffs would be health care insurers as to employees, but not as to non-employees, even where plaintiffs are offering the same health care benefits. The Court cannot guess why the legislature would desire this outcome when both plans would be equally susceptible to fraud. The Court has rejected analogous statutory interpretation arguments when it would lead to inconsistent application of the statute without a persuasive justification.\n   <em>\n    Zen Design Grp.

(Dkt. 117 at 13-14.) Plaintiffs allege that under the Administrative Services Contract (\"ASC\"), the parties entered a fiduciary relationship. (Dkt. 90 at 10.) Plaintiffs explain that as an administrator, defendant \"was required to make decisions about whether to pay a health care claim from Plan funds, and how much to pay from Plan funds, with the Plaintiffs' bests interest in mind and in a manner that preserved Plan assets\" and to do so \"with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence of a prudent person.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) Moreover, plaintiffs attach the ASC itself, which supports this interpretation of the relationship.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the ASC provides some limitations on defendant's responsibilities and disclaims defendant's role as an ERISA fiduciary (Dkt. 90-2 at 3-4), it does not contain prohibitive language about a common law fiduciary relationship as in\n   <em>\n    McLaren\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   In the light most favorable to plaintiffs, the duties set forth by the ASC satisfies\n   <em>\n    Calhoun\n   </em>\n   and the ASC and creates a fiduciary duty similar to that in\n   <em>\n    Dental Associates\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   2.

Moreover,\n   <em>\n    Loweke\n   </em>\n   is clear-the focus is on whether any legal duty exists separately and distinctly from the contract, not whether the conduct is contemplated by the contract. Even if the FCPA did not exist, defendant would have a fiduciary duty to manage the Plan with plaintiffs' best interest in mind and to act as a reasonably prudent investor and not squander plan assets based on the ASC. Therefore, plaintiffs have stated a claim that is the separate and distinct from their contractual breach claim regarding the FCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendant argues that the Court's previous ruling that the state fraud claims were barred is dispositive to the breach of common law fiduciary duty claim (Dkt. 120 at 7-8), but this argument is unpersuasive. Earlier, the Court held that plaintiffs' fraud claims that defendants made misrepresentations about MLR and failed to disclose when plaintiffs were not receiving MLR were not cognizable because \"any obligation to provide rates close to MLR and any obligation to disclose such discrepancies ... arose from the existence of the FCPA.\" (Dkt. 99 at 24-25.) In other words, plaintiffs could not point to a duty separate and distinct from the FCPA that required defendant to deliver MLR and disclose when MLR were not delivered. But here, plaintiffs plead that defendant had an obligation to meet its fiduciary duty that did not arise from the FCPA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs' fiduciary duty claim is therefore cognizable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    ii.

[and this]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   was a breach of BCBSM's fiduciary duties under ERISA\" (Dkt. 90 at 4-5), and the parties do not dispute these duties are identical to common law fiduciary duties. Then plaintiffs learned in 2009 that they were not receiving MLR discounts, i.e. that defendant was violating its fiduciary duty under ERISA. Defendant's conduct at this point, whether it be characterized as not offering competitive rates, preserving plan assets, etc. or offering rates close to MLR, breached its common law fiduciary duties to prudently manage funds and act with plaintiffs' best interests in mind.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the latest that plaintiffs could have brought the claim is 2012. The claim was not filed until 2014, and so it is time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiffs raise two counterarguments. First, they argue that there is \"a second type of 'wrong' by BCBSM,\" which is that defendant violated its common law fiduciary duties after the parties \"entered into the FCPA in 2009 to specifically address BCBSM's past squandering of plan assets\" and that it did not know of that breach of fiduciary duty until after the audit in 2012. (Dkt. 119 at 16, 18.) In other words, plaintiffs only maintain the breach of fiduciary duty claim from the point that the FCPA was signed and onward. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7 n.2.) But plaintiffs cannot have it both ways. Plaintiffs have prevailed on the separate and distinct analysis and are therefore permitted to raise both a fiduciary duty and contractual breach claim. They cannot now conflate the separate duties by arguing the FCPA somehow reinvigorated the fiduciary duty or created a new fiduciary duty, in effect resetting the clock on the claim. The claim cannot be maintained after 2009 because plaintiffs knew of the breach in 2009-that defendant continued to breach its fiduciary duties and plaintiffs did not realize this until 2012 is not relevant to the question of when they first knew of the breach of fiduciary duty, as is the fact that plaintiffs sought to put additional pressure on defendant by entering the FCPA to impose specific contractual terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Second, plaintiffs argue that the statute of limitations should be tolled. They appear to raise two arguments: that defendant fraudulently concealed the claim by failing to disclose the second breach of fiduciary duty and by making an affirmative misrepresentation by entering the FCPA. There is no legal support for either argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   First, plaintiffs argue that defendant failed to disclose a material fact, its breach of fiduciary duties after it signed the FCPA, which amounts to fraudulent concealment in Michigan.

But this argument is subsumed by the Court's earlier analysis; plaintiffs already knew of the breach, and Michigan courts do not permit tolling under \u00a7 600.5855 once the party knows of a cause of action.\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

Shrewdly, plaintiffs entered into the FCPA and imposed more specific requirements upon the relationship to see if matters improved. And now, when it alleges that defendant failed to live up to the spirit of the parties' relationship, it will be able to pursue contractual relief. However, it will not be able to turn back the clock on the breach of fiduciary duty claim that it knew of in 2009.
