MORENO, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs Santiago Padilla and Murray Shames (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") filed a\n   Class Action Complaint against Defendant Porsche Cars North America, Inc. (\"Porsche\"), seeking declaratory relief and damages for alleged violations of the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (\"FDUTPA\") and for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability under Florida law, based upon Porsche's alleged knowledge of an alleged safety defect in the cooling system of certain Porsche vehicle models. Porsche filed a Motion to Dismiss, asking the Court to dismiss Plaintiffs' 3-count Class Action Complaint with prejudice under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 8(a), 12(b)(1), and 12(b)(6). For the reasons below, Porsche's Motion to Dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Porsche sold its high-end performance vehicles as safe, despite knowing for more than a decade that it used a defective epoxy adhesive to join coolant pipes to the thermostat housing assembly. According to Plaintiffs, the \"Cooling System Defect\" occurs when the epoxy adhesive degrades, loosens, and eventually fails due to the contraction and expansion of coolant pipes caused by repeated heating and cooling over time; and when the epoxy adhesive fails, the cooling pipes separate from the thermostat housing assembly, causing a significant coolant leak that in turn causes the engine to overheat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Padilla purchased his used 2011 Porsche Panamera from The Collection, a car dealership located in Miami, Florida. Plaintiff Shames bought his used 2011 Cayenne S from the Carmax in Tampa, Florida. Within two years of purchase, each high-end performance vehicle suffered the Cooling System Defect, which resulted in each Plaintiff having to pay thousands of dollars in repairs out of their pockets. After Shames's vehicle suffered the Cooling System Defect a second time, within seventeen months of the first occurrence, he wrote a letter to Porsche notifying them of the Cooling System Defect and demanded that Porsche pay for the repairs. When Porsche refused to pay, because the repairs were incurred outside the standard warranty period, Shames traded in his 2011 Cayenne S at a loss. Padilla apparently still owns his vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 29, 2018, Plaintiffs commenced this class action lawsuit on behalf of themselves and a nationwide class of all current or former owners and/or lessees of certain Porsche models that suffer from the Cooling System Defect. On January 28, 2019, Porsche filed a Motion to Dismiss the Class Action Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"A pleading that states a claim for relief must contain ... a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).

Thus, the limitations period for a declaratory relief claim premised on rights protected by FDUTPA is also four years under Florida Statute Section 95.11(3)(f).
