ALTMAN, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS MATTER\n   </strong>\n   came before the Court upon the parties' responses [ECF Nos. 192 &amp; 193] to the Court's May 15, 2019 Omnibus Order (\"Omnibus Order\") [ECF No. 191]. The Omnibus Order required the parties, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f), to brief the following questions: (1) whether Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\") and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (\"RA\") apply extraterritorially; and (2) what impact, if any, the answer to this question has on the Plaintiff's remaining claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On March 2, 2019, this Court entered partial summary judgment against the Plaintiff [ECF No. 154] and, as a result, only four of the Plaintiff's claims against the Defendant, Ross University School of Medicine (\"RUSM\"), have survived: Count I (failure to accommodate under the RA); Count II (failure to accommodate under the ADA); Count VIII (fraudulent inducement); and Count IX (negligent misrepresentation). At the motions hearing on June 11, 2019, the Plaintiff moved in open court to voluntarily dismiss Count IX (negligent misrepresentation) with prejudice under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(2), and the Court granted that motion. Accordingly, as of this Order, only Counts I, II, and VIII remain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As the Omnibus Order made clear, neither party had raised-and so the Court did not consider-the question of the ADA's and the RA's extraterritorial application. With the benefit of the parties' supplemental briefing and oral argument, the Court does so now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     THE FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The facts of this case are thoroughly detailed in the Court's March 2, 2019 Order on the parties' motions for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As relevant here, the Plaintiff is a former medical student at RUSM, a private medical school in Dominica. Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 1, 9. The Plaintiff applied to RUSM in 2013. Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 4. On its website, RUSM represented that \"[i]t is the policy and practice of [RUSM] to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act as applicable and practical in Dominica.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   RUSM requires its students to take the National Board of Medical Examiners' Comprehensive Basic Science Exam (\"COMP Exam\") at the end of their fifth semester. Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 36. The Plaintiff took and failed the COMP Exam five times. Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 39-50. As a result, on June 29, 2017, RUSM dismissed him from the university.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dismissal Letter [ECF No. 119-28 at 2].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Plaintiff's remaining contentions are that: (1) RUSM failed to honor his alleged requests for an accommodation under the ADA and the RA for extra test-taking time; and (2) RUSM's statement that it complies with the ADA \"as applicable and practical in Dominica\" constitutes fraudulent inducement because RUSM never had any intention of complying with either federal statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     THE STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate where there is \"no genuine dispute as\n   to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

The text of the statute provides no indication Congress intended to provide extraterritorial application of these standards to foreign institutions offering public accommodations or public transportation. Moreover, in this piece of legislation, Congress sought to reduce physical or other barriers to sites where disabled individuals need access. This focus is presumed to be domestic, as no indication exists in the text of the statute to suggest otherwise. This statute is narrowly addressed to the domestic issue of providing access for disabled United States citizens. It would be contrary to the rationale of the presumption against extraterritoriality to interpret the text so as to require foreign institutions to adhere to United States standards\n   for barrier removal and reasonable accommodations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Archut v.

Because of the very particular language of that statute-language that is noticeably absent from either the ADA or the RA-the Supreme Court concluded that the plaintiffs had successfully rebutted the presumption against a finding of extraterritoriality. Specifically, given that certain RICO predicates unquestionably apply extraterritorially,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court found that Congress had unmistakably expressed its intention that RICO govern abroad.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    RJR Nabisco, Inc.\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597929\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2090/\">\n    136 S.

Accordingly,\n   <em>\n    RJR Nabisco\n   </em>\n   does not help the Plaintiff here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Having concluded that neither the ADA nor the RA apply extraterritorially, the Court must now determine whether the Plaintiff's claims arise in the United States. To succeed on a failure to accommodate claim, including both a Title III ADA claim and a claim under the Rehabilitation Act, a plaintiff must demonstrate that he: (1) has a disability; (2) is an otherwise qualified individual; and (3) was discriminated against because of his disability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boyle v.

Indeed, according to the Plaintiff's own Statement of Undisputed Material Facts: (1) RUSM, which was located in Dominica, was the entity empowered to grant the Plaintiff extended testing time; (2) the Plaintiff authorized the RUSM Counseling Center\n   <em>\n    in Dominica\n   </em>\n   to \"discuss his confidential information [with the administration]\" for the purpose of determining whether an accommodation was appropriate; (3) the Plaintiff verbally asked Dr. Sharma and Mr. Cuffy, who were in Dominica, to tell the RUSM administration that he needed extended testing time because of his disability; (4) the Plaintiff, while in Dominica, went in person to provide the RUSM Counseling Center with a medical assessment upon which he was relying for his request; and, most importantly, (5) Dr. Hayse, RUSM's Associate Dean of Student Affairs, who lived and worked in Dominica, \"made the final decision [with respect to the Plaintiff's request for accommodation] and oversaw the academic accommodations process.\" Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 16-17, 26, 32, 34. What's more, all of the Plaintiff's counseling notes-which he says support his allegation that he requested an accommodation-indicate that his counseling sessions occurred, not in the United States, but at the RUSM Counseling Center in Dominica. Pl. Mot. Summ. J. [ECF No. 102 at 12-16]. Because these allegations, if true, would constitute both the beginning and the end of the Plaintiff's ADA and RA claims-and because all of these critical events took place in Dominica-the Court finds that the central facts upon which the Plaintiff's complaint is premised occurred outside of the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In this respect, the only relevant acts that took place in the United States were the Plaintiff's second, third, fourth, and fifth attempts at passing the COMP Exams-which, it is undisputed, are not administered by RUSM.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 28. But by the time the Plaintiff sat down to take these examinations, the alleged discriminatory decision to deny his requested accommodation-the decision upon which his ADA and RA claims are based-had already been made in Dominica. In short, the record contains no evidence to support the Plaintiff's position that the conduct he has challenged occurred anywhere but in Dominica-a place where neither the ADA nor the RA apply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Because Title III of the ADA and Section 504 of the RA do not apply extraterritorially,\n   and because the acts that form the basis of the Plaintiff's complaint occurred in Dominica, the Court finds that summary judgment is appropriate as to Counts I and II of the Plaintiff's Third Amended Complaint. Accordingly, it is hereby\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED and ADJUDGED\n   </strong>\n   that Counts I and II are\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED with prejudice\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Count VIII (Fraudulent Inducement)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Count VIII of the Plaintiff's Third Amended Complaint arises under Florida law. Pointing to a statement on RUSM's website to the effect that \"[i]t is the policy and practice of the University to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act as applicable and practical in Dominica,\" the Plaintiff claims that RUSM fraudulently induced him into enrolling at the school.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Am. Compl. at 20-22. To succeed on a claim of fraudulent inducement under Florida law, a plaintiff must show that (1) the defendant made a misrepresentation of material fact; (2) the defendant knew or should have known of the falsity of the statement; (3) the defendant intended for the misrepresentation to induce the plaintiff to rely and act upon the misrepresentation; and (4) the plaintiff suffered injury in justifiable reliance on the representation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Biscayne Inv.

Pl. Resp. 10. For its part, RUSM says that, because the ADA is inapplicable in Dominica, any assurances it may have made concerning its compliance with the ADA \"cannot be false as a matter of law.\" Def. Resp. 7. The Court is not persuaded that summary judgment as to Count VIII is appropriate on this basis. If, when it published the alleged avowal on its website, RUSM knew, as its papers here suggest, that the ADA did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   apply in Dominica, then its promise to abide by the ADA \"as practical\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   [legally] applicable\" in Dominica could indeed be false. \"A promise of future conduct made with the positive intent not to perform will satisfy the misrepresentation element.\"\n   <em>\n    Stefan v.

Sharma Dep. 27:1-18 [ECF No. 102 at 102]. Dr. Sharma further testified that RUSM \"does not deny student accommodations once documentation is adequate.\" Sharma Dep. 74:3-5. No less significantly, Mr. Stewart-Fulton, one of the accommodations coordinators at RUSM, testified that, although RUSM was not\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   to comply with the ADA, \"in the interest of supporting our students, we abide[ ] by the spirit of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act to provide appropriate accommodations within the process that was defined in the student handbook.\" Stewart-Fulton Dep. 32:1-10 [ECF No. 102 at 122]. Finally, Dr. Bryan Hayse testified that RUSM \"uses [the] ADA as a guideline, but [RUSM is] not necessarily beholden to [it].\" Hayse Dep. 10:14-17 [ECF No. 102 at 114]. This testimony was corroborated by the fact that RUSM maintains an Accommodations Office (and pays accommodations coordinators) for the sole purpose of determining whether a student is eligible for the kind of accommodation the Plaintiff sought here.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Sharma Dep. 28-29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Plaintiff has introduced no evidence to rebut this testimony.
