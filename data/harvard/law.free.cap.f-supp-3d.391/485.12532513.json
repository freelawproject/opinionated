INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The matter before the Court is Defendants Highmark Health, Highmark Inc., and Highmark Choice Company's (collectively \"Highmark\") second motion to dismiss. Plaintiff Presque Isle Colon and Rectal Surgery (\"Plaintiff\") instituted this action against Highmark alleging in its original complaint that Highmark violated Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act as well as Pennsylvania's antitrust laws, breached the parties' contract and implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and was unjustly enriched. Dkt. No. 1. Highmark then moved to dismiss Plaintiff's claims, arguing that Plaintiff failed to sufficiently allege a violation of the federal antitrust laws. Dkt. No. 17. This Court agreed with Highmark and dismissed largely for failure to sufficiently set forth a federal antitrust violation but granted plaintiff leave to amend its federal law claims and replead its pendent state and common law claims. Dkt. No. 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff filed an amended complaint on December 3, 2018. Dkt. No. 42. In it, Plaintiff reasserts its claims as to Highmark's violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act, Pennsylvania's antitrust laws, and Pennsylvania common law causes of action including unjust enrichment, breach of contract and covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and reformation or rescission. Dkt. No. 42. Currently before the Court is Highmark's motion to dismiss the amended complaint in its entirety, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), arguing that the amended complaint still fails to state a claim on which relief can be granted. Dkt. No. 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Having reviewed the motion to dismiss the amended complaint, the opposition thereto, the record of the case, and the relevant legal authorities, the Court will GRANT in part and DENY in part the motion. Specifically, the Court will grant the motion as to Plaintiff's Section 1 and\n   related Pennsylvania common law claims, as well as its claims of unjust enrichment and breach of contract. The Court will deny, however, the motion as to Plaintiff's Section 2 and related Pennsylvania common law claims, as well as its claims for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and reformation and rescission. The Court's reasoning follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court assumes familiarity with the facts of this case, as described in the Court's September 6, 2018 Memorandum Order granting the Highmark's first motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Dkt. No. 17. For clarity's sake, however, the Court will reiterate some of the salient facts, as pled in the amended complaint. Dkt. No. 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff operates an independent physician-run medical practice organized under the laws of Pennsylvania and located in Erie County, Pennsylvania, part of the Erie County Metropolitan Statistical Area (\"MSA\"). Dkt. No. 42 at \u00b6 14.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Highmark is comprised of three Pennsylvania corporations that provide health insurance coverage to its members under various healthcare plans, including PPOs, HMOs, and ACA\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   -compliant private health insurance plans.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 15-17; Dkt. No. 47 at 3. In the healthcare industry, medical service providers, such as Plaintiff, are considered sellers because while they provide care to patients they sell their services to insurers, like Highmark, in exchange for contractually determined \"reimbursements.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dkt. No. 35 at 2-3 (internal citations removed). Insurers, such as Highmark, are then considered buyers of physician services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (internal citations removed).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Highmark is one of the largest health insurers in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, with \"more than 4 million covered lives.\" Dkt. No. 42 at \u00b6\u00b6 2, 42; Dkt. No 47 at 3 n.3. Plaintiff alleges that Highmark is the \"dominant\" health insurer in the region, insuring at least 65% of health insurance enrollees in Western Pennsylvania\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and far in excess of 65% of enrollees in the Erie County MSA. Dkt. No. 42 at \u00b6\u00b6 2, 43. Additionally, Plaintiff contends that Highmark \"controls commensurate shares of reimbursements\" to independent physicians in both the Erie County MSA and Western Pennsylvania based on the assertion that it is \"responsible for 'buying' \" at least 65% of the outpatient physician services to insured patients in Western Pennsylvania and \"well in excess\" of 65-70% of the same services in the Erie County MSA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 43. Thus, Plaintiff asserts, \"Highmark is both the largest health\n   insurer\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the, largest buyer of outpatient physician services in these areas.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3 (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In addition to its health insurance business, Highmark recently entered the outpatient physician services market by acquiring several hospitals and other healthcare facilities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 4, 46. Highmark now controls St. Vincent Hospital, which Plaintiff explains is the \"largest hospital system in Erie.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4. Plaintiff also reports that Highmark has announced plans to build or operate at least four other facilities in Pennsylvania.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4 n.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 2011, Plaintiff and Highmark signed a Professional (or Participating or Preferred) Provider Agreement (\"PPA\"), in which Plaintiff agreed to render medical care to Highmark-covered patients and Highmark, in turn, agreed to pay, or \"reimburse,\" Plaintiff for its services. Dkt. No. 42-1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 42 at \u00b6\u00b6 14, 59-61.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The PPA governs the reimbursement terms between the parties and includes two relevant clauses to the instant case. First, the PPA provides for a variable reimbursement rate, in which \"allowances [paid to specialist] may be reviewed and adjusted from time to time during the Term.\" Dkt. No. 42-1 at Att. 6.1 \u00a7 4.2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 42 at \u00b6 60. Second, the PPA contains an \"all products\" clause, through which Plaintiff agreed to treat patients enrolled in any insurance product offered by Highmark (the \"All Products Clause\"). Dkt. No. 42-1 at \u00a7 4.1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 42 at \u00b6\u00b6 13, 61.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Current Dispute and The Court's Previous Order granting Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Relations between the parties deteriorated when Highmark implemented a 4.5% \"across-the-board\" reimbursement rate cut effective April 1, 2016, for outpatient services rendered to patients covered by one of Highmark's ACA-compliant healthcare plans. Dkt. No. 42 at \u00b6\u00b6 10, 65, 164. Plaintiff instituted the instant action on May 11, 2017, alleging antitrust violations of both Section 1,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and Section 2,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 2, of the Sherman Antitrust Act, as well as related Pennsylvania common law causes of action. Dkt. No. 1. Plaintiff's original complaint focused on the PPA, alleging that it constitutes an unreasonable restraint of trade under Section 1, Dkt. No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 111-12, 126-27, and that Highmark maintains and abuses monopsony\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   power by combining the reimbursement rate cuts with the All Products Clause to \"forc[e] upon independent physician\" an \"anticompetitive scheme.\" Dkt. No. 35 at 6 (internal quotations and citations removed). As stated above, Highmark moved to dismiss the original complaint for failure to state a claim, which this Court granted in a written decision dated September 6, 2018 (\"hereinafter, \"the September Order\"). Dkt. Nos. 17 and 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The September Order focused on Plaintiff's Section 1 and 2 claims. In regard to the Section 1 claim, the Court held that Plaintiff failed to allege an \"agreement\" which is required to satisfy Section 1's prohibition against \"\n   <em>\n    agreement\n   </em>\n   [s] that unreasonable restrain trade.\" Dkt. No. 35 at 9 (emphasis in original). With respect to the Section 2 claims, the Court held that Plaintiff failed to satisfy both the requirements of antitrust injury and the substantive requirements of Section 2, which prohibits \"unlawful monopsony\" and attempted monopsony.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n    at 9-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court's reasoning rested on the conclusion that a unilateral depression of reimbursement rates \"does not, on its own, run afoul of \u00a7 2.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n    at 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As this Court stated, \"absent 'special circumstances, where, for example, a price is below incremental cost,' there is no harm\n   <em>\n    to the market, i.e.\n   </em>\n   , there is no 'antitrust injury.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n    at 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Kartell v.

Therefore, this Court dismissed the complaint with leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As both parties have noted in their briefing,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 48 at 1-2, the Court invited Plaintiff in its repleading to address how (1) Highmark's acquisition of Saint Vincent enhanced its unlawful monopsony as a health insurer and (2) Highmark treats independent physicians differently from Highmark-acquired hospitals, Dkt. No. 12-13. In addition, this Court instructed Plaintiff to provide a \"breakdown of [its] insured, non-insured, and ACA-insured patients,\" as well as additional business-related information, necessary to support a predatory pricing claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Amended Complaint and Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff has now provided an amended complaint. Dkt. No. 42. Plaintiff still advances causes of action under Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act (Counts 5 and 7) and related Pennsylvania common law antitrust claims (Counts 6 and 8); Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act (Counts 1 and 3) and related Pennsylvania common law antitrust claims (Counts 2 and 4); and Pennsylvania common law causes of action for Unjust Enrichment (Count 9), Breach of Contract and Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing (Count 10), and Reformation or Recission (Count 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The most immediate difference between the original complaint and the amended complaint is that Plaintiff has refashioned its Section 1 claim as an \"unlawful tying\" claim, in which it claims Highmark restrained trade by \"unlawfully tying\" reimbursements \"under any of its health insurance products to the reimbursement of the same under any of its other health insurance product\" through the All Products Clause.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 119.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, Plaintiff\n   revised large sections of its Section 2-related allegations in an attempt to address some of this Court's concerns highlighted in the September Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff now contends that Highmark's reduction in reimbursements rates \"has led, and will continue to lead,\" to a reduction in the quantity and quality of outpatient physician services, including colorectal services in both the Erie County MSA and Western Pennsylvania. Dkt. No. 42 at \u00b6 5. Specifically, Plaintiff claims that \"predatorily reduced reimbursement rates to below independent physicians' costs\" will result in such physicians going out of business, reducing the quantity of such services available to patients, and that Highmark has not imposed the same rate reductions on physicians working at Highmark-controlled facilities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6. Further, according to Plaintiff, rate reductions will also result in a degradation of quality of services available to patients as independent physicians will \"cease performing better, higher-quality procedures with favorable patient outcomes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7. Plaintiff also alleges that at the same time Highmark cut reimbursement rates, it simultaneously raised premium rates for enrollees, for example increasing rates for Highmark ACA plans between 20.1%-21.5% in 2016 and 48.1%, \"or more,\" in 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10, 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In addition to \"predatorily depressed reimbursement rates,\" Plaintiff now adds \"other anticompetitive conduct,\" which it contends is \"designed to raise [Plaintiff's] costs, harm their [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] business[ ], or impede their [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] ability to compete against Highmark-controlled outpatient physician services.\" Dkt. No. 42 at \u00b6 12. This alleged conduct includes (1) an \"extraordinary number of so-called 'audits,' \" which Plaintiff contends are pretextual attempts to \"claw-back\" fairly earned reimbursements and interfere with quality of care, (2) steering patients away from Plaintiff in favor of Highmark's own outpatient services, and (3) instituting procedure codes that \"result in gross inefficiencies,\" including forcing Plaintiff to perform multiple procedures where it could perform just one, resulting in \"inconvenience and burden on [Plaintiff's] patients.\" Dkt. No. 42 at \u00b6\u00b6 12, 49-58. Plaintiff contends that independent physicians are unable to avoid this anticompetitive conduct based on the All Products Clause, which forces physicians \"to accept reimbursement from\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of Highmark's health insurance products or none at all.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13. Independent physicians, according to Plaintiff, cannot forgo treating Highmark patients because of the insurers' dominance in the relevant markets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 13, 59-66. As a result, Plaintiff claims it has \"lost approximately $200,000 to $300,000 annually.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 11, 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As stated above, Highmark moves to dismiss the amended complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), arguing that it still fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    III. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A Rule 12(b)(6) motion tests the legal sufficiency of claims asserted in a complaint.

As the Court previously held in the September Order, Plaintiff's allegations regarding rate reductions, even when coupled with the All Products Clause, do not suffice to establish antitrust injury or a substantive claim under Section 2.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 35 at 10-14 (holding that there is no \"harm\n   <em>\n    to the market\n   </em>\n   \" when insurers, even with monopsony power, \"contractually extract, and then pay, noncompetitive prices to medical providers\") (citing\n   <em>\n    Kartell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"633210\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/749/922/#p927\">\n    749 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   927 )) (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In its amended complaint, however, Plaintiff has added substantive claims of additional anticompetitive conduct that it alleges has and will continue to cause adverse effects on competition and consumers. First, Plaintiff claims it and other independent physicians have been subjected to unnecessary audits as a means to \"claw-back\" previously disbursed reimbursements that \"interfere with treatment decisions.\" Dkt. No. 42 at \u00b6\u00b6 12, 49-50. Plaintiff claims that Highmark \"does not subject physicians working at Highmark-controlled facilities to the same scrutiny.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12. These audits hurt independent physicians by \"rais[ing] [physicians'] costs\" and \"diverting resources away from providing outpatient colorectal services to patients.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Second, Plaintiff alleges that Highmark subjects independent physicians to inefficient procedure codes and requirements. Dkt. No. 42 at \u00b6 51. These procedure codes have forced Plaintiff to schedule patients for two different \"procedures,\" where one would suffice, subjecting patients to \"inconvenience and burden\" not to mention any pain and discomfort resultant from the procedures themselves.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff alleges that Highmark uses its dominance and market presences to \"steer\" patients away from independent physicians to its own facility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 42 at \u00b6 12, 46 (\"Highmark seeks to ... steer patients away from independent physicians and to Highmark-controlled providers\"), \u00b6\u00b6 53-57 (recounting the experiences of patients A through D, who report to Plaintiff attempts by hospital staff at Highland facilities to steer them away from care at independent physicians). \"This includes,\" according to Plaintiff, allegations that Highmark has \"misrepresent[ed]\" to patients that Plaintiff's physicians do not have admitting privileges at St. Vincent, when they do, and that patients must use St. Vincent physicians only.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   When these allegations are taken in concert with Plaintiff's allegations of predatory reimbursement reductions, market dominance, and alleged coercion through the use of the All Product Clause, a facially plausible pleading emerges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   First, there is plausible harm to competition. Plaintiff has alleged that Highmark uses its dominance on the \"buy side\" of the market, including insisting on unnecessary audits, inefficient procedure codes, and predatorily low reimbursement rates, to drive up the costs for and lower the income of independent physicians. All the while, according to Plaintiff, Highmark does not subject its own facilities to such treatment. And, according to Plaintiff, independent physicians \"cannot avoid the anticompetitive or predatory effects\" of Highmark's actions based on its market dominance, and its non-negotiable insistence on the All Products Clause. Dkt. No. 42 at \u00b6 12. \"This has and will result,\" according to Plaintiff, \"in independent physicians providing fewer outpatient physician services, or going out of business entirely.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6. Additionally, \"independent physicians have lost substantial money as a result of Highmark's predatory reimbursement rates and related practices.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11. In fact, this is the entire point according to Plaintiff, as Highland's dominance on the insurance end of the market allows it to unfairly compete on the physician services end of the market, driving independent physicians into the Hobson's choice between absorption or going out of business. Thus, these allegations are enough to establish anticompetitive conduct in differentiated treatment meant to harm competition on the provider side of the market by utilizing monopsony power on the insurance side of the market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Meanwhile, Plaintiff has also plausibly alleged harm to patients. Through weakening competition between independent physicians and Highmark facilities by exploiting its position as buyers of medical services, Plaintiff alleges that patients have been subjected to a \"reduction in the quantity [and] a degradation in the quality of outpatient physician services.\" Dkt. No. 42 at \u00b6 5. This includes patients being subjected to unnecessary procedures, increases in premiums, and the confusion and frustration that potentially arises when being steered away from one's preferred physician based on what insurance allegedly will and will not cover.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   These allegations, taken as true and as a whole as the Court must, are sufficient to adequately plead at the 12(b)(6) stage that Highmark has engaged in anticompetitive conduct and that the alleged conduct has caused harm to competition and consumers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    2. Plaintiff Pleads Injury Which Flowed from Anticompetitive Conduct\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   As stated above, it is not sufficient for Plaintiff to simply allege that there has been anticompetitive conduct that caused harm to the market and consumers. Rather, Plaintiff must also show that it was injured by the anticompetitive conduct and that the injury \"flows from that which makes defendants' acts unlawful.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Highmark contends that Plaintiff has failed to sufficiently plead this prong of antitrust injury in the amended complaint. It disputes the amended complaint's contention that Plaintiff \"has lost approximately $200,000 to $300,000 annually,\" Dkt. No. 42 at \u00b6\u00b6 11, 47, on two levels. First, Highmark asserts that the loss \"is not an antitrust injury because it does not arise\" from conduct the type of which the antitrust laws were intended to prevent. Dkt. 47 at 10-11. Second, it attacks the figure directly by asserting that the alleged losses are insufficient because they \"say[ ] nothing about whether and to what extent those losses relate to reimbursements from Highmark or other payors, how Highmark's reimbursements relate to Plaintiff's costs,\"\n   <em>\n    etc.\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 49 at 3-4. Plaintiff simply responds that it has alleged\n   proper injury based on the claimed losses of \"$200,000 to $300,000 annually due to Highmark's predatory rates.\" Dkt. No. 48 at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   While Plaintiff's pleading regarding injury stemming from anticompetitive conduct is barebones, it is sufficient to survive this stage of the pleadings. Plaintiff has alleged an injury, \"$200,000 to $300,000 annually,\" resulting from a \"rates drop below its costs for numerous procedures\" attributable to \"predatorily depressed reimbursement rates.\" Dkt. No. 42 at \u00b6 47. Plaintiff has also alleged that Highmark's anticompetitive conduct, in the form of unnecessary audits and inefficient procedure codes \"raise its costs\" and \"divert[ ] resources away from providing\" patient care.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50. This is a sufficient allegation of losses stemming from anticompetitive conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As such, Plaintiff has established a showing of antitrust injury, which comports with the goals of antitrust law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, Highmark is incorrect that all of Plaintiff's alleged harms flow from the All Products Clause and the PPA, the state approval of which provides the basis for its invocation of the\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 47 at 21. As Plaintiff replies, \"[t]he all products clause is but one aspect of Highmark's anticompetitive behavior.\" Dkt. 48 at 20. As previously discussed, Plaintiff's amended complaint alleges other anticompetitive conduct, which the Court considered to determine whether Plaintiff had met the pleading requirements to establish anticompetitive conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 497-500. Plaintiff's amended complaint characterizes the All Products clause as an exacerbating factor, not a sole factor.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 42 at \u00b6 13, There is no indication in the Pennsylvania administrative code, or Exhibit A, that Pennsylvania approved of Plaintiff's alleged other anticompetitive conduct or the reduced rates of primary concern to Plaintiff. As such, Highmark has failed to make a prima facia showing that the\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   doctrine is broadly applicable to all the alleged conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Second, Highmark fails to meet the substantive requirements of the\n   <em>\n    Midcal\n   </em>\n   standard. Quite simply, Highmark overstates the extent of Pennsylvania's approval of its actions through submission and review of the draft PPA. For example, Section 9.722 contains no indication that the DOH reviews for antitrust concerns, let alone expresses a \"clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed\" state policy to permit anticompetitive conduct.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%209.722\">\n    28 Pa. Code \u00a7 9.722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To the contrary, DOH's affirmative obligations evidence a concern for consumer protection, for example by (1) prohibiting retaliatory clauses against healthcare providers who \"[a]dvocate for medically necessary and appropriate health care services for an enrollee\" or who file grievances on behalf of an enrollee,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%209.722\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 9.722(c), and (2) requiring certain consumer protection provisions, for example, \"[l]anguage stating that enrollee records shall be kept confidential by the plan and the health care provider,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%209.722\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 9.722(e).

No. 42 at \u00b6 155.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Highmark moves to dismiss this cause of action based on the contention that \" '[a] cause of action for unjust enrichment may arise only when a transaction of the parties [is] not otherwise governed by an express contract.' \" Dkt.

As the PPA governs the relationship between the parties, Highmark argues this cause of action should be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Plaintiff responds by pointing out that Highmark has not challenged the sufficiency of Plaintiff's pleading of the necessary elements of an unjust enrichment claim, but rather whether such a claim may advance in the face of the PPA. Plaintiff cites a similarly situated recent Eleventh Circuit case and also argues that it may plead unjust enrichment in the alternative, under on FED. R. CIV.

In\n   <em>\n    Liss\n   </em>\n   the incorporated statute, the Medical Records Act (\"MRA\"), 42 PA. STAT. AND CONS. STAT.

Highmark counters that \"[t]o the extent that Plaintiff purports to base its claim\" for breach of fiduciary duty on such allegations, dismissal is appropriate because, under Pennsylvania law, such claims must be based on a specific provision of a contract. Dkt. No. 47 at 26 n.8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Plaintiff's however, can point to such a provision, the variable reimbursement rate clause, which provides that \"allowances [paid to specialist] may be reviewed and adjusted from time to time during the Term.\" Dkt.
