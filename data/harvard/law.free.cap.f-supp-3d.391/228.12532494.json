(\"SCE\") owns and operates a club known as Sin City Cabaret, which is located at 2520 Park Avenue, Bronx, New York. Doc. 108, 2. Defendant 21 Group, Inc. (\"21 Group\") owns and operates a club known as Show Palace Gentlemen's Club, which is located at 45-20 21st Street, Long Island City, New York. Doc. 108, 2. Both clubs also operate related social media accounts. Doc. 111, 63. Constantine Drakopoulos, the general manager of SCE Group, oversaw all marketing and social media for Show Palace and Sin City and served as their Rule 30(b)(6) witness. 105-5, 19, 31, 118.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   SCE and 21 Group concede that the pictures of the Plaintiffs at issue herein appeared on their respective Instagram and Facebook accounts. Doc. 108, 2. Drakopoulos testified that at different times either Mike Diaz, a manager of 21 Group, or Creative Complex, an advertising agency retained by Defendants, posted the images. Doc. 111, 66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Drakopoulos testified that Diaz found the images that he personally posted on Google and believed that the images could be used in the clubs' social media accounts because it was his understanding that any image on the internet could be used for commercial purposes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 67. Drakopoulos testified that Diaz would only post an image if \"there [wa]s no warning or restrictions or anything that says not to use the image.\" Doc. 105-5, 202. Drakopoulos further stated that Defendants searched for the pictures by theme, such as \"sexy girl in a military outfit,\" and not by the names of any of the models.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   With respect to the images posted by Creative Complex, Drakopoulos testified that Creative Complex told him that it purchased the pictures to create the posts.

Doc. 105-5, 37-38, 56-57, and 191. Moreover, Drakopoulos testified that there did not seem to be a relationship between the alleged fame or notoriety\n   of the models and the effectiveness of the advertisements because the profits generally remained the same for each event, regardless of the identity of the model used in the social media posts relating to those events.

To bring a false endorsement claim, Plaintiffs must show that Defendants, \"(1) in commerce, (2) made a false or misleading representation of fact (3) in connection with goods or services (4) that is likely to cause consumer confusion as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of the goods or services.\"\n    <em>\n     Toth v. 59 Murray Enterprises, Inc.\n    </em>\n    , No. 15 Civ. 8028 (NRB),\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%2095564\">\n     2019 WL 95564\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *5 (S.D.N.Y.

Because Defendants used Plaintiffs' pictures to advertise their commercial establishments, there is no dispute about the first and third prong of the test.

The first Lanham Act element therefore turned on whether the video implied that the [plaintiffs] had done so, because any such implication was necessarily false.\"). This inquiry consists of two questions: Do the posts contain an endorsement of Defendants? And if so, is that endorsement fairly attributed to Plaintiffs?\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4178389\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/66/424/#p449\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    As to the first question, the answer is yes.

Each appears on a social media page that prominently displays Defendants' name and most advertise an event at one of Defendants' location.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    As to the second question, the answer is also yes. These endorsements imply an association between Plaintiffs and Defendants because they juxtapose Plaintiffs' pictures with text referencing Defendants' clubs. Furthermore, a number of the posts describe the women, though not by name, who perform at the clubs directly under Plaintiffs' picture, and therefore imply that Plaintiffs are the women that the posts describe.\n    <footnotemark>\n     11\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    <strong>\n     2. Consumer Confusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    The parties dispute whether the use of Plaintiffs' images caused consumer confusion.
