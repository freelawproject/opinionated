Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plastronics Socket is a provider of technology and innovation for the semiconductor industry, including burn-in sockets and related components. (Doc. 11 \u00b6 2, \"FAC\"). In 2003, Defendant Dong Weon Hwang was an engineer based in Korea. (FAC \u00b6 36). In 2004, he joined Plastronics Socket as its Chief Technology Officer (FAC \u00b6 36). Before joining Plastronics, Hwang had an idea for a new contact pin (the \"Invention\"), which became the subject of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%207%2C025%2C602\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 7,025,602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the \"'602 Patent\"). (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 9, 39). The '602 Patent was issued April 11, 2006 and entitled \"Contact for Electronic Devices.\" (FAC \u00b6 9). On September 24, 2005, prior to obtaining the patent, Hwang and Plastronics executed a royalty agreement (the \"Royalty Agreement\"),\n   under which Plastronics agreed to pay for the development of the Invention and worldwide patent rights where needed, and Plastronics was to be assigned the patent jointly with Hwang. (FAC \u00b6 40). The Royalty Agreement also prohibited both Plastronics Socket and Hwang from granting a license for the Invention without approval from the other party. (FAC \u00b6 40).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 4, 2005, also prior to obtaining the patent, Hwang and Plastronics Socket executed an assignment agreement, assigning half of the right, title, and interest in and to the Invention and any letters patent that may issue thereon (the \"Assignment and Agreement\"). (FAC \u00b6 41). The other half was assigned to Hwang. (FAC \u00b6 41). Additionally, both Hwang and Plastronics Socket agreed to not transfer any interest in or license the Invention without the written consent of all Assignees. (FAC \u00b6 42).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In April 2008, Hwang decided to return to Korea and resigned his position with Plastronics. (FAC \u00b6 56). Also in April 2008, Hwang formed HiCon Ltd. to manufacture and sell competing products. (FAC \u00b6 57). On or about July 27, 2009, Hwang formed HiCon Co. to design and sell competing products. (FAC \u00b6 60). In 2016, Hwang and Defendant Paul Schubring formed HiCon USA,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   which signed an exclusive distribution agreement with HiCon Ltd. and/or HiCon Co. for the territory of North America. (FAC \u00b6 65).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 10, 2018, Plaintiffs filed their First Amended Complaint (FAC) alleging counts of patent infringement against Defendants HiCon USA and HighRel, as well as a count of tortious interference with business expectancy, prospective business relations. Plaintiffs also alleged various counts against Defendants Hwang and Shubring, all but one of which was dismissed by this Court's May 9, 2019 order, (Doc. 58). Defendants now move to dismiss, asserting that Plaintiffs lack standing because this patent infringement suit was not brought by both owners of the patent.

Therefore, the inquiry here is not one involving an exclusive licensee, but rather two co-owners. Neither party argues that Plastronics does not have constitutional standing to sue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Evident Corp. v.

Cir. 2005) (holding that plaintiff with significant rights to the patent \"[c]learly ... had constitutional standing to sue under the patent\"). The question is one of whether Plastronics has prudential standing to bring a patent infringement action without Hwang joined as a plaintiff.

(Mot. at 9). Plaintiffs respond asserting that nowhere in the\n   <em>\n    Evident\n   </em>\n   opinion did the court rely on \"any alleged alignment of interests with plaintiff for its decision.\" (Resp. at 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The facts underlying the\n   <em>\n    Evident\n   </em>\n   holding are dissimilar to the facts here. As an initial matter,\n   <em>\n    Evident\n   </em>\n   dealt with a patent owner and a licensee-not two co-owners. Furthermore, in\n   <em>\n    Evident\n   </em>\n   , the patent owner and the licensee were both defendants to the counterclaim and both defending the patent. That is not the case here. Hwang is not defending the patent with Plastronics and is only in the lawsuit because of one remaining count for breach of fiduciary duty in regard to confidential information-a count separate from the infringement counts. The facts here do not parallel the facts in\n   <em>\n    Evident\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Also, the\n   <em>\n    Evident\n   </em>\n   court discussed that both the patent owner and the licensee \"were clearly parties to the lawsuit, and [the patent owner] participated throughout the duration of the lawsuit.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1546955\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/399/1310/#p1314\">\n    399 F.3d at 1314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The question of standing was first raised on a\n   <em>\n    second\n   </em>\n   appeal to the Federal Circuit and after seven years of litigation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1546955\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/399/1310/#p1314\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court did not need to question whether the patent owner was going to be involved in the entirety of the litigation-it had already happened. Again, that is not the case here. At present, Hwang is only tied as a defendant to this lawsuit by one count which is unrelated to the infringement claims. (Doc. 58) (dismissing all counts against Hwang except breach of fiduciary duty in regard to confidential information). Hwang can be dismissed as a defendant from the lawsuit at any point, leaving Plastronics as only one of two co-owners to bring the remainder of the suit against the alleged infringers. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Evident\n   </em>\n   , this Court is not able to overlook\n   the concern that the litigation may at some point proceed without involvement from Hwang.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Court is not aware of any case that extends\n   <em>\n    Evident\n   </em>\n   's holding to a case where the co-owner of a patent is joined merely as a defendant for a claim unrelated to defending the patent. While\n   <em>\n    Evident\n   </em>\n   does appear to make another limited exception to the rule that all co-owners must join as plaintiffs, the Court does not find that this exception extends to the facts here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that under\n   <em>\n    Morrow v.

But Plaintiffs' reliance on\n   <em>\n    Morrow\n   </em>\n   is misplaced.\n   <em>\n    Morrow\n   </em>\n   does not specifically discuss the situation of one co-owner refusing join the other co-owner in a patent infringement suit.\n   <em>\n    Morrow\n   </em>\n   described three general categories of plaintiffs encountered when analyzing constitutional standing in patent infringement suits: \"[1] those that can sue in their own name alone; [2] those that can sue as long as the patent owner is joined in the suit; [3] and those that cannot even participate as a party to an infringement suit.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3656177,3093461\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/499/1332/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3656177,3093461\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/499/1332/\">\n    at 1339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs assert that here, they fall into category two. But in context, category two is primarily aimed at the case of an exclusive licensee. The\n   <em>\n    Morrow\n   </em>\n   court said that plaintiffs in category two hold \"exclusionary rights,\" but not all substantial rights to the patent, and that \"the patentee who transferred these exclusionary interests is usually joined to satisfy prudential standing concerns.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3656177,3093461\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/499/1332/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3656177,3093461\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/499/1332/\">\n    at 1340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Morrow\n   </em>\n   court indicated that in cases dealing with category two plaintiffs, \"joinder of the patentee is not necessary\" when \"the patentee is the infringer,\n   <em>\n    or the prudential concerns are not at play in a particular case.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3656177,3093461\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/499/1332/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But these statements were made in context of a patent owner being forced to join suit with an exclusive licensee;\n   <em>\n    Morrow\n   </em>\n   does not contemplate the situation of two co-owners. Plaintiffs fall more likely into category one, as they can sue in their own name as long as any patent co-owners are also joined as plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiffs have not provided an exception that allows Hwang's presence as a defendant to obviate the rule that a co-owner must be joined with the other co-owner in order for there to be standing. The Court therefore declines to recognize a new exception and holds that Hwang's presence in the lawsuit as a defendant does not confer standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Recognized Exceptions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In addition to arguing that Hwang's presence as a defendant confers standing, the parties also analyze the recognized exceptions to the rule that a co-owner must join as a plaintiff. The parties focus their arguments on the exception which requires a co-owner to join suit if the co-owners had an agreement waiving their rights to refuse to join the other co-owner in an infringement suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    STC.UNM\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055316\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/754/940/#p946\">\n    754 F.3d at 946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"If, by agreement, a co-owner waives his right to refuse to join suit, his co-owners may subsequently force him to join in a suit against infringers.\"). Defendants assert that neither the Royalty Agreement nor the Assignment and Agreement require Hwang to \"join a patent-infringement suit or allow[ ] Plastronics to file suit without Mr. Hwang.\" (Mot. at 4). In opposition, Plaintiffs assert that the Assignment and Agreement obligates Hwang to join the suit and that Hwang waived his right to refuse to join. (Resp. at 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   But as Defendants have correctly noted, \"Plastronics does not seek and has never sought to join Mr. Hwang as a plaintiff.\" (Reply at 4). While the Court notes that Hwang may well have waived his right to refuse to join an infringement lawsuit\n   through the Assignment and Agreement, the Court declines to analyze any possible waiver since Plastronics has not moved to join Hwang. And as Defendants have noted, further procedural complications may arise due to Hwang's current status as a defendant. (Reply at 4) (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Court notes that if there was anything alleged beyond patent infringement, it was dismissed pursuant to this Court's prior order. (Doc. 58 at 7-8).
