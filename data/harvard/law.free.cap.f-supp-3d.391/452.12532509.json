The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has not decided the issue. In a non-precedential opinion, the Third Circuit has held that a \u00a7 1734 sign down of UM/UIM coverage continues in effect after bodily injury liability limits are increased. Several district courts have held that a \u00a7 1731 total rejection, rather than a reduction under \u00a7 1734, of UM/UIM coverage remains valid even when a vehicle is added to the policy. Based on the rationale of these cases, we conclude that a \u00a7 1734 sign down survives the addition of vehicles to the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Relying on cases involving waiver of stacking coverage under \u00a7 1738, the insureds, Susan and John Alcedo, contend that the addition of vehicles to their policy rendered the sign down executed by Mr. Alcedo at the inception of the policy invalid. They maintain that their insurer, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, was required to obtain a new sign down each time a vehicle was added because the additional vehicle increased the amount of UM/UIM coverage otherwise available. Therefore, so they argue, State Farm's inability to produce a sign down executed contemporaneously with or after the addition of the last vehicle to the policy fixes the UM/UIM limits at the same level as the full bodily injury liability limits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   State Farm counters that \u00a7 1738 stacking cases are inapplicable to this \u00a7 1734 sign down case. It argues that a rejection of UM/UIM coverage under \u00a7 1731 survives the addition of vehicles to the policy because \u00a7 1791 alone provides the form to notify the insured of available limits and \"no other notice or rejection shall be required.\" It reasons that because a \u00a7 1731 total rejection of UM/UIM coverage is subject to greater scrutiny than a \u00a7 1734 sign down, the fact that a rejection does\n   not require a new written rejection when a vehicle is added to the policy means that a reduction of coverage should be treated the same - a new sign down is not required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We conclude that State Farm fulfilled its obligations under the MVFRL when it offered the Alcedos UM/UIM coverage up to the amount of the bodily injury liability limits and confirmed in writing Mr. Alcedo's decision to reduce that coverage. The cases cited by the Alcedos dealing with waiver of stacking under \u00a7 1738 are inapplicable. The sign down executed by Mr. Alcedo remained valid after he added vehicles to the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Stipulated Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 29, 2005, State Farm issued Mr. Alcedo an automobile insurance policy covering a 2005 Nissan Pathfinder and a 1999 Nissan Maxima.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The policy provided UM/UIM bodily injury liability limits of $ 100,000 per person and $ 300,000 per accident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his insurance application and his sign down form, Mr. Alcedo opted to reduce UM/UIM coverage to $ 25,000 per person and $ 50,000 per accident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also signed the \u00a7 1791 notice attached to the application acknowledging that higher UM/UIM limits had been made available to him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 3 and August 25, 2014, Mr. Alcedo added a 1996 Buick Roadmaster and a 2011 Honda Accord, respectively, to the policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   On March 8, 2016, Mr. Alcedo removed the Roadmaster.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   On July 3, 2017, he added a 2007 Mazda Mazda 3 to the policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   At no time after he signed down UM/UIM coverage at the inception of the policy did he provide another sign down.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On September 29, 2017, Mrs. Alcedo was injured in a covered automobile accident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   She sought UIM benefits in the amount of the policy's stacked bodily injury limits of $ 400,000. After State Farm refused to pay that amount, the Alcedos filed this declaratory judgment action in the state court. After removing the case to this court, State Farm moved for judgment on the pleadings.
