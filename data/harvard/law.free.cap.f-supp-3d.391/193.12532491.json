(\"Hanover\") and Citizens Insurance Company of America (\"Citizens\") (collectively \"defendants\"). Plaintiffs seek a judgment declaring that defendants are obligated to provide insurance coverage and seek damages for various contract related claims stemming from a denial of coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 17, 2017 plaintiffs brought suit against defendants in New York State Supreme Court, Albany County. On May 19, 2017, defendants removed the suit to this Court based upon diversity jurisdiction. Defendants now move for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (\"Rule\") 12(c) and summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 dismissing the four count Complaint. Plaintiffs opposed only defendants' motion pursuant to Rule 56 to dismiss the second cause of action for breach of contract. Defendants replied. Oral argument was heard on August 1, 2019 in Utica, New York. Decision was reserved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The facts are largely undisputed. They are drawn from the undisputed facts in defendants' Statement of Material Facts (\"Defs.' SMF\"), plaintiffs' Response Statement of Material Facts and Statement of Additional Material Facts, defendants' Response to Plaintiffs' Statement of Additional Material Facts, and the exhibits and affidavits submitted in connection with the motions. Where the facts stated by the moving parties are supported by testimonial or documentary evidence, and denied with only a conclusory statement, or not denied at all, those facts are found to be true.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Local Rule 7.1(a)(3) (\"The Court shall deem admitted any properly supported facts set forth in the Statement of Material Facts that the opposing party does not specifically controvert.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During the relevant time, plaintiffs owned two hotels in the Albany, New York area. In 2010, plaintiffs entered into a management agreement with Bullock Hospitality LLC (\"Bullock Hospitality\") to manage both hotels.

The policy listed eight named insureds including: \"400 HIE, LLC DBA ALBANY AIRPORT HOLIDAY INN EXPRESS AND SUITES\"; \"ALBANY AIRPORT HIE, LLC D/B/A ALBANY AIRPORT HOTEL\"; and \"BULLOCK HOSPITALITY, LLC.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6\u00b6 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In February 2015, plaintiffs reported to Citizens that their former hotel manager, Tod Hanlon, had stolen over $700,000 from them by depositing checks intended for the hotels into his own bank account.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 7. Plaintiffs made a claim to Citizens for coverage under the policy's employee theft section of the policy's \"GOLD FORM BROADENING ENDORSEMENT.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 8. At the time of the reported theft, the policy's \"GOLD FORM BROADENING ENDORSEMENT\" contained the following exclusion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    (8) Special Employee Theft Exclusions\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   We will not pay for:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    (a)\n   </strong>\n   Loss resulting from \"theft\" or any other dishonest act committed by:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    (i)\n   </strong>\n   You; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    (ii)\n   </strong>\n   Any of your partners or \"members\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Whether acting alone or in collusion with other persons.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 9 (emphasis in original).

That opinion concluded,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the Special Employee Theft Exclusion excluding coverage for theft by \"You\" or \"Any of your partners or 'members' \" did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   apply to exclude coverage for the instant alleged theft.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On May 18, 2016, Citizens denied coverage to plaintiffs based on the policy's Special Employee Theft Exclusion 8.a.

Not so, say plaintiffs. According to them, defendants contracted to pay for losses from thefts by an employee. Plaintiffs contend that while Tod Hanlon was a member of Bullock Hospitality, his theft was carried out in his individual capacity as an employee rather than a member of a named insured. Plaintiffs also focus significant attention on the relationship or lack thereof among the named insureds, as well as on the PLRB coverage opinion. In particular, plaintiffs urge that the because the PLRB coverage opinion was in conflict with defendants' ultimate coverage position, the terms of the policy are capable of more than one meaning when viewed objectively by a reasonably intelligent person and the contract is thus\n   ambiguous.
