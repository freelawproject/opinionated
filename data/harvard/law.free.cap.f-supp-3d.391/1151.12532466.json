The Plaintiff filed a response (ECF No. 26) and the Defendant timely replied (ECF No. 29.) Upon review of the record, the relevant caselaw, and the parties' submissions, the Court\n   <strong>\n    grants\n   </strong>\n   the Plaintiff's motion. (\n   <strong>\n    ECF Nos. 23\n   </strong>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Gregory Haskin Chiropractic Clinics, Inc. filed its Amended Class Action Complaint against Defendant State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (\"State Farm\") for declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and breach of contract. (ECF No. 16.) The Plaintiff's allegations center around the Defendant's improper application of the Plaintiff's deductible to its medical bills under Florida's no-fault personal injury protection (\"PIP\") statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20627.736\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On December 28, 2018, the Florida Supreme Court clarified Florida law regarding the issue of the proper timing for an insurer to apply an insured's deductible to medical bills for PIP benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Progressive Select Ins. C. v. Fla. Hosp. Medical Cntr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12684052\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/260/219/\">\n    260 So.3d 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 2018).\n   <em>\n    Florida Hospital\n   </em>\n   held that when calculating the amount of PIP benefits due, the insured's deductible is to be subtracted from the total medical charges\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   applying the statutory reimbursement limits in the PIP statute. (ECF No. 16 at \u00b653.) Plaintiff's complaint alleges that the Defendant has been misapplying the deductible and under-paying its insureds, including Plaintiff and all those similarly situated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Also relevant to this Court's order is a lawsuit pending in the Eleventh Judicial Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County. On October 23, 2014, Progressive Health Services, Inc. filed its Amended Class Action Complaint against Defendant State Farm\n   Mutual Automobile Insurance Company seeking declaratory relief and damages for breach of contract. (ECF No. 23-2.) The Plaintiff in the state court complaint and in this action seek the same declaratory relief regarding the Defendant's PIP reimbursement practices. The two complaints also seek contract damages based on State Farm's under-payment of no-fault benefits under Florida law. There is currently a motion for class certification pending in the state court action.\n   <em>\n    Progressive Health Servs. Inc. v. State Farm Mutual Auto Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 2011-010334-CA-01, Dkt. #13 (11th Jud. Cir. Fla. April 4, 2019).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Defendant now moves to dismiss the complaint on three separate grounds: (1) the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because the Plaintiff failed to allege the jurisdictional amount in controversy required by the Class Action Fairness Act; (2) the equitable claims should be dismissed because the Plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law; or alternatively (3) the case should be stayed pending the outcome of a related state court case. (ECF No. 23 at 6-11.) Because the Court finds that it should decline to exercise jurisdiction over this case, it will address the Defendant's last argument only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Defendant argues that this case should be dismissed or stayed under\n   <em>\n    Ameritas Variable Life Ins. Co. v.

Under\n   <em>\n    Ameritas\n   </em>\n   , the Eleventh Circuit held that a federal court should decline to hear a declaratory judgment action where \"another suit is pending in a state court presenting the same issues, not governed by federal law, between the same parties.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8958313\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/411/1328/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8958313\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/411/1328/\">\n    at 1330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the state court action will determine the same legal issues against the same defendant, State Farm believes this case should be stayed or dismissed pending the outcome of the state court case. The Defendant also argues that this case should be stayed or dismissed under\n   <em>\n    Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. U.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027510\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/800/\">\n    424 U.S. 800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027510\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/800/\">\n    96 S.Ct. 1236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027510\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/800/\">\n    47 L.Ed.2d 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976). While the Plaintiff \"concedes that the prior pending state court class action seeks virtually the same\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   relief against State Farm,\" the Plaintiff argues that this case should not be stayed under\n   <em>\n    Colorado River\n   </em>\n   because the \"state court action is in its infancy.\" (ECF No. 26 at 13.) The Plaintiff does not address\n   <em>\n    Ameritas\n   </em>\n   and neither party bothers to explain which test should apply,\n   <em>\n    Ameritas\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Colorado River\n   </em>\n   , and the relationship between the two, if any.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Ameritas,\n   </em>\n   the Eleventh Circuit explained that the \"Declaratory Judgment Act is an enabling Act, which confers a discretion on courts rather than an absolute right upon the litigant.

Here, the Plaintiff's breach of contract claim does not raise any distinct factual or legal issues and requires the same analysis as the declaratory judgment claim. The declaratory judgment claim asks for a declaration regarding State Farm's allegedly improper application of the PIP statute to calculate reimbursements. The Court's decision on the declaratory judgment count will determine if the Plaintiff is entitled to damages under the breach of contract count. For example, if the Court holds that State Farm was improperly applying the PIP statute, then the Plaintiff is entitled to damages for under-payment of benefits. On the other hand, if the Court holds that State Farm correctly applied the PIP statute, the Plaintiff is not entitled to damages under its breach of contract theory. Accordingly, this is, at its core, a declaratory judgment action and\n   <em>\n    Ameritas\n   </em>\n   applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Upon application of the\n   <em>\n    Ameritas\n   </em>\n   factors to this case, the Court finds that the factors weigh in favor of abstention.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The first factor concerns the strength of the state's interest in having the issues raised in the federal declaratory action decided in state court.\n   <em>\n    Ameritas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8958313\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/411/1328/\">\n    411 F.3d at 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Florida state courts have a substantial interest in deciding how insurance companies should apply Florida statutes regarding reimbursements and deductibles to the claims of Florida residents. This factor points towards abstention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The second factor looks to whether the judgment in the federal action would settle the controversy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8958313\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/411/1328/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   A decision in this case would not. This is one of many lawsuits in which a provider or insured seeks a declaration of its right under Florida's PIP statute. A ruling in this action adverse to the Plaintiff would not moot the issue in the state court lawsuit. Indeed, if both lawsuits are allowed to proceed there is the possibility of inconsistent verdicts on the same issue against the same defendant. Therefore, this factor also favors abstention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The third factor asks whether the federal action would serve a useful purpose in clarifying the legal relations at issue.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8958313\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/411/1328/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Although a decision by the Court in this case would indeed clarify the legal relations of the parties, it could, as discussed above, lead to inconsistent verdicts if allowed to proceed.

There is nothing to suggest that the state court remedy is \"better\" or \"more effective\" as both forums could address the declaratory judgment issues before the Court.

The Plaintiff's complaint raises exclusively Florida law issues related to the interpretation of the Florida PIP statute and the interpretation of an insurance contract under state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   After weighing each of the\n   <em>\n    Ameritas\n   </em>\n   factors, the Court concludes that it should decline to exercise jurisdiction over the Plaintiff's claims and stay this case in favor of the state court case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Court\n   <strong>\n    grants\n   </strong>\n   the Defendant's motion to stay. (\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 23\n   </strong>\n   .) This case is hereby\n   <strong>\n    stayed\n   </strong>\n   until the conclusion of the parallel state court proceeding. The parties shall provide the Court with a status report of the state court case every 90 days from the date of this Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Clerk is directed to\n   <strong>\n    administratively close\n   </strong>\n   this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    Done and ordered\n   </strong>\n   , at Miami, Florida, on June 7, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    The Court notes that although the parties\n    <em>\n     agree\n    </em>\n    on the fact that the state court action is a \"parallel\" proceeding, the parties are not perfectly parallel. The two plaintiffs are distinct. The Court finds, however, that the parties do not have to be perfectly identical for the district court to exercise its discretion to stay the case.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Mid-Continental Casualty Company v.
