Russell acted unreasonably and violated Mr. Marshall's right to be free from unreasonable deadly force. It is undisputed that Sgt. Russell was not responding to any crime; he was responding to a call for medical assistance to ensure Emergency Medical Services (\"EMS\") could render medical aid. Mrs. Marshall testified that when Sgt. Russell arrived on scene, she informed him she was \"waiting for the ambulance because [her] husband need[ed] medical attention because he [wa]s bleeding from his left arm,\" and responded \"No\" when Sgt. Russell asked if Mr. Marshall was being bothersome. M. Marshall Dep. 12:23-13:24, ECF No. 57-6. Mrs. Marshall also testified she told Sgt. Russell that Mr. Marshall was drunk.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   11:20-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In this case, the critical inquiry is whether the shooting was objectively reasonable in the circumstances confronting Sgt. Russell at the moment he shot Mr. Marshall. The most critical disputed fact is whether, at the moment Sgt. Russell shot Mr. Marshall, Mr. Marshall took steps toward Sgt. Russell or made some other threatening movement toward Sgt. Russell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In his affidavit, Sgt. Russell stated that when he climbed the second floor landing of the apartment building, he \"moved to the middle of the second floor landing about three feet from the doorway, where\n   [he] could see inside the apartment....\" Russell Aff. \u00b6 7, ECF No. 52-2. He further asserted Mr. Marshall was \"approximately four feet inside the apartment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. Sgt. Russell stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   After seeing the male bleeding and appearing to use the drill to cause additional harm to himself I was alarmed and afraid that he was going to harm either me or the female standing nearby with the drill. Fearing for the safety of the female and myself, I immediately went to low ready with my service weapon in my hand pointed toward the ground. I ordered the male to drop the drill at least two times then the male turned towards me and I talked to him and tried to get him to come with me for medical care. The male looked directly at my handgun and stated, \"What, are you going to f***ing shoot me?\" The male raised the drill and moved quickly towards me. I reflexively raised my weapon and fired one shot into the male's chest because I believed he was going to hurt me or kill me with the drill. At the time I fired, the male was at the doorway and about three feet from me. After the shot, the male turned and fell on his side inside the apartment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. Sgt. Russell contended Mrs. Marshall did not see Mr. Marshall advance toward Sgt. Russell because she was looking at Sgt. Russell at the time he fired his weapon. ECF No. 55 at 29-30. He attached the following excerpts from her deposition transcript:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Q: So is it accurate - from all the words that you've said, my understanding is that you were looking at Sergeant Russell -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   A: Uh-huh.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Q: -- at the time that he pulled his weapon and fired?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   A: Right, right.

And then the off - and then he said put down the driller to Charlie and Charlie said, \"Well, what are you going to do? You going to kill me?\" And then the officer, which never in my mind ever would think that the officer was going to pull out his gun and shot him right in the chest, one shot, cold blood murder. Boom. Just like that. And I'm like, \"Why did you kill him? Why did you kill him? He didn't do anything. He did not deserve that.\" ... Why did he have to shoot him like that? I don't get it.

Russell shot him and saw him make no movement, drawing all factual inferences in Plaintiffs' favor as the Court must on summary judgment, her testimony is sufficient to create a fact issue. Her testimony that Mr. Marshall was \"not doing anything\" and stayed in the same position throughout the incident calls into question Sgt. Russell's statement that Mr. Marshall \"raised the drill and moved quickly towards\" him, closing a distance of four feet. There is evidence, if believed, that Sgt. Russell shot Mr. Marshall while he stood motionless with the drill in hand; that he made no threatening movement toward the officer; and that he posed no threat to anyone else at the time he was shot.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under Plaintiffs' version of the facts, while Mr. Marshall did not comply with commands to put down the drill, he was not actively resisting any arrest or attempting to flee.
