Dennis Saylor IV, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This is a putative class action alleging violations of Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act of 1934. The plaintiff class purchased common stock of ReWalk Robotics, Ltd. between September 12, 2014 (the date of its initial public offering (\"IPO\")) and February 29, 2016. The consolidated amended complaint alleges that ReWalk, its officers and directors, and the IPO underwriters concealed material information in its IPO registration statement about ReWalk's failure to comply with FDA regulations in violation of the Securities Act. It also alleges that after the IPO, ReWalk and certain officers continued to make material false statements after the initial offering in violation of the Exchange Act. It relies in part on statements by three former ReWalk employees acting as confidential witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\"PSLRA\"), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78u-4, 78u-5. On August 23, 2018, the Court dismissed the Securities Act claim on the ground that the complaint failed to identify a false or misleading statement in the registration statement. As to the claims under the Exchange Act, however, the Court denied the motion to dismiss without prejudice. It noted that the lead plaintiff, Wang Yan, purchased shares only in September 2014, at the time of the initial public offering, and could therefore assert claims personally only under the Securities Act. And it provided plaintiff an opportunity to seek the appointment of a substitute or supplemental lead plaintiff or to take other steps to establish standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Yan has elected to seek to amend the complaint to add Joanne Geller as a named plaintiff as to the Exchange Act class. For the following reasons, the motion will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The allegations in the consolidated amended complaint are set out in the Court's Memorandum and Order dated August 23, 2018. Familiarity with that opinion is assumed. The factual background relevant to the motion to amend is set forth below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant ReWalk Robotics, Ltd., formerly known as Argo Medical Technologies, Inc., is a medical device company. It designs and develops exoskeletons, which are devices that help persons with spinal-cord injuries walk. (CAC \u00b6 2). The company is incorporated in Israel and has its United States headquarters in Marlborough, Massachusetts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   ReWalk currently sells two distinct products: ReWalk Personal, which is designed for everyday use, and ReWalk Rehabilitation, which is designed for clinical rehabilitation centers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46). Both devices are regulated in various jurisdictions by the FDA, the European Union, or other governmental agencies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94). This proceeding concerns only the ReWalk Personal device, which the Court will refer to as the \"device.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2014, ReWalk submitted the device to the FDA for \"de novo\" classification. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47). \"De novo\" classification allows manufacturers to market devices that are low-to-moderate risk and not substantially similar to devices that are already being marketed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On June 26, 2014, the FDA approved the ReWalk device for marketing. It designated the ReWalk device \"Class II,\" requiring special controls. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48-49).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The FDA also ordered the company to conduct a \"post-market surveillance\" study to determine the product's risks, as required by Section 522 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 48-49; 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360L(a)(1)(A) ). FDA regulations require manufacturers to report results of such studies, including important attributes such as the type of test subjects, methodology, data-collection plan, and patient follow-up. 21 C.F.R. 822.10. The FDA required the study due to concerns that a malfunction could result in serious injury or death to a patient. (CAC \u00b6\u00b6 4, 49).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The complaint alleges that defendants failed to disclose that ReWalk was either unprepared or unable to comply with the FDA's June 2014 directive that it perform post-market surveillance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16, 68).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Prior to the IPO, ReWalk filed a registration statement with the SEC stating that it had developed a \"breakthrough product\" that would \"deliver a natural gait and functional walking speed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90). The complaint alleges that the registration statement failed to disclose that the reason the FDA ordered the company to conduct a post-market surveillance study was that the ReWalk device posed a threat of serious injury or death. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 85-95).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The initial public offering of ReWalk occurred on September 12, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5). Lead plaintiff Wang Yan purchased 3,600 shares of ReWalk in September 2014, shortly after the IPO. (Docket No. 7, Ex. C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Two weeks after the IPO, on September 29, 2014, the FDA contacted ReWalk to inform the company that its proposed post-market surveillance study was deficient. (CAC \u00b6 7). Notably, the FDA letter stated that although the plan was deficient, because less than six months had elapsed\n   since the issuance of the Section 522 order, the study status would be marked as \"Plan Pending\" on the FDA's website. (Feldman Decl. Ex. F at 3). The FDA granted ReWalk 30 days to file a response. (CAC \u00b6 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ReWalk failed to do so in a timely fashion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8). It eventually filed a response on November 6, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On February 13, 2015, the FDA found that the November 6 submission was also deficient. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The FDA granted ReWalk another 30 days to file a further response, and the company responded (late) on May 22, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-10). ReWalk stated that it wanted to discuss an issue with the FDA before submitting a formal reply to the February 13 letter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   According to the complaint, during that time, ReWalk officials held quarterly earnings calls during which they failed to disclose the company's failure to comply with the FDA's requirement. Specifically, those calls were made on February 12, 2015 (Q4 2014), May 7, 2015 (Q1 2015), August 6, 2015 (Q2 2015), November 11, 2015 (Q3 2015), and February 25, 2016 (Q4 2015). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 99-110).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On September 5, 2015, the FDA cautioned ReWalk that it still had not submitted a revised study plan addressing the deficiencies previously identified by the agency. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13). Having received no response, on September 30, 2015, the FDA issued a warning letter outlining the company's substantial failure to comply with the post-market surveillance requirement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14). Specifically, the letter stated that under the Section 522 order, ReWalk was required to begin its surveillance study \"not later than 15 months after the day on which [a Section 522 order] is issued.\" (Pl. Ex. C at 2). The 15-month time frame had closed on September 28, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The letter went on to state that ReWalk had \"committed a prohibited act under section 301(q)(1)(C) of the [Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]\" and that the ReWalk device was \"currently misbranded.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The letter was eventually disclosed to the public by the FDA on March 1, 2016. (CAC \u00b6 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In the meantime, on December 21, 2015, proposed plaintiff Joanne Geller purchased 1,000 shares of ReWalk common stock at $ 14.80 per share. (Jafri Decl. Ex. A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   ReWalk's closing stock price on February 29, 2016, the day before the FDA released the letter, was $ 10.48. (CAC \u00b6 19). The closing price the following day, on March 1, 2016, was $ 9.07, reflecting a 13% decline in value. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The stock price steadily declined thereafter, and ReWalk shares were trading in August 2018 at around $ 0.75 to $ 1.25.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At the end of March 2016, the FDA exercised its enforcement discretion and allowed ReWalk to continue to market its device, provided that it would initiate the post-market surveillance study by June 1, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 114). The FDA approved ReWalk's proposed protocol for the study on May 5, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 115). However, ReWalk did not file timely monthly reports to the FDA in June and July 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 116). Although the approved protocol required 60 subjects from twelve United States clinical areas, according to CW-3, ReWalk had only recruited eight subjects from three areas by June 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 117-18).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs in this action initially filed suit in California state court on September 20, 2016. (Docket No. 37, Ex. 4 at 2). The California action was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction over the defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On October 31, 2016, plaintiff Shane Vesey filed suit against defendants in the Massachusetts Superior Court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 1). On November 30, 2016, plaintiff Phanindra Chittavajhula also filed suit against defendants in the Superior Court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 2). Both cases were putative class actions alleging violations of the federal Securities Act relating to omissions in ReWalk's registration statement and final prospectus. The state court consolidated the two cases under the name\n   <em>\n    In re ReWalk Robotics Ltd. Stockholder Litigation\n   </em>\n   on January 10, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Three weeks later, on January 31, 2017, this action was filed in federal court. The original complaint in this case only alleged violations of the federal Securities Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On March 30, 2017, defendants moved in the Massachusetts Superior Court to stay the pending state action on the ground that the present case should be considered the first-filed because the federal complaint mirrored that of the earlier dismissed California state-court complaint. The court denied that motion, finding that the California action was a \"nullity\" and that the state-court plaintiffs \"have made more progress in investigating the factual basis for their claims.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 4 at 3). The court also concluded that there was concurrent state and federal jurisdiction for claims arising from violations of the Securities Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4). Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the state action, and a hearing was held on October 18, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In the interim, on June 9, 2017, in this proceeding, the Court appointed a lead plaintiff (Wang Yan), lead counsel, and liaison counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Lead plaintiff Yan filed a consolidated amended complaint on August 9, 2017. That amended complaint added claims under the federal Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78a\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , over which federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On November 10, 2017, defendants moved to dismiss the action for failure to complete service of process on the individual domestic defendants pursuant to Rule 4(m), and for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). Defendants then filed a renewed motion to stay in the Superior Court, which was granted on December 13, 2017. On February 23, 2018, the Court denied defendants' motion to dismiss for insufficient service of process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On August 23, 2018, the Court granted defendants' motion to dismiss the Securities Act claims. As to the Exchange Act claims, it denied the motion to dismiss without prejudice, and gave plaintiff an opportunity to make a supplemental filing concerning the standing issue; to seek the appointment of a substitute or supplemental lead plaintiff; or to take such other steps as they believe may be proper under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On September 10, 2018, lead plaintiff Yan moved to amend the complaint to add Joanne Geller as a named plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   It is undisputed that Yan purchased his shares on September 15 and 17, 2014. The statements alleged to have violated the Exchange Act were made between February 12, 2015, and February 25, 2016. The only statements, therefore, that Yan could have relied on were those made on or before September 17, 2014-that is, those in the registration statement, which the Court has found did not violate the Securities Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Normally, that would be sufficient to dispose of the Exchange Act claims for lack of standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gross v. Summa Four, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7637051\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/93/987/#p992\">\n    93 F.3d 987\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 992-93 (1st Cir. 1996) (holding that a plaintiff was barred from relying on statements made after he purchased stock in support of his Exchange Act claims, reasoning that the statements \"could not possibly have inflated the market price that he paid for those shares.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Yan contends, however, that he should remain the lead plaintiff in the litigation because his claims are based on a \"common scheme\" with the claims of the class. He further contends that the PSLRA does not require that he have standing to assert the Exchange Act claims. And he has moved to amend the complaint, contending that Geller should be added as a named plaintiff because (1) she has standing to pursue the Exchange Act claims; (2) her claims are not barred by the statute of limitations; and (3) she satisfies Rule 23 requirements of typicality and adequacy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   For the reasons discussed below, Yan does not have standing to assert claims under the Exchange Act, and cannot cure the deficiency by adding Geller as a named plaintiff. The Exchange Act claims (and the complaint) will therefore be dismissed, and the motion to amend will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Whether Lead Plaintiff Has Standing Based on a \"Common Scheme\"\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The first issue is whether Yan has standing to assert claims under the Exchange Act based on a \"common scheme\" to defraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As noted, Yan purchased his shares before, not after, the relevant statements were made and therefore could not have relied on the alleged misstatements. Nonetheless, there is authority providing that class representatives may have standing to assert Exchange Act claims arising from statements made after the share purchase date \"as long as the statements allegedly made were in furtherance of a common scheme to defraud.\"\n   <em>\n    Crowell v. Ionics, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9145317\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/343/1/#p13\">\n    343 F.

Mass. 1987).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The applicability of that principle here, however, is entirely undercut by the manner in which plaintiff structured his complaint. The complaint clearly alleges that the Securities Act claims and the Exchange Act claims are based on different theories: the Securities Act claims are based on an alleged failure to disclose the reason the FDA required the post-market surveillance study, and the Exchange Act claims are based on an alleged failure to disclose the company's difficulties in meeting that requirement. Moreover, as noted, the complaint expressly alleges that plaintiff \"disclaims any reliance upon [the Exchange Act allegations] or incorporation of these allegations in his Securities Act claims.\" (CAC \u00b6 96). And counsel for plaintiff explicitly argued that there were two\n   separate classes-one for the Securities Act claims and one for the Exchange Act claims. (Mot. to Stay Hearing Tr. at 13, 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Accordingly, the alleged omissions are not sufficiently similar to constitute a single \"common scheme\" extending from September 12, 2014, through February 29, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Bristol Pension Fund v.
