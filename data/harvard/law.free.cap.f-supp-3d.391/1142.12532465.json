The Court has carefully considered the Motion [DE 10], the Response [DE 13], the Reply [DE 15], the record in this case, and is otherwise fully advised of the premises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 8, 2019, Defendants removed this case from the Circuit Court of the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit in and for Broward County, Florida to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. [DE 1]. On May 7, 2019, Plaintiffs filed the instant Motion to Remand [DE 10]. The Court has considered the Motion to Remand [DE 10], the Response [DE 13], the Reply [DE 15], and is otherwise fully advised in the premises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   According to the Complaint [DE 1-1], Plaintiffs in this case are Leslie Edgecombe (\"Edgecombe\"), Gabriel Berry (\"Berry\"), and Mark Diab (\"Diab\"). All are citizens of Florida. Defendants are Lowes Home Centers, L.L.C. (\"Lowes\"), a citizen of North Carolina qualified to do business in Florida, and Paul Laurent (\"Laurent\"), a citizen of Florida [DE 1-1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs were all black males employed by Lowes in various management capacities and in various South Florida locations. [DE 1-1]. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants \"together perpetrated a pattern or practice of discrimination with respect [to] employment decisions concerning black store managers and other managers in Broward County, as to which all of the Plaintiffs were victimized.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   There are twelve Lowes stores in the South Florida Market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24. Of the twelve store managers in the market, four were black.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30. In 2013, Lowes replaced the presiding South Florida market manager, the district manager over the twelve South Florida stores, with Jerry Hair (\"Hair\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32. Plaintiffs allege that Hair \"simply did not like blacks and was obsessed with removing them from their leadership positions and ultimately from employment with [Lowes].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33. Plaintiffs allege that Hair, with the support of Lowes, sought to \"eliminate from employment as many black managers as he could in the South Florida market as quickly as he could by creating pretextual reasons for each of their respective terminations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Specifically, Hair began investigating, criticizing, and \"writing-up\" a black store manager at the Sunrise location.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 37, 42. He asked her to voluntarily step down from her position, and when she did not, he eventually terminated her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 44, 47. Hair followed a similar protocol with other black managers in the area. The Coral Springs store had a black manager, Yvon Senat (\"Senat\"), and a black assistant manager, Gabriel Berry; Hair transferred Berry to the Sunrise store because Hair stated there were \"too many black managers\" in the Coral Springs Store.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 103. Berry was eventually fired in\n   September 2015 \"for pretextual reasons.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 180. Senat had a series of negative interactions with Hair and complained of racial discrimination to others within the company, and to the Florida Commission on Human Relations (\"FCHR\"); Senat was fired by Hair on April 16, 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 130.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Diab was hired in March 2014 as a Market Sales Manager for the entire market and filed a charge of discrimination against Lowes in July 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 209. He was terminated in October 2015 despite his high ranking by Lowes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 215.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Edgecombe had been a store manager for about eight years before Hair arrived and began harassing Edgecombe.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 142. Edgecombe filed a charge of discrimination in January 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 176. In August 2015, Hair was transferred out of the South Florida market and replaced by Laurent who continued the same discriminatory practices until terminating Edgecombe in September 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 182, 201.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Each of these plaintiffs allege discrimination and infliction of emotional distress by Lowes, in violation of the Florida Civil Rights Act of 1992 (\"FCRA\").\n   <em>\n    Florida Statutes\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 760.01\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; [DE 1-1] at \u00b6 286. Additionally, they all allege retaliation by Lowes under the FCRA for engaging in the protected activity of complaining about unlawful racial discrimination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 291. Edgecombe alone alleges negligent infliction of emotional distress (\"NIED\") against Lowes and Laurent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 299. All Plaintiffs assert a claim of outrage or intentional infliction of emotional distress (\"IIED\") against Lowes, and Edgecombe asserts this claim against Laurent, as well.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 305. Finally, Edgecombe asserts a claim against all Defendants alleging he was not paid the minimum wage to which he was entitled for the extra hours he worked,\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 311-314, and was retaliated against for his complaints about these wage violations,\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 318. The Complaint sets forth no specific calculation of damages, but only the following general list of damages:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   compensation for past pecuniary losses, including back pay with pre-judgment interest and lost benefits, in amounts to be proven at trial; compensation for future pecuniary losses, including front pay, in amounts to be proven at trial; compensation for non-pecuniary losses, including emotional pain, suffering, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment at work, and humiliation, in amounts to be proven at trial; punitive damages for Defendants' malicious and/or reckless conduct, in amounts to be proven at trial; compensation for lost future earnings capacity; attorneys' fees and costs in this action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    See Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 39-53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants removed to Federal Court alleging diversity jurisdiction. Defendants assert that complete diversity exists based on Edgecombe's alleged fraudulent joinder of Laurent. [DE 1]. Further, they argue that the amount in controversy is exceeded for each plaintiff individually. [DE 1] at \u00b6\u00b6 17-18. Plaintiffs filed the instant Motion to Remand [DE 10] arguing that the federal court does not have diversity jurisdiction, as there was no fraudulent joinder and the amount in controversy has not been proven to exceed $75,000.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams v.
