The Complaint describes a scheme by which Defendants acquired the financial information of subprime customers and made unauthorized debits to their bank accounts to pay for online coupons that went largely unused [Doc. 223 \u00b6 43-45]. The EDP Parties operated this scheme from July 2010 to September 2013 [Doc. 223 \u00b6 25] before selling the operation to the Hornbeam parties, which operated the scheme until June 2016 [Doc. 223 \u00b6 32-33]. Throughout this time, the iStream Parties played an essential role in the scheme, providing payment processing to the other Defendants despite knowing about high return rates for electronic checks and frequent customer complaints [Doc. 223 \u00b6 83-99].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In its Complaint, FTC alleges facts and circumstances which demonstrate the ongoing nature of Defendants' activities. Prior to this current action, the EDP Parties had been under FTC scrutiny in another matter. After resolving the conflict with a stipulated order, the EDP Parties were held in contempt after the court found they violated the order and continued the illegal activity from at least the day of the order [Doc. 223 \u00b6\u00b6 50-53]. Similarly, the EDP Parties settled investigations into their scheme from the states of Oregon and Iowa [Doc. 223 \u00b6\u00b6 142-43, 148, 186], yet continued to operate the scheme. After selling the operation to the Hornbeam Parties, Wilson formed a new company, AdMediary, LLC, which began targeting the financial information of subprime customers and recruiting employees from the EDP Parties and Hornbeam Parties [Doc. 223. \u00b6\u00b6 194-99, 265].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Likewise, after purchasing the operation with full knowledge of its practices and the legal scrutiny that it was under, the Hornbeam Parties continued to operate the scheme and worked to prolong it [Doc. 223 \u00b6\u00b6 225-25, 234-37, 310]. They made fake transactions to mask high return rates, sought a new processing bank, and only stopped the scheme when their replacement bank stopped cooperating [Doc. 223 \u00b6\u00b6 344-45].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Finally, the iStream Parties continued working with the EDP Parties and Hornbeam Parties despite knowing about the high return rates [Doc. 223 \u00b6\u00b6 109, 243, 467-80] and the legal scrutiny [Doc. 223\u00b6\u00b6 476-77, 480]. They helped the Hornbeam Parties find a new processing bank and maintain its relationship with the main processing bank, and they approved accounts the Hornbeam Parties used to mask high return rates [Doc. 223 \u00b6\u00b6 579-83]. Additionally, iStream continues to provide payment processing services to a variety of customers [Doc. 223 \u00b6 594].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In response, the FTC argues that there is an \"internal standard\" component to \u00a7 53(b), emphasizing the \"whenever the Commission has reason to believe\" language of the statute. Additionally, the FTC contends that its factual allegations are sufficient to show that Defendants are about to violate the law if not for government intervention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Third Circuit has recently addressed the pleading requirement under \u00a7 53(b) at the motion to dismiss stage. In\n   <em>\n    FTC v. Shire ViroPharma, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520285\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/917/147/\">\n    917 F.3d 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2019), the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that the FTC must plead facts showing a current or impending violation of the law to survive a motion to dismiss on a \u00a7 53(b) claim. \"We conclude that this language is unambiguous; it prohibits existing or impending conduct. Simply put, [ \u00a7 53(b) ] does not permit the FTC to bring a claim based on long-past conduct without some evidence that the defendant 'is' committing or 'is about to' commit another violation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520285\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/917/147/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520285\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/917/147/\">\n    at 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, the Third Circuit did not address the merits of the FTC's internal standard argument. \"The FTC also asserts that [ \u00a7 53(b) ]'s 'reason to believe' language confers upon it unreviewable discretion to file suit.... We decline to consider this argument because the FTC failed to raise it in the District Court.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520285\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/917/147/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520285\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/917/147/\">\n    at 159, n.17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the Third Circuit went on to doubt the persuasiveness of the argument because there was \"no evidence to support the FTC's 'reason to believe' [defendant] is violating or about to violate the law,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520285\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/917/147/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520285\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/917/147/\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   the differing circumstances of the instant case lead this Court to a different conclusion. Here, the FTC has raised the internal standard argument, and the Court finds it persuasive because the FTC has pled at least some facts to show that it had \"reason to believe\" that Defendants were \"about to violate\" the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Shire ViroPharma\n   </em>\n   , the Third Circuit emphasized the \"about to violate\" language of \u00a7 53(b) when rendering its opinion, finding that this language is unambiguous,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520285\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/917/147/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520285\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/917/147/\">\n    at 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and that \"[the statute] means what it says.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520285\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/917/147/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520285\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/917/147/\">\n    at 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(Emphasis added). The standard established in \u00a7 53(b) is not necessarily an objective one. If there was some information to suggest that the FTC's motive for filing suit was merely vindictive, or if the Complaint did not contain any factual allegations from which to infer that the law was about to be violated, then the FTC would clearly lack a \"reason to believe\" and dismissal would be proper. Here, however, the FTC has alleged facts about past bad behavior which includes a pattern of reoccurrence. Thus, the Complaint sets forth at least some facts to support a reasonable inference that the behavior will reoccur in the future in the absence of preliminary injunctive relief. At this stage of the litigation, the FTC has pled sufficient facts to state a plausible claim under \u00a7 53(b) and to survive the Defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
