COOPER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The 34-day government shutdown that began in December 2018 and ran through most of January 2019 disrupted the lives of hundreds of thousands of federal employees and countless others who depend on their services. Families missed paychecks, furloughed workers were forced to moonlight, and critical public functions were curtailed after unpaid civil servants called in sick. All of those effects were entirely predictable. But the shutdown also had myriad other, more surprising consequences. One of them even threatened the country's most treasured libation: beer. This case shows how.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Under federal law, any brewer who wishes to ship an alcoholic beverage in interstate commerce must first submit for regulatory approval the labels it will affix to its containers. If a brewer forgoes the pre-approval process and ships a container anyway, it risks criminal prosecution. The government shutdown, however, effectively put the regulator out of business, stalling the approval process for any labels already in the pipeline. District of Columbia-based craft brewer Atlas Brew Works had a few such labels, including one for a perishable pale ale, \"The Precious One,\" that Atlas had already brewed. Without label approval, The Precious One sat waiting in an Atlas fermenting tank, rather than flowing freely at area watering holes. This pinched the company's bottom line and left its expectant customers in the lurch. But it also, Atlas said, constituted a First Amendment violation: a law that prohibits speech without regulatory approval becomes an outright ban on speech when the approval process is shuttered. As Atlas puts it, \"[i]t cannot be denied the right to speak for lack of meeting an impossible condition.\" Am. Compl. at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   So Atlas filed suit on January 15, 2019-24 days into the shutdown. It sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction preventing the Justice Department from prosecuting Atlas for proceeding with its labels without pre-approval.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 3. Given Atlas's request for expedited review, the Court ordered the government to promptly reply\n   and held a hearing on the matter. Within days of that hearing, the Court was poised to issue a ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   But then, on January 25, the shutdown ended. Just a few days later, The Precious One label was approved, and Atlas was once again able to speak via its beer labels without the fear of prosecution. With Atlas no longer suffering an immediate and potentially irreparable injury, the Court denied as moot Atlas's motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order, ECF No. 13. The government asked the Court to go a step further, dismissing the entire case as moot. Atlas countered that the case was not moot and, in any event, that it fit within the capable-of-repetition-yet-evading-review exception to the ordinary mootness rule. It argued that another shutdown would likely come, and that when it did, Atlas would suffer a similar injury. The Court reserved judgment on that question and ordered the parties to fully brief it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The government has since followed up with a motion to dismiss focused exclusively on the mootness question. Because the shutdown that started this dispute has ended and the likelihood of the same injury recurring is too speculative, the Court finds the case moot and will grant the government's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

If the TTB, for some reason, did not shutter its operations and continued processing COLA applications, the so-called policy Atlas challenges would not even be implicated.

The government contends that there are too many hypothetical events that would have to coincide for this case to count as reasonably likely to recur. In its view, at least four events would have to occur-at the same time-for the alleged wrong Atlas suffered during the last government shutdown to recur. MTD at 18, 20. Three are out of Atlas's hands altogether; the last would depend on what Atlas does, and when it does it. The first three are that another appropriations lapse would have to occur, that lapse would have to affect the Treasury, and the Treasury would have to respond to the lapse in the same way it did during the last shutdown. As for what Atlas must do for this grievance to recur, it must seek a COLA approval either right before the shutdown begins or while it is ongoing. The government says there is no reasonable expectation that each of those contingencies will be satisfied simultaneously.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court agrees. Closer examination of each of the contingencies, with relevant case law providing a useful barometer, confirms that Atlas's capable-of-repetition argument is more conjecture than reasonable expectation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    1.

After all, as Atlas documents, there have been 20 federal \"funding gaps\" since FY 1977.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp., Ex. B, Congressional Research Service,\n   <em>\n    Federal Funding Gaps: A Brief Overview\n   </em>\n   (February 4, 2019) (\"Opp., Ex. B\"), ECF No. 24-3, at 2. But Atlas must point to more than just a lapse in appropriations or \"funding gap.\" It needs a lapse that actually results in a government shutdown, and that shutdown must last long enough to hinder the processing of one of Atlas's COLA labels. Yet about half of the 20 funding gaps that have occurred since FY 1977 were so brief-three days or fewer in duration-that they \"do not appear to have resulted in a 'shutdown' \" at all.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10537649,5676494\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/915/699/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And while the most recent lapse caused a shutdown that lasted 34 days, that was the longest by 13 days; only seven of the 20 shutdowns have lasted 10 or more days, and only two have stretched beyond 20.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Even so, the Court agrees with Atlas that there is at least a \"reasonable expectation\" that a shutdown will occur again in the foreseeable future.\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306141\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/478/#p481\">\n    455 U.S. at 482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306141\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/478/#p481\">\n    102 S.Ct. 1181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There have been two extended funding gaps in this decade alone-16 days in 2013 and 34 days in 2018-19-and this nation's otherwise long history of budget impasses indicates still more lie ahead. Satisfying this threshold contingency, however, takes Atlas's capable-of-repetition argument only so far.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    The shutdown has to affect the Treasury Department, and Treasury must shutter the TTB.\n   </em>\n   The Court takes the next two contingencies together. Even assuming a future appropriations lapse is likely to recur, the lapse would have to affect the Treasury Department, and Treasury would have to respond to a funding gap in the same way it did the last time around. As the government explains, \"[n]ot all lapses in appropriations necessarily affect all agencies.\" MTD at 18;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Opp., Ex. B at 4 (\"[W]hen most of these funding gaps occurred, one or more regular appropriations measures had been enacted, so any effects were not felt government-wide.\").

It is true that the TTB stopped processing COLA applications during the last shutdown, but it is equally true that not all appropriations lapses, including the last one, affect all federal entities, and that Treasury remains free to tinker with its response to a future shutdown,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Reply to Opposition (\"Reply\"), ECF No. 26, at 6 (citing OMB guidance stating that requires agencies \"to re-evaluate and update their contingency plans\").

But as counsel for Atlas surely understands, the cases Atlas cites in support of that proposition all involve the voluntary-cessation exception to mootness, not the capable-of-repetition exception. These are two discrete analytical frameworks. The former holds that a defendant cannot unilaterally moot a case simply by ceasing his current conduct, because that would \"leave the defendant free to return to his old ways.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Atlas is of course correct that the government's mere suggestion in this case that the Treasury might handle the next shutdown differently does none of those.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   But that is not the issue that confronts the Court. This case involves the capable-of-repetition exception to mootness, and that means it is\n   <em>\n    Atlas\n   </em>\n   's burden to show\n   that the conduct it complains about here is\n   <em>\n    likely\n   </em>\n   to recur, not the government's to show it\n   <em>\n    absolutely cannot\n   </em>\n   recur. However \"worthless\" the mere prospect of reform might be for purposes of the voluntary-cessation exception, that prospect provides still further reason to doubt that the injury that spawned this case will recur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Atlas would have to seek a COLA immediately before a shutdown began, or during it.\n   </em>\n   That leaves one final hurdle to this dispute's recurrence. Even if a lapse in appropriations occurs, even if the lapse affects the Treasury Department, even if the shortfall persists long enough to cause a shutdown of Treasury's operations, and even if Treasury responds to the shutdown by ceasing COLA processing, Atlas has to hold up its end of the bargain: it must have a COLA application that needs processing at the time all of the above events occur. The TTB's track record reveals that it processes COLA applications rather quickly; although processing time fluctuates, it appears to take TTB about two to three weeks to approve or deny a COLA application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Janet M. Scalese (\"Scalese Decl.\"), ECF No. 14-1,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   \u00b6 4 (average processing time of 18 calendar days for malt beverages in February 2019); Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, \"Processing Times for Label Applications\" (July 22, 2019),\n   <em>\n    https://www.ttb.gov/labeling/processing-times.shtml\n   </em>\n   (average processing time of 24 calendar days on July 22, 2019). Thus, if Atlas does not file a COLA application close in time to when a future shutdown begins, or file one during the pendency of the shutdown, its First Amendment rights still would not be implicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Atlas tries hard to minimize this contingency. It maintains that it \"applies for COLAs at a rate of one every 11 days, and it takes approximately 3 weeks to process a COLA.\" Opp. at 28;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Justin Cox (\"Cox Decl.\"), ECF No. 24-1,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   \u00b6 9 (stating Atlas applied for 34 COLAs in 2018). Given those numbers, Atlas says it \"almost always needs at least one COLA\" and \"there is all but a mathematical certainty that a COLA shutdown will leave at least one of Atlas's applications hanging.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520401\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/918/151/#p157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court sees it differently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   First of all, while the Court does not doubt that Atlas sought 34 COLAs in 2018, the brewer's every-11-days statistic is misleading. Atlas arrived at that number by dividing 365 by 34, but Atlas's own declaration makes clear that Atlas seeks COLAs in fits and spurts, not at regular intervals throughout the calendar year. For example, Atlas applied for three other COLAs on the same day it applied for The Precious One COLA that precipitated this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cox Decl. \u00b6 16; Cox Decl., Ex. A., ECF No. 24-2, at 3. It applied for another six COLAs on the same day, December 11, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cox Decl., Ex. A at 2-3. The brewer's lumpy application pattern meant that it had long dry spells in 2018 without having a single COLA pending-including for 34 days (coincidentally, the same length of the recent record shutdown) from February to March,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 (rows 52-53), and for 55 days from April to May,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (rows 54-55). It should therefore come as no surprise that, when the government filed its initial motion to dismiss on February 26, 2019, Atlas had no pending COLA applications, and indeed did not file another until March 12, 2019.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 (rows 80, 87). These facts belie Atlas's contention\n   that \"there is all but a mathematical certainty that a COLA shutdown will leave at least one of [its] applications hanging.\" Opp. at 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In addition, the relatively brief duration of most appropriations lapses, combined with the short time it takes TTB to process a COLA application, also lessens the likelihood that an Atlas COLA application will be left at sea during a hypothetical shutdown. Funding gaps, as the Court highlighted earlier, are historically very short-so short, in fact, that they often do not cause a \"shutdown\" at all.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp., Ex. B, at 2, 5. Even when a shutdown does occur, it has rarely stretched beyond a week or two.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And because the TTB processes COLAs so quickly-about two to three weeks-that means Atlas must file for a COLA within about 20 days of a shutdown's onset for that COLA's processing to be affected and for Atlas's alleged First Amendment injury to arise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Scalese Decl. \u00b6 4. True, Atlas could also file for a COLA\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   a shutdown has begun, but there again, the short duration of shutdowns makes that a slim possibility. (Unless, of course, Atlas were to deliberately wait to file a COLA until a shutdown has begun, about which more will be said later.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   To recap the boxes that must be checked for this dispute to recur: a lapse in appropriations must happen; the lapse must affect the Treasury Department; the lapse must last long enough to actually cause a shutdown; Treasury must respond to the shutdown by shuttering the TTB's COLA processing; and Atlas must have a COLA application pending at the time the shutdown begins or file one shortly thereafter. In the Court's view, the combination of these contingencies takes this case beyond the limits of the capable-of-repetition exception to mootness. The Court grants that, if only two or three of these events had to coincide for the alleged wrong to recur, the Court would be facing a different question and might well come to a different conclusion. For it is not hard to imagine another appropriations lapse causing a government shutdown, just as it is easy to predict that Atlas will continue to need COLAs so long as it remains in business. But this case will not again present a live controversy unless each and every potentiality discussed here happens, and happens at the right time. Stretching the capable-of-repetition exception to cover this chain of contingencies would permit the exception to swallow the rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <em>\n    2.

Supp. 3d 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.D.C. 2014), which arose out of the 2013 shutdown and involved, like this case, an alleged First Amendment violation. The plaintiff, Father Ray Leonard, worked as a Catholic chaplain at the naval submarine base in Kings Bay, Georgia. When the government shut down, Father Leonard was told that he could not perform his \"ecclesiastical duties, even voluntarily,\" which Leonard said violated his rights under the First Amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (\"RFRA\").\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339714\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/38/99/#p104\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339714\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/38/99/#p104\">\n    at 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . One day after Father Leonard filed suit, in which he sought both injunctive and declaratory relief, the defendants told him that \"he (and other chaplains like him) would be permitted to continue working during the shutdown.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339714\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/38/99/#p104\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   After the shutdown ended and the Defense Department\n   moved to dismiss the suit as moot, Father Leonard contended, among other things, that the First Amendment injury he suffered fit into the capable-of-repetition exception to mootness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Judge Huvelle disagreed. She reasoned that \"there are simply too many contingencies that would need to occur simultaneously\" to be capable of repetition, namely:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   (1) the government would need to shut down once again, (2) it would need to exclude payment for chaplains from any temporary funding schemes; (3) Father Leonard, who works on year-to-year contracts, would need to continue to serve at the Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay as a chaplain, and (4) the Navy would need to apply the Anti-Deficiency Act so as to limit chaplains' religious activities despite the express decision not to do so at the end of the most recent government shutdown.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339714\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/38/99/#p104\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339714\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/38/99/#p104\">\n    at 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The D.C.

The government calls it \"[t]he most relevant precedent directly on point,\" MTD at 21; Atlas says it is \"readily distinguishable\" and thus \"unavailing,\" Opp. at 32. The key distinction, according to Atlas, is the fourth contingency highlighted by Judge Huvelle-the fact that the Navy already made the \"express decision\" not to \"limit chaplains' religious activities\" during the shutdown. Opp. at 33 (citing\n   <em>\n    Leonard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339714\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/38/99/#p104\">\n    38 F. Supp. 3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   106 ). Because the Navy allowed Father Leonard to continue performing his ecclesiastical duties during the last shutdown, it was improbable that Navy would stop him from doing so during any future shutdown. That, Atlas says, stands in stark contrast to the facts presented here, where the TTB has twice stopped processing COLA applications during government shutdowns, has twice allegedly infringed brewers' free speech rights, and has never made an \"express decision\" to avoid that alleged First Amendment harm during any prior shutdown.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339714\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/38/99/#p104\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Atlas is right that this feature of\n   <em>\n    Leonard\n   </em>\n   weakened the plaintiff's capable-of-repetition argument. Atlas also correctly notes the absence of that feature here, which would seem to attenuate\n   <em>\n    Leonard\n   </em>\n   's relevance to this case. But Atlas overlooks the fact that another contrast between this case and\n   <em>\n    Leonard\n   </em>\n   cuts the other way, making this case a comparatively weaker candidate for the capable-of-repetition exception. In\n   <em>\n    Leonard\n   </em>\n   , a single-day shutdown-provided the government told Leonard he could not perform his duties-would\n   <em>\n    guarantee\n   </em>\n   the recurrence of his First Amendment injury, so long as he remained a Navy chaplain. Here, by contrast, a First Amendment deprivation would occur only if Atlas, in addition to remaining in business, had filed a COLA application close in time to the shutdown's onset or filed one after the shutdown began. Said another way, the contingency in the\n   <em>\n    plaintiff\n   </em>\n   's control was much more certain in\n   <em>\n    Leonard\n   </em>\n   than it is here. To create a ripe First Amendment dispute, all Father Leonard would have to do if the government-side contingencies were satisfied is keep his job, while Atlas would have to take a particular action at a particular time to do the same. And given Atlas's history of going long stretches without filing for a COLA,\n   that is no minor obstacle. Thus, the factual differences that exist between this case and\n   <em>\n    Leonard\n   </em>\n   merely cancel one another out; they do not augur in favor of a different result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In any event,\n   <em>\n    Leonard\n   </em>\n   is but one chapter in an anthology of consonant cases, many of which do not have the distinguishing feature Atlas highlights in\n   <em>\n    Leonard\n   </em>\n   . Consider, for instance,\n   <em>\n    American Federation of Government Employees v. Rivlin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"208568\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/995/165/\">\n    995 F. Supp. 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.D.C. 1998), on which\n   <em>\n    Leonard\n   </em>\n   relied. In\n   <em>\n    Rivlin\n   </em>\n   , government employees, represented by unions, sought a declaratory judgment that the federal government could not force them to work without pay during a shutdown.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"208568\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/995/165/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"208568\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/995/165/\">\n    at 165-66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The defendants argued the case had been mooted by the passage of the 1996 budget, and plaintiffs answered that the dispute remained live under the capable-of-repetition exception.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"208568\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/995/165/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"208568\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/995/165/\">\n    at 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Judge Sullivan rejected plaintiffs' argument and dismissed the case. \"It would be entirely speculative for this Court to attempt to predict if, and when, another lapse in appropriations may occur, how long that lapse might be, which agencies might be subject to the lapse, which employees might be affected, and whether employees will be required to work without compensation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"208568\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/995/165/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That holding, too, was affirmed by the D.C. Circuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am. Fed'n of Gov't Employees, AFL-CIO v. Raines\n   </em>\n   , No. 98-5045,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1998%20WL%20545417\">\n    1998 WL 545417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. Cir. July 15, 1998). Although the opinion affirming\n   <em>\n    Rivlin\n   </em>\n   was unpublished, and therefore is not binding precedent, it is notable that the D.C. Circuit found the issue \"so clear as to warrant summary action.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The very same government-side contingencies that\n   <em>\n    Rivlin\n   </em>\n   found too remote are present in this case. A funding gap must occur; it must have an impact on the Treasury; it must last long enough to result in a shutdown of at least some Treasury activities; and Treasury must again choose to pause the processing of COLA applications. And, as the Court explained in its discussion of\n   <em>\n    Leonard\n   </em>\n   , this case contains an additional contingency-the plaintiff taking a particular action at the right time, as opposed to simply maintaining a certain status-that provides further reason to doubt the likelihood of recurrence. Atlas counters that\n   <em>\n    Rivlin\n   </em>\n   cannot guide the analysis in this case because the court there \"did not fully review the history of shutdowns, and obviously, was not in a position to consider the many shutdowns that have occurred since.\" Opp. at 33. But that argument addresses just one of the contingencies-the likelihood of a shutdown-which this Court has already explained stands as the lowest hurdle for Atlas in this case. Atlas has no answer for the remaining hurdles that\n   <em>\n    Rivlin\n   </em>\n   identified and that stand in its way here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The government also urges on the Court, among other cases,\n   <em>\n    Alaska v. Jewell\n   </em>\n   , No. 13-cv-34,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%203778590\">\n    2014 WL 3778590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Alaska July 29, 2014), and\n   <em>\n    Foster v. Carson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9050426\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/347/742/\">\n    347 F.3d 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2003). Both are instructive. In\n   <em>\n    Jewell\n   </em>\n   , involving the 2013 federal shutdown, the district court rejected the plaintiff's argument that a national wildlife refuge would be closed during the next hypothetical shutdown because \"the only fact in the record before the Court that suggests a refuge closure may happen again is the fact that it happened once.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%203778590\">\n    2014 WL 3778590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. For support,\n   <em>\n    Jewell\n   </em>\n   cited\n   <em>\n    Foster\n   </em>\n   , a case involving an Oregon budget shortfall, which also rejected a capable-of-repetition argument because \"the only fact in the record ... that supports [the likelihood of recurrence] is that it happened once.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9050426\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/347/742/\">\n    347 F.3d at 748\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Atlas contends that both\n   <em>\n    Jewell\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Foster\n   </em>\n   are inapposite because the plaintiff there \"lacked evidence that previous shutdowns have ever created the same injury.\" Opp. at 34. But the plaintiffs in those\n   cases had essentially what Atlas has here: an allegation that it was injured during the immediately preceding shutdown. The only difference is that the TTB has stopped processing COLA applications\n   <em>\n    twice\n   </em>\n   (in 2018-19 and 2013) as opposed to just\n   <em>\n    once\n   </em>\n   (although Atlas was not affected by the 2013 shutdown).\n   <em>\n    Jewell\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Foster\n   </em>\n   yield no indication the result would have been different with one additional data point about the government's track record. They therefore remain useful guideposts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The cases Atlas has offered, meanwhile, are not much help. The case Atlas says is \"[d]irectly on-point,\"\n   <em>\n    Pratt v. Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3755280\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/770/539/\">\n    770 F. Supp. 539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Cal. 1991), is anything but. That case involved a class-action challenge to the state of California's refusal, due to a budget impasse, to provide benefits pursuant to the state's Aid to Families with Dependent Children (\"AFDC\") program.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3755280\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/770/539/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3755280\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/770/539/\">\n    at 540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The impasse ended, but the court held that the dispute remained live because it was capable of repetition.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3755280\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/770/539/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3755280\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/770/539/\">\n    at 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court had good reasons for doing so, but many of those reasons are absent here. For one thing, the government-side contingencies appeared far less speculative. At the time plaintiffs filed suit, California had failed to \"timely adopt[ ] a budget in five of the last eight years\" and the same plaintiff class had previously been denied AFDC benefits during a shutdown.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3755280\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/770/539/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But more important for present purposes is what the\n   <em>\n    Pratt\n   </em>\n   court did not discuss: the plaintiff-side contingencies. Chief among these, plaintiffs were a class, and ostensibly one that would\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   have eligible members. No matter when the next California budget crisis occurred, it seems reasonable to assume there would always be some residents affected by a stoppage of AFDC benefits. The facts here are different. Even after the government-controlled conditions are satisfied-a funding lapse affecting Treasury long enough to cause a shutdown, and Treasury carrying out the same contingency plan it did the last time-Atlas, and Atlas alone, would have to file for a COLA at just the right time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    Biggs v. Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3827563\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/828/774/\">\n    828 F. Supp. 774\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Cal. 1991), which Atlas also cites, is even further afield. There, the 1990 California budget impasse caused the paychecks of plaintiffs, California Department of Transportation employees, to be delayed, and the employees alleged this violated the Fair Labor Standards Act's prompt-payment requirement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3827563\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/828/774/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3827563\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/828/774/\">\n    at 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Biggs\n   </em>\n   , however, makes for a poor fit with this case. For starters, neither the word \"mootness\" nor the phrase \"capable of repetition\" even appears in the decision. Therefore, while\n   <em>\n    Biggs\n   </em>\n   may have remarked on the likelihood of another California budget impasse, it was clearly not doing so under the rubric that controls the Court's inquiry in this case. What's more, beyond the possibility of a funding gap alone, the\n   <em>\n    Biggs\n   </em>\n   court discusses exactly none of the contingencies that animate the Court's capable-of-repetition analysis here.\n   <em>\n    Biggs\n   </em>\n   is inapposite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   So what does this comparison to relevant case law reveal? It shows that this case is far closer factually to the cases where courts have declined to find shutdown-contingent disputes capable of repetition than it is to the few cases that have concluded otherwise. This case sits comfortably alongside\n   <em>\n    Leonard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Rivlin\n   </em>\n   , and other decisions holding that shutdown-related disputes are not sufficiently capable of repetition. The very same contingencies those district courts (and the D.C. Circuit) found too speculative are present in this case, and they point to the same conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   But there is one other feature of this case that makes it even less suited to the capable-of-repetition exception than any that the parties have cited or that the\n   Court has uncovered: the fact that Atlas, to some extent, can control whether or not a hypothetical future shutdown causes them any injury at all. As alluded to earlier, Atlas is to some extent free to choose when to seek COLA approval. Indeed, in planning the release of new beers, Atlas admits that it \"builds in ... three weeks for TTB approval.\" Cox Decl. \u00b6 12. Combined with the fact that speculation regarding an impending shutdown begins well in advance of the actual event, that means Atlas can possibly avoid, or at least mitigate, the harm caused by a future shutdown-and it makes the chasm between this case and Atlas's favored authorities wider still. In cases like\n   <em>\n    Pratt\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Biggs\n   </em>\n   , there was nothing the plaintiffs could do to avoid the legal wrong in the event of another state shutdown, save for relinquishing their entitlement to benefits in\n   <em>\n    Pratt\n   </em>\n   or quitting their jobs in\n   <em>\n    Biggs\n   </em>\n   . They could not, for example, demand an advance on their benefits or pay that would obviate the pain of the shutdown; Atlas can, however, accelerate their COLA process if a shutdown seems likely. This is, of course, not to say that the blame for any potential First Amendment deprivation or economic harm caused by a future shutdown should lie exclusively, or even primarily, at the feet of Atlas. But it is to say that, to the extent Atlas genuinely wishes to avoid a First Amendment injury and any concomitant business loss, it could plan the COLA process with an eye toward any looming shutdown. That Atlas has at least some ability to avoid the alleged injury that gave rise to this lawsuit, and that Atlas might rationally try to do so, further lessens the likelihood that it will recur. That is the final reason why this case does not present the sort of \"exceptional situation[ ]\" fit for the capable-of-repetition exception.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Los Angeles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298204\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/95/#p109\">\n    461 U.S. at 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298204\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/95/#p109\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1660\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   As the passage of time can skunk a beer, so too can it spoil a lawsuit. Atlas came to this Court because it believed the government shutdown resulted in a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   ban on protected speech and because it feared that The Precious One's purgatory might become a permanent loss. When the government turned the lights back on, however, Atlas regained its ability to speak via its labels, and The Precious One was liberated from Atlas's tanks. Despite the brewer's protestations that it will likely suffer the same harms in the future, the Court sees too many contingencies that would have to coincide for that to happen. As a consequence, this case is now moot, and the Court therefore must dismiss it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
