In addition, the record contradicts petitioner's contentions and thus, he has failed to overcome procedural default. First, the plea agreement states that Aponte-Ramos \"acknowledges that no threats have been made against him and that he is pleading guilty freely and voluntarily because he is guilty.\" (Criminal No. 13-294, Docket No. 91 at p. 9.) Second, at the change of plea hearing Aponte-Ramos\n   stated under oath that no one had attempted in any way to force him to sign the plea agreement, that no one had made any promise or assurance to him of any kind in an effort to induce him to sign the plea agreement and, that he was pleading guilty of his own free will because he was guilty. (Criminal Case No. 13-294, Docket No. 107 at pp. 13-14.) Third, at the Change of Plea hearing the Court went thoroughly over the two counts he was pleading guilty to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   THE COURT: The plea agreement is ordered filed and taken under advisement to be considered by the Court in sentencing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Mr. Aponte, you're charged in Count One that on August 27, 2012, here in Puerto Rico, you and another co-defendant, aiding and abetting each other, took a 2009 Toyota Yaris, with Puerto Rico license plate HJT-043, Vehicle Identification Number JTB -- JTDBT923291310170, a car that had been transported, shipped and received in interstate or foreign commerce, from the person or in the presence of an individual by the name of L.R.Q. by force, violence and intimidation, with the intent to cause death and serious bodily harm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   As to Count One, is that what you did?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   THE COURT: ...

(emphasis ours)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Aponte-Ramos represented to the Court that he was pleading guilty knowingly and voluntarily. At no time during the change of plea hearing did Aponte-Ramos give any indication that he was being threatened or coerced into pleading guilty. Quite the contrary, he admitted to every element of the offenses charged and did so in an intelligent and voluntary manner, with full knowledge of the consequences of his guilty plea. (Criminal Case No. 13-294, Docket No. 107 at p. 20.) Therefore, petitioner's claim that he was \"scared into pleading guilty to possession of a weapon\" is meritless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Claim of unconstitutional sentence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Petitioner claims that his sentence was \"unconstitutional\" and the only specific contention he indicates is that his sentences should run concurrently instead of consecutively.

(Civil Docket No. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Court recognizes that\n   <em>\n    pro-se\n   </em>\n   litigants are entitled to a liberal construction of their pleadings which are held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers. Nevertheless, while\n   <em>\n    pro-se\n   </em>\n   litigants are held to less stringent standards, their motions must meet certain fundamental requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
