On July 23, 2015, Miller was banned from all New York City Housing Authority (\"NYCHA\") property, effective August 17, 2015, including the Hammel Houses project in Far Rockaway, Queens. Defs.' R. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, Dkt. 43; Akina Decl. Ex. B, Dkt. 44-2. On August\n   22, 2015, five days after the ban had become effective, at around 8:30 p.m., Miller, his friend Edward Fields, and two other men entered Fields's car parked on Rockaway Beach Boulevard, a public street running along the southern boundary of Hammel Houses. Defs.' R. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 6; Miller Dep. at 69-71, Sullivan Decl. Ex. 1, Dkt. 47-1, Akina Decl. Ex. C, Dkt. 44-3. Shortly after Fields started driving, the car was pulled over by Officer Terrillion, who arrested Miller and took him to the 100\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   precinct. Defs.' R. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 8; Pl.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. at 1, Dkt. 46; Sullivan Decl. Exs. 2-4, Dkts. 47-2-47-4. The resulting criminal complaint charged Miller with criminal trespassing in the third degree under New York Penal Law \u00a7 140.10 (E), for unlawful entry into a public housing project. Sullivan Decl. Ex. 2. In September 2015, Miller received an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal on the trespassing charge. Compl. \u00b6 18. Notwithstanding, the devil is in the details, since the motion turns on whether Miller, just prior to his arrest, actually entered upon the property of NYCHA's Hammel Houses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A district court must grant summary judgment if \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Defs.' Reply Mem. at 5. But, defendants' argument skips a step; they have failed on this motion to show the absence of a disputed issue of material fact. Reduced to the raw, Miller testified at his deposition that he never entered NYCHA property when he was visiting the area near the Hammel Houses, providing a detailed account of the route he says he took from nearby Dayton Towers to his friend's car-an account that flat-out contradicts the statement provided by Officer Terrillion which is the sole basis for the trespassing charge.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Miller Dep. at 67-73, 80,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Terrillion Dep. at 20-27, 31, 34, 48-49, Akina Decl. Ex. D, Dkt. 44-4, Sullivan Decl. Ex 5, Dkt. 47-5. Significantly, moreover, while Officer Terrillion suggests that video surveillance\n   footage was taken at Hammel Houses on the night Miller supposedly trespassed, defendants have offered no video evidence to corroborate Officer Terrillion's account. Terrillion Dep. at 71. Thus, there are two competing tales with no objective corroboration. Such disputes of fact, hinging on witness credibility determinations, must be resolved by a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Furthermore, despite the movant's burden to show the absence of a genuine dispute of material fact, Officer Terrillion's police reports, if anything, do the opposite. The reports contain at least one misstatement-incorrectly listing the address where the alleged offense took place. Sullivan Decl. Exs. 3-4; Terrillion Dep. at 60-61. Worse yet, the professed error found its way into the criminal complaint that Officer Terrillion reviewed and swore upon penalty of perjury was accurate. Sullivan Decl. Ex. 2; Terrillion Dep. at 64-67. The police reports, moreover, give different descriptions regarding the offense location, with one report describing it as Hammel Houses and the other as a \"public sidewalk\" abutting Hammel Houses. Sullivan Decl. Exs. 3-4. Since the primary factual dispute concerns whether Miller entered NYCHA property or he passed by it on a public sidewalk, this discrepancy is material. Although Officer Terrillion testified at his deposition that, in the course of his patrol, he watched Miller crossing Hammel Houses, he also answered \"no\" in completing the police report query regarding whether the incident was \"visible by patrol\". Terrillion Dep. at 23-25, 31; Sullivan Decl. Ex. 4. Therefore, viewing these facts in the light most favorable to the non-movant, Officer Terrillion's account of events is inconsistent with the police reports he prepared upon penalty of perjury then forwarded to prosecutors, and which became the basis for the criminal complaint against Miller. It supports a due process claim that Miller was denied the opportunity of a fair trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Keller v. Sobolewski\n   </em>\n   , No. 10-CV-5198 (FB)(RML),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%204863228\">\n    2012 WL 4863228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (E.D.N.Y.

Defendants readily concede, though, that Miller may be able to pursue an equal protection claim under multiple potential theories, but protest that Miller fails to choose one and support it with any record evidence of racial profiling. Defs.' Reply Mem. at 6-8. Boldly going further, defendants, in fact, contend that Miller's claim reflects race animus of its own, since it \"essentially asks the Court to conclude either that every police action with a black male is racially motivated, or that [Officer] Terrillion committed misconduct based on the color of [Officer] Terrillion's skin-the very definition of racial profiling.\" Defs.'

Miller, more specifically, seeks to incorporate the\n   <em>\n    Floyd\n   </em>\n   record here, particularly the evidence \"establishing that NYPD officers stop blacks and Hispanics with less justification than whites resulting in a discriminatory effect and motivated by a discriminatory purpose\".

The argument, plaintiff points out, is consistent with the fact that the \"occupants of the vehicle in which Plaintiff was arrested were all young black males,\" while Officer Terrillion and \"all other officers who participated in the stop were all white.\" Pl.'s Opp'n Mem. at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In counterpoint to plaintiff's proposed shortcut to liability, the rules of practice require litigants to develop their own case records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 (c)(1)(A) (\"A party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must support the assertion by ... citing to particular parts of materials in the record\"); Local Civ. R. 56.1(d) (\"Each [factual] statement ... must be followed by citation to evidence which would be admissible, set forth as required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\"). Naturally, a court may consider the legal principles underpinning\n   <em>\n    Floyd\n   </em>\n   to the extent they are relevant, but it must apply them to the facts of the pending case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Those principles are to be applied to a record\n   <em>\n    developed\n   </em>\n   during pre-trial discovery, not one embellished selectively by facts taken from another litigation.

Given the intertwined nature of the facts underlying the false arrest and fair trial claims, there is little risk that defendants have taken discovery in defense of the former that does not also aid their defense of the latter. At bottom, permitting the claim to go forward in the streamlined Count Two is more than amply justified, since the Court finds defendants received adequate notice of plaintiff's fair trial claim for falsification of evidence.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Plaintiff's in other \u00a7 1983 actions brought in New York federal courts have attempted to rely on the facts found in\n    <em>\n     Floyd\n    </em>\n    in the absence of their own record evidence, typically in support of\n    <em>\n     Monell\n    </em>\n    claims.
