BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff, Lisa M. Davenport, initially filed this action against defendant Ray Mabus,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the former Secretary of the Department of the Navy, after she was removed from her position as Supervisory Security Specialist at the Navy Depot in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On October 31, 2016, plaintiff filed an amended complaint, (Doc. 11), which asserted two counts, namely, an appeal from the February 19, 2015 final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\"MSPB\") affirming the decision of the Administrative Judge (\"AJ\") finding that the Navy properly removed her from her position for physical inability to perform her job and denying her affirmative defense of failure to accommodate, Count I, and a disability discrimination claim under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (\"RA\"),\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n     29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Count II.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, in Count I, plaintiff alleges that her civil service rights were violated and that she was discriminated against by the Navy for failing to reasonably accommodate her medical conditions under the RA. This count presents a \"mixed case\" because it combines a civil service claim with a claim under a federal antidiscrimination law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 14, 2017, the court granted plaintiff's motion to sever Count I and stated that it would decide the claims in Count I before addressing Count II. (Docs. 30 &amp; 31). The court also continued the stay of discovery regarding Count II until it decides Count I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The administrative record was then filed and the parties filed briefs regarding Count I. (Docs. 34, 40 &amp; 41).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For the following reasons, the court will\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRM\n   </strong>\n   the decision of the MSPB and enter judgment for the defendant with respect to Count I of plaintiff's amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. MATERIAL FACTS\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff transferred from the New Cumberland Army Depot to the Navy in 2006, as a Security Specialist for Naval Supply\n   Systems Command Weapon Systems Support (\"NAVSUP WSS\") at the Navy Depot in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania. In this position, plaintiff was eligible for situational telework. There is no dispute that plaintiff had medical conditions dating back to 2001, including Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Plaintiff's WSS supervisor, Michael Zinski, had approved her as eligible for situational teleworking allowing her to work from home on occasion when she experienced \"flare-ups\" of her Lyme disease, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, and Fibromyalgia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff testified that she was sick with her stated medical conditions since 2001, and that the nature of her conditions was such that she had rare flare-ups of extreme exhaustion and fatigue, but that the flare-ups were not a constant thing. She stated that from 2001 to the end of 2012, her flare-ups were minimal in duration, i.e., \"a couple of days, maybe a week or so, possible two weeks.\" (AR 84-87).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On August 28, 2011, plaintiff was promoted to the position of Supervisory Security Specialist at the Naval Support Activity (\"NSA\"), Commander Navy Region Mid-Atlantic (\"CNRMA\") at the Navy Depot in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania. Following the functional realignment of security from NAVSUP WSS to CNRMA, plaintiff was not eligible for situational telework since the equivalent Security Supervisor positions across the other fifteen CNRMA installations were ineligible for telework and, since CNRMA had not adopted a telework agreement at the time of the functional realignment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Supervisory Security Specialist for NSA was \"the Security Director for one of the Naval Activities that comprise[d] Regional Security Directorate, Public Safety Program, Commander, Navy Region Mid-Atlantic.\" As Supervisory Security Specialist, plaintiff's duties included being responsible for \"physical security, Antiterrorism/Force Protection (\"AT/FP\") and law enforcement\", and responsible to \"develop[ ] and implement[ ] policies and procedures for the protection of property, facilities, operations, or material from unauthorized disclosure, misuse, theft, assault, vandalism, espionage, sabotage, or loss.\" As such, plaintiff managed the NSA Mechanicsburg Security Program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Also, plaintiff was \"the senior advisor to the Installation Commander [ ] of the [NSA], Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania on all phases of law enforcement, anti-terrorism/force protection, and physical security operations.\" Additionally, plaintiff was responsible for supervising and directing a Naval Security Force of thirty-eight civilians at the Navy Depot in Mechanicsburg.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff also had \"frequent face-to-face and telephone contact with senior military and high ranking civilian government officials within [the Navy], Joint Chief of Staffs, and [the Department of Defense (\"DOD\") ] charged with force protection/anti-terrorism responsibilities,\" including the Commanding Officer, Executive Officer, subordinate staff and other installation program managers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Moreover, in her position, plaintiff had to have access to the Department of Defense's Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (\"SIPRNET\"), and DOD Instruction (\"DODI\") 1035.01 directed that access to SIPRNET by the Navy could not occur from alternative worksites, such as an employee's home, due to security considerations. Additionally requirements of plaintiff's position was that she had to attend classified security briefings, which could be held with little advance notice, and to coordinate responses to security incidents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On October 31, 2012, plaintiff notified her chain of command, namely, Thomas Tyree, Deputy Director for Operations,\n   CNRMA, Charles Hargraves, Site Manager for NSA Mechanicsburg, and Seth Farris, Operations Manager for NSA Mechanicsburg, that she was experiencing a \"reactivation of her [L]yme disease\", and, as a result, that she may be requesting leave for partial days, full days or extended leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On January 1, 2013, plaintiff requested that she be allowed to telework. In support, she submitted two letters from her treating physician, Dr. Seltzer. The doctor indicated that he was treating plaintiff for active Lyme disease, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Fibromyalgia. Dr. Seltzer also noted that plaintiff's conditions \"may result in symptoms including extreme pain and fatigue, which at worst [may] leave her completely incapacitated.\" Dr. Seltzer stated that the symptoms may require plaintiff to \"miss work, follow a modified schedule, work from home, etc.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Consequently, on January 7, 2013, plaintiff sent an email to her chain of command and requested an alternative work schedule that combined half days, telework and leave, stating that it would allow her to attend medical appointments that were \"necessary to continue to diagnose and treat\" her conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On January 11, 2013, plaintiff submitted a formal request to telework.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff's first-level supervisor, Tyree, conducted an interactive dialogue, regarding her accommodation request for telework, with plaintiff, Farris and Carrie Hawk, EEO Specialist. Tyree recommended the disapproval of plaintiff's request for telework on January 18, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On January 23, 2013, Dr. Seltzer sent the Navy a letter responding to a request for more information regrading plaintiff's need to telework. He stated that it was difficult to predict the duration of her current symptoms, but that it was reasonable to assume they \"will last another 4-6 weeks, if not longer.\" Dr. Seltzer also stated that telework \"will assist in [plaintiff's] work as physical activity takes a severe toll on her, and anything that can be done to limit her exertion will allow [plaintiff] to work more effectively.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On January 23, 2013, Tyree forwarded plaintiff's request for situational telework to CNRMA Chief of Staff, Captain Mary Jackson, the approving official. Tyree recommended that plaintiff's request be denied for several reasons, to wit: (1) plaintiff failed to provide adequate medical documentation; (2) Security Directors, such as plaintiff, had to report to the office to meet with subordinate staff and command management; (3) Security Directors could only access SIPRNET at the office, in accordance with DOD rules, to change the Force Protection levels; and (4) the Total Workforce Management System indicated that the Security Director position was ineligible for telework.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On February 4, 2013, Jackson denied plaintiff's request for situational telework.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On March 1, 2013, Farris sent plaintiff a letter notifying her of the denial of her request for an accommodation in the nature of teleworking. In particular, Farris advised plaintiff that he could not provide her with an accommodation that would \"enable [her] to perform the essential functions of [her] job or any other available position within the command.\" Ferris' letter also stated that his decision was supported by the medical documentation provided by Dr. Seltzer as well as plaintiff's own telework request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff did not return to work for the Navy after March 1, 2013, due to her medical conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On March 10, 2013, plaintiff sought a reconsideration of the denial of her situational telework request stating that her\n   position was \"administrative,\" not \"supervisory,\" and that she could perform the essential functions of her job from home. In support of her telework request, Dr. Garabedian, another one of plaintiff's treating physicians, advised the Navy that he was treating plaintiff for infections, \"uncontrolled hypertension\", and gastrointestinal problems. He also stated that due to her conditions and an exacerbation of her symptoms, she was unable to perform her job description and would require two weeks of leave.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On March 31, 2013, Dr. Garabedian wrote a letter to the Navy indicating that plaintiff's condition had \"greatly deteriorated\" over the preceding months, and he requested that the Navy provide plaintiff with six to eight weeks of leave in order for her to recover.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff's request for reconsideration was denied on April 5, 2013, by Hargraves. In his denial letter, Hargraves stated that he expected plaintiff to perform the essential functions of her Supervisory Security Specialist position, which he described, in pertinent part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   forty hours of work per week; the ability to put eyes on security incidents [on site] and provide directions [to] staff; direct and supervise the security force; monitor day-to-day security operations; respond to incidents that require higher authority guidance; the ability to keep command staff informed; participation in face-to-face meetings at a moment's notice to represent command interests from both security and tenant commands; frequent face-to-face meetings with senior military and high ranking civilian officials, as well as security briefs, conferences, meetings and working groups, and some of the meetings require a secure location which may only be accomplished at the duty station.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (AR 399-400).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Additionally, in his letter, Hargraves indicated that plaintiff's prior telework agreement was executed with NAVSUP WSS, and not CNRMA, and that CNRMA had appropriately denied her request based on Region Telework Policy. Hargraves also pointed out that no other Region Security Specialist position was eligible for situational telework, and that plaintiff's position was re-coded to be consistent with other CNRMA positions and the Region Telework Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On April 29, 2013, Dr. Garabedian sent another letter to the Navy advising it that plaintiff's condition had again \"greatly deteriorated\", and he requested that the Navy give her an additional six to eight weeks of leave so that she could rest at home in order to stabilize her condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On April 30, 2013, Dr. Garabedian sent the Navy an FMLA medical certification stating that plaintiff was not \"able to perform work of any kind.\" Subsequently, Dr. Garabedian concluded that plaintiff could only tolerate up to four hours of teleworking from home subject to frequent reassessments, and he submitted an explanation to the Navy for the plaintiff's work limitations he recommended. In particular, the doctor opined that a \"return to [plaintiff's] regular employment schedule, with the associated physical and mental stressors,\" would have severely compromised \"her health and potentially cause a new major setback.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On June 17, 2013, Dr. Garabedian again sent a letter to the Navy stating that plaintiff's condition had not changed and that she would require an additional six to eight weeks of leave from work before\n   returning in order to stabilize her condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On July 17, 2013, Dr. Garabedian sent yet another letter to the Navy requesting that the Navy give plaintiff an additional six to eight weeks in order to stabilize her condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Thus, the record reveals that plaintiff's medical condition did not improve since March 1, 2013, and her prognosis in July of 2013 was that she could not return to work until the end of August or September of 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On August 8, 2013, Farris sent plaintiff a \"Notice of Status,\" due to her continued absence from work since March 1, 2013. The Notice stated, in pertinent part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   While I am concerned about your health and well-being, I must also be concerned with the efficiency of work operations as well. Your inability to maintain a regular work schedule as the Security Director is contrary to the agency's mission. If your return to full-time work is not foreseeable in the near future, then your position needs to be filled with someone who is available to work on a full-time basis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   The position you encumber is critical to this Command and it is imperative that you report for work no later than\n   <strong>\n    9 September 2013\n   </strong>\n   , at which time your entitlement to approved leave expires. If you fail to do so or if you are unable to resume and maintain your full-time schedule, I shall propose your removal because your continuing absence is creating a hardship that this Command can no longer endure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On August 26, 2013, Farris sent plaintiff a Notice of Proposed Removal and stated that it was proposed plaintiff be removed from her position effective September 27, 2013 due to her inability to perform as a result of her medical condition. (AR 173). The Notice contained a Specification of the Charge, which stated, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   The medical evidence that you have provided shows that you have permanent medical conditions. Because of these medical conditions, you have not been able to return to work or fulfill the requirements of your position since 1 March 2013. Your position is one that needs to be filled and this action will promote the efficiency of the service.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On September 10, 2013, plaintiff responded through her attorney to the Notice recognizing that her medical condition prevented her from performing her assigned work, but requesting that the Navy consider reasonable accommodation for her condition, including telework, reassignment to another position, and the approval of leave until she could return to her job. However, there was no indication that plaintiff's condition had improved. (AR 199).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On September 20, 2013, Hargraves issued a Notice of Decision sustaining the charge of inability to perform due to a medical condition, denying plaintiff's request for telework, and removing plaintiff from her position with the Navy effective September 27, 2013. (AR 175-176).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   On October 28, 2013, plaintiff filed an appeal of her removal with the MSPB, but it was dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiff then re-filed her appeal with the MSPB on July 21, 2014. An Administrative Judge (\"AJ\") then conducted a hearing on November 6, 2013, and November 10, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   At plaintiff's hearing before the AJ, Dr. Garabedian corroborated plaintiff's testimony that she had minimal disability from her medical conditions based on the history she gave him, and stated that she was relatively stable until she experienced a\n   \"sudden breakdown around 2013.\" Dr. Garabedian also stated that while plaintiff was capable of teleworking in January of 2013 when she first requested CNRMA to allow her to do so, she was not capable of teleworking at the time of the hearing based on the deterioration of her condition since January of 2013. He also stated that he completed the FMLA certification in April of 2013 indicating that, at that time, plaintiff was unable to perform work of any kind, but he explained that he did so since the Navy did not approve plaintiff's request to telework and he believed that if plaintiff went back to work without the accommodation her condition was going to be made worse. (AR 135-139).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   On November 13, 2014, the AJ issued an Initial Decision affirming plaintiff's removal from her position with the Navy. The AJ found that neither permanent, full-time telework nor situational telework was a reasonable accommodation for plaintiff. Specifically, the AJ found that: (1) the Navy had proven its charge of plaintiff's inability to perform her job as a result of a medical condition; (2) plaintiff had failed to prove her affirmative defense of disability discrimination despite the fact that she was an individual with a disability since she could not perform all essential functions of her position due to her medical conditions even with reasonable accommodation rendering her as not a \"qualified individual\"; and (3) the penalty of removal was reasonable and promoted the efficiency of the Navy's service.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   On December 17, 2014, plaintiff appealed the AJ's Initial Decision to the MSPB by filing a Petition for Review (\"PFR\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   On February 19, 2015, the MSPB issued a Final Decision denying plaintiff's mixed case appeal challenging her removal and the denial of her defense of failure to accommodate and, affirming the AJ's Initial Decision. In particular, the MSPB found that the AJ was correct in sustaining the Navy's charge of removal due to plaintiff's inability to perform her job based on the essential functions of her position as Supervisory Security Specialist, and that he correctly denied plaintiff's affirmative defense of disability discrimination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In finding that the Navy properly removed plaintiff from her position, (AR 351), the MSPB concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   [plaintiff] was unable to perform the core duties of her position and that her continued absence from work not only negatively impacted her performance, but also had an adverse effect on the agency. We thus concur with the [AJ] that the agency proved the elements of its charge, and we find it uncontroverted that there exists a nexus between [plaintiff's] medical condition and her absence from employment. Similarly, based on the nature of [plaintiff's] medical conditions and diagnosis, we agree with [AJ] that reassignment was neither reasonable nor feasible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The MSPB also found that the AJ correctly decided that plaintiff failed to establish disability discrimination citing to the plaintiff's medical records, including Dr. Garabedian's opinion that, as of February 2013, plaintiff was medically incapacitated and unable \"to perform work of any kind\", as well as the doctor's subsequent continued\n   opinions that plaintiff was unable to work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   On March 23, 2015, plaintiff appealed the MSPB's Final Decision to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\"). She argued that the MSPB erred since it failed to apply the proper test to determine whether she was a \"qualified\" employee with a disability regarding her disability discrimination defense, and that it erred by applying the wrong analysis to her request for telework, i.e., it applied an essential function analysis as opposed to an undue hardship analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   On February 19, 2016, the EEOC issued a decision affirming the MSPB's Final Decision. The EEOC concurred with the decision of the MSPB that plaintiff \"did not demonstrate that she was subjected to discrimination or denied a reasonable accommodation.\" The EEOC concluded that the MSPB's Final Decision was a \"correct interpretation of the laws, rules, regulations, and policies governing [the] matter and [was] supported by the evidence in the record as a whole.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   On March 23, 2016, plaintiff filed a timely appeal of the MSPB's Final Decision with this court. (Doc. 1). She then filed her amended complaint on October 31, 2016. (Doc. 11). As relief, plaintiff requests this court to reverse the MSPB's Final Decision and to reinstate her to her former position of Security Director with back pay and front pay. Plaintiff also requests compensatory damages for emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In Count I, plaintiff alleges that her removal from the Navy violated the civil service law and the RA. In Count II, she alleges a disability discrimination claim under the RA. As such, this is a \"mixed case.\" As the court previously stated, (Doc. 30 at 3), \"[a] 'mixed case' exists when the plaintiff's claim alleges she was subjected to a serious adverse employment action, one encompassed by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, and that such action was at least partially motivated by unlawful bias in violation of federal antidiscrimination laws.\" When a federal employee brings a mixed case, i.e., asserts a discrimination claim together with a civil service appeal from a decision of the MSPB, judicial review lies in the district court.\n   <em>\n    Perry v.

She also states that the Navy failed to prove that it was unable to reasonably accommodate her sometimes disabling medical conditions. Plaintiff points out that her medical conditions are not always disabling, and that they are only disabling when they flare-up, which is why she was previously approved for situational telework at her prior position as Supervisory Security Specialist with NAVSUP WSS.
