The Act also grants certain rights for \"applicants\" to participate in this process.

Both the Association and the Service have moved for summary judgment. For the following reasons, the Court finds that the Service's denial decision was reasonable.

Section 402.02 defines \"applicant\" as \"any person, as defined by section 3(13) of the Act, who requires formal approval\n   or authorization from a Federal agency as a prerequisite to conducting the action.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   But what is \"the action?\" Is it the action that the person needs a permit to do\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   is it the action that the agency is consulting on? In other words, is it fishing or the continued operation of the Fishery? The regulation's own definition of \"action\" does not dispel the confusion. It defines \"action\" broadly as \"all activities or programs of any kind authorized, funded, or carried out, in whole or in part, by Federal agencies in the United States or upon the high seas.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20402.02\">\n    50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Clearly, fishing is\n   <em>\n    an\n   </em>\n   action that is authorized by federal agencies. But is it\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   action? In short, the regulation's definition of applicant is ambiguous in this circumstance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Second, the Service's interpretation is reasonable. Under its view, an applicant is a person seeking, or who has sought, a permit from an agency, and that agency's approval of that permit is the subject of the consultation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R. 2. Applicant status, thus, is unavailable for programmatic consultations because those consultations relate to broad programs rather than specific permits.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20402.02\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Service's Handbook defines \"programmatic consultation\" as a consultation \"addressing an agency's multiple actions on a program, regional or other basis.\" U.S. Fish and Wildlife Serv. &amp; Nat'l Marine Fisheries Serv.,\n   <em>\n    Endangered Species Consultation Handbook: Procedures for Conducting Consultation and Conference Activities Under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act\n   </em>\n   (\"the Handbook\") (1998), at xvii. True, the Act itself does not distinguish between programmatic and individual consultations, but the Service's dichotomy here is rationale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Consider the alternative. The Association suggests that an applicant in this context is a person who needs a permit to fish. But everyone, the Court presumes,\n   <em>\n    needs\n   </em>\n   a permit to fish lawfully. The Association's proposed interpretation of \"applicant\" has no clear limiting principle. It is certainly reasonable for the Service to require a link between a person's required authorization and the subject of the specific consultation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The roles and responsibilities of an applicant, as outlined in both the Act and the regulation, confirm the limited scope of \"applicant.\" For instance, the regulations require the Service to use the applicant in identifying reasonable and prudent alternatives that both the agency and the applicant can take to avoid jeopardizing species.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20402.14\">\n    50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(5). In the context of a permit application for a specific project, the importance of the applicant's expertise is obvious given the applicant's knowledge of its own project. But for a programmatic consultation, a lone permittee likely would not have expertise for identifying reasonable and prudent alternatives applicable for an entire regulatory scheme or program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   True, the Association represents all large U.S. flag purse seine vessels in the Fishery, and so it can plausibly claim relevant knowledge in this programmatic review. But the regulations and the Handbook govern all consultations, including programmatic reviews where there is no comparable association and thousands of potential applicants.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2018%2C706\">\n    82 Fed. Reg. 18,706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that there are 1,335 limited access permits under the Northeast Multispecies Fisheries Management Plan). Reasonable interpretations of regulations must account for the varied areas in which they apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   More, both the statute and the regulations require that applicants consent to extensions of the consultation deadline longer than 60 days.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201536\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20402.14\">\n    50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). This power to consent (or not) to extensions\n   makes sense when there is an individual applicant whose proposed project cannot begin until completion of consultation. But for programmatic consultations with dozens or even thousands of applicants, it is hard to imagine how the Service would manage all the competing interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Still more, the preamble to the final rule for the Section 7 regulations (\"the Preamble\") accords with the Service's position. There, the Service specifically declines to amend the definition of \"applicant\" to allow participation in consultations about the promulgation of regulations governing permit issuance because an applicant \"is involved in the consultation process as a result of a specific permit or license application.\" 51 Fed. Reg. at 19,930. A permit applicant instead \"may provide input regarding its concerns in the Federal agency's rulemaking process through the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 551\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Preamble thus underscores that \"applicant\" status is limited to consultations on specific permit or license applications and unavailable when the agency is consulting on broader regulatory programs, such as the promulgation of regulations about permit issuance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Both the Association and the Service insist that the Service's Handbook supports their positions. The Handbook explains that the action agency, here the Service, determines applicant status and coordinates with the applicant during the consultation process. Handbook at 2-12, 2-13. It then says:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   Users of public resources (e.g. timber companies harvesting on National Forests) are not parties to programmatic section 7 consultations dealing with an agency's overall management operations, including land management planning and other program level consultations. However, users who are party to a discrete action (i.e., where they are already the successful bidder on a timber sale that becomes the subject of later consultation or reinitiation when a new species is listed or new critical habitat is designated) may participate as applicants in the section 7 process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Handbook 2-12. The Association argues that the Handbook treats companies with logging authorizations as applicants for later consultations implicating those authorizations. Pl.'s Br. at 39-40. On the other hand, the Service emphasizes that the Handbook explains that these companies are not parties to programmatic consultations dealing with \"overall management operations.\" Defs.' Br. at 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   While the Handbook is no model of clarity, the Service's gloss is certainly reasonable. The Handbook says that timber companies cannot participate in a programmatic consultation on forestry management, but they may participate on a \"discrete action.\" For instance, they have applicant status when they are already successful bidders on a timber sale that becomes the\n   <em>\n    subject\n   </em>\n   of a later consultation. Putting aside the text's confusing parentheticals, the Handbook is drawing a distinction between overall management reviews in the first sentence, in which applicants cannot participate, and reviews of\n   discrete actions in the second sentence, in which they may. Here, the subject of the consultation is not a discrete act: it is the general operations of the Fishery. While the Handbook may be susceptible to other readings, the Service's interpretation is reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Courts should not reward agencies for drafting deliberately opaque regulations that they can clarify to their advantage in subsequent litigation, but nor should courts demand crystal clarity from bureaucrats who did not anticipate the implications of unintended regulatory nuances. The Service's reading of the Handbook is plausible on its face and consistent with the other available governing documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In sum, the Service offers a fair interpretation of a genuinely ambiguous regulation. The Court is careful not to defer to a merely \"convenient litigating position\" or \"\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   rationalization advanced\" to \"defend past agency action against attack.\"\n   <em>\n    Christopher v.

National Marine Fisheries Service\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    HLA\n   </em>\n   \"), another court in this District concluded that the Service's interpretation of \"applicant\" was \"a post-hoc rationalization\" because it found no evidence that the issue was considered before the litigation.

April 25, 2002). Not so here. First, the Service offered the same interpretation of \"applicant\" in its reasoned letter to the Association before litigation began. A.R. 1-3. Similarly, the Service's position matches its (unsuccessful) litigating position in\n   <em>\n    HLA\n   </em>\n   in 2002, and it tracks with its Handbook that it issued in 1998. In short, the Service's interpretation reflects its \"fair and considered judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kisor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12620765\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/2400/\">\n    139 S.

The Assistant Administrator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries reviewed the Regional Administrator's decision denying the Corporation applicant status.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R. 10. And the Regional Administrator signed the denial decisions. A.R. 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Service's interpretation also stems from its expertise in both managing fisheries and in administrating the Act and the related treaties. For example, the Service issues regulations to implement and enforce the South Pacific Tuna Treaty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   16 U.S.C. \u00a7 973b. Similarly, based on its authority under the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Convention Implementation Act, the Service is responsible for promulgating regulations to enforce the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission's directives.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206901\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 6901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300\">\n    50 C.F.R. \u00a7 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Subpart O. The Service serves an important role in ensuring that the United States meets its obligations under international law. For all these reasons, the Court\n   will defer to the Service's interpretation of its own regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Given that deference, it follows that the Service's decision was not arbitrary or capricious. The Service provided a reasoned denial decision that explained and applied the relevant law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Throughout its briefing, the Association urges the Court to follow\n   <em>\n    HLA\n   </em>\n   . Pl.'s Br. at 32-33. But as discussed above, the\n   <em>\n    HLA\n   </em>\n   court found that the Service had proffered a post-hoc rationalization and, as such, its interpretation of \"applicant\" was entitled to less deference.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002%20WL%20732363\">\n    2002 WL 732363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7.

A.R. 205-6.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    The Service extended the consultation in December 2017, A.R. 433, and again in May 2018, A.R. 457-58.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    The Preamble also provides that \"[t]he definition in the proposed rule broadly defines 'applicant' as 'any person who requires formal approval or authorization from a Federal agency as a prerequisite to conduct the action.' \" 51 Fed. Reg. at 19,930. The Association emphasizes the Preamble's use of the word \"broadly,\" insisting that the Service intended \"applicant\" to be read broadly.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Br. at 24. But the Preamble goes on to explain that by \"broadly\" it means that \"applicant\" includes \"those seeking permits, licenses, leases, letters of authorization, and any other form of authorization or approval.\" 51 Fed. Reg. at 19,930.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    The Association suggests that the Service has changed its interpretation of \"applicant\" during litigation. Pl.'s Reply Br. at 11-12. The Association insists that the Service is engaged in some type of \"game playing.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 12. Not so. In its briefing here, the Service is merely clarifying why it denied the Association's specific request. At most, the Service is attempting to be more precise. Any daylight between the interpretations is small given that the Association itself admits that its arguments against this so-called new interpretation remain the same.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Reply Br. at 12 (explaining that \"the same deficiencies identified in the [Service's] old interpretation set forth in its denial decision apply to its new interpretation\"). In any event, the Court's focus is on the Service's denial decision itself, not positions taken in litigation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
