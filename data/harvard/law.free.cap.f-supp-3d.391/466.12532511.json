Because Plaintiffs have a viable FLSA claim, however, I may still exercise pendent jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' state-law claim. I will thus also deny BBUSA's request for summary judgment on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, I will deny BBUSA's Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    AND NOW\n   </strong>\n   , this 12th day of August, 2019, upon consideration of Defendant's Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 62), Plaintiffs' Response in Opposition (Doc. No. 66), and Defendant's Reply (Doc. No. 69), and all related submissions, it is hereby\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendant's Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 62) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    AND IT IS SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
