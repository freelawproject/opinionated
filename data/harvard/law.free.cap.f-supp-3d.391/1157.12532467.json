Like the Florida Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit, the\n   <em>\n    Lou Fusz\n   </em>\n   court concluded that \"it is clear that Congress viewed violations of the Act as 'private nuisances' and as 'invasions of privacy' under ordinary, lay meanings of these phrases.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9175288\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/401/876/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9175288\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/401/876/\">\n    at 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Florida Supreme Court has held that the words \"arising out of\" in an insurance policy are unambiguous and absolute in scope.\n   <em>\n    Taurus Holdings, Inc. v. U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8903974\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/913/528/#p532\">\n    913 So. 2d 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 532-33 (Fla. 2005). In\n   <em>\n    Taurus Holdings\n   </em>\n   , the Court recognized that \"[t]he term 'arising out of' is broader in meaning than the term 'caused by' and means 'originating from,' 'having its origin in,' 'growing out of,' 'flowing from,' 'incident to' or 'having a connection with.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8903974\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/913/528/#p532\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, applying the definition of \"arising out of\" in\n   <em>\n    Taurus Holdings\n   </em>\n   to the Policy language here, if the\n   <em>\n    iCan Action\n   </em>\n   or its causes of action, expressly or by incorporation, originated from, grew out of, flowed from, or merely\n   <em>\n    had a connection with\n   </em>\n   any actual or alleged invasion of privacy, the Claim is not covered under the Policy. Based on the allegations in the\n   <em>\n    iCan Action\n   </em>\n   , the Court finds that such a nexus does exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Coupling the case law cited above that interprets TCPA violations as invasions of privacy with Florida's broad interpretation of \"arising out of,\" the Court finds that the TCPA violations at issue here\n   <em>\n    arise out of\n   </em>\n   an invasion of privacy and therefore are excluded from coverage under Exclusion B.4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, the underlying complaint in the\n   <em>\n    iCan Action\n   </em>\n   explicitly states that the class action plaintiffs' privacy was invaded by the violative texts, so the Court need not determine whether TCPA violations are\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   invasions of privacy, but instead concludes that on the facts before this\n   Court, the Invasion of Privacy Exclusion would apply. Accordingly, there are at least some parts of the underlying class action that are excluded from coverage by virtue of the B.4 Exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Court must next consider whether the entire\n   <em>\n    iCan Action\n   </em>\n   is excluded from coverage or whether just those aspects of the underlying case that involve invasion of privacy are excluded. Here, \"Claim\" is specifically defined by the Policy as \"a civil proceeding against any Insured commenced by the service of a complaint or similar pleading.\" DE 56-1, 15, \u00a7 III, as amended by Endt. 11. Liberty argues that the defined term \"Claim\" is thus the entire underlying civil proceeding, not to be confused with the undefined word \"\n   <em>\n    c\n   </em>\n   laim,\" or its common-use derivatives, such as \"harm,\" \"damages,\" \"causes of action\" or the \"separate allegations of wrongful conduct in a complaint.\" Regardless of whether the Court interprets \"Claim\" as referring to the entire action or just to individual counts contained within the Complaint, the Claim(s) all arise out of TCPA violations that invaded the class action plaintiffs' privacy. Throughout the underlying Complaint, Plaintiffs expressly alleged invasion of privacy as a basis for their lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 111-3, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 16, 28, 39, &amp; 63. Plaintiffs further represented that the\n   <em>\n    iCan Action\n   </em>\n   was \"premised on violations of the TCPA, which caused actual harm to the Plaintiffs' class in the form of aggravation and nuisance and invasion of privacy.\" DE 16, 6. Plaintiffs also concede in their Statement of Facts that the \"pertinent allegations\" for the relief sought in the underlying Class Action include \"actual harm and cognizable legal injury\" caused by \"invasions of privacy that result from the sending and receipt of such text messages....\" DE 107, \u00b6 3(b). Thus, the Claim - however defined - includes allegations that the\n   <em>\n    iCan\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs suffered the harm of invasion of privacy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Court concludes that the Policy's broad exclusion barring coverage for Claims arising out of an actual or alleged invasion of privacy precludes coverage here entirely. This is true regardless of whether Claim is viewed as the entire\n   <em>\n    iCan Action\n   </em>\n   as a whole or as separate Claims for each cause of action. As a result, the Liberty Policy provides no coverage for the\n   <em>\n    iCan\n   </em>\n   settlement agreement, for which Plaintiffs seek indemnification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Allocation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In the alternative, even if the broad definition of Claim did not preclude coverage over the entirety of the underlying action, Plaintiffs have failed to allocate the settlement agreement between covered and uncovered claims as required by Florida law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Florida law is well-settled that the party seeking coverage for a settlement has the burden of proving that the settlement is covered under the insurance policy.\n   <em>\n    Bradfield v.

Jan. 23, 2012). In this case, Plaintiffs do not identify a promise that Liberty made to the insureds, on which they relied to their detriment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Contrary to Plaintiffs' assertion, the Court finds that Liberty timely notified their insureds of the various coverage issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. SOF, \u00b6\u00b6 35-41 (\"As set forth in the Reservations of Rights Letter, the denial of coverage for iCan's claim was based upon the Invasion of Privacy Exclusion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. The Reservation of Rights Letter explained that because the claim was 'based upon allegations that [Plaintiffs'] privacy rights were violated by the Insured sending unsolicited text messages, Exclusion B.4 is applicable and shall serve to exclude coverage for this matter in its entirety.\"). Having been expressly informed of the various coverage issues, including the invasion of privacy exclusion, the\n   <em>\n    iCan\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs and Plaintiffs here nonetheless proceeded with an unallocated settlement, to their peril. The Court concludes that estoppel does not apply in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   For all of the reasons stated above, the Court finds that there is no coverage in the Liberty Policy over the\n   <em>\n    iCan Action\n   </em>\n   , and Plaintiffs cannot recover the settlement or defense costs of that action. The\n   <em>\n    iCan Action\n   </em>\n   is excluded from coverage by\n   virtue of the invasion of privacy exclusion in Exclusion B.4. This exclusion bars coverage for the entire action based on the expansive definition of \"Claim\" in the Policy, and in the alternative, based on the Plaintiffs' failure to allocate the underlying settlement agreement. In light of the Court's findings above, the Court need not reach Liberty's additional arguments regarding the B.3 Exclusion. Nor must the Court reach Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment, as the Court has concluded that there is no coverage for the\n   <em>\n    iCan Action.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, summary judgment is granted in favor of Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   It is hereby\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED AND ADJUDGED\n   </strong>\n   as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   1.
