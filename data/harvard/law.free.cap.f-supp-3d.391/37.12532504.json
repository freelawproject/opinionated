McFADDEN, U.S.D.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   A young tourist suffered every commuter's nightmare when his foot and then hand were mangled in an escalator at the Smithsonian Metrorail Station in Washington, D.C. Teman Chow and his parents sued the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (\"WMATA\"), which owns and operates the station, alleging various negligence claims. WMATA has moved to dismiss the Chows' Complaint in part, arguing that several of their claims are time barred or barred by sovereign immunity. For the reasons below, the Court will grant in part and deny in part WMATA's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   According to the Complaint, in the summer of 2012, then-14-year-old Teman Chow and his family traveled from their home in Canada to vacation in Washington, D.C. Compl. \u00b6 12, ECF No. 1. After touring the National Mall one evening, the Chows boarded an escalator at the Smithsonian Metrorail Station.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. At the bottom of the escalator, Teman's sandal and foot got caught between the escalator stair and the bottom comb plate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. The escalator continued to run even though his foot was stuck, causing him severe pain.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Teman instinctively reached down to try to free his foot.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. But things only got worse. As Teman tried to rescue his foot, the teeth of the comb plate impaled his hand, which also became trapped between the escalator's still-rotating stairs and the comb plate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. Even with his foot and hand lodged between the escalator stairs and the comb plate, the escalator continued to function at full power, grinding away at Teman's foot and hand.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. No automatic safety shutoff mechanism ever engaged.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16, 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Meanwhile, Teman's parents watched in horror.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. His father tried to activate the emergency stop button, but the escalator did not stop.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Eventually, another WMATA customer alerted the station manager who stopped the escalator, while other customers called 9-1-1.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Emergency medical technicians arrived, but they were unable to remove Teman's hand from the comb plate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. They ultimately removed the entire comb plate, still clenched to Teman's hand.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23-24. They rushed Teman to National Children's Hospital, and doctors treated him for a severe foot injury and multiple severe injuries to his hand, which the doctors termed a \"de-gloving.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Chows allege that Teman's injuries stem from WMATA's negligence in its operation and maintenance of the escalator.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. First, they assert that the escalator was in disrepair.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. The bottom comb plate, they claim, was missing at least three teeth, and those missing teeth allowed his sandal and foot to become trapped.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 61-67. And, according to them, the escalator's safety systems were not functioning properly.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47b. A comb-step impact device should cut power to the escalator if an object becomes trapped between the comb plate and the rotating steps, and an emergency stop button should stop the escalator when pushed.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35. But the Chows allege that neither of these systems activated properly during the incident.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20, 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   According to them, WMATA knew that the escalator's safety systems were malfunctioning.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39. Indeed, they claim that just a day before the incident, WMATA inspected the escalator and determined that the \"comb plate, steps, and up-thrust safety devices\" were not in good condition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38. And an inspector recommended that WMATA replace the broken comb plate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Even so, WMATA allowed customers to ride the escalator, unwarned of the danger lurking beneath their feet. The Chows allege negligence claims, including negligent maintenance, failure to warn, and negligent infliction of emotional distress.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43-89. They also seek punitive damages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 90-92.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   WMATA has moved to dismiss three of the Chows' claims under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). Def.'s Mot to Dismiss, ECF No. 13. First, it argues that Teman's parents' claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress is time barred. Def.'s Mem. in Supp. of Mot to Dismiss (\"Def.'s Mem.\") at 4-5, ECF No. 13-1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Chows now concede as much. Pls.' Mem. in Opp'n to Mot. to Dismiss (\"Pls.' Opp'n\") at 3, ECF No. 14-1. Next, WMATA argues that sovereign immunity bars the claims for negligent training and punitive damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 7-11, 16-18. Teman agrees that his punitive damages claim cannot proceed and affirmatively states that he has not brought a claim for negligent training. Pls.' Opp'n at 3, 13. The Court will therefore grant WMATA's motion as to these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Finally, according to WMATA, sovereign immunity bars Teman's claim for failure to warn. Def.'s Mem. at 11-16. But for the reasons below, the Court will deny WMATA's Motion to Dismiss that claim and grant Teman jurisdictional discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"[S]overeign immunity claims are jurisdictional.\"\n   <em>\n    Burkhart v.

The court rejected the government's argument that its decisions implicated engineering, aesthetic, and fiscal concerns, and were thus fraught with public policy considerations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3616113,7413555\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/45/445/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3616113,7413555\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/45/445/\">\n    at 451-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the Park Service had \"chosen to manage the road in a manner more amenable to commuting through nature than communing with it\" and already had several signs along the stretch including the dangerous curve, the court found that the discretionary function exception was inapplicable to the decisions not to post warning signs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3616113,7413555\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/45/445/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This case's path through the discretionary function test \"morass\" is currently unclear.
