Safeway responded by removing the suit to this Court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.

Safeway contends that the ADA may not be used as the basis of a negligence\n      <em>\n       per se\n      </em>\n      claim for personal injury and that Samuels includes no other statutory basis for the\n      <em>\n       per se\n      </em>\n      action.

Under D.C. law, a negligence\n      <em>\n       per se\n      </em>\n      plaintiff must \"(1) identify a particular law or regulation designed to promote safety, (2) show that the plaintiff is a member of the class to be protected by the statute, and (3) show that the statute imposes specific duties of care and protection on the defendant.\"\n      <em>\n       Blake v.

Supp. 2d 141\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , 150 (D.D.C. 2013). The question in this case turns on the second element, namely whether Congress enacted the ADA to protect people in Ms. Samuels's position. The Court finds that because the ADA has neither a primary nor partial purpose of protecting people with disabilities from physical injury, it did not. Therefore, it will grant Safeway's motion for judgment on the pleadings with respect to Samuels's negligence\n      <em>\n       per se\n      </em>\n      claim.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-17\">\n      A brief examination of the ADA and case law interpreting it reveals that the ADA does not have a public-safety purpose that can provide the statutory linchpin for a negligence\n      <em>\n       per se\n      </em>\n      claim. The Court begins with the statute itself. Title III of the ADA expressly identifies its various purposes:\n     </p>\n     <p class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-19\">\n      (1) to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities;\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-20\">\n      (2) to provide clear, strong, consistent, enforceable standards addressing discrimination against individuals with disabilities;\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-21\">\n      (3) to ensure that the Federal Government plays a central role in enforcing the standards established in this chapter on behalf of individuals with disabilities; and\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-22\">\n      (4) to invoke the sweep of congressional authority, including the power to enforce the fourteenth amendment and to regulate commerce, in order to address the major areas of discrimination faced day-to-day by people with disabilities.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-23\">\n      <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012101\">\n       42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (b). Nowhere does the ADA mention the creation or promotion of safety measures. Instead, as \u00a7 12101(b) makes clear, the ADA's relentless focus is on the elimination of discrimination.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-24\">\n      The Supreme Court has confirmed this understanding of the ADA's purpose.\n      <em>\n       PGA Tour, Inc. v.

That purpose was reflected, the Supreme Court explained, in both \u00a7 12101(b)'s statement of purpose and also Congress's \"findings\" in \u00a7 12101(a). One such finding, highlighted by the Court in\n      <em>\n       PGA Tour\n      </em>\n      , states that \"historically, society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities, and, despite some improvements, such forms of discrimination against individuals with disabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem.\"\n      <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012101\">\n       42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (a)(2). Another, also highlighted by the Court, states that \"discrimination against individual with disabilities persists in such critical areas as employment, housing, public accommodations,\" and so on.\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012101\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      \u00a7 12101(a)(3). Findings like these spurred\n     Congress to act. \"After thoroughly investigating the problem, Congress concluded that there was a 'compelling need' for a 'clear and comprehensive national mandate' to eliminate discrimination against disabled individuals, and to integrate them 'into the economic and social mainstream of American life.' \"\n      <em>\n       PGA Tour\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301934\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/661/#p674\">\n       532 U.S. at 675\n      </extracted-citation>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301934\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/661/#p674\">\n       121 S.Ct. 1879\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (quoting S.

Defendant's Opposition (\"Opp.\"), ECF No. 9, at 7. The Court disagrees. Given that the resolution of this question requires this Court to determine the purpose of the ADA, the Supreme Court's explanation of the statute's purpose-regardless whether the case involved any argument that the statute had a public-safety purpose-is certainly instructive. The fact that the Court was not confronted with the argument that the statute had a public safety purpose relaxes\n      <em>\n       PGA Tour\n      </em>\n      's grip on this case, but it does not remove it altogether.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-26\">\n      In any event, cases that have considered whether the ADA can support a negligence\n      <em>\n       per se\n      </em>\n      claim have uniformly concluded it cannot.

As for a negligence\n      <em>\n       per se\n      </em>\n      claim, the court noted that the plaintiff \"advanced that theory below but the trial judge rejected it. The issue is not before us on appeal.\"\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076659\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/765/986/\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      at 989 n.6. And the trial court's analysis, left undisturbed by the D.C. Court of Appeals, is completely consistent with this Court's: \"Obviously, it would have been error if the court had instructed the jury that evidence of the ADA and the applicable C.F.R. violations constituted negligence\n      <em>\n       per se\n      </em>\n      , since the Act was promulgated to prevent discrimination, not physical injury.\"\n      <em>\n       Dalgliesh v. Theatre Mgmt. Grp., Inc.\n      </em>\n      , No. 96-CA-3985,\n      <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1999%20WL%20638127\">\n       1999 WL 638127\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , at *1 (D.C. Super. Ct. May 28, 1999).\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-29\">\n      Samuels insists that even if the ADA's primary purpose is to combat discrimination, it also has a partial safety-promoting purpose that can sustain a negligence\n      <em>\n       per se\n      </em>\n      claim. She relies heavily on\n      <em>\n       Rong Yao Zhou v. Jennifer Mall Rest., Inc.\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7893429\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/534/1268/\">\n       534 A.2d 1268\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (D.C. 1987), which held that a statute prohibiting liquor license holders from serving alcohol to intoxicated individuals had the purpose of protecting both the intoxicated individual and the general public. However,\n      <em>\n       Rong Yao Zhou\n      </em>\n      is easily distinguishable, as it involved a question of to whom the protection from harm applied under a statute clearly designed with an overall safety purpose. In other words, there was no debate in\n      <em>\n       Rong Yao Zhou\n      </em>\n      , unlike in this case, over whether the statute had a public-safety purpose. It clearly did, and the only question was\n      <em>\n       whom\n      </em>\n      the statute sought to protect. Here, however, the Supreme Court and others have found that the ADA's primary purpose is ending disability-based discrimination; the only question, then, is whether an additional safety-promoting purpose can be gleaned from it.\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7893429\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/534/1268/\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      Samuels thus asks more from\n      <em>\n       Rong Yao Zhou\n      </em>\n      than the facts of the case permit.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-30\">\n      At any rate, the ADA reveals no additional, public-safety purpose. To the contrary, the statute contains clues that its purpose is sometimes in conflict with public safety concerns. For example,\n      <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012182\">\n       42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182\n      </extracted-citation>\n      contains a provision which carves out an exception to the requirements set forth in the section when the individual in need of accommodation would pose a direct threat to the health and safety of others. The Supreme Court extended this same statutory exception, holding that when a structural modification would pose a direct threat to the health or safety of others, it is not a readily achievable modification that the ADA requires public accommodations to implement.\n      <em>\n       Spector v. Norwegian Cruise Line Ltd.\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208887\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/119/#p136\">\n       545 U.S. 119\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , 136,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208887\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/119/#p136\">\n       125 S.Ct. 2169\n      </extracted-citation>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208887\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/119/#p136\">\n       162 L.Ed.2d 97\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (2005). These clues suggest Congress understood that the ADA's commands may sometimes create safety concerns. Thus, Samuels in effect asks the court to read in a secondary purpose that the statute itself recognizes will sometimes be in tension with its primary\n     purpose. The Court declines this invitation.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-31\">\n      Given that the ADA cannot provide the statutory basis for Samuels's negligence\n      <em>\n       per se\n      </em>\n      claim, and because Samuels offers no other such basis, Safeway is entitled to judgment on the pleadings with respect to the negligence\n      <em>\n       per se\n      </em>\n      claim.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-32\">\n      <strong>\n       IV. Conclusion\n      </strong>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-33\">\n      For the foregoing reasons, the Court will grant Defendant's Motion for Partial Judgment on the Pleadings and dismiss Count II of the Plaintiff's Complaint. A separate Order shall accompany this memorandum opinion.\n     </p>\n    </div>\n   </opinion>\n  </casebody>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
