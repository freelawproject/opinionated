That is, rather than refund Murry and Grimes the alleged overcharges of $116.52 and $65 respectively, the defendant zeroed out the overcharges by posting additional suspect transactions to those plaintiffs' accounts after their loans had been paid in full.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32-37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Finally, to carry out the \"improper collection scheme,\" the defendant allegedly collected costs charged to the California-resident plaintiffs - Grimes, Murry, and Brandt - that were prohibited by California Civil Code \u00a7 2924c.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 38-40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In sum, the plaintiffs' claims are alleged as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The plaintiffs have not attempted to defend any claims asserted by Karla Freeland and concede that those claims should be dismissed.

However, nothing in this provision suggests that the loan owner assigned any part of its contractual rights, vis-\u00e0-vis Grimes, to the defendant.

The plaintiffs only state generally that the defendant has \"not even attempted\" to argue that there were facts available to Grimes\n   that should have made him aware that the defendant was collecting improper late fees. Opp. at 44. But the evidence shows that Grimes entered a contract with the loan owner, his loan was accelerated, he was subsequently charged late fees, and he paid those fees on December 18, 2009.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 66-68, 72-73; Stacy Decl. \u00b6 11; Grobman Decl. Ex. B; Turner Decl. Ex. 60. Thus, Grimes knew or should have known each fact essential to his claim by the time he paid the late fees. The plaintiffs have put forth no evidence suggesting otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The plaintiffs contend that the statute of limitations was equitably tolled starting in November 2008, when a similar case,\n   <em>\n    Kline v. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:08cv408, was filed in the Southern District of Ohio.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 146, 261. California law permits equitable tolling during the pendency of a prior putative class action involving claims similar to those brought in a subsequent class action suit.\n   <em>\n    Hatfield v.

But \"a plaintiff who wishes to benefit from equitable tolling must have actually relied on the use of some other legal mechanism to vindicate his rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Hendrix v. Novartis Pharm. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233281\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/975/1100/#p1114\">\n    975 F.

Equitable tolling therefore applies where a plaintiff delays filing suit \"\n   <em>\n    because of\n   </em>\n   \" the pendency of the related proceeding.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5922770\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/647/749/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The plaintiffs do not contend that Grimes had notice of the\n   <em>\n    Kline\n   </em>\n   suit, much less that Grimes delayed bringing his own suit because of the pending action. Indeed, the plaintiffs do not dispute that Grimes first contemplated bringing suit in 2016 (after the statute of limitations had expired) when he was contacted by counsel and told that he might have claims against the defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 78-79. Moreover, the plaintiffs could not possibly claim that the discovery rule applies. They argue inconsistently that there is no evidence that Grimes should have known about his cause of action but at the same time argue that Grimes was aware of his cause of action and delayed bringing it because of the\n   <em>\n    Kline\n   </em>\n   case. The equitable tolling doctrine therefore does not save Grimes's time-barred breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In short, no equitable exception applies to the four-year statute of limitations that governs Grimes's breach of contract claim. The statute of limitations began to run on December 18, 2009, and the plaintiffs filed suit on March 8, 2014 and added Grimes to the suit on May 4, 2017. Grimes's breach of contract claim regarding the alleged post-acceleration late fees scheme is time-barred. Moreover, under California law the statutes of limitations for unjust enrichment and conversion claims are shorter than for breach of contract claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fed.

And there is no reason why an equitable exception would toll the limitations periods of Grimes's quasi-contract claims but not his breach of contract claim. Thus, Grimes's quasi-contract claims relating to the alleged post-acceleration late fees scheme are also time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   All of the plaintiffs' claims, with respect to each the schemes allegedly carried out by the defendant, fail for the reasons explained above.

Stacy's supplemental declaration; (2) any facts alleged, or arguments made, for the first time in the defendant's reply brief; and (3) a \"check log\" purporting to show that the defendant refunded the post-acceleration late fees charged to plaintiff Grimes. The plaintiffs' motion to strike appears primarily to be an effort to get the last word.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In any event, none of the materials that the plaintiffs move to strike influenced this Court's decision. Stacy's supplemental declaration does not add to the arguments made elsewhere in the papers that the Court finds persuasive. And the check log need not be considered because the claim to which it is relevant - Grimes's breach of contract claim regarding post-acceleration late fees - is time-barred. That claim also fails on another ground, namely, that the defendant is not a party to the relevant agreement. Finally, the arguments made in the defendant's reply brief were plainly arguments made in response to the plaintiffs' opposition papers, not new arguments. Moreover, the Court did not rely on the arguments to which the plaintiffs' object. The plaintiffs' motion to strike is therefore\n   <strong>\n    denied\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Court has considered all the arguments raised by the parties.

Any alleged mislabeled fees are tied to the plaintiffs' loan agreements, which set out the fees for which the plaintiffs can be charged. The defendant is not a party to the plaintiffs' loan agreements. Thus, for the same reasons discussed with respect to the plaintiffs' claims under the \"inflated fees scheme,\" a claim against the defendant related to this alleged mislabeling fails.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    The plaintiffs also cite\n    <em>\n     Hearn Pacific Corp. v.
