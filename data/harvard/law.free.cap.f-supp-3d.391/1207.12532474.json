STORY, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case comes before the Court for reconsideration of the City of Doraville's Motion to Dismiss [15]. After reviewing the record and with the benefit of oral argument, the Court enters the following Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case involves the system through which Doraville raises revenue from fines, fees, and forfeitures. Doraville, like other Georgia \"home rule\" municipalities, passes its own criminal ordinances and tries violations of those ordinances in a municipal court. Doraville's police department primarily\n   enforces the City's ordinances, except for property violations, which are handled by a private firm. Those municipal servants issue thousands of tickets and citations every year. And the individuals cited or ticketed are ordered to appear at Doraville's municipal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At municipal court hearings, the City Attorney acts as prosecutor. The judge presiding over those proceedings is appointed by the City Council and \"hold[s] office at the pleasure of the City Council.\" Doraville Municipal Code \u00a7 9-1. The municipal court judge is authorized to impose criminal penalties for violations of the City's code. The standard penalty is a fine of up to $1,000 or six months imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Overall, the City generates $3 million or more annually from fines, fees, and forfeitures that are prosecuted through the municipal court. Those funds constitute anywhere from 17 to 30 percent of the City's total yearly revenue. Hence, the City is highly dependent on revenue it derives from its municipal court. And so the City Council includes projected revenue from fines, fees, and forfeitures in its municipal budget.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   According to Plaintiffs-four individuals who have each been convicted or threatened with conviction in Doraville's municipal court-\"the City's institutional reliance on revenue from fines and fees\" incentivizes \"the City to ticket, convict, and fine defendants, regardless of the nature of an individual's offense\" in violation of Plaintiffs' due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit challenging the City's conduct under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Count I challenges the City's adjudication of municipal violations, while Count II focuses on the incentives for law enforcement officers and prosecutors to obtain convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Doraville timely moved to dismiss both counts, (Dkt. [15] ). The City argued this case should be dismissed because the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction and because Plaintiffs' Complaint fails to state a claim as a matter of law. On April 1, 2019, the Court denied Doraville's motion, finding that it did indeed have jurisdiction. The Court went on, however, to grant reconsideration (\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   ) on the Rule 12(b)(6) portion of the motion and invited supplemental briefing from the parties \"to address which standard of review should guide the Court's analysis ... and define the parameters of this case, should it move forward.\" Both parties submitted briefs and appeared for oral argument to discuss their positions on June 4, 2019. The Court now reconsiders its previous denial of Doraville's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At the heart of Plaintiffs' case is the City's reliance on fines, fees, and forfeitures and the influence that reliance might have on those issuing tickets and resolving offenses in the City's municipal court. According to Plaintiffs, the City's institutional practices generate two impermissible conflicts of interest. First, municipal court personnel, including Doraville's municipal court judges, are financially incentivized to convict defendants appearing before them. And second, the City's law enforcement personnel, including its prosecutors and police officers, have a financial incentive to ticket and prosecute citizens and passers-through. Plaintiffs argue these conflicts of interest deprived them and others of their rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    A.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doraville's Municipal Court\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees that states will not deprive \"any person of life liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" U.S. CONST. amend. XIV, \u00a7 1. Inherent in this guarantee is the concept of neutrality: that people are entitled to \"impartial and disinterested\" tribunals in civil and criminal proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Marshall v.

It\n   was interested rather in the inherent defect in the legislative framework arising from the vulnerability of the average man-as the system works in practice and as it appears to defendants and to the public. The Court's inquiry there and our inquiry here is not whether a particular man has succumbed to temptation, but whether the economic realities make the design of the fee system vulnerable to a \"possible temptation\" to the \"average man\" as judge. Here we have no need to be solicitous of the honor of a particular judge; none has been questioned. Nor do concerns of judicial administration necessarily require a high evidentiary barrier. The\n   <em>\n    Tumey\n   </em>\n   -\n   <em>\n    Ward\n   </em>\n   test, in sum,\n   <em>\n    is levelled at the system, not the individual judge.\n   </em>\n   This is the reason it speaks of temptation to the average man.

For this reason, the Court is not convinced that the inquiry should be completely affixed on the individual decision-maker (that is, the one actually adjudicating cases as opposed to the municipal structure more broadly) like Doraville suggests. Instead,\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   makes clear that the Court's focus should be on the municipal structure as a whole and whether it would appear, to the average citizen, that that system potentially fuels impropriety in judicial proceedings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1353860\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/637/272/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Still, the parties disagree over how to evaluate the existence of such institutional bias. In other words, how do the principles described above translate into a workable test? While the case law makes clear that certain arrangements are clearly unconstitutional-\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , where the judicial officer has a \"direct, personal, substantial pecuniary interest\" in the proceedings,\n   <em>\n    Tumey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6142780\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/273/510/#p521\">\n    273 U.S. at 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6142780\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/273/510/#p521\">\n    47 S.Ct. 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -it does not elucidate how to determine when less concrete financial incentives-such as those at issue here-make the likelihood of impartiality so great as to violate due process. For Doraville, the threshold issue when deciding if institutional bias exists is whether the system vests in the decision-maker both judicial and executive authority. And in this case, Doraville insists, that issue is dispositive because the City's municipal court judges lack any executive responsibilities; they are, instead, simply judges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The City's best case on this point is\n   <em>\n    Dugan v.

There, the Supreme Court found that the institutional interests of a mayor exercising judicial functions were too remote to create an unconstitutional conflict of interest. Influential in the Court's analysis was that, unlike the mayor in\n   <em>\n    Tumey\n   </em>\n   , the mayor in\n   <em>\n    Dugan\n   </em>\n   had no executive authority.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3903191\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/277/61/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3903191\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/277/61/\">\n    at 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3903191\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/277/61/\">\n    48 S.Ct. 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As for common sense, look just a bit further than the allegations in the Complaint. All else being equal, imagine that direct evidence comes to light that one of Doraville's municipal court judges is, in fact, finding citizens guilty for violating City ordinances, even where proof of culpability is lacking, solely to increase revenue for the City.

To begin, that case involved \"administrative prosecutors\" charged with enforcing certain provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act involving child labor; they were not judges, and\n   <em>\n    Marshall\n   </em>\n   makes clear that while the Due Process Clause imposes certain limits on prosecutors, those limits are less stringent than the ones applicable to judges.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   Part II.B.

The importance of this distinction-at least for present purposes-is that the\n   <em>\n    Marshall\n   </em>\n   Court confirmed that due process applies, not just to judges, but to other public officials as well, albeit to a lesser extent. And as for judges, the Court clarified that\n   <em>\n    Tumey\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ward\n   </em>\n   's stricter standards control because it is the duty of judges \"to make the final decision,\" and it is judges \"whose impartiality serves as the ultimate guarantee of a fair and meaningful proceeding in our constitutional regime.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181682\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/238/#p242\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181682\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/238/#p242\">\n    at 250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181682\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/238/#p242\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This tenet applies with equal force to judges across the board-regardless of which level of government they serve and regardless of whether their functions are wholly judicial or quasi-judicial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Supreme Court also alluded to several factors that might bear on whether a law, procedure, or program unconstitutionally biases an official. A judge in another district summarized those factors as follows: \"(i) whether the amount of penalties or prosecutions affects an official's salary; (ii) the official's authority over allocating the penalty funds; (iii) the percentage of the budget that the fees and penalties constitute; and (iv) whether surplus funds are allocated to the program or to other programs.\"\n   <em>\n    Harjo v.

The Court does not suggest that this list of factors is exhaustive, nor is any one factor dispositive. But the Justices' consideration of them suggests\n   that due process concerns might be raised even absent the vesting of nonjudicial functions in the courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   This approach also tracks recent decisions from another district.\n   <em>\n    Cain v.

Second, is the conflict of interest substantial?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   While the need for the first question should be obvious, the reasoning behind the second might not be. It is derived from\n   <em>\n    Tumey.\n   </em>\n   The Supreme Court, there, emphasized that mayor courts are not, in every event, unconstitutional because \"[t]he minor penalties usually attaching to the ordinances of a village council, or to the misdemeanors in which the mayor may pronounce final judgment without a jury, do not involve any such addition to the revenue of the village as to justify the fear that the mayor would be influenced in his judicial judgment by that fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Tumey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6142780\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/273/510/#p521\">\n    273 U.S. at 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6142780\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/273/510/#p521\">\n    47 S.Ct. 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So institutional conflicts of interest with minimal effects do not implicate due process because they do not provide a legitimate incentive for officials to stray from neutrality; instead, the official motive must be, as then-retired Justice White described it, \"strong\"-so strong that it \"reasonably warrants fear of partisan influence on the judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Alpha Epsilon Phi Tau Chapter Hous.

Supp. 3d at 1184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the absence of one or more factors might be outweighed by the substantiality of other factors under the test's second prong. As an example, the amount of revenues produced from the court is one measure of whether the judge may reasonably be perceived as impartial, and the degree of executive authority transferred to the judge is another. The more substantial the percentage of revenues, the more reasonable it is to question the impartiality of the judge, even if that judge has little to no executive authority. Likewise, if the judge is vested with broad executive authority, it might be reasonable to question that judge's neutrality even if the court is responsible for only a minor percentage of the city's overall revenue.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DePiero v.

In Doraville, that is exactly what is happening: The municipal court judge \"hold[s] office at the pleasure of the City Council.\" Doraville Municipal Code \u00a7 9-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   To that end, a critical aspect of Plaintiffs' argument is that Doraville's municipal court judges are hired by and can be fired at will by the City Council. Doraville responds that the City Council does not enjoy unfettered authority to terminate municipal court judges because that authority is abated by Georgia law. Specifically, O.C.G.A. \u00a7 36-32-2.1 prohibits removal of municipal court judges without cause that \"adversely affects the administration of the office of the judge and the rights and interests of the public\" and requires a two-thirds' vote of the governing authority following notice and a public hearing. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 36-32-2.1(a) - (c), (d). At this stage, however, Doraville's position is unavailing. For one thing, there are no allegations in the Complaint suggesting that Doraville's City Council actually follows these restrictions, or that it would should municipal court revenues fall. Nor, for that matter, is it entirely clear that firing a judge who allowed court revenues to fall-and hence compromised the City's financial well-being-would run afoul of \u00a7 36-32-2.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Thus, while a municipal court judge's success undoubtedly depends on a variety of factors, chief among them is the support and good will of the City Council. The City Council, in turn, has an obvious incentive to maximize revenue from the municipal court. Of course, it is true that the City Council's concerns transcend the collection of fines, fees, and forfeitures. But the importance of municipal court revenues in Doraville cannot be ignored. Millions of dollars each year are generated from the enforcement of Doraville's criminal ordinances. And the Court cannot assume that Doraville is more interested in compliance with its criminal ordinances than it is with collecting fines and fees from those who violate them. After all, many of the ordinances at issue were not enacted in furtherance of public health and safety (at least not at face value); they deal, instead, with aesthetics-for instance, a home having chipped paint, overgrown vegetation, or logs stacked in the yard. Doraville therefore has as much to gain (if not more) from citizens violating these ordinances, as it does from everyone adhering to them. And a violation of the City's ordinances is no minor ordeal. It carries the potential for serious criminal penalties including hefty fines or even jail time.

What is more, the City Council essentially sets a target for municipal court judges to hit: It \"budgets [each year] to receive millions of dollars from municipal fines, fees, and forfeitures,\" (Compl., Dkt. [1] \u00b6 7), all of which are imposed and assessed by municipal court judges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Equally important is the percentage those criminal penalties make up of the\n   City's general fund-indeed, up to 30 percent. \"In both\n   <em>\n    Tumey\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ward\n   </em>\n   the [Supreme] Court put great emphasis on the fact that the revenues generated by the [courts at issue] were very substantial and vitally important to the village's fiscal well being.\"\n   <em>\n    Wolkenstein v.

So too in Doraville. The City is heavily reliant on revenues from its municipal courts, meaning that failure to maintain a strict policy of conviction might make it impossible for the City to balance its budget. In that event the municipal court would likely suffer too. Since such a significant portion of Doraville's yearly revenue comes from fines, fees, and forfeitures, it is reasonable to infer that the municipal court is dependent on those funds. And by extension, that if fine, fee, and forfeiture revenues fall too much or disappear completely, the officials working there would face pay cuts or lose their jobs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Doraville's municipal court judges, then, are not well insulated from the pressures of their partisan superiors or the burden of funding the municipality. So much so that an \"average man\" in those judges' shoes could fail \"to hold the balance nice, clear, and true between the state and the accused.\"\n   <em>\n    Ward\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171363\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/409/57/#p58\">\n    409 U.S. at 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171363\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/409/57/#p58\">\n    93 S.Ct. 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Is the conflict substantial?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Doraville does not seriously dispute that, assuming a conflict exists (as the Court has already found) the conflict is substantial. Indeed, revenues from the municipal court are obviously important to the City: fines, fees, and forfeitures account for up to 30 percent of the City's total budget.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Compl., Dkt.

The Court is not discounting the fact that most cases relied on by the parties involved a decision-maker who exercised both judicial and executive power. And here, by contrast, there is no allegation that Doraville's municipal court judges participate in any executive processes, nor do they appear to have any responsibilities beyond those routinely vested in members of the judiciary. Equally troubling is the speculative nature of the alleged financial or personal interests weighing on Doraville's law enforcement personnel. Whether a number of the facts alleged by Plaintiffs are able to be substantiated will ultimately be critical to Plaintiffs' case. Discovery in this case may, or may not, support Plaintiffs' allegations that Doraville's municipal scheme and institutional reliance on fines, fees, and forfeitures impermissibly incentivize the City's police officers, City Attorney, and municipal court judges.

There is no case, to the Court's knowledge, that takes such an approach, and Plaintiffs have not articulated why, for instance, a wholly independent judiciary-say, with judges having life tenure-that operates under the same system as Doraville would nevertheless violate the Due Process Clause. No, instead the caselaw strikes a middle ground between the parties. That precedent instructs the Court to examine whether\n    <em>\n     Doraville's\n    </em>\n    municipal structure and systemic reliance on fines, fees, and forfeitures creates a potential for biasing\n    <em>\n     City officials\n    </em>\n    sufficient to violate due process.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
