Plaintiff's Employment With The Texas Military Department.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The following are the pertinent facts. This is an employment dispute case. The Texas Military Department (\"TMD\") is the coordinating state agency that facilitates the Texas governor's access to the Texas National Guard and Texas State Guard to respond to disasters, emergencies, or as otherwise needed. Ex. 2 at 13, ECF No. 37-1. TMD operates the Texas Challenge Academy (\"TCA\") in two locations: TCA-East Campus (Eagle Lake) (\"TCA-East\") and TCA-West Campus (Sheffield) (\"TCA-West\").\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   TCA runs a residential youth education program to provide training, education, life skills, and employment potential to at-risk students, referred to as \"Cadets.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    at 1-2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; Flowers Dep. 49:10-24, ECF No. 37-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On May 18, 2015, Sandra Flowers (\"Plaintiff\") applied for a position as a Resident Specialist IV, or Team Leader, with Defendant. Ex. 3 at 16, ECF No. 37-1; Flowers Dep. 10:2-9, ECF No. 37-2. Team Leaders perform care and living skills training work for Cadets and are responsible for the direct supervision of Cadets. Ex. 5 at 1, ECF No. 37-3. The job vacancy notice for this position listed the essential job functions, including but not limited to, \"transport[ing] Cadets between locations (i.e. formations, physical training areas and work sites) and for medical treatment, as needed.\" Ex. 5 at 1, ECF No. 37-3. The vacancy notice also stated that a \"[v]alid driver's license is required.\" Ex. 5 at 2, ECF No. 37-3. Plaintiff represented on her initial and amended employment applications that she had a valid Class C Texas driver's license. Ex. 3 at 16, ECF No. 37-1; Ex. 7 at 6, 9, ECF No. 37-3; Ex. 8 at 10, 14, ECF No. 37-3; Flowers Dep. 16:2-6, ECF No. 37-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff was hired as a Resident Specialist IV (Team Leader) effective June 1, 2015 at TCA-East. Ex. 6 at 5, ECF No. 37-3; Flowers Dep. 16:7-9, ECF No. 37-2. Plaintiff worked in this position from June 1, 2015 through April 29, 2016. Ex. 22 at 41, ECF No. 37-3. Lauren Schulman, the Program Director of TCA-East, recommended hiring and later terminating Plaintiff. Schulman Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-4, ECF No. 37-3. Plaintiff testified in her deposition that in her chain of command, the first shift supervisor was Marquise Wilson; next was Gonzalo Rocha; and finally, Lauren Schulman. Flowers Dep. 104:6-105:5, ECF No. 37-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiff's Non-Compliance With Driver's License Job Requirement.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff's job description reiterated that one of her duties was \"transport[ing] Cadets\" and that a valid driver's license was required. Ex. 9 at 15, 16, ECF No. 37-3; Flowers Dep. 19:2-8, ECF No. 37-2; Ex. 23 at 1, 7, ECF No. 37-4. Plaintiff was aware of her job duties and signed the job description on October 20, 2015. Ex. 9 at 18, ECF No. 37-3; Flowers Dep. 16:11-19:1, ECF No. 37-2. Plaintiff conceded that she was an at-will employee and if she violated any TMD policy, she could be disciplined or terminated. Ex. 23 at 4, ECF No. 37-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff's most recent driver's license expired on February 1, 2015, before she applied for the job on May 18, 2015 and before she was hired on June 1, 2015. Ex. 10 at 19, ECF No. 37-3; Flowers Dep. 19:9-20:2, ECF No. 37-2. Her driver's license record with the Texas Department\n   of Public Safety (\"DPS\") indicated that her driver eligibility was \"not eligible,\" and since February 2, 2015, she was denied renewal of her driver's license due to a failure to appear.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ex. 10 at 19, ECF No. 37-3. Plaintiff testified she became aware there was a hold on her license three months before she applied for the position with TDM, in February 2015, when she went to DPS to attempt to renew her license. Flowers Dep. 22:2-23:20, 25:3-6, ECF No. 37-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In January 2016, Ms. Schulman announced at an internal meeting that all TCA-East staff whose positions required a valid Texas driver's license were to provide a copy of their license to the Training Coordinator, Lawrence (\"Larry\") Olson by January 14, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Schulman Decl. \u00b6 5, ECF No. 37-3. At the end of January, Mr. Olson reported that he confirmed the existence of or received a copy of each employee's driver's license, except Plaintiff's. Ex. 14 at 28, ECF No. 37-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Disciplinary Action Against Plaintiff.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   When Mr. Olson reported that Plaintiff did not have a driver's license, Defendant did not immediately terminate her, but instead gave her more than 60 days to resolve the issue. Flowers Dep. 90:13-21, ECF No. 37-2; Ex. 23 at 4, 6, ECF No. 37-4. On February 12, 2016, Plaintiff's supervisor, Mr. Rocha, provided her with a counseling form, requiring her to provide proof of having a valid driver's license by March 14, 2016. Ex. 17 at 32, ECF No. 37-3; Ex. 23 at 7, ECF No. 37-4. Plaintiff circled on the form that she agreed with the counseling provided and signed the form.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ex. 17 at 33, ECF No. 37-3; Ex. 23 at 7, ECF No. 37-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On March 3, 2016, Plaintiff obtained an order from a Justice of the Peace in Colorado County, Texas, granting her a restricted occupational driver's license.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ex. 18 at 34-36, ECF No. 37-3; Flowers Dep. 25:20-26:9, ECF No. 37-2. The order stated that the DPS would mail the occupational driver's license within 31 days of the date of the order and after receiving Plaintiff's payment of a $10.00 fee. Ex. 18 at 34, ECF No. 37-3; Flowers Dep. 80:17-81:7, ECF No. 37-2. The order itself was valid as the occupational driver's license for 45 days-until April 16, 2016-to allow time for the driver's license to be mailed. Flowers Dep. 76:17-24, 78:22-79:5, 81:8-16, ECF No. 37-2. The only documentation Plaintiff presented to Defendant was the court order\n   granting her occupational driver's license.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    77:21-78:1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; Ex. 20 at 38, ECF No. 37-3; Ex. 23 at 1-2, ECF no. 37-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Thus, the undisputed evidence establishes that Plaintiff was driving without a valid driver's license from February 2015, when her driver's license expired, through March 2016, when she received the court order for an occupational restricted driver's license, temporarily allowing her to drive to and from work. The restricted license, however, would not allow Plaintiff to drive during work hours, except for a medical emergency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On March 23, 2016, Mr. Rocha gave Plaintiff a letter of reprimand for leaving her shift five hours early, reminding her of her obligation to maintain a valid driver's license, and warning her that \"[t]he failure to do so may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.\" Ex. 19 at 37, ECF No. 37-3. Plaintiff signed the letter.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Plaintiff's Termination.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   By April 16, 2019, Plaintiff still had not obtained a valid driver's license from the DPS and thus did not provide it to Defendant. Flowers Dep. 78:16-21, ECF No. 37-2. Plaintiff conceded that Defendant worked with her for months to obtain a valid driver's license, but she was not able to provide one. Ex. 23 at 8, ECF No. 37-4. Plaintiff also did not update Mr. Rocha on her efforts to obtain her driver's license. Ex. 20 at 38, ECF No. 37-3. On April 19, 2016, Mr. Rocha submitted a request to terminate Plaintiff to the human resources department, due to noncompliance with the driver's license requirement and attendance issues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    at 38-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Ex. 21 at 40, ECF No. 37-3. On April 29, 2016, the then director of human resources, Shelia Taylor, provided Plaintiff with her termination letter, effective May 2, 2016. Ex. 22 at 41, ECF No. 37-3. The termination letter stated Plaintiff was terminated \"for violation of a condition of [her] employment to maintain a valid Driver License.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

Ex. 27 at 22, ECF No. 37-4; Flowers Dep. 107:11-14, 108:2-17, ECF No. 37-2.

Nevertheless, TMD did not immediately terminate Plaintiff, but instead gave her ample opportunity-months-to resolve the issue.

Because Plaintiff never had a valid Class C license during her tenure, she violated TMD's job requirement. In addition, she violated the policy every time she transported Cadets.
