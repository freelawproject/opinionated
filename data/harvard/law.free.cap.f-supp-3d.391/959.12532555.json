In\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff trademark owner claimed that an expressive work infringed plaintiff's trademark rights under the Lanham Act.

More important, the KBFAA Counter-Defendants ignore that the Supreme Court and Ninth Circuit have both stated several times that the general test for copyright infringement-principally, the \"idea/expression dichotomy\"-itself accounts for relevant First Amendment concerns, as it \"strike[s] [the necessary] definitional balance between the First Amendment and the Copyright Act.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harper &amp; Row Publishers, Inc. v.

KGSI at several points alleges that Mr. Barry's actions were \"willful.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   Counterclaims \u00b6 29.

Thus, although the complaint does not specifically allege that Mr. Barry \"knew he was violating copyright laws,\" viewing the facts alleged in the light most favorable to KGSI, the only possible inference from KGSI's allegations is that Mr. Barry, and thus KBFAA knew (but did not care) that their actions violated copyright law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    c.
