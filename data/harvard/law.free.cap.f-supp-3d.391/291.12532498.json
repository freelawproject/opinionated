Plaintiffs Howard J. Barnet, Peter L. Barnet, and Jane L. Barnet (collectively, the \"Barnet Plaintiffs\"), along with Sotheby's, Inc. (\"Sotheby's,\" and together with the Barnet Plaintiffs, \"Plaintiffs\"), bring this action against Defendant Ministry of Culture and Sports of the Hellenic Republic (the \"Ministry\" or \"Greece\"), seeking a declaratory judgment that the Barnet Plaintiffs are the lawful owners of the Bronze Horse and, further, that Sotheby's may sell the figure on their behalf. Defendant, for its part, contends that the Bronze Horse was illegally removed from Greece and should be repatriated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Rather than resolve these issues through the litigation, Defendant asserts immunity from litigation, and moves to dismiss Plaintiffs' Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). Specifically, Defendant argues that (i) the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' claims pursuant to the Foreign\n   Sovereign Immunities Act (the \"FSIA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201602\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 11 ; and (ii) Plaintiff Sotheby's lacks Article III standing because it does not sufficiently allege injury-in-fact. For the reasons set forth herein, Defendant's motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 16, 1973, Howard and Saretta Barnet purchased the Bronze Horse. (Compl. \u00b6 21). The figure, which dates back to the 8th Century B.C.E., is an example of a common style of Greek statutes depicting horses from the Geometric period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 16, 33). The Barnets added the Bronze Horse to their private art collection, displaying it at their New York home for more than 20 years. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24). In 1992, Howard Barnet passed away and the ownership of the figure vested entirely in Saretta Barnet. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26). In 2012, ownership of the Bronze Horse was transferred to the 2012 Saretta Barnet Revocable Trust (the \"Trust\"), of which the Barnet Plaintiffs are the sole trustees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In July 2017, after Saretta Barnet's death, the Barnet Plaintiffs consigned the Bronze Horse to Sotheby's for sale, along with numerous other items from the Barnet collection. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 29-30). Sotheby's planned to sell the Bronze Horse at an auction scheduled for May 14, 2018, in New York, New York. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31). As is customary prior to any auction, on April 25, 2018, Sotheby's published an auction catalog online that included the Bronze Horse. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 32-33). The auction catalog described the provenance, or ownership history, of the Bronze Horse, which potential buyers use to confirm the authenticity of a work of art. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As described in its provenance, on May 6, 1967, the Bronze Horse was sold at a public auction in Switzerland by M\u00fcnzen und Medaillen, a reputable European auction house, to an undisclosed buyer. (Compl. \u00b6 23). At a later date, the Bronze Horse was acquired by Robin Symes from the 1967 auction purchaser. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Howard and Saretta Barnet acquired the Bronze Horse from Mr. Symes on November 3, 1973. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On May 11, 2018, the Friday prior to the Monday auction, Defendant emailed a letter to Sotheby's, demanding that the auction house immediately withdraw the Bronze Horse from the auction and repatriate the figure to Greece (the \"Demand Letter\"). (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 37, 39). The Ministry asserted that the Bronze Horse is cultural property that had been stolen from Greece, in violation of Greek patrimony\n   laws. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38). In support of Greece's claim of ownership, the Demand Letter referred to the figure's prior connection to Robin Symes, which had been publically disclosed in the Sotheby's auction catalog. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43). In closing, the letter noted that Greece \"reserves the right to take the necessary legal action in the competent courts in order to repatriate the coin [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ].\" (Demand Letter 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Demand Letter, irrespective of its merit, placed a cloud over the Bronze Horse's marketability, impairing Sotheby's ability to sell it on behalf of the Barnet family. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 51-52). Accordingly, Sotheby's immediately withdrew the Bronze Horse from the auction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 52). Several days later, Sotheby's responded to the Demand Letter, rejecting Greece's claim of ownership, and inviting the Ministry of Culture to provide any other evidence to support its initial assertions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 53-54). At present, the Bronze Horse is located in New York, New York. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 56).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The Court Has Subject Matter Jurisdiction Under the Commercial Activity Exception of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant argues principally that this Court lacks jurisdiction to consider Plaintiffs' claims due to Defendant's sovereign immunity. (Def. Br. 6-21). However, the Court finds that the act in question - Defendant's transmission of the Demand Letter, which halted the auction of the Bronze Horse - falls within the FSIA's commercial activity exception. As a result, Defendant is not immune from suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Commercial Exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"The FSIA provides the sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in federal court.\"\n   <em>\n    Anglo-Iberia Underwriting Mgmt.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    P.T.

Broadly, a foreign state is immune from federal court jurisdiction, unless a specific exception in the FSIA applies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matar\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dichter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237893\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/563/9/#p12\">\n    563 F.3d 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 12 (2d Cir. 2009). If such an exception applies, \"the foreign state shall be liable in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201606\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Here, Plaintiffs argue that Defendant's behavior falls within the commercial activity exception to the FSIA. (Pl. Opp. 7). The third prong of that exception, known as the \"direct-effect clause,\" abrogates sovereign immunity when the action is based upon \"an act outside the territory of the United States in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere and that act causes a direct effect in the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201605\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). To establish jurisdiction on that basis, the action must be (i) based upon an act outside the United States; (ii) that was taken in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign sovereign; and (iii) that caused a direct effect in the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Petersen Energia Inversora S.A.U.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Argentine Republic &amp; YPF S.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517600\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/895/194/#p204\">\n    895 F.3d 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 204 (2d Cir. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   At the motion to dismiss stage, the defendant must first make a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing that it is a foreign state under the FSIA.\n   <em>\n    Kensington Int'l Ltd.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Itoua\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5859883\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/505/147/#p153\">\n    505 F.3d 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 153 (2d Cir. 2007).

Plaintiffs' core claim is that Defendant erred in asserting an ownership interest in the Bronze Horse when demanding that Sotheby's withdraw the figure from the auction. Accordingly, the Court finds - and Defendant does not dispute - that the foundation of lawsuit is the act of sending the Demand Letter. (Def. Br. 14 (\"Sotheby's admits that the gravamen of the suit is predicated on the sole act of Defendant sending a letter.\")).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

Plaintiffs argue that the relevant conduct, the act of sending the Demand Letter, was a commercial activity (Pl. Opp. 11-19), while Defendants assert that the act was purely sovereign in nature (Def.

The Court agrees with Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   To review, for the Court to find that jurisdiction has been established under the \"direct-effect\" clause, it must find that Defendant's action was \"taken in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign sovereign.\"\n   <em>\n    Petersen Energia Inversora S.A.U.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517600\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/895/194/#p204\">\n    895 F.3d at 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(Def. Br. 18). Because the letter was sent \"in fulfillment of the Ministry's public purpose,\" Defendant argues that \"it could not have been sent by a private party,\" and therefore the act is not commercial in nature. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20). However, the fact that Defendant sent the Demand Letter in order to protect its cultural heritage is immaterial to the Court's analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Weltover II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730183\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/607/#p612\">\n    504 U.S. at 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730183\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/607/#p612\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In making this argument, Defendant conflates the nature with the purpose of the act. While the\n   <em>\n    purpose\n   </em>\n   of sending the Demand Letter may have been to fulfill the Ministry's constitutional mandate to protect Greece's cultural heritage, the\n   <em>\n    nature\n   </em>\n   of the act is analogous to a private citizen attempting to enforce his property rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Furthermore, Defendant's assertion that \"[t]he protection of heritage has never been considered commercial activity by the Second Circuit, the Supreme Court, or any other court\" (Def. Br. 20), only goes so far. While the Second Circuit has not had the opportunity to address the issue, courts have found that acts taken in furtherance of a sovereign's cultural mission can be commercial in nature. In\n   <em>\n    Cassirer\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kingdom of Spain\n   </em>\n   , an American citizen filed suit to recover a painting from Spain, which claimed ownership.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6050167\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/1019/#p1022\">\n    616 F.3d 1019\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1022 (9th Cir. 2010). Spain moved to dismiss the case by asserting sovereign immunity on the basis of the FSIA, arguing that it had not engaged in \"commercial activity.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6050167\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/1019/#p1022\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6050167\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/1019/#p1022\">\n    at 1032\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Ninth Circuit held that \"it does not matter that [Spain's] activities are undertaken on behalf of a non-profit museum to further its cultural mission,\" because \"the commercial character of an activity depends on its nature rather than its purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6050167\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/1019/#p1022\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Likewise, in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Overseas Korean Cultural Heritage Foundation\n   </em>\n   , the D.C.

Supp. 3d 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 297 (D.D.C. 2018). As such, the court concluded, \"the act is 'commercial.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272891\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/279/293/#p297\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   For the sake of completeness, the Court addresses one lingering argument: that the sending of the Demand Letter was not commercial activity because Greece \"has no intention to sell the\n   Bronze,\" (Def. Br. 11), \"did not seek to generate business activity for Greece\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12), and would receive \"no commercial benefit for the Ministry\" if the Bronze Horse were repatriated (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ).

On May 11, 2018, one business day prior to the scheduled auction, Defendant sent Sotheby's the Demand Letter, which asked Sotheby's to \"immediately withdraw the ancient Greek figurine of the list from the items to be auctioned on May 14, 2018.\" (Demand Letter 1). \"The threats and allegations in the demand letter put Plaintiffs in the untenable position of selling an object to which there was a competing claim of ownership, and where they were being threatened with litigation and criminal prosecution.\" (Pl. Opp. 9). For that reason, Plaintiffs withdrew the Bronze Horse from the New York auction. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 51-52).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In response, Defendant pivots to argue that the alleged conduct - the sending of the Demand Letter - was not \"legally significant.\" (Def.

It was only later, when Plaintiffs filed the instant suit, that concerns about the figure's ownership history and association with Mr. Symes became public, thereby placing a cloud over the figure's marketability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Court disagrees.\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , the Complaint clearly alleges that Plaintiffs withdrew the Bronze Horse from the auction upon receipt of the Demand Letter, which explicitly asked them to do just that. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 51-52). Nothing in the record supports Defendant's position that Plaintiffs withdrew the figure for any other reason.\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , the \"problems\" with the Bronze Horse to which Defendant alludes involve Mr. Symes's prior ownership of the piece. However, Mr. Symes purchased the piece from a reputable auction house, a fact that Plaintiffs disclosed in the publicly available auction catalogue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 34, 43-44). Therefore, the piece is arguably not amongst those in Mr. Symes's collection with questionable origins. The Court cannot find that Sotheby's, after publishing the Bronze Horse's provenance, withdrew the figure from the auction weeks later due solely to issues with that provenance, and only coincidentally one day after receiving the Demand Letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Accordingly, Plaintiff has demonstrated that Defendant lacks sovereign immunity due to the FSIA commercial exception and Defendant has not met its ultimate burden of persuasion.

Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Court observes at the outset that Defendant raises a facial attack on Sotheby's standing to sue. (Def. Br. 21-22). Defendant argues that Sotheby's lacks standing to bring the declaratory judgment action because Sotheby's has not satisfied the injury-in-fact prong of the\n   standing inquiry for three reasons: (i) Plaintiffs withdrew the Bronze Horse from the auction \"because the Ministry presented legitimate concerns as to the item's provenance\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 22); (ii) Sotheby's had no ownership claim in the Bronze Horse, \"given that the title was not transferred to Sotheby's\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ); and (iii) \"Sotheby's is shifting blame onto Defendant for purportedly alerting potential buyers to the disputed provenance of the Bronze, when actually it was Sotheby's who publicized the matter by filing suit\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Court is not persuaded by Defendant's arguments.\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , despite not having title to the Bronze Horse, as a consignee, \"Sotheby's has its own particularized economic interest in being able to sell the Bronze Horse, in particular its right to earn a commission upon the sale.\" (Pl. Opp. 24).\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , as discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Defendant's claim that Plaintiffs withdrew the Bronze Horse due to their own concerns flatly contradicts the factual allegations in the Complaint - which allegations, on a facial challenge, the Court must accept as true. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 51-52).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    HealthPort Techs.\n   </em>\n   , LLC,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055671\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/47/#p56\">\n    822 F.3d 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 57 (2d Cir. 2016).\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , even if it were possible for Plaintiffs to withdraw the Bronze Horse from the auction in secret, Sotheby's warrants and represents to potential buyers that buyers will obtain good title to items they purchase. (Pl. Opp. 25). Therefore, Defendant's Demand Letter necessitated that Sotheby's inform potential buyers of Defendant's competing claim to ownership, whether or not the matter was further publicized by filing a suit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    Finally\n   </em>\n   , in the Demand Letter, Defendant threatened \"to take the necessary legal action in the competent courts in order to repatriate the coin [sic].\" (Demand Letter 2). Defendant's threat of legal action against Sotheby's, which was sufficiently concrete and imminent, is a separate and independent basis for standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Digital Angel Corp.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Corporativo SCM, S.A. de C.V.\n   </em>\n   , No. Civ. 05-1060 (ADM) (JJG),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%203357084\">\n    2005 WL 3357084\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (D.

Mar. 31, 2006) (\"A party has a right to seek declaratory judgment where a reasonable apprehension exists that if it continues an activity it will be sued by another party.\"). For these reasons, the Court finds that Sotheby's has standing to initiate the instant action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   For the reasons stated in this Opinion, Defendant's motion to dismiss is DENIED. The Clerk of Court is directed to terminate the motion at docket entry 20.

In addition, the Court considers the Ministry's letter to Sotheby's regarding the auction described\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    (the \"Demand Letter\" (Dkt. #20)), which is incorporated by reference, and integral to the Complaint.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Chambers v.

Br. 12).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Defendant's briefing is inconsistent on this point. Several pages later, Defendant contradicts its prior arguments by stating that, \"as noted by the Supreme Court, profit is not central to the determination of whether an activity is 'commercial.' \" (Def.
