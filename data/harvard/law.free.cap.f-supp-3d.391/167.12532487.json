In its October 24, 2017 Order, the court wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   The Master has informed the court that he has entered a limited protective order concerning the confidentiality of certain information he has received in discovery and informed the [Lawyers] that an opportunity would be provided for them to propose redactions to the Report and Recommendation which will be filed for the public record. In view of the foregoing, the court is modifying the March 8, 2017 Order to provide that: the Master shall file his Report and Recommendation with the court under seal; the court will provide the Report and Recommendation to the [Lawyers], under seal; and the court will establish schedules for proposed redactions and objections.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Docket No. 208 at 3. The March 29, 2017 Limited Protective Order in its most pertinent part provides that the production of documents requested by the Master would not constitute a waiver of any attorney-client privilege or any other privilege.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 191, \u00b61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 14, 2018, the Master filed his Report and Recommendation, an Executive Summary of it, and referenced exhibits in both printed and electronic form.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Pursuant to the October 24, 2017 Order, the court has temporarily sealed those submissions to provide the Lawyers an opportunity to review them and propose redactions. The court intends to decide whether any proposed redactions are justified. The court may, however, refer any redaction issues to the Master for a Report and Recommendation. The court may also, instead, ask the Master, or his counsel, to respond to any questionable requests for redactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In proposing redactions, the Lawyers shall bear in mind that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Nixon v.
