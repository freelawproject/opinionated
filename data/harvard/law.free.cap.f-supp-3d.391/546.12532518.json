(\"Defendant\" or \"Serenity\"). ECF Nos. 14, 15. The parties have requested a ruling on the briefs. ECF No. 20. After examining the briefs and the record, the Court agrees that oral argument is unnecessary because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented, and oral argument would not aid in the decisional process. Fed. R. Civ. P. 78(b) ; E.D. Va. Loc. R. 7 (J). For the reasons stated below, Defendant's motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant is a corporation licensed in Virginia to provide support and training to their clients who are individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (\"Clients\"). Def.'s Br. 1, ECF No. 15; Hernandez Decl. \u00b6 3, ECF No. 15-1. One of the services that Defendant provides for its Clients is the Sponsored Residential Program where the Clients live with family\n   sponsors (\"Sponsors\"), who have contracted with Defendant to provide appropriate food, lodging, sanitation, and a residential home environment for the Clients. Def.'s Br. 2; Hernandez Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6. The Sponsors agree to adhere to Defendant's guidelines and regulatory requirements and to complete the necessary training and certifications. Def.'s Br. 2; Hernandez Decl. \u00b6 6. Defendant compensates the Sponsors based on the level of service they provide to the Clients. Def.'s Br. 2, Hernandez Decl. \u00b6 6. While participating in the Sponsored Residential Programs, Clients receive services from other providers such as mental health professionals and counselors. Def.'s Br. 2; Hernandez Decl. \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In September of 2017, Defendant hired plaintiff Athena Brown (\"Plaintiff\") as a \"Program Coordinator\" whose job was to supervise the Clients and their Sponsors in the Sponsored Residential Program. Def.'s Br. 2; Hernandez Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 7-8. Specifically, the job description given to Plaintiff on the day she was hired provides that the primary duties of a Program Coordinator consist of the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   1. Develop and ensure on-going implementation of Individual Support Plans, Behavioral and Therapeutic Treatment Plans. Ensure adherence to Licensure, Human Rights, and/or other State, Federal, or Local regulations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   2.

According to Plaintiff, Plaintiff's duties as a Program Coordinator included\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   supervis[ing] or ... oversee [ing] the sponsor providers and individuals with guidance from our supervisor, from the directors.... writing reports ... going to home visits, inspecting home visits, on-call situations or emergencies, holding annual meetings, meeting other entities, going to ... different job fairs, auditing books, ... trainings with individuals, sponsor providers[,] ... ensuring that the sponsor providers follow the guidelines under Serenity and licensure[,] ... filing papers and reports,\n   writing monthly documentation, [and] care coordination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Brown Depo. 8, ECF No. 15-2. As a part of her job in carrying out these duties, Plaintiff supervised approximately 18-20 Clients and 15-20 Sponsors at a time and had the authority to remove Clients from their Sponsors' homes if the Sponsor was not fulfilling the criteria for the program. Def.'s Br. 5; Hernandez Decl. \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   During her employment, Plaintiff was placed on probation for failure to perform her duties properly and on time. Def.'s Br. 5; Hernandez Decl. \u00b6 11. As a result, Plaintiff received on-going performance counseling in which she was reminded of the duties she was expected to complete as stated in her job description. Def.'s Br. 5; Hernandez Decl. \u00b6 11; Def.'s Ex. 16, 17, 18, ECF Nos. 15-6, 15-7, 15-8. In one of those written counseling documents, Plaintiff was reminded that \" [i]t is imperative that all Program Coordinators be proactive and take[ ] initiative in accordance to [sic] the job description.\" Def.'s Ex. 18; Brown Depo. 87, ECF No. 15-2; Def.'s Br. 6. In response to the counseling, Plaintiff maintained that she was \"fully competent and handling [her] caseloads as well as the responsibilities [as] a program coordinator with the company.\" Def.'s Ex. 18 at 5; Brown Depo. 88-89; Def.'s Br. 6. On August 3, 2018, Plaintiff took a leave of absence from work for medical reasons. Def.'s Br. 6; Hernandez Decl. \u00b6 7. Plaintiff never returned to work for Defendant following her medical leave. Def.'s Br. 6; Hernandez Decl. \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff filed a Complaint in this Court against Defendant on September 7, 2018, alleging that Defendant violated the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\") by failing to pay her overtime wages for the hours she worked when she was a Program Coordinator. Compl., ECF No. 1. Defendant answered the Complaint on October 9, 2018. Def.'s Ans., ECF No. 4. On May 28, 2019, Defendant filed the instant Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 14, and an accompanying brief and evidence in support, ECF No. 15, asserting an affirmative defense that Plaintiff was not entitled to overtime because she was properly classified as \"exempt\" from overtime under what is known as the \"administrative exemption.\" Defendant argues that there is no dispute of material fact relevant to the application of the exemption and that the undisputed facts prove, as a matter of law, that Plaintiff was exempt. Def.'s Br.6-7. On June 11, 2019, Plaintiff filed a memorandum in opposition to the motion for summary judgment arguing that Defendant has failed to meet is burden to prove that Plaintiff is exempt. Pl.'s Resp., ECF No. 18. Defendant replied on June 14, 2019. Def.'s Reply, ECF No. 19. Trial is scheduled to begin in this case on July 23, 2019. Having been fully briefed, this matter is now ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Local Rule 56(B)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As a preliminary matter, the Court notes that Plaintiff has failed to comply with Local Civil Rule 56(B), which states that a brief in response to a motion for summary judgment \"shall include a specifically captioned section listing all material facts as to which it is contended that there exists a genuine issue necessary to be litigated and citing the parts of the record relied on to support the facts alleged to be in dispute.\" E.D. Va. Loc. R. 56(B). Plaintiff failed to specifically identify any material facts in dispute, and therefore, of course, failed to list any such facts in a separate section. This may be of no moment, as the remainder of Plaintiff's brief does not dispute the facts relied upon by Defendant and, in fact, relies upon such facts. Moreover, Plaintiff has failed to provide any additional evidence in support of her position. Accordingly, Plaintiff has not adequately disputed any of the facts stated by Defendant. Therefore, in accordance with Local Rule 56(B), \"the Court may assume that facts identified by the moving party in its listing of material facts are admitted, unless such a fact is controverted in the statement of genuine issues filed in opposition to the motion.\" E.D.

Even if a non-moving party fails to comply with Local Rule 56(B), the Court should still generally determine whether the moving party has met its burden on a motion for summary judgment, rather than deciding the motion on a technicality,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hedrick v.

The consequence of Plaintiff's failure to comply is provided by the Rule itself: The Court deems Defendant's statement of undisputed facts to be admitted by Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   E.D. Va. Loc. R. 56(B). As a result, Defendant has met its burden to show that there is no dispute of material fact over the facts relevant to whether the administrative exemption applies. Nevertheless, Defendant must still meet its burden to show that the undisputed facts support a finding in its favor as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a) (stating that a court should grant summary judgment if the movant \"shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law\"). This is particularly true where, like here, the Defendant's motion is based on an affirmative defense, which the Defendant has the burden to prove. Accordingly, due to Plaintiff's failure to comply with Local Rule 56 and failure to dispute facts or provide evidence, the Court deems the facts identified by Defendant as undisputed and admitted by Plaintiff. As a result, the Court will move to the next step of the analysis and determine whether the undisputed facts support a judgment in favor of Defendant as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Administrative Exemption\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Pursuant to the FLSA, \"no employer shall employ any of his employees ... for a workweek longer than forty hours unless such employee receives compensation for his employment in excess of the hours above specified at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is employed.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).

Reg 22,122, 22,124 (Apr. 23, 2004). \"Additionally, 'the type of work they performed was difficult to standardize to any time frame and could not be easily spread to other workers after 40 hours in a week,' thus 'precluding the potential job expansion intended' by the overtime premium.\"\n   <em>\n    Calderon v.

In other words, because it would be more difficult to accomplish the goal of right sizing the workforce if \"white collar\" employees, whose workload and schedules are less predictable, were paid overtime than it would be if employees whose work is more standardized, like factory employees working on the production line, were paid overtime, Congress chose to exempt the \"white collar\" employees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defining and Delimiting the Exemptions, 69 Fed.

Defining and Delimiting the Exemptions, 69 Fed. Reg at 22,141.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Plaintiff argues that her duties should qualify as \"production\" because they were limited to \"producing\" the day-to-day business of Serenity, which she asserts is \"the provision of case management coordination services to Defendant's developmentally disabled customers.\" Pl.'s Br. 5-6. On the other hand, Defendant argues that Plaintiff's primary duties are administrative duties because she was supervising the Sponsors who were actually producing the service of home care. Def.'s Reply 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Serenity is in the business of providing \"support and training to individuals with intellectual disabilities\" through placement in residential homes. Hernandez Decl. \u00b6 3-4. The business is essentially a way to replace residential facilities that place individuals with disabilities in a more institutionalized setting, rather than a home setting. Significantly, Plaintiff is not a Sponsor providing the service of home care, rather, she is managing and supervising those Sponsors. Additionally, Plaintiff is coordinating with the Sponsors and with third party service providers to ensure the Clients are receiving all the services they need. Plaintiff's job is conceptually similar to that of someone who coordinates services in a residential facility, such as a group home or an assisted living community. Such a person would be considered administrative because they are not actually producing the services, such as medical care, therapy treatments, and food services, but, rather, are administering the business of residential care by managing the producers of that care. At least one other court has found that managers of an \"adult family home\" were exempt administrators because they were responsible for managing the operations of the facility, including supervising the employees, screening residents, paying bills, ordering supplies, and taking care of the residents' needs.\n   <em>\n    Schryvers v. Coulee Cmty.

Here, like the plaintiffs in charge of the adult family home in\n   <em>\n    Schryvers\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff manages the Sponsors and helps them coordinate with other providers to ensure the Client is receiving all the services during the time that the Client lives with the Sponsor. The fact that the Clients are not all living in the same place does not change the nature of Plaintiff's job. In her own words, one of Plaintiff's primary duties, \"care coordination,\" is \"just coordinating with\n   <em>\n    other people that actually take care of the individual\n   </em>\n   .\" Brown Depo. 9. She is not actually the person taking care of the Defendant's Clients. Thus, as Plaintiff was not providing support and training to Defendant's Clients with intellectual disabilities, but was instead supervising and supporting the home-based Sponsors who were producing and directly overseeing the service of home care, Plaintiff was not involved in the production side of Serenity's business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   This is further evidenced by a comparison to cases in other jurisdictions that\n   have found employees with similar positions in home care companies to be exempt. For example, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania found that a supervisor of the nurses at a company whose business was providing in-home nursing care to patients met the criteria for the administrative exemption.\n   <em>\n    Goff v.

In finding that the plaintiff, Goff, satisfied the element of performing office or non-manual work directly related to the management or general business operations of the company, the court stated that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   it is undisputed that Goff's work was office or nonmanual work. Bayada's business involved providing nurses for patients, and Goff matched nurses to patients, ensuring that company standards were met. As Goff stated in her resume on careerbuilder.com, as a staff supervisor at Bayada, she was involved in \"casemanaging to ensure that the employee retains a positive relationship with the client and/or family while adhering to standards.\" (Goff Dep. at 30; Bayada Ex. 5). This direct role in managing and dealing with customers to ensure that standards were met fits within prong (2) of this exemption.

Though she may not have the hiring power Goff had or the recruiting responsibilities of Hudkins, or the control over aspects of the business such as payroll like Selfridge, like the plaintiffs in all three cases, Plaintiff's primary duty was to manage other people who were actually producing the service of the business. Accordingly, Plaintiff's primary duties fall more on the administrative side rather than the production side of the business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Specific Duties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Next, because the dichotomy between production-type work and administration of the business is useful but not dispositive, the Court looks to whether Plaintiff's primary duties fall within the categories of work identified by the DOL as directly related to the management or general business operations rather than the day-to-day operations. As stated earlier, the regulations explain that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   [w]ork directly related to management or general business operations\n   <em>\n    includes, but is not limited to\n   </em>\n   , work in functional areas such as tax; finance; accounting;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   budgeting;\n   <em>\n    auditing\n   </em>\n   ; insurance;\n   <em>\n    quality control\n   </em>\n   ; purchasing; procurement; advertising; marketing; research; safety and health;\n   <em>\n    personnel management\n   </em>\n   ; human resources; employee benefits; labor relations; public relations, government relations; computer network, internet and database administration;\n   <em>\n    legal and regulatory compliance; and similar activities\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20541.201\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Many of Plaintiff's primary duties fall squarely within the list of examples provided in the regulation. Specifically, her primary duties involve auditing, quality control, personnel management, and legal and regulatory compliance. During her deposition, Plaintiff admitted that a part of her duty is auditing the books. Brown Depo. 8. Plaintiff also engages in quality control by monitoring the Sponsors and keeping records of the Clients and the Sponsors to ensure that the Client is receiving the quality of care that Defendant seeks to provide.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hernandez Decl. \u00b6 10 (explaining that Plaintiff's duties involved assuring that the program criteria are met); Def.'s Exhibit 3 (describing that Plaintiff has the authority to modify plans for the Clients as needed). Plaintiff also engages in personnel management in that she can essentially fire the Sponsors by removing the Clients from the home if the Sponsor is not complying with program criteria.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hernandez Decl. \u00b6 10. Additionally, as listed in both the job description (Defendant's Exhibit 3) and Plaintiff's resume (Defendant's Exhibit 4), one of Plaintiff's primary duties is to \"ensure adherence to licensure requirements, human rights guidelines, and other governmental regulations.\" Def.'s Ex. 3; Def.'s Ex. 4. This falls within the category of work that is exempt because it is in the area of \"legal and regulatory compliance.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20541.201\">\n    29 C.F.R \u00a7 541.201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Additionally, Plaintiff develops and implements training for the Sponsors. Though training is not listed in the specific duties quoted above, the Fourth Circuit has recognized that an employee who spends more than 50% of their time developing training policies and training the other employees meets the requirements of the administrative exemption.\n   <em>\n    West v.

The DOL regulations provide examples of supervisors who are normally considered exempt because their work is \"directly and closely related to managerial\" duties:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   A supervisor who spot checks and examines the work of subordinates to determine whether they are performing their duties properly, and whether the product is satisfactory, is performing work which is directly and closely related to managerial and supervisory functions, so long as the checking is distinguishable from the work ordinarily performed by a nonexempt inspector.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   A department manager in a retail or service establishment who walks about the sales floor observing the work of sales personnel under the employee's supervision to determine the effectiveness of their sales techniques, checks on the quality of customer service being given, or observes customer preferences is performing work which is directly and closely related to managerial and supervisory functions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20541.703\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3), (5). Like these examples, Plaintiff is supervising the work of the Sponsors by ensuring that they are adhering to company standards, licensure requirements, and regulations and by checking on the quality of services provided. Hernandez Decl. \u00b6 10; Def.'s Ex. 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Fourth Circuit has highlighted the importance of such supervisory responsibilities in determining whether an employee falls within the administrative exemption.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Desmond\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237975\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/564/688/#p694\">\n    564 F.3d at 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Desmond\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs were horse racing officials at a company whose business was to produce live horse races.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237975\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/564/688/#p694\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237975\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/564/688/#p694\">\n    at 689-90, 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The racing officials' jobs entailed assisting with clerical duties, noting jockey changes, compiling the program for each race, completing racing entries, determining the outcome of races, identifying horses and ensuring they met the requirements to race, and verifying the jockeys' presence and licensure at each race.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237975\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/564/688/#p694\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237975\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/564/688/#p694\">\n    at 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Fourth Circuit found that, because these employees had \"\n   <em>\n    no supervisory responsibility\n   </em>\n   and do not develop, review, evaluate, or recommend ... business policies or strategies,\" their job \"consist[ed] of 'the day-to-day carrying out of' \" their employer's business of producing horse races.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237975\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/564/688/#p694\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 694 (citing\n   <em>\n    Bratt v.

As a result, the Fourth Circuit held that the racing officials were not exempt. Unlike the racing officials, Plaintiff's primary duty is to supervise and manage the Sponsors in their provision of home-based services and to coordinate with the Sponsors and third-party providers to ensure Clients receive all the services to which they are entitled. She is not carrying out the day-to-day business of providing these services. If this were a group home or institutional setting, for example, it would be clear that the people providing the services (such as healthcare, food, and therapy) are involved in the day-to-day business of the residential facility, while the person coordinating these services and supervising the provision of such services is more involved in administering the business of the residential/institutional facility or group home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Plaintiff's duties as a supervisor can also be distinguished from the duties of an employee described in guidance from the DOL. In a DOL opinion letter analyzing whether an employee met the administrative exemption criteria, the DOL guidance highlighted the fact that a non-exempt employee \"does not supervise other employees.\" U.S. Dep't of Labor, Wage &amp; Hour Div., Opinion Letter (Aug. 29, 2005). Unlike the employee described in that letter, who was an advocate for people with disabilities, Plaintiff supervises and manages people who care for individuals with disabilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Conclusion About \"Directly Related\" Requirement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Plaintiff's primary duties, as explained above, are the kind encompassed by the administrative exemption because they are directly related to the management or general business operations of Defendant. Not only is she not engaged in \"producing\" the service Defendant provides, but many of her primary duties fall squarely within the specific categories of exempt work identified by the DOL. Because there is no\n   dispute of fact and Defendant has provided sufficient evidence to meet its burden, the Court finds that the \"directly related\" requirement is satisfied because Plaintiff's primary duties are directly related to the management or general business operations of her employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Exercise of Discretion and Independent Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Finally, with regard to the third requirement, whether an employee's primary duty includes exercising \"discretion and independent judgment\" in \"matters of significance,\" the DOL has explained that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   (a) To qualify for the administrative exemption, an employee's primary duty must include the exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance. In general, the exercise of discretion and independent judgment\n   <em>\n    involves the comparison and the evaluation of possible courses of conduct, and acting or making a decision after the various possibilities have been considered\n   </em>\n   . The term\n   <em>\n    \"matters of significance\" refers to the level of importance or consequence\n   </em>\n   of the work performed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   (b) The phrase \"discretion and independent judgment\" must be applied in the light of all the facts involved in the particular employment situation in which the question arises. Factors to consider when determining whether an employee exercises discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance include, but are not limited to: whether the employee has\n   <em>\n    authority to formulate, affect, interpret, or implement management policies or operating practices\n   </em>\n   ; whether the employee carries out major assignments in conducting the operations of the business;\n   <em>\n    whether the employee performs work that affects business operations to a substantial degree, even if the employee's assignments are related to operation of a particular segment of the business\n   </em>\n   ; whether the employee has authority to commit the employer in matters that have significant financial impact; whether the employee has authority to waive or deviate from established policies and procedures without prior approval; whether the employee has\n   <em>\n    authority to negotiate and bind the company on significant matters\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    whether the employee provides consultation or expert advice to management\n   </em>\n   ; whether the employee is involved in planning long- or short-term business objectives; whether the employee investigates and resolves matters of significance on behalf of management; and whether the employee represents the company in handling complaints, arbitrating disputes or resolving grievances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   (c) The exercise of discretion and independent judgment implies that the\n   <em>\n    employee has authority to make an independent choice, free from immediate direction or supervision. However, employees can exercise discretion and independent judgment even if their decisions or recommendations are reviewed at a higher level\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   (d) An employer's volume of business may make it necessary to employ a number of employees to perform the same or similar work. The fact that many employees perform identical work or work of the same relative importance does not mean that the work of each such employee does not involve the exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   (e) The exercise of discretion and independent judgment\n   <em>\n    must be more than the use of skill in applying well-established techniques, procedures or specific standards described in manuals or other sources.\n   </em>\n   See also \u00a7 541.704 regarding use of manuals. The exercise of discretion\n   and independent judgment also does not include clerical or secretarial work, recording or tabulating data, or performing other mechanical, repetitive, recurrent or routine work. An employee who simply tabulates data is not exempt, even if labeled as a \"statistician.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   (f) An employee\n   <em>\n    does not exercise discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance merely because the employer will experience financial losses if the employee fails to perform the job properly\n   </em>\n   . For example, a messenger who is entrusted with carrying large sums of money does not exercise discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance even though serious consequences may flow from the employee's neglect. Similarly, an employee who operates very expensive equipment does not exercise discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance merely because improper performance of the employee's duties may cause serious financial loss to the employer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20541.202\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). \"Federal Courts generally find that employees who meet at least two or three of these facts are exercising discretion and independent judgment, although a case-by-case analysis is required.\" Defining and Delimiting the Exemptions, 69 Fed. Reg. at 22,143.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Plaintiff clearly exercises discretion and independent judgment on matters of significance. First, Plaintiff has the \"authority to formulate, ... interpret, ... and implement ... operating policies,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20541.202\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , through her duty of developing and implementing training, Def.'s Ex. 3 (noting that Plaintiff's duties are to \"[d]evelop and coordinate meetings and training for staff, individuals and families regarding support and services within the sponsored residential\" and to \"[r]eview, receive and maintain the sponsor training folder\"). Like the EMTs in charge of training in\n   <em>\n    West\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff's primary duties of developing and coordinating training \"necessitates the exercise of precisely such judgment and discretion\" described in the regulations.\n   <em>\n    West\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"106016\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/137/752/#p764\">\n    137 F.3d at 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, Plaintiff has \"the authority to remove an individual from a sponsor's home if the program criteria are not being satisfied.\" Hernandez Decl. \u00b6 10. This authority is, essentially, authority to terminate contracts with the Sponsors by removing Clients from their homes. This is a matter of significance because maintaining these contracts and keeping Clients in Sponsors' homes is crucial to the operation of the business of providing home-based services through the Sponsors and third parties. Plaintiff has substantial authority to act on behalf of Defendant in this context. Third, Plaintiff's duties included giving input and advising her managers on significant matters such as admissions and discharges. Brown Decl. 15; Def.'s Ex. 3. Although Plaintiff may not have been the final decision maker, Brown Decl. 15, the regulations specifically provide that \"employees can exercise discretion and independent judgment even if their decisions or recommendations are reviewed at a higher level,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20541.202\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, because there is no dispute of material fact and the evidence put forth by Defendant is sufficient to satisfy its burden of proving that Plaintiff exercised discretion and independent judgment over matters of significance, this requirement has been met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Defendant has met its burden to prove that all requirements for application of the administrative exemption have been satisfied and, thus, Defendant is not subject to any liability for failure to pay Plaintiff for her overtime hours as Plaintiff was not\n   entitled to overtime pay. Because \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and [Defendant] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,\" this Court will grant summary judgment in Defendant's favor. Fed. R. Civ.
