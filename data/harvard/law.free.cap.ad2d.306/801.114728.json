Defendant contends, inter alia, that his plea of guilty to burglary in the first degree in exchange for a term of incarceration not to exceed 12 years was not knowing and vol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>untary because the court failed to advise him. of the mandatory period of postrelease supervision at the time of the plea. When defendant raised that contention on his direct appeal from the judgment of conviction, we noted in our decision therein that his contention was not preserved for our review, and we declined to exercise our power to review it as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice <em>(People v Minter, </em>295 AD2d 927 [2002], <em>lv denied </em>98 NY2d 712 [2002]). The court should have denied defendant\u2019s motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 (2) (b) because defendant\u2019s direct appeal from the judgment of conviction was pending at the time of the motion and there were sufficient facts in the record to permit adequate review of defendant\u2019s contention on the direct appeal. Instead, the court denied the motion as a matter of law, relying upon our decision in <em>People v Bloom </em>(269 AD2d 838 [2000],. <em>lv denied </em>94 NY2d 945 [2000]). The court\u2019s reliance on <em>Bloom </em>was misplaced. In <em>Bloom </em>(269 AD2d at 838), we determined that there was no need for the sentencing court to specify a period of postrelease supervision inasmuch as, pursuant to Penal Law \u00a7 70.45 (2), the period of postrelease supervision is five years unless a shorter period is specified by the court.
