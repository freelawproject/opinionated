Petitioner failed to file a statutorily mandated notice of claim within 90 days of the accident; instead she filed her motion for leave with the clerk of court exactly one year and 90 days from the accrual date of her cause of action <em>(see </em>General Municipal Law \u00a7 50-e [5]; Public Authorities Law \u00a7 1212 [2]). Since there was no pending action, the application for relief constituted a special proceeding which is commenced by filing and was timely (CPLR 304; <em>Rybka v New York City Health &amp; Hosps. Corp., </em>263 AD2d 403, 404 [1999]). Although the motion was timely, petitioner failed to demonstrate an excuse for leave. She claimed her failure to file a timely notice of claim resulted from physical incapacitation. However, by her own admission, that only lasted until several months after the accident, specifically December 1, 2000. There is no claim, much less medical verification, that there was anything which prevented her from timely filing a notice of claim within the original 90 days and the motion should have been denied <em>(Burgos v City of New York, </em>294 AD2d 177 [2002]; <em>Potts v City of N.Y. Health &amp; Hosps. Corp, </em>270 AD2d 129 [2000]; <em>Matter of Gomez v City of New York, </em>250 AD2d 443 [1998], <em>lv denied </em>92 NY2d 809 [1998]).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>Concur \u2014 Buckley, P.J., Sullivan, Rosenberger, Wallach<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and Friedman, JJ.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b42-7\"> Deceased June 1, 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
