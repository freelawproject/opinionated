Conclusion...............................................................1230</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-10\">This multi-district litigation arises out of Plaintiffs\u2019 purchase of vehicles designed, manufactured, distributed, marketed and sold by Defendants Toyota Motor Corporation dba Toyota Motor North America, Inc. (\u201cTMC\u201d), and its subsidiary, Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. (\u201cTMS\u201d) (collectively, \u201cToyota\u201d or \u201cDefendants\u201d). Presently before the Court are Toyota\u2019s Motions to Dismiss claims asserted by Plaintiffs claiming personal injury and/or wrongful death as a result of events of sudden, unintended acceleration (\u201cSUA\u201d) of Toyota vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-11\">This ruling applies to all of Toyota\u2019s Motions to Dismiss (specifically, to Docket Nos. 335, 377, 409, 489, 495), unless otherwise noted. It also applies to the Motion to Dismiss filed by Defendant The Hertz Corporation (Docket No. 372), which incorporates Toyota\u2019s Motion to Dismiss (Docket No. 335) as to the negligence claim. Because the substance of all of the listed motions is the same, for efficiency, the Court cites only to Defendants\u2019 Memorandum of Points and Authorities (Docket No. 335) (\u201cDefs.\u2019 Mem.\u201d). Similarly, to the extent the substance of all exemplar complaints cited by Toyota is the same, the Court cites only to the <em>Roberts </em>complaint in the discussion sections that follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-14\">1. <em>Factual Allegations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1273-15\">In support of its Motions to Dismiss certain personal injury/wrongful death complaints, Toyota cites to four exemplar complaints.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The complaints collectively raise the following claims under California law: (1) negligence, (2) products liability, (3) breach of express and implied warranties, and (4) fraudulent concealment. The individual factual allegations contained therein are summarized below. As it must pursuant to the relevant legal standard, for the purposes of Toyota\u2019s Motions to Dismiss, the Court accepts as true all wellpled factual allegations set forth in the complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-16\">A. <em>Roberts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1273-17\">Plaintiff Omar Roberts (\u201cRoberts\u201d) is a resident of Brooklyn, New York. (\u00b6 24.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1218\">*1218</page-number>Roberts was the owner of a 2009 Toyota Camry. (\u00b626.) On October 7, 2008, Roberts was driving his Toyota Camry at a safe rate of speed when the vehicle \u201csuddenly accelerated at a high rate of speed and he was unable to stop the vehicle by braking.\u201d (\u00b6 27.) Roberts\u2019 car struck the car in front of him, and as a result of the collision, Roberts suffered numerous traumatic injuries, including broken legs and torn tendons. (\u00b6\u00b6 27-28.) Residual effects of the accident continue to impact Roberts\u2019 daily life, including his mobility. (\u00b6 28.) At all relevant times, Roberts was unaware of his vehicle\u2019s hidden defects. (\u00b6 26.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-4\">B. <em>Scott</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1274-5\">Plaintiffs Saundra Hill Scott (\u201cMrs. Scott\u201d) and Raleigh Scott (\u201cMr. Scott\u201d), husband and wife, reside in Lee County, Florida. (\u00b6 12.) On April 12, 2010, while Mrs. Scott was driving her 2004 Toyota Prius in Miami Gardens, Florida, the Prius suddenly and unexpectedly accelerated. (\u00b6\u00b6 19-20.) Mrs. Scott attempted to control the sudden acceleration by stepping on the brake pedal. (\u00b6 20.) However, the vehicle would not stop and instead accelerated through four lanes of traffic, and collided -with a fence and a tree. <em>(Id.) </em>The Florida Traffic Crash Report associated with the incident read, \u201cDriver 1 stated the accelerator of the vehicle got stuck and she could not control the vehicle.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>The crash resulted in injury and damage to Mrs. Scott.

Akamike purchased a 2007 Toyota Camry, alleging that at the time of purchase, he thought \u201che was investing in a safe and reliable vehicle\u201d and that he was \u201cunaware of the vehicle\u2019s concealed and potentially lethal defects of which Toyota was or should have been aware.\u201d (\u00b6 16.) On December 15, 2009, Akamike was driving his Toyota Camry when his car \u201csuddenly accelerated, causing the car to flip several times before coming to a stop.\u201d (\u00b6 17.) Akamike suffered general bruising over his entire body, left shoulder pain, and a large subdural hematoma. (\u00b6 19.) The day after the accident, Akamike \u201cwas found unresponsive\u201d and transported by ambulance to a nearby medical center, where he was diagnosed as having a head injury.

Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). The Court recently discussed this standard and the applicable case law in its Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Toyota\u2019s Motion to Dismiss and Motion to Strike the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1219\">*1219</page-number>Economic Loss Plaintiffs\u2019 Master Consolidated Complaint (Docket No. 510 at 32) (\u201cEconomic Loss Order\u201d). The Court adopts that discussion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-5\">III. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Products Liability and Negligence Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1275-6\">Toyota argues that Plaintiffs\u2019 products liability and negligence claims are deficient under <em>Twombly </em>and <em>Iqbal </em>because they fail to offer specific allegations of an actual defect in Toyota\u2019s electronic throttle control system (\u201cETCS\u201d or \u201cETCS-i\u201d). (Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 7.) According to Toyota, Plaintiffs do not identify or describe any alleged defect in the ETCS-i, or sufficiently allege that the ETCS-i defect was a substantial factor in causing any of the accidents that led to Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. (Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 8.) Instead, Plaintiffs rely on conclusory allegations regarding past incidents of SUA events compiled from media reports, NHTSA databases, and third party complaints. (Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 7.) In Toyota\u2019s view, because products liability and negligence claims must be plausible, Plaintiffs\u2019 failure to identify \u201cwhat specific defect, if any, is causing the alleged [SUA] events\u201d renders their allegations insufficient. (Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 11.) Thus, Toyota reasons, Plaintiffs\u2019 products liability and negligence claims should be dismissed because Plaintiffs have \u201cconcluded, not shown, that the subject accidents were caused by a specific defect in the ETCS-i.\u201d (Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 14.) Toyota concludes, therefore, that \u201c[i]f the holdings of <em>Iqbal </em>and <em>Twombly </em>have any purpose, it is that the Toyota Defendants do not have to guess or speculate as to Plaintiffs\u2019 allegation of the cause of the alleged acceleration events.\u201d (Defs.\u2019 Reply at 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-7\">Plaintiffs respond that they properly allege that their Toyota vehicles are defective because they suddenly accelerate on their own and lack a brake override system to prevent, mitigate, or stop an SUA event. (Pltfs.\u2019 Opp\u2019n at 5.) Plaintiffs allege that their vehicles failed to perform as safely as an ordinary consumer would expect when used in an intended or reasonably foreseeable manner, and Plaintiffs argue that they are not required to plead, let alone prove at trial, a more specific \u201cdefect\u201d to prevail under California design defect law. (Pltfs.\u2019 Opp\u2019n at 5-6.) Moreover, under <em>Twombly </em>and <em>Iqbal, </em>Plaintiffs contend that their claims suffice because \u201c \u2018the very nature of a products liability action\u2019 makes it difficult \u2018to know with specificity before discovery what was the likely source of the defect,\u2019 or \u2018to pinpoint a specific source of a defect.\u2019 \u201d (Pltfs.\u2019 Opp\u2019n at 8 (quoting <em>Bailey v. Janssen Pharmaceutica, Inc., </em>288 Fed.Appx. 597, 605-07 (11th Cir.2008)).) Thus, Plaintiffs argue that by \u201cdetailing the product\u2019s problem, the consequences of that problem,\u201d alleging that Plaintiffs \u201cused the product,\u201d and the \u201cconsequences that occurred[,]\u201d their allegations \u201care more than sufficient\u201d under <em>Iqbal </em>to \u201cnudge claims across the line from conceivable to plausible.\u201d (Pltfs.\u2019 Opp\u2019n at 8 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).) Plaintiffs describe in detail the SUA problem with Toyota vehicles, the alleged causes of SUA, Plaintiffs\u2019 use of the products in an ordinary and reasonably foreseeable manner, and the adverse consequences of that use. (Pltfs.\u2019 Opp\u2019n at 11.) For these reasons, Plaintiffs argue that Toyota\u2019s motion should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-9\">A. <em>Products Liability Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1275-10\">\u201cA manufacturer may be held strictly liable for placing a defective product on the market if the plaintiffs injury results from a reasonably foreseeable use of the product.\u201d <em>Saller v. Crown Cork &amp; Seal Co., Inc., </em>187 Cal.App.4th 1220, 1231, 115 Cal.Rptr.3d 151 (2010). California recognizes strict liability for three types of products liability claims: design defects, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>manufacturing defects, and warning defects. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1276-4\">Here, each exemplar complaint asserts products liability claims for design and warning defects. It appears that the <em>Scott </em>and <em>Riegel Breit </em>complaints also assert claims for manufacturing defects. The Court addresses the sufficiency of the pleadings under each theory of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-5\">1. <em>Design Defects</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1276-6\">\u201cDefective design may be established under two theories: (1) the consumer expectations test, which asks whether the product performed as safely as an ordinary consumer would expect when used in an intended and reasonably foreseeable manner; or (2) the risk/benefit test, which asks whether the benefits of the challenged design outweigh the risk of danger inherent in the design.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1231-32, 115 Cal.Rptr.3d 151. The consumer expectations test is used when \u201c \u2018the product is one within the common experience of ordinary consumers.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1232, 115 Cal.Rptr.3d 151 (quoting <em>Campbell v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>32 Cal.3d 112, 127, 184 Cal.Rptr. 891, 649 P.2d 224 (1982)). If the facts do not \u201cpermit an inference that the product\u2019s performance did not meet minimum safety expectations of its ordinary users,\u201d the design defect must be analyzed under the risk-benefit test. <em>Id. </em>at 1233, 115 Cal.Rptr.3d 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-7\">To meet the strictures of <em>Twombly </em>and <em>Iqbal, </em>Plaintiffs should identify which design defect theory is being utilized and allege facts to support that theory. <em>Lucas v. City of Visalia, </em>726 F.Supp.2d 1149, 1155 (E.D.Cal.2010). For example, under the \u201cconsumer expectations test,\u201d plaintiff \u201c \u2018should <em>describe how </em>the [product] failed to meet the minimum safety expectations of an ordinary consumer\u2019 \u201d of that product. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Altman v. HO Sports Co., </em>No. 1:09-ev-1000 AWI SMS, 2009 WL 4163512, at *8 (E.D.Cal. Nov. 19, 2009)) (italics in original). Similarly, under the \u201crisk-benefit test,\u201d a plaintiff \u201cshould allege that the risks of the design outweigh the benefits, and then \u201cexplain how the particular design of the [product] caused [plaintiff] harm\u201d.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Altman, </em>2009 WL 4163512, at *8). A bare allegation that the product \u201csuffered from a \u2018design defect\u2019 is an insufficient legal conclusion\u201d under <em>Twombly </em>and <em>Iqbal. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1276-11\">Here, the Court finds that the exemplar complaints allege sufficient facts under both the consumer expectations and risk-benefit tests. For example, the <em>Roberts </em>complaint alleges that Plaintiff was \u201cdriving at a safe rate of speed\u201d when the \u201cvehicle suddenly accelerated at a high rate of speed.\u201d (\u00b6 27.) Plaintiff was \u201cunable to stop the vehicle by braking\u201d and consequently \u201cstruck the car ahead of him,\u201d (\u00b6 27), resulting in numerous injuries including \u201cbroken legs and torn tendons.\u201d (\u00b6 28.) Plaintiff further alleges that Toyota vehicles with \u201cthe electronic throttle control system ... contain design defects that cause sudden and uncontrolled acceleration to speeds of up to 100 miles per hour or more,\u201d (\u00b6 6), and that these vehicles are defective because they experience SUA events and \u201clack a mechanism, such as a brake override system, to prevent, mitigate, or stop [an SUA] event.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (\u00b6 7.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1221\">*1221</page-number>Plaintiff identifies three design defects that cause or contribute to SUA events, including: (1) an inadequate fault detection system (\u00b6 9), (2) an ETCS system that is \u201chighly susceptible to malfunction caused by various electronic failures, including ... short circuits, software glitches, and electromagnetic interference from outside sources,\u201d (\u00b6 10), and (3) the absence of a brake override system. (\u00b6 11.) According to Plaintiff, \u201c[tjhese defects alone, or in combination, render certain Toyota vehicles unreasonably dangerous and unable to perform as an ordinary consumer would expect.\u201d (\u00b6 12.) By 2007, Toyota was aware that a brake override system could prevent the SUA defect and \u201ccould have easily implemented a brake override system,\u201d (\u00b6\u00b6 13-14), but instead \u201chid the problem and proposed inadequate and misleading solutions\u201d that led to \u201cnumerous fatalities and injuries, including those suffered by Plaintiff.\u201d (\u00b6 20.) Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff brings claims for design defects under the consumer expectations test (\u00b6 158) and risk-benefit test (\u00b6 159).</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-5\">The Court has no trouble discerning sufficient facts in the <em>Roberts </em>complaint that support a design-defect claim under the consumer expectations test and the risk-benefit test. Under the consumer expectations test, Toyota vehicles do not meet consumer expectations because they suddenly and unexpectedly accelerate and cannot be stopped upon proper application of the brake pedal, which happened to Plaintiff Roberts and caused his crash and injuries. Similarly, under the risk-benefit test, the ETCS-i system is defective because it causes SUA events owing to an inadequate fault detection system, electronic failures, and the absence of a brake override system, and the risks of SUA are not outweighed by any purported benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-7\">Toyota argues that Plaintiffs \u201cfail to identify a defective cause of the alleged acceleration incidents\u201d and, as an issue of \u201cfair notice,\u201d Plaintiffs must state \u201cwhat is allegedly wrong with the vehicles other than conjecture that a brake override system could prevent an occurrence.\u201d (Defs.\u2019 Reply at 2.) Toyota demands a level of specificity that is not required at the pleadings stage. The defect is identified: Plaintiffs\u2019 cars suddenly and unexpectedly accelerate and do not stop upon proper application of the brake pedal. Causes of the defect are identified: an inadequate fault detection system and electronic failures. An alternative design (that allegedly would have prevented the defect from injuring Plaintiffs) is identified: a brake override system. These allegations do more than merely recite the elements required for design defect claims under California law, and plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-8\">Accordingly, Toyota\u2019s motion is denied as it pertains to Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of design defects.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1277-9\">2. <em>Warning Defect</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1277-10\">Under a \u201cwarning defect\u201d theory, \u201ca product may be defective even though it is manufactured or designed flawlessly.\u201d <em>Saller, </em>187 Cal.App.4th at 1238, 115 Cal. Rptr.3d 151. Liability under this theory \u201crequires that the manufacturer knows, or should have known, of the danger of the product at the time it is sold or distributed,\u201d and that \u201cthe plaintiff prove that defendant \u2018did not adequately warn of a particular risk that was known or knowable in light of the generally recognized and prevailing best scientific and medical knowledge available at the time of the manufacture and distribution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Anderson v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1222\">*1222</page-number><em>Corp., </em>53 Cal.3d 987, 1002-03, 281 Cal.Rptr. 528, 810 P.2d 549 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-4\">Here, the Court finds that the exemplar complaints allege sufficient facts to establish a claim for a \u201cwarning defect.\u201d For example, the <em>Roberts </em>complaint alleges the danger of SUA, (\u00b6 6), and that \u201cToyota was aware of the defective nature of the acceleration control and throttle system in its vehicles since at least 2002, but failed to adequately and accurately disclose these facts to Plaintiff, the public, and NHTSA.\u201d (\u00b6 105.) Paragraphs 49 through 78 contain allegations about Toyota\u2019s knowledge of the alleged defects, including numerous consumer complaints and investigations by NHTSA. Paragraphs 105 through 125 contain allegations that Toyota concealed the danger of these defects from the public, including hiding reports of SUA and denying that SUA existed. Paragraphs 126 through 129 contain allegations that Toyota tried to cover up the alleged ETCS-i defects by focusing on mechanical problems with the floor mats and sticky pedals. Plaintiff also alleges that he did not know of the dangers of SUA. (\u00b6 26, 168.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-30\">Taken together, these allegations are sufficient to support a claim under a warning defect theory of liability: the particular risk allegedly known by Toyota was SUA, and that risk was not disclosed to Plaintiff. To the extent that Toyota argues more specificity is required, the Court disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-31\">Accordingly, Toyota\u2019s motion is denied as it pertains to Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of warning defects.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1278-32\">3. <em>Manufacturing Defects</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1278-33\"> Under a \"manufacturing defect\u201d theory, \u201c \u2018a defective product is one that differs from the manufacturer\u2019s intended result or from other ostensibly identical units of the same product line.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lucas, </em>726 F.Supp.2d at 1154 (quoting <em>Barker v. Lull Eng\u2019g Co., </em>20 Cal.3d 413, 429, 143 Cal.Rptr. 225, 573 P.2d 443 (1978)). The \u201cmanufacturing defect\u201d theory posits that \u201ca suitable design is in place, but that the manufacturing process has in some way deviated from that design.\u201d <em>In re Coordinated Latex Glove Litig., </em>99 Cal.App.4th 594, 613, 121 Cal.Rptr.2d 301 (2002). To satisfy <em>Twombly </em>and <em>Iqbal, </em>plaintiffs should <em>\u201cidentify/explain how </em>the [product] either deviated from [defendant\u2019s] intended result/design or <em>how </em>the [product] deviated from other seemingly identical [product] models.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1155 (italics in original) (citing <em>Barker, </em>20 Cal.3d at 429, 143 Cal.Rptr. 225, 573 P.2d 443). \u201cA bare allegation that the [product] had \u2018a manufacturing defect\u2019 is an insufficient legal conclusion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1278-39\">Here, the Court finds that the <em>Scott </em>and <em>Riegel Breit </em>complaints do not adequately assert claims for manufacturing defects under <em>Twombly </em>and <em>Iqbal. </em>For example, the <em>Scott </em>complaint alleges that the \u201cETCS systems and their various components were defectively designed <em>and manufactured </em>in that they were highly susceptible to malfunction caused by various electronic failures, including but not limited to short circuits and electromagnetic interference from electromagnetic sources outside the vehicle.\u201d (\u00b6 2 (italics added).) Plaintiff further alleges that \u201cthe Subject Prius, which was being used in a reasonably foreseeable manner, failed to perform as an ordinary consumer would have expected, <em>failed to conform with its manufacturing specifications, </em>failed to contain adequate warnings, and its design was a substantial factor in causing injuries.\u201d (\u00b6 130 (italics added).) Taken together, these two allegations seemingly allege a manufacturing defect. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1223\">*1223</page-number>the <em>Scott </em>complaint does not offer any allegations of how the vehicle deviated from Toyota\u2019s intended design or other product models. <em>See Lucas, </em>726 F.Supp.2d at 1155. Instead, the <em>Scott </em>complaint offers bare allegations of a manufacturing defect, and thus dismissal is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-5\">Accordingly, Toyota\u2019s motion is granted as it pertains to Scott and Riegel Breit\u2019s allegations of manufacturing defects.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The dismissal is without prejudice.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1279-6\">With respect to Plaintiffs\u2019 design and warning defect claims, Toyota cannot credibly claim that it does not comprehend Plaintiffs\u2019 theory from the pleadings, nor that it is handicapped in responding to the Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-7\">B. <em>Negligence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1279-8\">A negligence claim under California law requires plaintiff to allege that defendant \u201cowed [plaintiff] a legal duty, breached the duty, and that the breach was a proximate or legal cause of [plaintiffs] injury.\u201d <em>Gonzalez v. Autoliv ASP, Inc., </em>154 Cal.App.4th 780, 793, 64 Cal.Rptr.3d 908 (2007). \u201cIn the context of a products liability lawsuit, \u2018[u]nder a negligence theory, a plaintiff must also prove ... \u201cthat the defect in the product was due to negligence of the defendant.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Merrill v. Navegar, Inc., </em>26 Cal.4th 465, 479, 110 Cal.Rptr.2d 370, 28 P.3d 116 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-12\">Here, Toyota does not specifically challenge any particular element required for a negligence claim. Instead, Toyota broadly attacks the exemplar complaints on the same grounds that it challenged Plaintiffs\u2019 products liability claims, namely: Plaintiffs \u201cfail to identify a defective cause of the alleged acceleration incidents,\u201d and as an issue of \u201cfair notice\u201d Plaintiffs must state \u201cwhat is allegedly wrong with the vehicles other than conjecture that a brake override system could prevent an occurrence.\u201d (Defs.\u2019 Reply at 2.) The Court rejects Toyota\u2019s arguments for the reasons previously stated: Plaintiffs identify the alleged defect (i.e., Plaintiffs\u2019 cars suddenly and unexpectedly accelerate and do not stop upon proper application of the brake pedal), identify causes of the defect (e.g., an inadequate fault detection system and electronic failures), identify an alternative design that would have prevented the defect from injuring Plaintiffs (i.e., a brake override system), allege that the SUA risk was known by Toyota, and allege that Toyota did not disclose or eliminate the risk to Plaintiffs that culminated in Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1224\">*1224</page-number>Accordingly, Toyota\u2019s motion is denied as it pertains to Plaintiffs\u2019 negligence claims. Because the Court denies Toyota\u2019s motion, the Court similarly denies defendant The Hertz Corporation\u2019s motion to dismiss Count III of the Izenstark complaint for negligence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (Docket No. 372.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-4\">C. <em>Conclusion for Products Liability and Negligence Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"ARp\">Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the Court grants Toyota\u2019s Motion to Dismiss the manufacturing defect claims in the <em>Scott </em>and <em>Riegel Breit </em>complaints, but otherwise holds that Plaintiffs have adequately alleged their products liability and negligence claims. The Plaintiffs in <em>Scott </em>and <em>Riegel Breit </em>are granted leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-5\">IV. <em>Breach of Express and Implied Warranties</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1280-6\">The Court\u2019s previous rulings regarding the express and implied warranty claims, set forth in the Court\u2019s Economic Loss Order, are generally applicable to these same claims asserted by Plaintiffs in the personal injury/wrongful death cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-7\">In the Economic Loss Order, the Court dismissed with prejudice the express written warranty claims to the extent those claims were premised on defects in design rather than on defects in materials and workmanship. (Economic Loss Order at 57-59.) The remaining express written warranty claims, i.e., those premised on defects in materials and workmanship, are subject to the added requirement that a Plaintiff plead that he or she sought repairs, including in response to the recalls, during the relevant warranty period. <em>(Id. </em>at 52-55.) The claims of those Plaintiffs who cannot allege that they sought repairs during the relevant warranty period are dismissed with prejudice. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1280-10\">Examining the four exemplar complaints, <em>supra </em>n. 1, two do not assert express warranty claims. <em>(See generally Akamike </em>FAC, <em>Roberts </em>FAC.) The two remaining exemplar complaints make only conclusory allegations regarding non-design defects that are insufficient to state an express warranty claim, and make no allegations regarding whether they sought repair during the relevant warranty period. <em>(See Scott </em>\u00b6 130 (vehicle \u201cfailed to conform with its manufacturing specifications\u201d); <em>Riegel Breit </em>\u00b6 1 (referring to \u201celectronic defects\u201d), \u00b6 127 (alleging that the vehicle was \u201cdefectively ... manufactured\u201d); <em>cf. </em>Roberts FAC \u00b6\u00b6 8-11 (making detailed factual allegations regarding \u201cat least three design defects,\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> including \u201cinadequate fault detections systems,\u201d \u201ccomponents [that] are highly susceptible to malfunctions ... such as short circuits, software glitches, and electromagnetic interference,\u201d and the \u201clack of a brake override system\u201d); <em>Akamike </em>FAC \u00b6\u00b6 8-11 (same).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-11\">The express warranty claims set forth in the exemplar complaints are therefore dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1225\">*1225</page-number>In the Economic Loss Order, as to the implied warranty claim,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the Court rejected a \u201cdangerous instrumentality\u201d argument substantially identical to that raised by Plaintiffs in response to the present Motions, which the Court rejects here as well. <em>(Id. </em>at 69-70.) Nevertheless, the Court denied the Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 implied warranty claims, notwithstanding the lack of vertical privity, because Plaintiffs have sufficiently pled then-third party beneficiary status. <em>(Id. </em>at 66-68.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-5\">Here, none of the exemplar complaints set forth any factual allegations regarding the Plaintiffs\u2019 third party beneficiary status. As such, the implied warranty claims are dismissed without prejudice.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1281-6\">V. <em>Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1281-7\">Although at the time of the briefing of the Motions to Dismiss, the parties addressed the viability of a claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fan-dealing (\u201cbad faith claim\u201d) under the present facts, upon a review of the current versions of the exemplar complaints to which Defendants\u2019 Motions to Dismiss refer, the Court finds no bad faith claim asserted. <em>(Compare, e.g., </em>Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 92-98, <em>Ross, et al. v. Toyota Motor Corp., et al., </em>10-5700 (Docket No. 1) (setting forth bad faith claim) <em>with Ross </em>FAC (Docket No. 10) (no bad faith claim asserted).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-11\">Thus, the Court does not analyze the viability of a bad faith claim at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-12\">VI. <em>Fraudulent Concealment, Intentional &amp; Negligent Misrepresentation, and Rule 9(b)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1281-13\">A. <em>Rule 9(b)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1281-14\">\n<em>1.

The Court recently summarized the case law applicable to Rule 9(b)\u2019s particularity requirement in its Economic Loss Order. (Docket No. 510 at 34-36, 77-78.) The Court adopts that discussion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-16\">2. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1281-17\">Toyota argues that Plaintiffs fail to identify \u201ca single instance where Toyota directed a single material misrepresentation toward a single plaintiff, much less a material misrepresentation made with knowledge of its falsity.\u201d (Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 28.) However, Plaintiffs\u2019 fraud theory is based on fraudulent concealment, not active misrepresentation.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> None of the exemplar complaints contain claims for misrepresentation or negligent misrepresentation.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>The Court finds that Plaintiffs have sufficiently pled fraud under Rule 9(b) to survive a motion to dismiss. In the exemplar complaints, Plaintiffs plead that Toyota concealed from Plaintiffs material facts regarding the SUA defect <em>(e.g., Roberts, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 6-10, 75(b), 109-14, 125), going as far back as 2002 <em>(e.g., Roberts, </em>\u00b6 50), for the purposes of avoiding escalating recall and public relations costs <em>(e.g., Roberts, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 100, 133, 135-36). Rather than disclosing the SUA defect to consumers, Toyota often blamed consumers for SUA-related problems. <em>(Roberts, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 70, 139.) These factual allegations state the \u201cwho, what, when, where, and how\u201d of the fraudulent concealment. Thus, Rule 9(b) is satisfied.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1282-4\">B. <em>Fraudulent Concealment </em>1. <em>Legal Standard</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1282-5\">The Court recently summarized the case law applicable to fraudulent concealment and the duty to disclose under California law in its Economic Loss Order. (Docket No. 510 at 78-79, 81-86.) The Court adopts that discussion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-6\">2. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1282-7\">Toyota argues that Plaintiffs cannot allege that Toyota had an independent duty to disclose facts regarding the alleged ETCS defect because Toyota did not have exclusive knowledge of material facts that were not known or knowable to Plaintiffs, Toyota did not conceal any material facts where no Plaintiff alleges having made an investigation or having sought information from Toyota, and Toyota\u2019s opinions regarding the quality of its products are not actionable as representations of fact. (Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 21, 23, 24.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-8\">Plaintiffs contend that Toyota had a duty to disclose the alleged defect because Toyota (a) occupied a superior position of knowledge regarding the condition of its vehicles; (b) made partial disclosures about the safety and quality of the subject vehicles without revealing their defective nature; and (c) fraudulently and affirmatively concealed the defective nature of the subject vehicles from Plaintiffs. <em>(See, e.g., Roberts, </em>\u00b6 183.) Plaintiffs also contend that Toyota shared a relationship of \u201ctrust and confidence\u201d with its consumers such that a duty to disclose arises. (Pltfs.\u2019 Opp\u2019n at 14.) Lastly, Plaintiffs argue that a duty to disclose arises under California law regarding matters of public safety. <em>(Id. </em>at 20.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-12\">a. <em>Exclusive Knowledge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1282-13\">Toyota contends that the exemplar complaints do not include sufficient facts to support an exclusive knowledge claim. (Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 22.) Toyota also argues that Plaintiffs\u2019 exclusive knowledge claim is belied by the fact that the disputed facts were known and accessible to NHTSA, as well as part of the public <em>record. (Id. </em>at 23.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-14\">Plaintiffs argue that if the facts were known to NHTSA and the public, Toyota would not have acquiesced to paying NHTSA a record $16.4 million fine for belatedly disclosing defects. (Pltfs.\u2019 Opp\u2019n at 18.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-15\">As an initial matter, the Court is mindful that remedial action such as repairing sticky accelerator pedals (even if not disclosed to NHTSA within five business days, resulting in a fine) does not support a permissible inference that Toyota fraudulently concealed a defect. <em>See Tietsworth v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>No. 5:09-CV-00288 JF (HRL), 2009 WL 3320486, at *5 (Oct. 13, 2009 N.D.Cal. 2009). Toyota\u2019s payment of a fine to NHTSA regarding sticky accelerator pedals is irrelevant to whether Toyota fraudu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1227\">*1227</page-number>lently concealed an underlying ETCS/SUA defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-5\">The Court finds that the exemplar complaints allege facts sufficient to demonstrate exclusive knowledge. While some facts surrounding SUA events were known to NHTSA and/or the public early on (e.g., <em>Roberts, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 52, 58), and others came to light more recently <em>(e.g., Roberts, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 73, 75(b), 81), Plaintiffs allege that Toyota had exclusive knowledge of the sheer magnitude and ongoing nature of the defect, as well as potential ways of identifying and correcting the defect. <em>See, e.g., Roberts, </em>\u00b6 50 (internal recognition of SUA complaints, dating back to 2002; failure to uncover cause); \u00b6 54 (internal Field Technical Report acknowledging that SUA was an \u201cextremely serious problem for customers,\u201d expressing fear \u201cof the frequency of this problem in near future\u201d); \u00b6 58 (knowledge of greater than 400% difference in SUA complaints in Camry models with ETCS not disclosed to consumers); \u00b6 60 (receipt of a forensic report concluding presence of an ETCS defect); \u00b6 90 (knowledge that recalls will not fix the problem and that software problems, faulty cruise control, and engine revs from using the air conditioning may be involved); \u00b6 93 (no error codes shown, so SUA cannot be documented or replicated); \u00b6 100 (convincing NHTSA to initially limit recall, saving Toyota over $100 million).</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-6\">Taking Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations as true, Toyota had a duty to disclose the concealed facts because it had exclusive knowledge of those facts. <em>See Falk v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>496 F.Supp.2d 1088, 1096 (N.D.Cal.2007) (sufficient allegations of exclusive knowledge where car manufacturer had exclusive access to aggregate dealership data, pre-release testing data, and numerous consumer complaints).</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-7\">Toyota\u2019s reliance on <em>Warner Constr. Corp. v. City of Los Angeles, 2 </em>Cal.3d 285, 294, 85 Cal.Rptr. 444, 466 P.2d 996 (1970), does not diminish this duty to disclose. The <em>Warner </em>court stated that one circumstance in which non-disclosure is actionable is when \u201cthe facts are known or accessible only to defendant, and defendant knows they are not known to or reasonably discoverable by the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1283-9\">While prospective customers could have been tipped off to the possibility of SUA by researching past complaints filed with NHTSA, many customers would not have performed such a search, nor would they be expected to. Moreover, searching publicly available information through NHTSA and/or the public record would have only revealed the tip of the iceberg, according to the factual allegations in Plaintiffs\u2019 complaints. Plaintiffs sufficiently allege facts that were known and accessible only to Toyota that were not known or reasonably discoverable by Plaintiffs. <em>See, e.g., Roberts, </em>\u00b6 54 (internal Field Technical Report acknowledging that SUA was an \u201cextremely serious problem for customers,\u201d expressing fear \u201cof the frequency of this problem in near future\u201d), \u00b6 90 (internal knowledge that recalls will not fix the problem and that software problems, faulty cruise control, and engine revs from using the air conditioning may be involved), \u00b6 106 (dealer Technical Service Bulletins acknowledging SUA), \u00b6\u00b6 109-14, 128, 134 (internal testing and knowledge of SUA), \u00b6 122 (engineer with knowledge of SUA not presented to NHTSA), \u00b6 125 (internal knowledge that aggregate number of complaints was approximately 37,900).</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-10\">Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged a duty to disclose based on exclusive knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-11\">b. <em>Concealment of Material Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1283-12\">Toyota argues that Plaintiffs cannot allege facts supporting the assertion that Toyota actively concealed information because Plaintiffs merely rely on conclusions regarding Toyota\u2019s interactions with NHTSA and others. (Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 23.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>The Court disagrees. Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient factual allegations to support a finding of active concealment at this stage based on alleged concealment of certain material facts. <em>See, e.g., Roberts, </em>\u00b6 14 (concealed knowledge that brake override could prevent SUA), \u00b6\u00b6 16, 18 (concealing fact that recall was a safety measure meant to address design defect, not just a \u201cconfidence\u201d booster); \u00b6\u00b6 17, 19(c) (recalls do not address design defect); \u00b6 50 (concealing discovery of SUA defect in 2002 and the fact that \u201cno known remedy exists ... at this time\u201d); \u00b6 53 (internal recognition of \u201cunwanted, acceleration\u201d in a Sienna); \u00b6 70 (dealer acknowledging SUA is \u201cnormal for this model,\u201d yet not acknowledged by Toyota overall); \u00b6 75(b) (ignoring 1,200 SUA complaints over eight-year period); \u00b6\u00b6 84, 87 (recalls do not address all SUA; Toyota hiding electronic defects); \u00b6 92 (erroneously asserting that the ETCS software could not be faulted); \u00b6 106 (dealer Technical Service Bulletins acknowledging SUA); \u00b6\u00b6 109-14 (concealment of internal testing and knowledge regarding SUA); \u00b6 118 (concealment of relevant complaints from NHTSA); \u00b6 121 (concealment of expert report regarding ETCS failure); \u00b6 122 (concealing engineer who knew of electronic failures from NHTSA); \u00b6 123 (removing reference to \u201cvehicle speed control\u201d problems); \u00b6 125 (concealing actual number of complaints received reached 37,900); \u00b6 128 (acknowledging it had a \u201cless defensible product\u201d); \u00b6 130 (knowledge of SUA defect for at least three years); \u00b6 134 (internal acknowledgment of SUA). Toyota cannot credibly claim that these facts, if true, are not material.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-4\">The foregoing allegations are sufficient to demonstrate active concealment at the pleadings stage. <em>See Tietsworth v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>720 F.Supp.2d 1123, 1134-36 (N.D.Cal.2010) (active concealment sufficiently alleged where Plaintiffs contacted defendant for service of defective machines and were told there was no defect and/or denied free service or replacement parts).</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-7\">While Toyota is correct that preventing a plaintiff from discovering an important fact is one way to demonstrate active concealment (Reply at 7, citing <em>Judicial Council of California Civil Jury Instructions </em>(\u201cCACI\u201d) No. 1901), it is not the only way. Active concealment standing alone is sufficient. <em>See </em>CACI No. 1901 (one method of proving concealment is for a plaintiff to demonstrate that defendant \u201cactively concealed an important fact from [plaintiff]\u201d). Whether Plaintiffs first sought to discover important facts before they were actively concealed is not controlling here. Plaintiffs plead fraudulent concealment, which by definition, means they could not be expected to seek facts which they had no way of knowing existed. <em>See Baggett v. Hewlett-Packard Co., </em>582 F.Supp.2d 1261, 1267 (C.D.Cal.2007) (fraudulent concealment allegations are not expected to point out the specific moment when defendant failed to act).</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-8\">Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged a duty to disclose based on concealment of material facts,</p>\n<p id=\"AHkn\">c. <em>Partial Representations</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ad-\">Toyota argues that Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that it made partial representations because the statements on which Plaintiffs rely are not representations of actionable facts, but rather general, vague, and unspecific assertions that a reasonable consumer would find to be promotional statements.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> (Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 25.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>Plaintiffs argue that many of their allegations concern misrepresentations of material facts, and where the speaker has special knowledge of the subject, even opinion statements may be construed as actionable factual misstatements. (Pltfs.\u2019 Opp\u2019n at 22 (citing <em>Furla v. Jon Douglas Co., </em>65 Cal.App.4th 1069, 1080-81, 76 Cal. Rptr.2d 911 (Cal.App.1998)).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-5\">The Court agrees that some of Toyota\u2019s alleged statements may fairly be characterized as generalized opinions <em>(e.g., Scott, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 63, 121 (\u201chigh quality, reliable, and dependable\u201d, \u201coutstanding quality, dependability, and peace of mind\u201d)). <em>See Oestreicher v. Alienware Corp., </em>544 F.Supp.2d 964, 973 (N.D.Cal.2008); <em>Anunziato v. eMachines, Inc., </em>402 F.Supp.2d 1133, 1140 (C.D.Cal.2005). These statements constitute \u201cpuffing\u201d and are not analogous to the type of opinion that may be construed as actionable under limited circumstances. <em>See 625 3rd St. Associates, L.P. v. Alliant Credit Union, </em>633 F.Supp.2d 1040, 1051-52 (N.D.Cal.2009) (construing CEO\u2019s opinion regarding the financial health and prospects of his company, when made in the context of a significant corporate transaction, as factual misstatements).</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-6\">However, other statements cited by Plaintiffs have a factual basis and may be proven true or false during discovery. <em>See, e.g., Roberts, </em>\u00b6 62 (stating to NHTSA there was \u201cno evidence of a system or component failure\u201d and \u201cvehicles operated as designed\u201d); \u00b6 65 (representation that water damage caused SUA, no abnormality in ETCS); \u00b666 (telling NHTSA the floor mat issue \u201cis not a safety concern\u201d); \u00b6 75 (claiming vehicles were not defective and subsequently being rebuked by NHTSA for being \u201cinaccurate\u201d and \u201cmisleading\u201d); \u00b6 118 (stating to NHTSA that no defect trend had emerged and that ETCS could not fail in unknown ways); \u00b6 126 (omitting reference to SUA in customer Q &amp; A document); \u00b6 137 (falsely stating that \u201cvehicle brakes would have restrained vehicle motion\u201d); \u00b6 138 (falsely stating that \u201cthere is no factor or trend indicating that a vehicle or component defect exists\u201d); \u00b6 139 (telling customer \u201c[i]t is virtually impossible for this type of [SUA] incident to happen.\u201d). The foregoing allegations demonstrate Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged actionable statements. <em>Anunziato, </em>402 F.Supp.2d at 1139 (\u201cWhile some of eMachines\u2019 representations constitute puffery, others do not.... [A]t least some actionable statements have been pled.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-9\">Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged a duty to disclose based on partial misrepresentations,</p>\n<p id=\"AGt\">d. <em>Trust and Confidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1285-10\">Plaintiffs recognize that they have not explicitly pleaded a \u201cfiduciary\u201d or \u201cconfidential\u201d relationship. (Pltfs.\u2019 Opp\u2019n at 14.) However, Plaintiffs argue nonetheless that they formed a relationship of \u201ctrust and confidence\u201d with Toyota, giving rise to a duty to disclose. <em>(Id.) </em>Plaintiffs support this argument by citing purposeful concealment of vehicle defects and partial representations regarding safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-11\">Plaintiffs conflate a duty to disclose under \u201cconcealment of material facts\u201d and \u201cpartial misrepresentations,\u201d as discussed above, with the type of relationship contemplated by <em>Ford v. Shearson Lehman/Am. Express, Inc., </em>180 Cal.App.3d 1011, 1020-22, 225 Cal.Rptr. 895 (1986). In <em>Shearson, </em>the trust and confidence arose out of a fiduciary relationship between a client and his security broker and investment adviser where the individual ceded control over his stockholdings, which were subsequently liquidated in a scheme by the fiduciaries. This case is dissimilar because Plaintiffs allege no facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1230\">*1230</page-number>in support of finding a fiduciary or other confidential relationship based on Plaintiffs ceding control to Toyota, or a particular vulnerability on Plaintiffs\u2019 part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-4\">Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not stated a duty to disclose under this factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-5\">e. Matters <em>of Public Safety</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1286-6\">Plaintiffs allege that the potential for SUA constitutes a safety hazard giving rise to a duty to disclose. (Pltfs.\u2019 Opp\u2019n at 20.) Toyota contends that alleging a safety risk does not on its own give rise to a duty to disclose, it merely establishes that the alleged nondisclosure relates to a material fact. (Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 26.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-7\">The Court finds that the risk of injury and/or death associated with the alleged SUA defect is the type of \u201cunreasonable risk\u201d that leads to a duty to disclose under California law. <em>Daugherty v. Am. Honda Motor Co., Inc., </em>144 Cal.App.4th 824, 886, 51 Cal.Rptr.3d 118 (Cal.App.2006). <em>See also Falk, </em>496 F.Supp.2d at 1096 (citing as further strength of plaintiffs\u2019 defect allegations \u201cthe [alleged] risk of inadvertent speeding, driving at unsafe speeds, and accidents\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-8\">For the foregoing reasons, Toyota\u2019s motions to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 fraudulent concealment claims are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-9\">C. <em>Misrepresentation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1286-10\">Toyota argues that, for the same reasons Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate partial misrepresentations of fact, Plaintiffs fail to state intentional and negligent misrepresentation claims.

The Court initially contemplated Toyota filing only two motions per issue, with the ruling on those cases to provide guidance on all other cases raising the same issue. (Docket No. 193 at 8.) However, Toyota has filed three main Motions to Dismiss that cite to four underlying complaints: <em>Roberts </em>FAC, <em>Scott, Akamike </em>FAC, and <em>Riegel Brett </em>(Docket No. 335, applicable to all personal injury/wrongful death cases; Docket No. 377, applicable to one case; and Docket No. 409, applicable to six cases.) In addition, Toyota has filed additional follow-on motions adopting its earlier briefing. (Docket Nos. 489, 495; <em>see also </em>Docket No. 499 (Amended Notice of Motion with updated chart identifying actions that have been voluntarily dismissed, complaints that have been amended, new actions that have been filed or transferred into the MDL, and actions that are expected to be transferred no later than the date of the hearing on the Motions to Dismiss).) While this structure of motions covering various overlapping complaints is not what the Court envisioned, the Court has nonetheless considered all complaints cited by Toyota and rules on all of the outstanding motions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1273-19\">. Here and elsewhere, citations to a complaint are citations to the operative complaint filed by the Plaintiff being discussed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1276-8\">. <em>But see Altman, </em>2009 WL 4163512 at *8 (holding that an allegation that the risks outweigh the benefits is unnecessary because defendant bears the ultimate burden of proof, but requiring plaintiff to allege that the design \"was a substantial factor in causing his injuries.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1276-12\">.

The Court also recognizes that Toyota's Motion to Dismiss is cast in slightly different terms than those granted by the Court. However, because <em>Twombly </em>and <em>Iqbal </em>are at the forefront of Toyota\u2019s motion, and the manufacturing defect claims in the <em>Scott </em>and <em>Riegel Breit </em>complaints clearly fail to meet <em>Twombly </em>and <em>Iqbal, </em>the Court grants Toyota\u2019s motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1279-10\">.

In opposition to the present Motions to Dismiss, Plaintiffs do not argue that third-party beneficiary status saves their implied warranty claims notwithstanding the lack of vertical privity. Nevertheless, the Court assumes Plaintiffs would request the opportunity to replead this issue, which appears to the Court, as pled in the MCC, to be equally applicable to Plaintiffs here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1281-19\">. While not necessarily required to allege fraudulent <em>concealment </em>under Rule 9(b), Plaintiffs allege many instances where Toyota made partial representations and misrepresentations, giving rise to a duty to disclose, as explained below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1281-20\">. Plaintiffs no longer assert claims for intentional and negligent misrepresentation in certain amended complaints. <em>(See, e.g., Akamike </em>FAC (Docket No. 8).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1282-9\">. Because the allegations in the exemplar complaints are nearly identical with respect to pleading particularity under Rule 9(b), the Court does not analyze them individually.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1284-5\">. Toyota makes similar arguments regarding allegedly false and/or misleading representations in their advertising materials with respect to claims falling under California Business and Professions Code \u00a7\u00a7 17200 and 17500. The Court does not address these arguments because none of the exemplar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>complaints, as amended, raise this type of claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
