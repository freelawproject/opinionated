R. 12(b)(1), moved to dismiss the MCC for lack of Article III standing and, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), moved to dismiss all claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. (Docket No. 329). Additionally, Defendants have moved to strike certain portions of the MCC (Docket No. 328). <em>(See also </em>Defs.\u2019 Mem. of Points and Authorities (Docket No. 332) (in support of both Motions) (hereinafter \u201cDefs.\u2019 Mem.\u201d). Plaintiffs have opposed both motions. (Docket No. 400; <em>see also </em>Defs.\u2019 Reply, Docket No. 450).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-7\">I. <em>Factual </em>Allegations<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1212-8\">From 2001 to the present, Defendants have sold tens of millions of vehicles, including models of Toyota, Lexus, and Scion, in the United States and throughout the world that use a fully electronic throttle control system (\u201cETCS\u201d). (\u00b6\u00b6 1, 76.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> An ETCS differs from a system using a mechanical throttle. <em>(See </em>\u00b6 2.) A mechanical throttle consists of a cable that connects the accelerator pedal and the engine. <em>(Id.) </em>In contrast, an ETCS does not operate with a cable; instead, in place of the cable, there are \u201ccomplex computer and sensor systems [that] communicate an accelerator pedal\u2019s position to the engine throttle, telling the vehicle how fast it should go.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Toyota began installing these electronic control systems in some Lexus models in 1998 and in Camry and Prius models in 2001 and 2002, and in all Toyota-made vehicles by 2006. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1212-12\">More specifically, Toyota calls its electronic throttle control system the ETCSintelligent, or \u201cETCS-i.\u201d (\u00b6 106.) ETCS-i activates the throttle utilizing the command from the driver\u2019s foot that is conveyed electronically from two position sensors in the accelerator pedal, processed in the engine control computer and then transmitted to the throttle. <em>(Id.) </em>Toyota began installing ETCS-i in models of the 1998 Lexus. <em>(Id.) </em>This earliest of version of Toyota\u2019s ETCS included a mechanical link that shut off the throttle. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1212-13\">In 2001, however, when Toyota redesigned what would become the 2002 Camry, it eliminated the mechanical link in the Camry and other models. (\u00b6 107.) When it did so, Toyota did not incorporate any type of manual fail-safe mechanism, as other auto manufacturers did. (\u00b6 108 (citing, <em>e.g., </em>an Audi system that mechanically closed the throttle when the brakes were applied).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-14\">Toyota has employed a number of electronic fail-safe strategies to prevent phenomena such as sudden unintended acceleration (\u201cSUA\u201d). <em>(See </em>\u00b6 109 (detailing fail-safe strategies employed by Toyota, in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>eluding circumstances under which an engine control computer should cause the engine to stall, reduce the throttle capacity by 70-75%, or close the throttle to idle).) Nevertheless, these strategies did not prevent incidents of SUA. (\u00b6 110; <em>see also </em>\u00b6 111 (suggesting other fail-safe methods that could have been employed).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-5\">Other makes of vehicles sold in the United States with electronic throttle control systems employ a \u201cbrake-override\u201d system that is designed to assign priority to an attempt by the driver to employ the brake notwithstanding any type of command to open the throttle. (\u00b6\u00b6 18, 247, 250; <em>see also </em>\u00b6 248 (\u201c \u2018If the brake and the accelerator are in an argument, the brake wins,\u2019 a spokesman at Chrysler said in describing the systems, which it began installing in 2003.\u201d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-6\">Since as early as 1996, Toyota vehicles have been marketed based on safety. <em>(See generally </em>\u00b6\u00b6 81-105.) For example, the ETCS\u2019s debut in the 1998 LEXUS vehicles was marketed as a safety improvement. (\u00b6 83 (marketed as a safety feature designed to enhance \u201cvehicle control\u201d).) The 2002 Camry was the subject of a press release regarding its \u201csafety and value.\u201d (\u00b6 84.) In their marketing materials, Toyota tied its improved technology, the ETCS, to improved safety. <em>(See, e.g., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 94-97.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-7\">Complaints to Toyota and governmental agencies regarding SUA began in 2002. On February 2, 2002, Toyota received its first consumer complaint of a 2002 Camry engine \u201csurging\u201d when the brakes were depressed. Toyota received ten other similar complaints before August 2002. (\u00b6 114.) A March 2002 internal Toyota document reveals Toyota was unable to discern a cause for the incidents of \u201csurging.\u201d (\u00b6 115.) In August 2002, Toyota released the first of at least three \u201cTechnical Service Bulletins\u201d regarding 2002 and 2003 Camry \u201csurging\u201d to its dealers. (\u00b6 116.) Toyota did not disclose the existence of these bulletins to consumers. <em>(Id.) </em>On August 31, 2002, Toyota recorded its first warranty claim to correct a throttle problem on a 2002 Camry. (\u00b6 117.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-9\">The following April, in 2003, after a consumer filed with the United States Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\u201cNHTSA\u201d) a report of SUA involving a 1999 Lexus, noting that 36 other complaints regarding \u201cvehicle speed control\u201d in these vehicles had been lodged on NHTSA\u2019s website, NHTSA opened Defect Petition DP03-003. (\u00b6 118.) Other reports followed, leading NHTSA to describe the problem to be investigated as \u201cthrottle control system fails to properly control engine speed resulting in vehicle surge.\u201d (\u00b6 119.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-10\">As revealed by the investigation, complaints of SUA tended to be significantly higher in Toyota vehicles with an ETCS rather than a mechanical throttle system. (\u00b6\u00b6 4, 122 (referring to an email from a NHTSA investigator from the Office of Defects Investigation (\u201cODI\u201d) to a Toyota official referring to a 400% difference in \u201cVehicle Speed\u201d complaints between a specific model with a mechanical throttle and as compared to a later year\u2019s version of the same model with an ETCS); <em>see also </em>\u00b6 5 (\u201cTwo of the top five categories of injury claims in NHTSA\u2019s Early Warning Reporting Database involved \u2018speed control\u2019 issues on the 2007 Lexus ES350 and Toyota Camry.\u201d); \u00b6 6 (referring to complaint data lodged with NHTSA), \u00b6 9 (referring to \u201cspeed control\u201d issues that resulted in death or injury); \u00b6\u00b6 124-27 (outlining statistical analyses of publicly available information regarding incidents of SUA in ETCS vehicles).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-11\">Nevertheless, after communications regarding the documents to be provided to NHTSA by Toyota, the investigation of DP03-003 was closed without any adverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1158\">*1158</page-number>findings. (\u00b6\u00b6 130-33.) Incidents of SUA continued to be reported, however, in 2004 and 2005. (\u00b6\u00b6 134-35.) Two subsequent Defect Petitions, one in 2005 and one in 2006, were investigated and closed without adverse findings. (\u00b6\u00b6 135^48.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-4\">Eventually, pursuant to a congressional investigation, Toyota disclosed that it had received over 37,900 complaints regarding SUA, including five incidents in which dealer service technicians themselves experienced and documented such incidents. (\u00b6\u00b6 149-54.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-5\">In March 2007, a NHTSA investigation regarding 2007 Lexus vehicles in which the floor mat interfered with the \u201cthrottle pedal\u201d or \u201caccelerator pedal\u201d was not expanded to include an investigation of ETCS. (\u00b6\u00b6 155-67.) Instead, Toyota recalled certain optional \u201cAll Weather Floor Mats\u201d on these vehicles. (\u00b6 168.) Two years later, a request to reopen this investigation was denied; the floor mat problem was \u201csuspected\u201d as causing the incident complained of, but the floor mat\u2019s role as a causal factor was not confirmed. (\u00b6\u00b6 190-95.) Similarly, in early 2008, an investigation of Tacomas and Siennas led to the conclusion that a trim panel on earlier models was responsible for accelerator problems and was remedied with a carpet replacement and retention clip. (\u00b6\u00b6 177-89.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-6\">Eventually, publicity regarding two accidents, led Toyota on September 29, 2009, to announce a floor mat recall involving approximately 3.8 million vehicles. (\u00b6 202.) One accident was a very high-profile fatal crash, caused by a mis-matched and improperly installed floor mat, and involved an off-duty police officer who was driving a Lexus lent to him by a dealership. <em>(See </em>\u00b6\u00b6 196-201). At the time of the floor mat recall, Toyota made statements to the media regarding NHTSA\u2019s supposed confirmation that, once the floor mats were properly installed, no other defect was present in the recalled vehicles. (\u00b6 205.) Within days, NHTSA clarified its statement in its own press release, stating that its position was that the floor mat recall was simply an interim measure and that it did not correct the underlying defect. (\u00b6 206.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-8\">On the same day that the floor mat recall was made in the United States, Toyota issued a Technical Information Bulletin to foreign Toyota distributors, identifying a procedure to repair \u201csticky accelerator pedals\u201d and sudden RPM increases and/or sudden acceleration. (\u00b6 203.) However, no similar bulletins were issued on that day in the United States, and no other steps were taken to address sticky accelerator pedals. <em>(Id.) </em>There was no mention in Toyota\u2019s September 29, 2009, Consumer Safety Advisory of sticky accelerator pedals; instead, the Advisory claimed that the sudden acceleration problem was caused by irregularities in the vehicles\u2019 floor mats. (\u00b6 204.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-9\">Internal communications from around that time reveal, however, that Toyota was aware of sticky accelerator pedal problems in the United States. (\u00b6\u00b6 209-13.) This defect was described as a mechanical failure in the pedals themselves rather than an ETCS failure. <em>(See e.g., </em>\u00b6 213.) Toyota representatives met with NHSTA officials in Washington, D.C., on January 19, 2010, about the problem, and on January 21, 2010, issued the sticky pedal recall, which affected approximately 2.3 million vehicles. (\u00b6 215.) On January 26, 2010, Toyota suspended sales of a number of models, resuming on February 5, 2010. (\u00b6 216.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-10\">In connection with this recall, NHTSA imposed a $16,375 million civil penalty on Toyota for its failure to inform NHTSA regarding the sticky pedal defect, which Toyota agreed to pay. (\u00b6 217.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-11\">Even after the floor mat and the sticky pedal recalls, however, incidents of SUA persisted, and Plaintiffs allege that \u201cToyota [continues to [wrongly] [d]eny [ETCS] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>[djefects,\u201d criticizing Toyota\u2019s testing of component parts and reiterating certain comments made by lawmakers in connection with a congressional investigation. (\u00b6 219 and subheading D at p. 97; <em>see also </em>\u00b6 221 (criticizing Toyota testing of ETCS component parts, which is delegated to suppliers); \u00b6224 (congressional statement regarding Toyota\u2019s failure to take into account the 400% increase in SUA in ETCS vehicles when compared to non-ETCS vehicles); \u00b6 226 (congressional statement criticizing a flawed expert report); \u00b6 228 (congressional statement criticizing the apparent attitude that the recalls have solved the SUA problem).) Plaintiffs also detail changes in quality control practices at one Toyota manufacturing plant. (\u00b6\u00b6 231-35.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-5\">Upon receipt of a claim for SUA, Toyota typically rejects any claim of defect and does not inform the claimant of the existence of hundreds or thousands of other, similar claims. (\u00b6 236.) In one instance, a claimant requested that Toyota address specific questions she had about how it reached its conclusion that her car suffered no defect when she had no floor mat on the drivers\u2019 side; Toyota did not explain its conclusion. (\u00b6\u00b6 238-41.) Similarly, when confronted with an engineering report attributing an SUA incident to the ETCS, Toyota claimed that \u201cthere have been no confirmed or documented reports or findings of any type of computer malfunctions related to the brake/acceleration or electrical systems.\u201d (\u00b6 242.) Denials were issued even where officers investigating an accident gave the opinion that, given the rough ride and the impact, it was unlikely that the driver continued to manually accelerate the vehicle. (\u00b6 243.) Additionally, a Toyota official \u201cfalsely stated on repeated occasions that \u2018the brakes will always override the throttle.\u2019 \u201d (\u00b6 244 (internal quotation marks omitted).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-7\">Plaintiffs attribute incidents of SUA to any number of specified electronic or mechanical issues, including the ETCS, floor mat interference, and sticky pedals. (\u00b6 245(l)-(2).) They also claim that SUA incidents may be due to the failure to develop and implement an appropriate fail-safe method (such as a brake-override system) and/or the failure to test and validate vehicle systems properly. (\u00b6 245(3)(4)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-8\">In response to a request for internal Toyota documents by a congressional committee investigated SUA complaints, Toyota identified 37,900 customer contact reports, randomly selected 3,430 of them, and determined that 1,008 of those reports were related to SUA. (\u00b6 12.) Toyota provided these documents to the congressional committee. <em>(Id.) </em>In the data the committee reviewed, telephone operators on the Toyota customer complaint line, relying on customer reports and information from dealer inspections, identified floor mats or sticky pedals as the cause of only 16% of the SUA incident reports. (\u00b6 15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-9\">Toyota eventually added a brake-override system as standard equipment in its 2011 model-year vehicles. (\u00b6\u00b6 18, 251.) On February 22, 2010, Toyota announced that it will provide brake-override systems as a \u201cconfidence booster\u201d (rather than a safety recall) on a number of models, but not on all models Plaintiffs claim are subject to the SUA defect.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (\u00b6\u00b6 18, 252-55.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-10\">Plaintiffs allege that Toyota officials have acknowledged that the SUA defect has not been completely remedied by the floor mat and \u201csticky pedal\u201d recalls. (\u00b6 20 (second-highest ranking North American executive, when asked, stated that recalls will \u201cnot totally\u201d solve the SUA problem); <em>see also </em>\u00b6\u00b6 21-23 (allegations regarding more generalized acknowledgment of safety failures by Toyota officials).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>As a result of publicity regarding the SUA defect, the value of Toyota cars diminished. (\u00b6\u00b6 24, 256.) Many consumers sought to return their cars out of fear that SUA could occur and cause catastrophic injury or death. (\u00b6 24.) Toyota has refused to take class members\u2019 vehicles back, and has refused to and cannot provide an adequate repair. (\u00b6\u00b6 24, 256, 257-59 (providing examples of diminution in value).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-4\">The individual Plaintiffs (or \u201cconsumer Plaintiffs\u201d) named in the MCC include Plaintiffs who are citizens of California, Illinois, Tennessee, Maryland, Florida, Massachusetts, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Washington, Missouri, Arizona, Iowa, New York, Nevada, Michigan, Colorado, Nebraska and Virginia. (\u00b6\u00b6 32-69.) Plaintiffs also include an individual who was motivated to buy a Toyota vehicle based upon their reputation for safety. (\u00b6 41.) Additionally, Plaintiffs include individuals who have experienced SUA, and those who have not experienced SUA but have nevertheless chosen not to use their vehicles since being notified of the potential for SUA. <em>(See, e.g., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 32, 37.) They include individuals whose requests for substitute vehicles have been refused, who have been directed by Toyota Customer Experience Center to file a claim with the National Center for Dispute Settlement (only to be informed by the National Center for Dispute Settlement that it could not resolve the claim), and who have been directed to file an arbitration claim. (\u00b6\u00b6 32, 40, 49.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-5\">The non-consumer Plaintiffs (or \u201ccommercial Plaintiffs\u201d) are a California auto dealership, a Missouri auto dealer, a New Jersey residual insurer/vehicle liquidator, and a Nevada corporation<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that operates a rental car business. Each commercial Plaintiff has purchased, or insured the residual value of, allegedly defective Toyota vehicles. (\u00b6\u00b6 71-74.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-10\">The Court repeats, as it stated above (n. 4), that the truth of these allegations is assumed at the pleadings stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-11\">II. <em>Article III Standing</em></p>\n<p id=\"AWm\">Toyota challenges Plaintiffs\u2019 Article III standing to bring the present action. Presumably, Toyota does so under Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), which allows dismissal of an action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Chandler v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>598 F.3d 1115, 1122 (9th Cir.2010) (\u201cBecause standing and ripeness pertain to federal courts\u2019 subject matter jurisdiction, they are properly raised in a Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-12\">Standing under Article III requires three elements. First, Plaintiffs must suffer an \u201cinjury in fact,\u201d which means that there must be a concrete and particularized \u201cinvasion of a legally protected interest\u201d that is actual or imminent. <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). Second, Plaintiffs must allege a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of, which means that the injury must be \u201cfairly traceable\u201d to Defendants\u2019 actions. <em>Id. </em>Third, Plaintiffs must show that a favorable decision will likely redress the injury. <em>Id. </em>at 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130. Although Plaintiffs bear the burden of establishing standing, \u201cgeneral factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant\u2019s conduct may suffice\u201d at the pleading stage. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1216-13\">Toyota contends that Plaintiffs fail to allege an \u201cinjury in fact.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>A. <em>A Manifested SUA Defect Is Not Necessary for Standing</em></p>\n<p id=\"AE-J\">Toyota points out that numerous Plaintiffs have not experienced the alleged SUA defect. (Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 10.) In the absence of a manifested defect, Toyota argues that those Plaintiffs lack standing because the mere possibility of a defective vehicle is not actual or imminent. Because courts have routinely \u201crejected the type of defect-without-malfunction theory asserted by many of the Plaintiffs in this lawsuit,\u201d (Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 10), Toyota urges the Court to adopt the same approach here. Plaintiffs respond that the absence of a manifested defect is not controlling because Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries consist of economic losses \u2014 that is, the diminished value of Plaintiffs\u2019 vehicles after the SUA defect was made public. (Pltfs.\u2019 Opp\u2019n at 10-14.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-5\">The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that experiencing an SUA defect is not required for standing. Standing merely requires a redressable injury that is fairly traceable to Defendants\u2019 conduct. Whether a plaintiff can recover for that injury under a particular theory of liability is a separate question. Here, Plaintiffs allege economic loss injuries, which may or may not be recoverable under Plaintiffs\u2019 claims in the MCC. These alleged economic injuries are sufficient.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1217-9\">The Court\u2019s decision is supported by the Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>Cole v. General Motors Corp., </em>which held that economic loss allegations were sufficient to establish an injury in fact. 484 F.3d 717, 722-23 (5th Cir.2007). The plaintiffs in <em>Cole </em>alleged that a defendant automobile company designed defective side air bags that unexpectedly deployed in cars. <em>Id. </em>at 720. The putative class in <em>Cole, </em>which excluded those \u201cwho sustained bodily injury or death as the result of the unexpected or premature deployment of a side impact air bag,\u201d sought recovery of \u201cthe difference between the value of the vehicle as delivered and the value it would have had if it had been delivered as warranted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 719-20. The defendant automobile company argued that \u201cplaintiffs lack standing because the air bags in their vehicles never deployed inadvertently, and therefore, they cannot have suffered an injury in fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 722. Without \u201cactual deployment, plaintiffs\u2019 injury is speculative because plaintiffs can only claim that the [air bags] in their vehicles were potentially defective.\u201d Plaintiffs countered that they \u201csuffered economic loss satisfying the inju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>ry-in-fact requirement because the [airbags] in all [cars] were defective at the moment of purchase.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1218-4\">The Fifth Circuit held that the economic loss injuries asserted by the plaintiffs were sufficient to confer standing. <em>Id. </em>at 723. In doing so, the court underscored the difference between two distinct inquiries: the inquiry into whether the plaintiffs sufficiently allege an \u201cinjury\u201d for standing purposes with the inquiry into whether the plaintiffs\u2019 theories of recovery are viable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALK\">Plaintiffs seek recovery for their actual economic harm (e.g., overpayment, loss in value, or loss of usefulness) emanating from the loss of their benefit of the bargain. Notably in this case, plaintiffs may bring claims under a contract theory based on the express and implied warranties they allege. Whether recovery for such a claim is permitted under governing law is a separate question; it is sufficient for standing purposes that the plaintiffs seek recovery for an economic harm that they allege they have suffered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1218-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-6\">In principle, the Court agrees with <em>Cole </em>that \u201coverpayment, loss in value, or loss of usefulness\u201d is sufficient to confer standing. Here, Plaintiffs allege that \u201cToyota vehicles with ETCS are defective.\u201d (\u00b6 8.) They further allege that a \u201cstatistically significant increase in the number of unintended acceleration complaints put Toyota on notice that there was a defect in its vehicles with ETCS that could cause SUA\u201d (\u00b6 128), and that \u201c[t]his defect renders the vehicles unsafe.\u201d (\u00b6 9.) As a result of the SUA defect and the ensuing safety concerns, Plaintiffs allege that \u201ceach Plaintiff did not receive the benefit of their bargain and/or overpaid for their vehicles, made lease payments that were too high and/or sold their vehicles at a loss when the public gained partial awareness of the defect.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (\u00b6 70.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-10\">Accepting these allegations as true, every Toyota vehicle with ETCS is defective and has a statistically significant propensity for SUA. While a statistically significant propensity for SUA may not be considered \u201cactual\u201d or \u201cimminent,\u201d the <em>market effect </em>of the alleged SUA defect undoubtedly <em>is </em>actual or imminent (as well as concrete and particularized): According to Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, Toyota vehicles with ETCS dropped in value owing to the alleged SUA defect. If a defect causes SUA to manifest itself in a small percentage of Toyota vehicles, it makes sense that people would be less willing to buy or use those vehicles on the off-chance that they might experience the SUA defect. All else being equal, prices typically decrease when demand decreases. Hence, the alleged economic loss.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1218-11\">Toyota argues that the weight of authority is contrary to <em>Cole. </em>(Defs.\u2019 Reply at 5-6.) <em>See, e.g., Briehl v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>172 F.3d 623, 628 (8th Cir.1999) (\u201cWhere, as in this case, a product performs satisfactorily and never exhibits an alleged defect, no cause of action lies.\u201d); <em>Contreras v.

Simplicity, Inc., </em>553 F.Supp.2d 1110, 1115 (D.Minn.2008) (\u201cIt is simply not enough for a plaintiff to allege that a product defect suffered by others renders his or her use of that same product unsafe; the plaintiff must instead allege an actual manifestation of the defect that results in some injury in order to state a cognizable claim for breach of warranty, unfair trade practices, or unjust enrichment.\u201d); <em>Whitson v. Bumbo, </em>No. C 07-05597 MHP, 2009 WL 1515597, at *6 (N.D.Cal. Apr. 16, 2009) (holding that plaintiff \u201cdoes not have standing for her claims under a \u2018benefit of the bargain\u2019 theory or any other stated theory\u201d because plaintiff failed \u201cto allege that her [baby seat] manifested the purported defect\u201d or that \u201ca purchase of a substitute for her allegedly defective [baby seat] was necessary.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-7\">Two considerations lead the Court to conclude that Toyota\u2019s line of authority should not control the outcome here. First, cases such as <em>Briehl, Wallis, Ziegelmann, </em>and <em>O\u2019Neil </em>did not address whether an \u201cinjury in fact\u201d had been sufficiently alleged for purposes of Article III standing, but rather whether damages were sufficiently alleged in order to support a claim under the theories pled.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The \u201cinjury in fact\u201d required for standing is conceptually distinct from \u201cdamages\u201d required under a particular theory or theories of liability. <em>Denney v. Deutsche Bank AG, </em>443 F.3d 253, 264-65 (2d Cir.2006). The Second Circuit\u2019s analysis in <em>Denney </em>is worth quoting at length for this proposition, particularly because the court grounded its holding in the precedent of the United States Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-8\">[A]n injury-in-fact differs from a \u201clegal interest\u201d; an injury-in-fact need not be capable of sustaining a valid cause of action under applicable tort law. An injury-in-fact may simply be the fear or anxiety of future harm. For example, exposure to toxic or harmful substances has been held sufficient to satisfy the Article III injury-in-fact requirement even without physical symptoms of injury caused by the exposure, and even though exposure alone may not provide sufficient ground for a claim under state tort law. <em>See Whitmore [v. Arkansas </em>], 495 U.S. [149] at 155, 110 S.Ct. 1717, 109 L.Ed.2d 135 [(1990)] (\u201cOur threshold inquiry into standing \u2018in no way depends on the merits of the [plaintiffs claim.]\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Warth, </em>422 U.S. at 500, 95 S.Ct. 2197); <em>In re Agent Orange Prod.

If plaintiff can show that there is a possibility that defendant\u2019s conduct may have a future effect, even if injury has not yet occurred, the court may hold that standing has been satisfied.\u201d). The risk of future harm may also entail economic costs, such as medical monitoring and preventative steps; but aesthetic, emotional or psychological harms also suffice for standing purposes. <em>See Ass\u2019n of Data Processing Serv. Orgs., Inc. v. Camp, </em>397 U.S. 150, 154, 90 S.Ct. 827, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970). Moreover, the fact that an injury may be outweighed by other benefits, while often sufficient to defeat a claim for damages, does not negate standing. <em>See Sutton, </em>419 F.3d at 574-75 (holding that the increased risk that a faulty medical device may malfunction constituted a sufficient injury-in-fact even though the class members\u2019 own devices had not malfunctioned and may have actually been beneficial).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1220-4\"><em>Id. </em>Plaintiffs here have clearly established \u201cinjury in fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-5\">Second, to the extent that cases such as <em>Contreras </em>and <em>Whitson </em>(or any of the cited cases) hold that standing cannot be established absent a manifested defect, and the former cases can be read to support that proposition, the Court disagrees: As long as plaintiffs allege a legally cognizable loss under the \u201cbenefit of the bargain\u201d or some other legal theory, they have standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-6\">B. <em>Pleading a Cognizable Loss under a \u201cBenefit of the Bargain\u201d Theory</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1220-7\">Toyota argues that Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cbenefit of the bargain\u201d theory does not work because the benefit of the bargain covers manifest or extant defects \u2014 not latent defects. (S<em>ee </em>Defs.\u2019 Reply at 4.) For example, in <em>Coghlan v. Wellcraft Marine Corp., </em>240 F.3d 449 (5th Cir.2001), the plaintiffs purchased a boat manufactured by the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 451. Defendants advertised that their boats were made completely of fiberglass, which were more durable and held their value better than boats made of a wood-fiberglass combination. <em>Id. </em>A few months after the purchase, however, the plaintiffs discovered that their boat was actually made of both wood and fiberglass, and they brought suit alleging claims under various consumer protection statutes and implied warranty. <em>Id. </em>The district court dismissed the entire complaint for failing to allege any cognizable damages, but the Fifth Circuit reversed. <em>Id. </em>In doing so, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdPs\">The key distinction between this case and a \u201cno-injury\u201d product liability suit is that the [plaintiffs\u2019] claims are rooted in basic contract law rather than the law of product liability: the [plaintiffs] assert they were promised one thing but were given a different, less valuable thing. The core allegation in a no-injury product liability class action is essentially the same as in a traditional products liability case: the defendant produced or sold a defective product and/or failed to warn of the product\u2019s dangers. The wrongful act in a no-injury products suit is thus the placing of a dangerous/defective product in the stream of commerce. In contrast, the wrongful act alleged by the [plaintiffs] is [defendants\u2019] failure to uphold its end of their bargain and to deliver what was promised. The strikjng feature of a typical no-injury class is that the plaintiffs have either not yet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>experienced a malfunction because of the alleged defect or have experienced a malfunction but not been harmed by it. <em>Therefore, the plaintiffs in a no-injury products liability case have not suffered any physical harm or out-of-pocket economic loss. Here, the damages sought by the [plaintiffs] are not rooted in the alleged defect of the product as such, but in the fact that they did not receive the benefit of their bargain.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1221-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 455 n. 4 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-6\">According to Toyota, Coghlan\u2019s logic was reasonably applied in <em>Kearney v. Hyundai Motor Co., </em>SACV 09-1298 DOC (MLGx), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68242, at *1, 14 (C.D.Cal. June 4, 2010), which dealt with alleged defects in the front passenger-side air bag system in certain lines of automobiles. (Defs.\u2019 Reply at 4.) In <em>Kearney, </em>the plaintiffs alleged that their vehicles failed to properly activate the front passenger side air bag capability when an adult was seated in the front passenger seat. <em>Id. </em>at *3. Federal regulations require vehicles \u201cwith advanced air bags [to] \u2018be equipped with an automatic suppression feature for the passenger air bag which results ... in activation of the air bag system\u2019 when a properly seated 105-pound individual occupies the front side passenger seat.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *2. The plaintiffs alleged that this system \u201cfailed to activate airbag capability when the 115-pound Nancy Kearney was seated in the front passenger seat\u201d and failed \u201cto activate the front side passenger air bag when the Moores\u2019 117-pound daughter occupies the front side passenger seat.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *3. Plaintiffs sued for the diminution in value of their vehicles as a result of the alleged defects and the deprivation of their contractual or property interest in their vehicles which resulted from the plaintiffs \u201cbeing provided with a car of a different quality than they were promised.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *10. Although defendant automobile company argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing, the court disagreed and adopted <em>Cole\u2019s </em>logic: \u201cthe court in <em>Cole </em>was concerned with the same situation alleged here \u2014 the receipt of a vehicle whose alleged defects reduced the car\u2019s value and deprived the consumer of the benefit of the bargain, <em>even when the alleged defects did not later materialize </em>\u2014 i.e., the loss was suffered \u2018at the moment\u2019 of purchase.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *14 (emphasis in the original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-8\">Toyota argues that <em>Coghlan </em>and <em>Kearney </em>stand for the proposition that standing under a \u201cbenefit of the bargain\u201d theory is warranted only when every product manifests the alleged defect. In <em>Coghlan, </em>the plaintiffs did not receive an all-fiberglass boat; in <em>Kearney, </em>every passenger-side air bag system was defective because it failed to activate when adults of small stature were properly seated. According to Toyota, Plaintiffs cannot argue a <em>Coghlan-type </em>injury because they got precisely what they bargained for: a car with ETCS. To the extent that Plaintiffs assert a lack of a brake override system or other additional safety feature, such allegations fall short because they were not part of the original benefit of the bargain. Moreover, Plaintiffs cannot allege the type of injury recognized in <em>Kearney </em>because Plaintiffs do not, and cannot, allege that all of their vehicles manifested the SUA defect. Thus, Plaintiffs who did not experience SUA are foreclosed from arguing that they did not receive the benefit of the bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-9\">The Court disagrees. First, Plaintiffs essentially allege that they contracted for safe vehicles that start and stop upon proper application of the accelerator and brake pedals. Plaintiffs allegedly received defective vehicles subject to dangerous SUA events, meaning that Plaintiffs\u2019 vehicles sometimes do not start and stop as promised. Accepting these allegations as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>true, they are sufficient to fall under the \u201cbenefit of the bargain\u201d rubric.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-4\">Second, under a \u201cbenefit of the bargain\u201d theory, Plaintiffs must allege \u201coverpayment, loss in value, or loss of usefulness.\u201d When those losses are sufficiently pled, they confer standing. Several Plaintiffs allege that they sold or traded in their vehicles at a loss owing to the alleged SUA defect, and these allegations suffice. For example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1222-5\">\u2022 Plaintiff Kathleen Atwater alleges that she \u201ctraded in her 2009 RAV4 on February 13, 2010, for a 2010 Ford Fusion\u201d and that she \u201creceived less for the sale of her RAV4 than she would have received if the vehicle did not have an SUA defect.\u201d (\u00b6 32.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1222-6\">\u2022 Plaintiff Richard Benjamin alleges that he \u201chas seen the trade-in value [of his 2007 Toyota Sienna] drop $2,000 since the recalls\u201d were made public. (\u00b6 35.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1222-7\">\u2022 Plaintiff Brandon Bowron \u201csold his Lexus on July 7, 2010,\u201d and alleges he \u201creceived less value for the car due to the SUA defect.\u201d (\u00b6 36.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1222-8\">\u2022 Plaintiff Matthew Heidenreich \u201csold his 2010 Corolla to NHTSA for research,\u201d and allegedly \u201clost money on the sale\u201d because \u201cNHTSA only paid the KELLEY BLUE BOOK value.\u201d (\u00b6 52.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1222-9\">\u2022 Plaintiff Mary Ann Tucker sold her 2005 Toyota Camry \u201con March 10, 2010, for $9,000,\u201d and alleges she \u201creceived less for her vehicle than she would have had her Camry not had a[n] SUA defect.\u201d (\u00b6 65.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1222-10\">\u2022 Plaintiffs Dana and Douglas Weller sold their Toyota RAV4 on March 13, 2010, and allege that they \u201creceived less for their trade-in vehicle than they would have had their RAV4 not had a[n] SUA defect.\u201d (\u00b6 68.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1222-11\">These specific allegations are not eonclusory, and substantiate the alleged \u201coverpayment, loss in value, or loss of usefulness.\u201d It is true that Plaintiffs do not generally allege the precise dollar value of their losses, but that level of specificity is not required at the pleadings stage. It is enough that they allege a tangible loss that can be proved or disproved upon discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-13\">C. <em>Lead Plaintiffs Must Plead a Cognizable Loss under a \u201cBenefit of the Bargain\u201d Theory</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1222-14\">Even accepting that Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cbenefit of the bargain\u201d theory confers standing for those who allege an \u201coverpayment, loss in value, or loss of usefulness,\u201d Toyota argues that some allegations of lead Plaintiffs are deficient. As currently pled, several plaintiffs do not allege any loss, as in the following representative examples:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1222-15\">\u2022 Plaintiff Ebony Brown is a resident and citizen of Illinois. She owns a 2009 Toyota Camry. (\u00b6 38.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1222-16\">\u2022 Plaintiff Gary Davis is a resident and citizen of Tennessee. He owns a 2008 Toyota Camry LE. Mr. Davis purchased his Toyota based on its reputation for safety. (\u00b6 41.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1222-17\">\u2022 Plaintiff Alexander Farrugia is a resident and citizen of New York. He owns a 2009 Toyota Highlander. (\u00b6 43.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1222-18\">\u2022 Carole Fisher is a resident and citizen of Nevada. She owns a 2010 Toyota Prius that she purchased on June 6, 2009. (\u00b6 44.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1222-19\">\u2022 Plaintiff John Flook is a resident and citizen of Maryland. He owns a 2010 Toyota Corolla. (\u00b6 46.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1222-20\">\u2022 Plaintiff Kevin Funez is a resident and citizen of Florida. He owns a 2006 Toyota Avalon. (\u00b6 47.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1222-21\">\u2022 Plaintiff Donald Graham is a resident and citizen of Colorado. He owns a 2007 Toyota Prius. (\u00b6 50.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1223-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>\u2022 Plaintiff Rodney Josephson is a resident and citizen of Massachusetts. He owns a 2010 Toyota Corolla. (\u00b6 53.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWk\">The Court agrees that these allegations do not go far enough to establish standing under a benefit of the bargain theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-5\">It is true that Plaintiffs generally allege that \u201ceach Plaintiff did not receive the benefit of their bargain and/or overpaid for their vehicles, made lease payments that were too high and/or sold their vehicles at a loss when the public gained partial awareness of the defect.\u201d (\u00b6 70.) As discussed previously, the Court accepts in principle that these allegations are sufficient to confer standing. However, \u201c[i]n a class action, the lead plaintiffs must show that they personally have been injured, \u2018not that injury has been suffered by other, unidentified members of the class to which they belong and which they purport to represent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Me. State Ret. Sys. v. Countrywide Fin. Corp., </em>722 F.Supp.2d 1157, 1163 (C.D.Cal.2010) (quoting <em>Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 502, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975)). General allegations of loss such as those contained in paragraph 70 of the MCC may suffice for the putative class, <em>see Denney, </em>443 F.3d at 263-64 (drawing distinction between lead plaintiffs and represented plaintiffs and stating that \u201c[w]e do not require that each member of a class [i.e., represented members] submit evidence of personal standing.\u201d), but that does not excuse lead Plaintiffs from specifically alleging injury.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Such allegations are necessary because lead Plaintiffs must have standing to sue prior to class certification. <em>Kohen v. Pac. Inv. Mgmt. Co., </em>571 F.3d 672, 676 (7th Cir.2009) <em>(\u201cBefore </em>a class is certified, it is true, the named plaintiff must have standing, because at that stage no one else has a legally protected interest in maintaining the suit.\u201d) (emphasis in the original).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In order to ascertain whether lead Plaintiffs have standing, it seems reasonable to require specific allegations by the lead Plaintiffs that support a cognizable injury under Article III, which would preferably be detailed enough so that the Court and Toyota would have no trouble discerning what constitutes the injury \u2014 e.g., the \u201coverpayment, loss in value, or loss of usefulness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-8\">D. <em>The Warranties Do Not Preclude Standing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1223-9\">Toyota argues that all Plaintiffs lack injuries because all received the benefit of the bargain from their warranties. (Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 13-14.) The exclusive remedy for those who have experienced a defect or malfunction is to obtain warranty repairs from an authorized dealer. The same reasoning applies, <em>a fortiori, </em>to those who have not experienced a defect or malfunction. <em>Cf. Thiedemann v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC, </em>183 N.J. 234, 251, 872 A.2d 783 (2005) (stating that automobile \u201cdefects that arise and are addressed by warranty, at no cost to the consumer, do not provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1168\">*1168</page-number>the predicate \u2018loss\u2019 that the CFA [New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act] expressly requires .... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-4\">Plaintiffs respond that Toyota has not agreed to repair or replace all class members\u2019 vehicles. (Pltfs.\u2019 Opp\u2019ii Brief at 14-15.) Toyota has not identified the root cause of most SUA events, the continuing defect is confirmed by SUA events occurring after recalls, and the purported warranty benefit does not address the diminished value of Plaintiffs\u2019 vehicles. (Pltfs.\u2019 Opp\u2019n Brief at 16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-5\">The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that they have alleged an injury-in-fact despite Toyota\u2019s warranties. First, for the reasons discussed above, Toyota conflates the inquiry into whether Plaintiffs sufficiently allege an \u201cinjury\u201d for standing purposes with the inquiry into whether Plaintiffs\u2019 theory of recovery is viable. Plaintiffs allege that they overpaid for defective vehicles owing to the SUA defect. Whether Plaintiffs can recover for their losses owing to the warranties or some other reason is a separate question. For purposes of standing, the alleged economic losses are sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-6\">Second, the Court agrees that Plaintiffs sufficiently allege that they have not received the benefit of the express warranties in the Warranty Manual.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-7\">E. <em>Conclusion for Article III Standing</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aui\">Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the Court grants Toyota\u2019s Motion to Dismiss the claims of the lead Plaintiffs who do not sufficiently allege a loss, but otherwise holds that Plaintiffs have adequately established Article III standing.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Plaintiffs who have failed to sufficiently allege standing are granted leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-10\">III. <em>Standing to Assert UCL, FAL, and CLRA Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1224-11\">Certain claims asserted by Plaintiffs are subject to particularized standing requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-12\">The UCL and FAL provide a private right of action only if Plaintiffs have \u201csuffered injury in fact and [have] lost money or property as a result of the unfair competition.\u201d Cal. Bus. <em>&amp; </em>Prof.Code \u00a7 17204; <em>Clayworth v. Pfizer, Inc., </em>49 Cal.4th 758, 788, 111 Cal.Rptr.3d 666, 233 P.3d 1066 (2010). \u201cA person whose property is diminished by a payment of money wrongfully induced is injured in his property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Chattanooga Foundry &amp; Pipe Works v. Atlanta, </em>203 U.S. 390, 396, 27 S.Ct. 65, 51 L.Ed. 241 (1906)). Overcharges paid as a result of unfair business practices are sufficient for UCL standing. <em>See id. </em>(holding that overcharges paid as a result of a price-fixing conspiracy were sufficient to support UCL standing); <em>Von Koenig v. Snapple Beverage Corp., </em>713 F.Supp.2d 1066, 1078 (E.D.Cal.2010) (holding that the plaintiffs sufficiently alleged injury under the UCL, FAL, and CLRA by asserting that the product they received was worth less than what they paid for it owing to defendants\u2019 misleading labels).</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-13\">Here, Plaintiffs allege that they \u201coverpaid for their vehicles, made lease payments that were too high and/or sold their vehicles at a loss when the public gained partial awareness of the defect.\u201d (\u00b6 70.) While these allegations may generally be sufficient to establish a money or property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1169\">*1169</page-number>loss under the UCL and FAL, the Court grants Toyota\u2019s Motion to Dismiss on this issue as to the lead Plaintiffs who have failed to plead \u201coverpayment, loss in value, or loss of usefulness.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The dismissal is without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-5\">IV. <em>Rule 12(b)(6) and Rule 12(f) Standards</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1225-6\">A. <em>Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1225-7\"> In addition to challenging Plaintiffs\u2019 standing to assert their claims, Toyota moves to dismiss all claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), a plaintiff must state \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). A claim has \u201cfacial plausibility\u201d if the plaintiff pleads facts that \u201callow[] the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-9\">In resolving a Rule 12(b)(6) motion under <em>Twombly, </em>the Court must follow a two-pronged approach. First, the Court must accept all well-pleaded factual allegations as true, but \u201c[t]hread-bare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.\u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1949. Nor must the Court \u201caccept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1949-50 (quoting <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955). Second, assuming the veracity of well-pleaded factual allegations, the Court must \u201cdetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1950. This determination is context-specific, requiring the Court to draw on its experience and common sense; there is no plausibility \u201cwhere the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1225-12\">B. <em>Motion to Strike Pursuant to Rule 12(f)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1225-13\">Under Rule 12(f), a party may move to strike from a pleading an insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(f). The grounds for a motion to strike must appear on the face of the pleading under attack, or from matters which the Court may take judicial notice. <em>SEC v. Sands, </em>902 F.Supp. 1149, 1165 (C.D.Cal.1995). The essential function of a Rule 12(f) motion is to \u201cavoid the expenditure of time and money that must arise from litigating spurious issues by dispensing with those issues prior to trial.\u201d <em>Fantasy, Inc. v. Fogerty, </em>984 F.2d 1524, 1527 (9th Cir.1993); <em>Sidney-Vinstein v. A.H. Robins Co., </em>697 F.2d 880, 885 (9th Cir.1983). Where a party moves to strike a prayer for damages on the basis that the damages sought are precluded as a matter of law, the request is more appropriately examined as a motion to dismiss. <em>See Whittlestone, Inc. v. Handi-Craft Co., </em>618 F.3d 970, 974-75 (9th Cir.2010) (\u201cWe therefore hold that Rule 12(f) does not authorize district courts to strike claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1170\">*1170</page-number>for damages on the ground that such claims are precluded as a matter of law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-4\">V. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 CLRA, UCL, and FAL Claims (First, Second, and Third Causes of Action)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1226-5\">Plaintiffs have alleged a number of claims under California consumer protection statutes. First, they allege violations of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act (\u201cCLRA\u201d), California Civil Code \u00a7\u00a7 1750 <em>et seq. </em>Second, they allege unfair, deceptive, and unlawful business practices in violation of the Unfair Competition Law (\u201cUCL\u201d), California Business &amp; Professions Code \u00a7\u00a7 17200 <em>et seq. </em>Third, they allege violations of the False Advertising Law (\u201cFAL\u201d), California Business &amp; Professions Code \u00a7\u00a7 17500 <em>et seq. </em>The Court examines each cause of action in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-6\">A. <em>Heightened Pleading Standard Under Rule 9(b)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1226-7\">Although these claims arise under state law, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations must be pled according to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. As a threshold matter, the parties do not dispute that claims sounding in fraud<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> are subject to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)\u2019s heightened pleading standard. <em>Kearns v. Ford Motor Co., </em>567 F.3d 1120, 1122 (9th Cir.2009) (applying Rule 9(b) standard to UCL and CLRA claims); <em>Vess v. Ciba-Geigy Corp., USA, </em>317 F.3d 1097, 1103-04 (9th Cir.2003) (where plaintiff identifies fraudulent course of conduct as basis for claim, pleading must satisfy particularity requirement).</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-11\">To survive a motion to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), allegations of fraud must meet the heightened pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). Namely, allegations of fraud \u201cmust state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b). A plaintiff must allege particular facts explaining the circumstances of the fraud, \u201cincluding time, place, persons, statements made[,] and an explanation of how or why such statements are false or misleading.\u201d <em>Baggett v. Hewlett-Packard Co., </em>582 F.Supp.2d 1261, 1265 (C.D.Cal.2007). The circumstances of the alleged fraud must be specific enough \u201cto give defendants notice of the particular misconduct ... so that they can defend against the charge and not just deny that they have done anything wrong.\u201d <em>Vess, </em>317 F.3d at 1106 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-12\">Under Rule 9(b), a plaintiff must plead each of the elements of a fraud claim with particularity, i.e., a plaintiff \u201cmust set forth <em>more </em>than the neutral facts necessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1171\">*1171</page-number>identify the transaction.\u201d <em>Cooper v. Pickett, </em>137 F.3d 616, 625 (9th Cir.1997) (emphasis in original). Fraud claims must be accompanied by the \u201cwho, what, when, where, and how\u201d of the fraudulent conduct charged. <em>Vess, </em>317 F.3d at 1106. A pleading is sufficient under Rule 9(b) if it identifies the circumstances constituting fraud so that a defendant can prepare an adequate answer from the allegations. <em>Moore v. Kayport Package Express, Inc., </em>885 F.2d 531, 540 (9th Cir.1989). The Court now turns to the parties\u2019 arguments about whether the MCC meets the 9(b) standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-5\">1. <em>Generalized Statements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1227-6\">Toyota argues that Plaintiffs\u2019 FAL, CLRA, and a portion of the alleged \u201cfraud\u201d theory under the UCL fail to meet Rule 9(b)\u2019s heightened pleading standard. (Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 20-21.) Toyota represents that Plaintiffs fail to identify a common defect or malfunction in the ETCS that Toyota knew about and knowingly concealed. <em>(Id.) </em>Toyota also claims that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations indicated \u201conly that Toyota\u2019s and others\u2019 investigations of a handful of <em>alleged </em>[S]UA incidents or engine surging were inconclusive\u201d and that Plaintiffs may not, under Rule 9(b) \u201cspeculate about potential defects\u201d and \u201cclaim that Toyota committed fraud by failing to disclose a product defect that is utterly undefined.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 22 (emphasis in original).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-7\">Toyota argues that the facts in the MCC are similar to those in cases in which courts have dismissed fraud claims for failure to plead according to Rule 9(b). In <em>Kearns, </em>567 F.3d at 1126, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s decision to grant a motion to dismiss where plaintiff \u201cfail[ed] to specify what the television advertisements or other sales material specifically stated.\u201d Toyota also urges the Court to follow the decisions of district courts granting motions to dismiss on 9(b) grounds. <em>See, e.g., Hovsepian v. Apple, Inc., </em>No. 08-578, 2009 WL 5069144, at *3 (N.D.Cal. Dec. 17, 2009) (\u201coperative pleading makes conclusory statements as to Apple\u2019s course of conduct\u201d ... \u201c[s]uch generalized allegations do not provide the \u2018who, what, when, where, and how5 of the misconduct charged.\u201d); <em>Oestreicher v. Alienware Corp., </em>544 F.Supp.2d 964, 974 (N.D.Cal.2008) (granting motion to dismiss where plaintiff provided \u201cno specific statement or absolute characteristic\u201d regarding products).</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-9\">2. <em>Specific Defect Allegations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1227-10\">Plaintiffs allege numerous facts to support a fraudulent course of conduct underlying these three consumer protection claims. They allege both an SUA defect <em>(see, e.g., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 119-29; 150; 165; 229) and a fail-safe defect (\u00b6\u00b6 18-19; 245-46). Plaintiffs have alleged that beginning in 1996, Toyota had a commitment to \u201coverall safety gains\u201d and that Toyota told the public that \u201cbuilding safe automobiles is the most important thing we can do.\u201d (\u00b6 82.) Plaintiffs allege that Toyota made representations in 1998 and 2002 that \u201csafety and security of driver and passenger has always been an absolute priority for Lexus\u201d and that Lexus was \u201craising the standards on standard safety features.\u201d (\u00b6\u00b6 83, 84.) Plaintiffs also allege that Toyota marketed other car models, such as the Toyota Camry, Prius, and Sienna, through advertisements, brochures, and press kits that claimed the vehicles included safety features such as the ETCS and were \u201cmore safe[ ].\u201d (\u00b6\u00b6 84, 88, 90, 91.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-11\">Plaintiffs allege that Toyota had a \u201cgeneral promise of safety and specific promise that the new electronic components being installed in the Defective Vehicles are more reliable than their mechanical predecessors.\u201d (\u00b6 92) (alleging Toyota issued press releases stating that Toyota vehicles used technological innovations to \u201cdeliver a high level of occupant safety\u201d; Lexus \u201cde<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>liver[s] real benefits to owners in terms of safety\u201d; Toyota SUVs \u201craise the standard\u201d; Toyota customers \u201chave long counted on the brand for the best in performance quality and durability\u201d; Toyota is \u201cobsessed with safety\u201d and \u201cserious about safety\u201d)- Plaintiffs also allege that Toyota issued brochures discussing the safety features of various vehicle models, such as Sienna, RAV4, 4Runner, Land Cruiser, and Sequoia SUVs. (\u00b6\u00b6 94-98) (\u201cequipped with more safety features\u201d; \u201cmore safety\u201d; \u201csame level of advanced safety technology\u201d; \u201ccustomer [has] peace of mind when purchasing and driving\u201d).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Plaintiffs have thus explained <em>who </em>made the representations, <em>where </em>and <em>when </em>they were made, and <em>what </em>the representations are.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-4\">Plaintiffs allege that Toyota\u2019s representations concerning safety were \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d because Toyota failed to disclose the SUA defect. (\u00b6 93; <em>see also </em>\u00b6\u00b6 6-7 (increase in SUA events within first year of changing from non-ETCS to ETCS); \u00b6\u00b6 119-29 (increase in SUA complaints after Toyota introduced ETCS-i); \u00b6 150 (Toyota technicians replicated SUA events without \u201cdriver error\u201d); \u00b6 229 (SUA incident caused by deviations with ETCS); \u00b6\u00b6 225-45 (summary of defects).) Plaintiffs have therefore alleged <em>why </em>Toyota\u2019s statements were false and misleading and have thus met the specificity requirement under Rule 9(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-5\">Thus, it is clear that Rule 9(b) applies to the allegations under the CLRA, the fraud prong of the UCL, and the FAL. As to each of these claims, Plaintiffs have set forth factual allegations that meet the appropriate pleading standard. Plaintiffs have alleged the \u201cwho\u201d (Toyota), the \u201cwhat\u201d (representations that Toyota vehicles are safe); the \u201cwhere\u201d and \u201cwhen\u201d (representations were allegedly made in magazine advertisements, press kits, and brochures), and the \u201cwhy\u201d (Toyota vehicles have a defect that causes SUA). Thus, the FAL, CLRA, and UCL (fraud theory) allegations are properly pled under Rule 9(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-8\">B. <em>CLRA Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1228-9\">Plaintiffs\u2019 first cause of action is for violations of the CLRA. The CLRA forbids \u201cunfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices undertaken by any person in a transaction intended to result or which results in the sale or lease of goods or services to any consumer.\u201d Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 1770(a). A fraudulent omission is actionable under the CLRA if the omission is \u201cof a representation actually made by the defendant, or an omission of a fact the defendant was obliged to disclose.\u201d <em>Daugherty v. American Honda Motor Co., </em>144 Cal.App.4th 824, 835, 51 Cal.Rptr.3d 118 (2006). To allege a duty to disclose, a plaintiff must show that the defendant (1) is in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiff; (2) had exclusive knowledge of material facts not known to the plaintiff; (3) actively conceals a material fact from the plaintiff; or (4) makes partial representations but also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>suppresses some material fact. <em>LiMandri v. Judkins, </em>52 Cal.App.4th 326, 336, 60 Cal.Rptr.2d 539 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-5\">Plaintiffs have pled a failure to disclose a defect under the second and third <em>Li-Mandri </em>factors. They allege that Toyota \u201cfailfed] to disclose and actively concealed] the dangerous risk of throttle control failure and the lack of adequate fail-safe mechanisms,\u201d thus engaging in five deceptive business practices:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1229-6\">(1) representing that Defective Vehicles have characteristics, uses, benefits, and qualities which they do not have,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1229-7\">(2) representing that Defective Vehicles are of a particular standard, quality, and grade when they are not,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1229-8\">(3) advertising Defective Vehicles with the intent not to sell them as advertised,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1229-9\">(4) representing that a transaction involving Defective Vehicles confers or involves rights, remedies, and obligations which it does not, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1229-10\">(5) representing that the subject of a transaction involving Defective Vehicles has been supplied in accordance with a previous representation when it has not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1229-11\">(\u00b6 300.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-12\">1. <em>Material Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1229-13\">To plead a duty to disclose, Plaintiffs must show the nondisclosed facts are material. Nondisclosures about safety considerations of consumer products are material. <em>Falk v. General Motors Corp., </em>496 F.Supp.2d 1088, 1096 (N.D.Cal.2007). Toyota argues that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations under the CLRA \u201care deficient because they do not identify <em>any </em>specific material facts ... that Toyota had a duty to disclose.\u201d (Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 25 (emphasis in the original).) Toyota argues that \u201cmaterial statements about the safety and reliability\u201d of the vehicles are not \u201cmaterial facts that give rise to a duty to disclose.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Moreover, Toyota argues that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations are deficient because they do not identify a defect. <em>(Id.) </em>Additionally, Toyota argues that \u201cgeneralized statements\u201d of material facts are insufficient, citing to <em>Oestreicher, </em>544 F.Supp.2d at 971-72 n. 1 (N.D.Cal.2008) and <em>Tietsworth v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>09-CV-00288, 2009 WL 3320486, at *4 (N.D.Cal. Oct. 13, 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-15\">Those cases are factually distinguishable. In <em>Oestreicher, </em>the court found that the plaintiff had not made any showing about safety considerations, and declined to find material facts that the defendant was obligated to disclose. Thus, allegations about safety <em>are </em>material. In <em>Tietsworth, </em>unlike here, the court recognized that the plaintiffs had alleged <em>no </em>representations about the defective product and found no duty to disclose. Here, Plaintiffs have alleged that Toyota\u2019s nondisclosure of the vehicles\u2019 \u201cpropensity ... to accelerate suddenly and dangerously out of the driver\u2019s control ... are material to the reasonable consumer.\u201d (\u00b6\u00b6 33, 34, 39, 40, 42, 45, 49, 51, 52, 54, 55, 59, 60, 62, 64, 67, 69) (examples of unintended acceleration and alleging accidents and damage from SUA); \u00b6 305 (\u201c[w]hether or not a vehicle (a) accelerates only when commanded to do so and (b) decelerates and stops when commanded to do so are facts that a reasonable consumer would consider important in selecting a vehicle to purchase or lease.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-16\">The Court is convinced that a safety consideration as fundamental as whether a car is able to stop when the brakes are applied is material to consumers. <em>See Falk, </em>496 F.Supp.2d at 1096 (a reasonable consumer \u201cwould expect the speedometer to read the speed accurately. Otherwise consumers would travel at unsafe speeds and possibly incur moving-violation penalties.\u201d). Here, the nondisclosure of the defect is equally, if not more, serious, because consumers have been unable to stop their vehicles. (\u00b6\u00b6 301-02.) Plaintiffs al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number>lege that Toyota made material statements about the safety and reliability of Defective Vehicles that were \u201ceither false or misleading,\u201d and each of these statements \u201ccontributed to the deceptive context\u201d of Toyota\u2019s \u201cunlawful advertising and representations as a whole.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Thus, Plaintiffs allege that SUA is material to consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-4\">2. <em>Exclusive Knowledge and Active Concealment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1230-5\">Plaintiffs establish a duty to disclose because they allege that Toyota has superior knowledge of the SUA defects. <em>(See, e.g., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 119-29, 131, 149-50, 160-61, 213, 303, 398 (consumers\u2019 reports to dealerships).) Plaintiffs allege that beginning in 2002, Toyota had exclusive knowledge of an SUA defect and knew about the material safety considerations through its own testing, dealership repair orders, and various other sources. <em>(See, e.g., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 113-16 (first reports of unintended acceleration); \u00b6 149 (disclosure of portion of consumer complaints to regulators). Plaintiffs also allege that Toyota actively concealed complaints from consumers and the \u201ctrue root cause of SUA.\u201d (\u00b6\u00b6 170; 196-218).) As discussed in greater detail with respect to the fraudulent concealment allegations below, Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that Toyota had exclusive knowledge of material facts not known to Plaintiffs and actively concealed those facts. Plaintiffs sufficiently allege a duty to disclose, and therefore they have a viable CLRA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-6\">3. <em>Damages</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1230-7\">A plaintiff seeking damages under the CLRA must provide notice to the defendant under California Civil Code \u00a7 1782(a).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> That section provides that at least thirty days prior to commencing an action for damages under the CLRA, the consumer must (1) notify the person alleged to have committed violations, and (2) demand that the person \u201ccorrect, repair, replace, or otherwise rectify the goods or services\u201d alleged to be in violation. Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 1782(a). Notice \u201cshall be in writing and shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested,\u201d to the place where the transaction occurred or to the person\u2019s principal place of business within California. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1230-10\">The purpose of the notice requirement is to \u201cgive the manufacturer or vendor sufficient notice of alleged defects to permit appropriate corrections or replacements,\u201d and the \u201cclear intent ... is to provide and facilitate precomplaint settlements of consumer actions wherever possible and to establish a limited period during which such settlement may be accomplished.\u201d <em>Outboard Marine Corp. v. Superior Court, </em>52 Cal.App.3d 30, 41, 124 Cal.Rptr. 852 (1975). A \u201cliteral application of the notice provisions\u201d is the \u201conly way\u201d to accomplish the CLRA\u2019s purposes. <em>Keilholtz v. Superior Fireplace Co., </em>No. 08-00836, 2009 WL 839076, at *3 (N.D.Cal. March 30, 2009) (citing <em>Outboard Marine, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1230-11\">Toyota argues that Plaintiffs did not meet the notice requirements because the CLRA notices were sent on behalf of Plaintiffs who are not named as class representatives. (Def.\u2019s Mem. 27.) Toyota argues that \u201cthe majority of named Plaintiffs have failed to establish proper notice to Toyota.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Toyota asks the Court to strike the damages request.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-12\">Plaintiffs argue that Toyota was put on notice of its violations of the CLRA more than thirty days before the MCC was filed, and that \u201c[njothing more is required.\u201d (Pi\u2019s Opp\u2019n Br. 24.) Plaintiffs allege that they sent notice in compliance with \u00a7 1782 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>as early as November 24, 2009 and that other notices were sent on March 23, 2010, and June 4, 2010. (\u00b6 309.) During the hearing, Plaintiffs counsel referred the Court to the letter sent to TMS by eleven Consumer Plaintiffs on June 4, 2010 (\u201cJune 4 letter\u201d). (Gilford Decl., Ex. E.) In that letter, the group of Plaintiffs stated, on behalf of a putative class, that they believed TMS had engaged in acts in violation of the CLRA and demanded that Toyota \u201chalt such unfair trade practices and make [] remedies on a classwide basis.\u201d (Gilford Deck, Ex. E, at 2.) The Court now agrees with Plaintiffs, and finds that the June 4 letter is sufficient to comply with the notice requirement. That letter fulfills the purpose of \u00a7 1782(a) to facilitate settlement and provide an opportunity for the manufacturer to fix alleged defects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-5\">During the hearing, the Court also queried whether one or more persons could meet the CLRA notice requirements on behalf of the putative class. The Court is satisfied that a group of named plaintiffs, such as those who wrote the June 4 letter, satisfy the notice requirements on behalf of the putative class. <em>Kagan v. Gibraltar Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>35 Cal.3d 582, 595, 200 Cal.Rptr. 38, 676 P.2d 1060 (1984) (disapproved on other grounds) (class action may begin thirty days after demand on behalf of class).</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-6\">Therefore, the Court denies the Motion to Strike the CLRA damages claim in the MCC. (\u00b6\u00b6 310-11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-7\">C. <em>UCL Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1231-8\">The UCL prohibits \u201cunlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act[s] or practice[s]\u201d and \u201cunfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising.\u201d Cal. Bus. <em>&amp; </em>Prof. Code \u00a7 17200. A plaintiff may pursue a UCL claim under any or all of three theories: the \u201cunlawfulness,\u201d \u201cfraudulent,\u201d or \u201cunfairness\u201d prongs. <em>South Bay Chevrolet v. General Motors Acceptance Corp., </em>72 Cal.App.4th 861, 878, 85 Cal.Rptr.2d 301 (1999). Plaintiffs have pursued all three, and Toyota does not contest this in its Motion or Reply briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-10\">Plaintiffs have set forth sufficient factual allegations under all three prongs. First, the UCL prohibits \u201cunlawful\u201d practices that are forbidden by any law. <em>Saunders v. Superior Court, </em>27 Cal.App.4th 832, 838, 33 Cal.Rptr.2d 438 (1994). The statute \u201cborrows\u201d violations of other laws and treats them as actionable. <em>Cel-Tech Commc\u2019ns v. Los Angeles Cellular Tel. Co., </em>20 Cal.4th 163, 180, 83 Cal.Rptr.2d 548, 973 P.2d 527 (1999). Plaintiffs allege a violation of the CLRA and the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1996, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 30101 <em>et seq. </em>(\u00b6\u00b6 318, 319, 320-24.) These allegations are sufficient to establish \u201cunlawful\u201d conduct in violation of the UCL.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-11\">Second, a fraudulent business practice is one that is likely to deceive the public and may be based on representations that are untrue. <em>McKell v. Washington Mut., Inc., </em>142 Cal.App.4th 1457, 1471, 49 Cal.Rptr.3d 227 (2006). Plaintiffs allege that Toyota misrepresented the safety of its vehicles and failed to disclose SUA defects. (\u00b6325.) As shown above, Toyota represented that its vehicles were safe when in fact Plaintiffs allege that they are not. This is sufficient to show that members of the public are \u201clikely to be deceived\u201d and establishes a violation under the fraudulent prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-12\">Lastly, Plaintiffs state a claim under the unfairness prong. \u201cUnfair\u201d means \u201cconduct that threatens an incipient violation of an antitrust law, or violates the policy or spirit of one of those laws because its effects are comparable to or the same as a violation of the law, or otherwise significantly threatens or harms competition.\u201d <em>Cel-Tech Commc\u2019ns, </em>20 Cal.4th at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>187, 83 Cal.Rptr.2d 548, 973 P.2d 527. Plaintiffs allege that Toyota committed a violation of this prong because \u201cthe manufacture and sale of vehicles with a sudden acceleration defect that lack a brake-override or other effective fail-safe mechanism, and defendants\u2019 failure to adequately investigate, disclose, and remedy, offend established public policy.\u201d (\u00b6 326.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations are sufficient under all three prongs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-5\">D. <em>FAL Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1232-6\">Section 17500 prohibits \u201cany statement\u201d that is \u201cuntrue or misleading\u201d and made \u201cwith the intent directly or indirectly to dispose of\u2019 property or services. Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof.Code \u00a7 17500. To state a claim for an FAL violation, Plaintiffs must allege that \u201cmembers of the public are likely to be deceived.\u201d <em>In re Tobacco II, </em>46 Cal.4th at 312, 93 Cal.Rptr.3d 559, 207 P.3d 20. Toyota claims that it is \u201cwell-established that generalized statements asserting claims of quality and safety are non-actionable,\u201d and cites to two cases for support. (Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 23 (citing <em>Glen Holly Entm\u2019t, Inc. v. Tektronix, Inc., </em>343 F.3d 1000, 1015 (9th Cir.2003) (statements describing \u201chigh priority\u201d that company placed on product development and marketing efforts were \u201cmere puffery\u201d upon which reasonable consumer could not rely); <em>Stearns v. Select Comfort Retail Corp., </em>No. 8-2746, 2009 WL 1635931, at *16-17 (N.D.Cal. June 5, 2009) (statement promising \u201cperfect night\u2019s sleep\u201d was non-actionable \u201cgeneralized and vague statement of product superiority\u201d)).)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1232-7\">This is not an accurate statement of the law. Neither of these cases stands for the proposition that Defendants who make safety representations cannot be liable for FAL claims. Instead, these cases present instances when representations about product development and product superiority were not actionable. That is not the case here. Toyota argues that representations it allegedly made in press releases, annual reports, brochures and the like are \u201cgeneralized statements concerning the quality and safety of Toyota vehicles.\u201d (Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 23.) Toyota argues that these statements are not actionable because they are not likely to deceive a reasonable consumer. Toyota is not correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-10\">The Ninth Circuit has recognized that \u201cmisdescriptions\u201d of specific or absolute characteristics of products are actionable. <em>Cook, Perkiss &amp; Liehe, Inc. v. Northern Cal. Collection Serv., Inc., </em>911 F.2d 242, 246 (9th Cir.1990). The court recognized that advertising which \u201cmerely states in general terms that one product is superior is not actionable,\u201d and found that the claims at issue\u2014\u201cwe\u2019re the low cost commercial collection experts\u201d\u2014were \u201cgeneral assertions of superiority rather than factual misrepresentations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Advertisements that make representations about safety are actionable. <em>See, e.g., Continental Airlines, Inc. v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., </em>216 Cal.App.3d 388, 424, 264 Cal.Rptr. 779 (1989) (representations in brochures \u201cwere not statements of \u2018opinion\u2019 or mere \u2018puffing\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-11\">Plaintiffs allege sufficient facts about the ETCS-i system to state a claim for violation of the FAL. Plaintiffs allege that Toyota \u201ccaused to be made or dissem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1177\">*1177</page-number>inated through California and the United States, through advertising, marketing and other publications, statements that were untrue or misleading.\u201d (\u00b6 333.) Plaintiffs allege that the misrepresentations and omissions were likely to deceive a reasonable consumer. (\u00b6 334.) Plaintiffs also allege Toyota made \u201cspecific misdescriptions\u201d of its vehicles. (Pltfs.\u2019 Opp\u2019n Brief at 31, citing <em>e.g., </em>\u00b6 89 (alleging that ETCS makes it possible to achieve \u201cshorter activation times\u201d leading reasonable consumers to \u201cbelieve that their brakes would activate more quickly than usual rather than potentially not at all.\u201d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-5\">Such a statement stands in stark contrast to Toyota\u2019s selective quotation and characterization of the allegations in the MCC as statements of \u201cproduct superiority.\u201d (Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 24, citing to <em>Fraker v. KFC Corp., </em>No. 06-01284, 2007 WL 1296571, at *2-3 (S.D.Cal. Apr. 30, 2007). In <em>Frnker,) </em>the court dismissed an FAL claim because \u201cno reasonable consumer\u201d would rely upon claims that the KFC Corporation provides the \u201cbest food\u201d and that \u201call foods can fit into a balanced eating plan\u201d as the basis of an actionable claim. <em>Id. </em>at *3. Here, however, the allegations about product safety are more than \u201cmere puffery\u201d that Toyota\u2019s cars were superior to others. They constitute a campaign by Toyota in which it represented itself as prioritizing (even \u201cobsessing over\u201d) safety. Accordingly, the Court denies Toyota\u2019s motion to dismiss the FAL claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-6\">E. <em>Motion to Strike CLRA and UCL Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1233-7\">Toyota moves to strike language in the section of the MCC seeking damages for alleged CLRA violations, namely paragraphs 310, 311, and 312, as well as the words \u201cpunitive damages\u201d from paragraph 314. (Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 1.) Toyota also moves to strike the UCL allegations in paragraphs 318, 325, and 326 from the MCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-8\">Toyota\u2019s motion is denied. The Court finds that the damages sought under paragraphs 310 and 311 are viable because Plaintiffs meet the notice requirements under California Civil Code \u00a7 1782(a). Moreover, the Court finds that the punitive damages allegations in paragraph 312 are sufficient and Toyota has not provided a reason to strike them. Finally, Toyota has provided no reason to strike the three allegations of violations of each prong of the UCL. Therefore, the Court declines to strike them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-9\">VI. <em>Express and Implied Warranties (Fourth and Fifth Causes of Action)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1233-10\">Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 express and implied warranty claims based on a number of theories. Plaintiffs\u2019 opposition reveals that they based their express warranty claims not only on the written manufacturer\u2019s warranty but also upon numerous statements made by Defendants in the marketing of Toyota vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-11\">A. <em>Express Written Warranty</em></p>\n<p id=\"AGh\">\n<em>1.

To receive service under the warranty, purchasers must seek assistance from Toyota\u2019s dealers: <em>(See, e.g., id. </em>at 44 (\u201cTo obtain warranty service in the United States, ... take your vehicle to an authorized Toyota dealership.\u201d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-4\">2. <em>Limited Remedy of Repair or Adjustment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1234-5\">Defendants contend that to the extent that Plaintiffs assert claims that seek remedies beyond repair or replacement, these claims are barred by the terms of the written warranty. Defendants correctly observe that this limitation is consistent with the Uniform Commercial Code (\u201cUCC\u201d) \u00a7 2-719(l)(a). <em>See </em>Cal. Com.Code \u00a7 2719(1)(a) (California\u2019s version of the UCC \u00a7 2-719(1)(a)) (\u201cThe agreement ... may limit or alter the measure of damages recoverable under this division, as by limiting the buyer\u2019s remedies to return of the goods and repayment of the price or to repair and replacement of nonconforming goods or parts ....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-6\">Here, however, the limitation on the remedy found in the written warranty must be viewed through the lens of Plaintiffs\u2019 theory of the alleged defects. Plaintiffs allege there are defects in the Toyota vehicles that Toyota is unable or unwilling to repair, and that the two wide-scale recalls failed to repair the defect. <em>(See </em>\u00b6 24.) Accepting this fact as true, as the Court must at the pleadings stage, Plaintiffs have stated a claim for breach of express written warranty, which includes any Plaintiff (1) whose vehicle was taken during its warranty period for repair pursuant to the recalls, and (2) who has alleged he or she sought repair during the vehicle\u2019s warranty period for SUA-related issues, and was informed either that the vehicle had been repaired or that nothing was wrong with the vehicle. The essence of Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations regarding repairs is that, with respect to any SUA-related repair request, any purported repair was itself defective because no adequate brake-override system was installed and/or because the repairs pursuant to the floor mat and pedal recalls did not address the root cause of the SUA events. <em>(See </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17-18.) At the pleadings stage, such allegations are sufficient to fall within the scope of the \u201crepair or adjustment\u201d warranty limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-8\">3. <em>Requirement of Presentment for Repair Within the Warranty Period and Requirement of Notice Before Filing Suit</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1234-9\">a. <em>Contractual Requirement of Presentment for Repair Within the Warranty Period</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1234-10\">As noted above, Plaintiffs who sought repairs pursuant to the recalls or who sought repairs for SUA-related issues have stated a claim for breach of express warranty based on the written warranty. The question remains, however, whether those Plaintiffs who are outside those two presumably overlapping groups have met the requirement that they take their vehicles to a dealer for repair (or are excused from that requirement) such that they, too have stated a claim for breach of express warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-11\">Plaintiffs argue they should be excused from seeking repair within the stated warranty period in the manner specified in the warranty because the defect alleged here is latent. This issue must be resolved by the Court\u2019s reconciliation of two seemingly conflicting California Court of Appeal decisions in the manner the California Supreme Court would reconcile the two. <em>See S.D. Myers, Inc. v. City &amp; County of San Francisco, </em>253 F.3d 461, 473 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201c[W]hen state law applies to an issue, federal courts must interpret and apply state law as would the highest state court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>In Plaintiffs\u2019 favor is <em>Hicks v. Kaufman &amp; Broad Home Corp., </em>89 Cal.App.4th 908, 923, 107 Cal.Rptr.2d 761 (2001), which suggests that the limitation on repair warranties does not apply when the product is inherently defective at the time of delivery. There, the court noted that if the Plaintiffs could prove that the allegedly defective product was \u201csubstantially certain to result in malfunction during the useful life of the product,\u201d they could prevail on their warranty claim notwithstanding the fact that the defect had not manifested itself as of the time of the filing of the action. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1235-5\">In Defendants\u2019 favor is <em>Daugherty, </em>144 Cal.App.4th at 830, 51 Cal.Rptr.3d 118 (2006), which considered a motor vehicle warranty similar to the one at issue here. In considering claims by a number of Plaintiffs based on the \u201c3 year or 36,000 mile\u201d written warranty where no defects were discovered during the warranty period, the court rejected the argument that the warranty covered undiscovered defects where it was alleged the manufacturer was aware of the defect when the vehicle was sold. <em>Id. </em>at 832, 51 Cal.Rptr.3d 118 (\u201cWe agree with the trial court that, as a matter of law, in giving its promise to repair or replace any part that was defective in material or workmanship and stating the car was covered for three years or 36,000 miles, Honda did not agree, and Plaintiffs did not understand it to agree, to repair latent defects that lead to a malfunction after the term of the warranty.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-6\">In reconciling conflicting appellate decisions applying state law, a district court must attempt to \u201cpredict how the highest state court would decide the issue using intermediate appellate court decisions, decisions from other jurisdictions, statutes, treatises, and restatements as guidance.\u201d <em>S.D. Myers, Inc., </em>253 F.3d at 473 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Here, however, such reference is not required because a closer examination of <em>Hicks </em>reveals it is not inconsistent with <em>Daugherty </em>as applied to the facts alleged in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-8\">As the <em>Hicks </em>court expressly recognized, its analysis was shaped by the unique nature of the product that was alleged to be defective: A product used in the construction of home concrete slab foundations that was alleged to have compromised the foundation\u2019s structural integrity. <em>Hicks, </em>89 Cal.App.4th at 912, 923, 107 Cal.Rptr.2d 761. The court expressly distinguished the product from motor vehicles and tires based on the length of useful life. <em>Id. </em>at 923, 107 Cal.Rptr.2d 761. Of foundations, the court noted that \u201c[a] foundation\u2019s useful life ... is indefinite,\u201d while \u201ccars and tires\u201d with their \u201climited useful life,\u201d will often \u201cwind up on a scrap heap\u201d with \u201cwhatever defect they may have contained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the <em>Hicks </em>decision does not support Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that it should be applied to excuse the failure to seek repair of the vehicles at issue here during the warranty period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-9\">Another district court case has made similar observations regarding the effect of <em>Daugherty </em>and <em>Hicks. See Tietsworth, </em>720 F.Supp.2d at 1141 (expressing concern that a holding contrary to <em>Daugherty </em>\u201cwould eviscerate any limitations put in place by an express warranty,\u201d and noting that <em>Hicks </em>does not permit a Plaintiff to assert a claim for breach of express written warranty based on a latent defect that does not \u201cresult in product failure during the warranty period\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-10\">Thus, Plaintiffs who neither sought repairs pursuant to the recalls nor sought repairs for SUA-related issues may not pursue a claim for breach of express warranty based on the written warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>b. <em>Statutory Requirement of Notice Before Filing Suit</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1236-4\">Relatedly, Cal. Com.Code \u00a7 2607(3)(A) requires pre-suit notice be given to a seller of goods: \u201cThe buyer must, within a reasonable time after he or she discovers or should have discovered any breach, notify the seller of breach or be barred from any remedy ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>Defendants contend that, pursuant to \u00a7 2607(3)(A), Plaintiffs who failed to give Defendants the required pre-suit notice are barred from seeking any remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-5\">Except as to those relatively few Plaintiffs (such as at least one non-consumer Plaintiff) who allege they purchased their vehicles directly from Defendants, this requirement is excused as to a manufacturer with which the purchaser did not deal. <em>See Greenman v. Yuba Power Prods., </em>59 Cal.2d 57, 61, 27 Cal.Rptr. 697, 377 P.2d 897 (1963) (notice not required in action against a manufacturer and by purchasers \u201cagainst [a] manufacture^ ] with whom they have not dealt.\u201d). The principle enunciated by the California Supreme Court in <em>Greenman </em>has been recently applied by federal district courts. <em>See e.g., Aaronson v. Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>No. 09-CV-1333 W(CAB), 2010 WL 625337, at *5 (S.D.Cal. Feb. 17, 2010) (denying motion to dismiss for failure to give \u00a7 2607(3)(A) notice); <em>cf. Sanders v. Apple Inc., </em>672 F.Supp.2d 978, 988-89 (2009) (noting the <em>Greenman </em>exception to the notice requirement but nevertheless dismissing a claim for failure to give notice to the manufacturer where an electronic device was purchased directly from the manufacturer\u2019s online store).</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-8\">Plaintiffs who allege they purchased their vehicle directly from Defendants are subject to the notice requirement. Notice may be given consistent with <em>Hampton v. Gebhardt\u2019s Chili Powder Co., </em>294 F.2d 172, 174 (9th Cir.1961),<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> which permits post-filing notice if notice is otherwise within a reasonable time, and Plaintiffs are granted leave to amend to allege such notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-9\">4. <em>Design Defect as Beyond the Scope of \u201cMaterials and Workmanship\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1236-10\">Defendants contend Plaintiffs\u2019 express warranty claim based on the written warranty fails because they claim a design defect and the written warranty applies only to defects in \u201cmaterials and workmanship.\u201d Plaintiffs fail to oppose this argument, which the Court nevertheless considers it on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-11\">The Court has been unable to locate any California state appellate case that answers this question on point. However, another district court case has addressed the question, and that court\u2019s decision is based on a relevant distinction in California products liability law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-12\">Specifically, in <em>Brothers v. Hewlett-Packard Co., </em>No. C-06-2254 RMW, 2007 WL 485979, at *4 (N.D.Cal. Feb. 12, 2007), the court rejected a breach of express written warranty claim based on an alleged design defect where the warranty guaranteed against defects in \u201cmaterials <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>and workmanship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *4. In differentiating between design defects and defects in materials and workmanship, the Court relied on <em>McCabe v. Am. Honda Motor Co., </em>100 Cal.App.4th 1111, 1120, 123 Cal. Rptr.2d 303 (2002), which, in turn, drew a distinction between the two terms based on California products liability law. <em>See Brothers, </em>2007 WL 485979 at *4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-5\">In <em>McCabe, </em>a the California Court of Appeal distinguished between a design defect and \u201cmanufacturing defects\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1237-6\">California recognizes two distinct categories of product defects: manufacturing defects and design defects.... A manufacturing defect exists when an item is produced in a substandard condition .... Such a defect is often demonstrated by showing the product performed differently from other ostensibly identical units of the same product line.... A design defect, in contrast, exists when the product is built in accordance with its intended specifications, but the design itself is inherently defective.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1237-7\"><em>McCabe, </em>100 Cal.App.4th at 1119-20, 123 Cal.Rptr.2d 303 (internal citations omitted) (paragraph structure altered).</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-8\">The Court agrees with the <em>Brothers </em>court that an express written warranty covering \u201cmaterials and workmanship\u201d does not include design defects. As articulated by the <em>McCabe </em>court, defects in design are of a wholly different character than those occurring in the manufacturing process, whether because the materials used were defective or because materials were assembled in a shoddy or otherwise improper manner. Thus, Plaintiffs may not base their express written warranty claims on an alleged design defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-9\">Nevertheless, although the Court concludes that claims based on a design defect are outside of the scope of the express written warranty that guarantees \u201cmaterials and workmanship,\u201d the Court does not agree with Defendants\u2019 assessment that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are based solely on alleged design defects. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege: \u201cThe failure to design, <em>assemble and manufacture </em>the ETCS-i wiring harnesses in such a way as to prevent mechanical and environmental stresses from causing various shorts and faults, including resistive faults which, in turn, sometimes cause sensor outputs consistent with a request by the driver to fully open the throttle .... \u201d (\u00b6 245(1)(h) (emphasis added)). Thus, to the extent that Plaintiffs\u2019 breach of express warranty claim is based on allegations other than design defects, they are not barred as beyond the scope of the warranty on \u201cmaterials and workmanship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-11\">5. <em>Unconscionability</em></p>\n<p id=\"Az3o\">Plaintiffs make allegations in the MCC that suggest they seek to avoid the limitations of the express written warranty on the basis of unconscionability. <em>(See </em>\u00b6\u00b6 347-48, 351-52.) Plaintiffs do not address Defendants\u2019 arguments regarding unconscionability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-12\">The law of contractual unconscionability is well established in California, and requires both procedural and substantive unconscionability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1237-13\">[U]nconscionability has both a procedural and a substantive element, the former focusing on oppression or surprise due to unequal bargaining power, the latter on overly harsh or one-sided results. The prevailing view is that procedural and substantive unconscionability must both be present in order for a court to exercise its discretion to refuse to enforce a contract or clause under the doctrine of unconscionability.... But they need not be present in the same degree. Essentially a sliding scale is invoked which disregards the regularity of the procedural process of the contract formation, that creates the terms, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>proportion to the greater harshness or unreasonableness of the substantive terms themselves.... In other words, the more substantively oppressive the contract term, the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable, and vice versa.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A95N\"><em>Armendariz v. Found. Health Psychcare Servs., Inc., </em>24 Cal.4th 83, 114, 99 Cal.Rptr.2d 745, 6 P.3d 669 (2000) (internal alteration marks, quotation marks, and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-4\">Plaintiffs allege that the warranties were offered on a \u201ctake-it-or-leave-it\u201d basis, resulting in a contract of adhesion, which tends toward procedural unconscionability. <em>(See </em>\u00b6 348.) However, \u201ca contract of adhesion is fully enforceable according to its terms unless certain other factors are present which ... operate to render it otherwise.\u201d <em>Graham v. Scissor-Tail, Inc., </em>28 Cal.3d 807, 819-20, 171 Cal.Rptr. 604, 623 P.2d 165 (1990) (per curiam) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-5\">Looking at the terms of the express written warranties, and in the absence of argument by Plaintiffs to the contrary, the Court discerns no substantive unconscionable terms. In the absence of any substantive unconscionability, Plaintiffs cannot avoid the terms of the express written warranty on the basis of unconscionability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-6\">B. <em>Express Warranty Created by Representations in Advertisements</em></p>\n<p id=\"ALcB\">Plaintiffs contend that, in addition to the express written warranty, Defendants extended an additional warranty by virtue of its statements regarding the safety and performance of their vehicles. This claim is based on Cal. Com.Code \u00a7 2313:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgV\">(1) Express warranties by the seller are created as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1238-7\">(a) Any affirmation of fact or promise made by the seller to the buyer which relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the affirmation or promise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1238-9\">(b) Any description of the goods which is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the description.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqYe\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-10\">To create a warranty, representations regarding a product must be specific and unequivocal. <em>See Johnson v. Mitsubishi Digital Elecs. Am., Inc., </em>578 F.Supp.2d 1229, 1236 (C.D.Cal.2008) (stating that to create an express warranty, the seller must make representations or promises with sufficient specificity); <em>Keith v. Buchanan, </em>173 Cal.App.3d 13, 21, 220 Cal.Rptr. 392 (1985) (setting forth factors to consider regarding whether a statement creates a warranty, including amount of specificity and lack of equivocalness).</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-11\">The Court finds that the statements alleged, when inferences are viewed in favor of Plaintiffs, are sufficiently specific and unequivocal. The thrust of Defendants\u2019 statements is that Toyota vehicles are safe; more specifically, their statements convey that Defendants\u2019 use of advanced technology in their vehicles, including ETCS, enhances safety. Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, if proven, represent the antithesis of these statements: ETCS (and/or some other unidentified defect) has resulted in dangerous SUA events. <em>See supra </em>section V.A.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-12\">Nevertheless, Plaintiffs cannot base a claim on this warranty in the absence of allegations that they were exposed to them. Defendants argue that these statements did not create any express warranty because they were not a \u201cbasis of the bargain\u201d as required by \u00a7 2313. Plaintiffs allege merely that Defendants\u2019 statements \u201cwere made ... in advertisements, in Toyota\u2019s \u2018e-brochures,\u2019 and in uniform statements provided by Toyota to be made by salespeople.\u201d (\u00b6 345.) Conspicuously ab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1183\">*1183</page-number>sent from their allegations is that they heard or read these statements or that the statements were otherwise disseminated to them.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> California law does not permit Plaintiffs, in the absence of specific allegations that they were aware of the statements made in a national advertising campaign, to base their express warranty claims on statements made in that national advertising campaign. <em>See Osborne v. Subaru of America, Inc., </em>198 Cal.App.3d 646, 660, 243 Cal.Rptr. 815 (1988) (rejecting an argument that court could infer plaintiffs reliance on a national advertising campaign).</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-5\">The authority cited by Plaintiffs does not counsel or compel a contrary conclusion. Plaintiffs rely on <em>Keith v. Buchanan, </em>173 Cal.App.3d 13, 21-22, 220 Cal.Rptr. 392 (1985), which states unequivocally, that \u201c[i]t is clear that statements made by a manufacturer or retailer in an advertising brochure which is disseminated to the consuming public in order to induce sales can create express warranties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, in <em>Keith, </em>as well as all the cases it cites in support of the quoted proposition, the record revealed that the Plaintiffs were recipients of the statements in the brochures or other sales literature. <em>Id. </em>Thus, <em>Keith </em>does not support the proposition that Plaintiffs are excused from pleading that they were exposed to the statements they allege create an express warranty. With respect to any Plaintiff not actually exposed to the advertising, the express contract claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-6\">C. <em>Implied Warranty</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1239-7\">Plaintiff brings its claim for breach of implied warranty pursuant to Cal. Com. Code \u00a7 2314, which sets forth the implied warranty of merchantability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1239-10\">[A] warranty that the goods shall be merchantable is implied in a contract for their sale if the seller is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind.... Goods to be merchantable must be ... fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1239-11\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2314(2) (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-12\">1. <em>The Requirement of Privity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1239-13\">This Court has before considered the requirement of vertical privity in connection with an implied warranty of merchantability. <em>See Anunziato v. eMachines, Inc., </em>402 F.Supp.2d 1133, 1141 (C.D.Cal.2005). There, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1239-14\">California recognizes the implied warranty of merchantability.... In California, a plaintiff alleging breach of warranty claims must stand in \u201cvertical privity\u201d with the defendant. The term \u201cvertical privity\u201d refers to links in the chain of distribution of goods. If the buyer and seller occupy adjoining links in the chain, they are in vertical privity with each other____ Further, if the retail buyer seeks warranty recovery against a manufacturer with whom he has no direct contractual nexus, the manufacturer would seek insulation via the vertical privity defense. Finally, there is no privity between the original seller and a subsequent purchaser who is in no way a party to the original sale.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1239-17\"><em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citations omitted); <em>accord, Clemens v. Daimler-Chrysler Corp., </em>534 F.3d 1017, 1023 (9th Cir.2008) (applying California law and dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1184\">*1184</page-number>missing, for lack of vertical privity, claims by a purchaser against a manufacturer).</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-4\">Although acknowledging the general rule that a plaintiff must be in privity with a defendant in order to assert an implied warranty claim, Plaintiffs here nonetheless argue two exceptions to the general rule, third-party beneficiary status and the sale of a dangerous instrumentality, excuse the lack of privity.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1240-5\">a. <em>Exception to Privity Requirement for Third-Party Beneficiaries</em></p>\n<p id=\"Act\">Plaintiffs contend that they may assert their implied warranty claim notwithstanding that the are admittedly not in vertical privity with Defendants. They do so based on the argument that third-party beneficiaries to contracts between other parties that create an implied warranty of merchantability may avail themselves of the implied warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-6\">The law in California on third-party beneficiaries is well established. By statute, Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 1559, a third-party beneficiary may enforce a contract made expressly for his or her benefit. <em>Id. </em>A contract made \u201cexpressly\u201d for a third party\u2019s benefit need not specifically name the party as the beneficiary; to be deemed a third-party beneficiary, one need only to have experienced more than an incidental benefit from the contract. <em>Gilbert Financial Corp. v. Steelform Contracting Co., </em>82 Cal.App.3d 65, 69, 145 Cal.Rptr. 448 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-7\">Although courts applying California law regarding the third-party beneficiary exception to the vertical privity requirement of implied warranty claims have come to differing conclusions, the clear weight of authority compels a conclusion that where plaintiffs successfully plead third-party beneficiary status, they successfully plead a breach of implied warranty claim. <em>Compare Gilbert, </em>82 Cal.App.3d at 69, 145 Cal.Rptr. 448 (finding that a homeowner, as a third-party beneficiary of a subcontractor\u2019s warranty in favor of the contractor who performed work on a residence, could maintain a breach of implied warranty claim against subcontractor notwithstanding the lack of privity between the homeowner and the subcontractor) <em>and Arnold v. Dow Chemical Co., </em>91 Cal.App.4th 698, 720, 110 Cal.Rptr.2d 722 (2001) (finding, based on the fact that distributors and retailers were not intended to be the ultimate consumers, that plaintiff could maintain breach of implied warranty claim notwithstanding the lack of privity with manufacturer of pesticide) <em>and Cartwright v. Viking Industries, Inc., </em>249 F.R.D. 351, 356 (E.D.Cal.2008) (relying on <em>Gilbert) </em>(concluding that plaintiffs were, as third-party beneficiaries, entitled to maintain a breach of implied warranty claim against the manufacturer where plaintiffs, not the distributors, were the intended consumers) <em>and In re Sony VAIO Computer Notebook Trackpad Litigation, </em>No. 09cv2109 BEN (RBB), 2010 WL 4262191, at *3 (S.D.Cal. Oct. 28, 2010) (holding that the facts as pled by plaintiffs \u2014 that the retailer from which they purchased defective products was manufacturer\u2019s authorized retailer and service facility \u2014 precluded dismissal of a breach of implied warranty claim for lack of privity) <em>with The NVIDIA GPU Liti</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1185\">*1185</page-number><em>gation, </em>No. C 08-04313 JW, 2009 WL 4020104, at *6-7 (N.D.Cal. Nov. 19, 2009) (finding, without elaboration, vertical privity requirement precluded breach of implied warranty claim against computer component manufacturer by purchasers of computers into which the component was incorporated because of the lack of allegations of a contract to which the computer purchasers were third-party beneficiaries).</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-5\">Thus, the Court concludes that where a plaintiff pleads that he or she is a third-party beneficiary to a contract that gives rise to the implied warranty of merchantability, he or she may assert a claim for the implied warranty\u2019s breach. Here, Plaintiffs have pled that they purchased vehicles from a network of dealers who are agents of Defendants. <em>(See </em>\u00b6\u00b6 77-78.) Like the plaintiffs in <em>Gilbert, Cartwright, </em>and <em>In re Sony VAIO, </em>Plaintiffs allege they were the intended consumers. <em>(See </em>\u00b6 363 (\u201cThe dealers were not intended to be the ultimate consumers of the Defective Vehicles and have no rights under the warranty agreements provided with the Defective Vehicles; the warranty agreements were designed for and intended to benefit the ultimate consumers only.\u201d).) Like those plaintiffs, they allege facts tending to support that they are third-party beneficiaries; therefore, Plaintiffs\u2019 breach of implied warranty claim is not precluded by the lack of vertical privity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-6\">Toyota\u2019s reliance on <em>Clemens v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., </em>534 F.3d 1017 (9th Cir.2008), a Ninth Circuit case applying California law, neither compels nor counsels a contrary result. There, the Ninth Circuit considered an implied warranty claim that a vehicle purchaser asserted against the manufacturer from which he did not directly purchase the vehicle, ultimately affirming the district court\u2019s dismissal based on the lack of vertical privity. <em>Id. </em>at 1021, 1023-24. However, the court did not consider the third-party beneficiary exception to the vertical privity requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 1023. Instead, after noting exceptions based on a plaintiffs reliance on written labels or advertisements, an employer-employee relationship, and in \u201cspecial cases\u201d involving food, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals, the court went on to note that the plaintiff did not seek applications of any of the established exceptions. <em>Id. </em>at 1023. Rather, the plaintiff in <em>Clemens </em>invited the creation of a \u201csimilar exception\u201d for his case, a invitation which the court declined, noting that \u201ca federal court sitting in diversity is not free to create new exceptions to it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1024. Thus, the Ninth Circuit had no occasion in <em>Clemens </em>to consider the California appellate cases recognizing the third-party beneficiary exception to the vertical privity requirement of implied warranty claims and, for this reason, <em>Clemens </em>is not at odds with the Court\u2019s decision, which merely applies an established exception articulated by California appellate courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-8\">b. <em>Exception: Dangerous Instrumentality</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1241-9\">Plaintiffs also advocate for an exception to the privity requirement for the sale of \u201cdangerous instrumentalities.\u201d Fifty years ago, the California Supreme Court rejected the suggestion that it adopt a blanket rule that a plaintiff exposed to dangerous instrumentalities with latent defects need not be in privity with the manufacturer to sue for breach of warranty. <em>Peterson v. Lamb Rubber Co., </em>54 Cal.2d 339, 346-47, 5 Cal.Rptr. 863, 353 P.2d 575 (1960) (\u201cThus, none of these five cases provides clear support for the general proposition for which they were cited: that privity is not required where the item sold was inherently dangerous.\u201d). The court did so in favor of a rule that permitted employees to be considered \u201ca member of the industrial \u2018family\u2019 of the employer,\u201d who was in privity with the manufacturer. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1186\">*1186</page-number><em>Id. </em>The current Plaintiffs do not fall within such a subset.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on <em>Alvarez v. Felker Mfg. Co., </em>230 Cal.App.2d 987, 41 Cal.Rptr. 514 (1964), does not compel a contrary result. Although Plaintiffs cite dicta from <em>Alvarez </em>that tends to support their position, the <em>Alvarez </em>court later clarifies that a manufacturer\u2019s strict liability for latent defects in dangerous instrumentalities is a creature of tort law, not breach of warranty. <em>Id. </em>at 1005, 41 Cal.Rptr. 514 (\u201cThe nature of the strict liability of a manufacturer resulting from the sale of defective products was finally put to rest by <em>Green-man^] </em>which declared that such liability is not one governed by the law of contract warranties or the implied warranties of the sales act, but by the law of strict liability in tort, and that the rules defining and governing warranties cannot properly be invoked to govern the manufacturer\u2019s liability to those injured by its defective products unless those rules also serve the purposes for which such liability is imposed.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-5\">Thus, Plaintiffs\u2019 lack of vertical privity is not excused by the dangerous instrumentality exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-6\">2. <em>Manifestation of Defect</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1242-7\">Defendants contend that those Plaintiffs whose vehicles have not manifested the alleged defect because they have not been involved in an SUA event may not maintain a breach of implied warranty claim. Defendants rely on <em>American Suzuki Motor Corp. v. Superior Court of L.A. County, </em>37 Cal.App.4th 1291, 1296-98, 44 Cal.Rptr.2d 526 (1995), which held that a class of vehicle owners prone to roll-over accidents should be decertified because the relevant evidence established that only a small percentage of the vehicles had been involved in accidents. In the absence of a defect that manifested itself more frequently, the California Court of Appeal held that there was no ascertainable class. <em>Id. </em>at 1299, 44 Cal.Rptr.2d 526. A subsequent California Supreme Court case has suggested that <em>American Suzuki </em>represented an impermissible inquiry into the merits of claims in resolving a motion for class certification. <em>See Linder v. Thrifty Oil Co., </em>23 Cal.4th 429, 443, 97 Cal.Rptr.2d 179, 2 P.3d 27 (2000); <em>cf. Conley v. Pacific Gas and Elec. Co., </em>131 Cal.App.4th 260, 268, 31 Cal.Rptr.3d 719 (2005) (\u201cWe agree that the holding in <em>American Suzuki </em>on which the trial court relied has been placed in serious question, if not overruled, by <em>Linder\u2019s </em>holding that class certification generally should not be conditioned upon a showing that class claims for relief are likely to prevail.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-9\">In the present context, the Court finds <em>American Suzuki </em>of little persuasive value. This case is at the pleadings stage, and evidence on the relative occurrence of events of SUA is undefined. Thus, Defendants\u2019 authority does not support dismissal of Plaintiffs\u2019 breach of implied warranty claims at the pleadings stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-10\">VII. <em>Breach of Contract/Common Law Warranty Claims (Eighth Cause of Action)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1242-11\">Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 eighth cause of action based on common law causes of action as duplicative of their statutory claims. Plaintiffs oppose, explaining these claims are pled in the alternative, which is permitted pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(d)(2) and 8(a)(3). Dismissal of these common law alternatives at the pleadings stage is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-12\">VIII. <em>Revocation of Acceptance (Sixth Cause of Action)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1242-13\">Plaintiffs bring a claim pursuant to Cal. Com.Code \u00a7 2608 for revocation. Defendants contend that Plaintiffs may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1187\">*1187</page-number>revoke acceptance against a non-seller manufacturer. The Court agrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-5\">Section 2608 of the California Commercial Code provides for revocation of acceptance of defective goods:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1243-6\">(1) The buyer may revoke his acceptance of a lot or commercial unit whose nonconformity substantially impairs its value to him if he has accepted it</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1243-7\">(a) On the reasonable assumption that its nonconformity would be cured and it has not been seasonably cured; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1243-8\">(b) Without discovery of such nonconformity if his acceptance was reasonably induced either by the difficulty of discovery before acceptance or by the seller\u2019s assurances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1243-9\">(2) Revocation of acceptance must occur within a reasonable time after the buyer discovers or should have discovered the ground for it and before any substantial change in condition of the goods which is not caused by their own defects. It is not effective until the buyer notifies the seller of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1243-10\">(3) A buyer who so revokes has the same rights and duties with regard to the goods involved as if he had rejected them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1243-11\">Cal. CoimCode \u00a7 2608.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-12\">Under \u00a7 2608, a seller who accepts goods without discovery of a defect based on the difficulty of discovery of that defect or by the seller\u2019s assurances, may thereafter revoke his or her acceptance so long as revocation occurs \u201cwithin a reasonable time\u201d after discovery. <em>Id. </em>Revocation becomes effective when the buyer notifies the \u201cseller\u201d of revocation. A \u201cseller\u201d is defined as \u201ca person who sells or contracts to sell goods.\u201d Cal. Com.Code \u00a7 2103(l)(d). A \u201csale\u201d is \u201cthe passing of title from the seller to the buyer for a price.\u201d Cal. Com.Code \u00a7 2106(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-13\">Here, with the exception of the Plaintiffs discussed in note 23, <em>supra, </em>who allege they purchased vehicles directly from Defendants, Plaintiffs have not alleged that they purchased their vehicles from Defendants. Thus, they seek revocation against an improper Defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-15\">Plaintiffs acknowledge Defendants\u2019 role in their purchase transactions; however, they cite a number of cases in which UCC revocation against non-sellers was permitted. These non-California cases do not convince the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-16\">Plaintiffs rely on <em>Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Harper, </em>671 F.2d 1117, 1126 (8th Cir.1982), in which the court applied Arkansas\u2019s version of U.C.C. \u00a7 2-608, rejecting an argument that a purchaser could not revoke as to a non-seller manufacturer; however, in doing so, it noted that failure to allow such revocation would leave the purchaser without a remedy because the intermediary was no longer in business. <em>Id. </em>Such a result, the court noted, would be inconsistent with the UCC\u2019s remedial purpose. <em>Id. </em>The present allegations do not suggest that this situation is of concern in the present case. Additionally, in reaching its conclusion, the court in <em>Harper </em>relied on the elimination, by Arkansas statutory law, of the privity requirement as to UCC warranties; in contrast, California has not eliminated the privity requirement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1243-17\">Plaintiffs also rely on <em>Durfee v. Rod Baxter Imports, Inc., </em>262 N.W.2d 349, 357-58 (Minn.1977), which applied Minnesota\u2019s version of U.C.C. \u00a7 2-608, permitting revocation of a purchase agreement. <em>Id. </em>However, the court did so based on the UCC provision that allows a purchaser to elude the limitation of a warranty where it fails of its essential purpose. <em>See e.g., </em>Cal. Com.Code \u00a7 2719 (U.C.C. \u00a7 2-719). Plaintiffs here do not argue, other than briefly quoting <em>Durfee </em>on this point, that the relevant express written warranty fails of its essential purpose within the meaning of Cal. CoimCode \u00a7 2719. In the absence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1188\">*1188</page-number>of briefing on the issue whether the relevant warranties have failed of their essential purpose, the Court does not address it.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1244-4\">The rationale of <em>Volkswagen of America, Inc. v. Novak, </em>418 So.2d 801, 804 (Miss.1982), is similar. This case also noted that permitting revocation as to a non-seller manufacturer was appropriate where \u201cthe retailer[\u2019]s sales contract [was] accompanied by the manufacturer\u2019s warranty, [such that they] are so closely linked both in time of delivery and subject matter, that they blend[ ] into a single unit at the time of sale.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The <em>Volkswagen </em>court cites no authority for this extension of the UCC beyond its clear language, and there is no indication that California would adopt such a strained construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-5\">Similarly, another case upon which Plaintiffs rely, <em>Gochey v. Bombardier, Inc., </em>153 Vt. 607, 613, 572 A.2d 921, 924 (Vt. 1990), blurs the distinction between the manufacturer\u2019s warranty and the purchase contract with a retailer in a manner not supported by California law. <em>Id. </em>at 613, 572 A.2d 921 (\u201cWhen the manufacturer\u2019s defect results in revocation by the consumer, the manufacturer must assume the liability it incurred when it warranted the product to the ultimate user.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-6\">Thus, the Court concludes Plaintiffs have not stated a claim for revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-7\">IX. <em>Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act (Seventh Cause of Action)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1244-8\">\n<em>A. Relation to State Warranty Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-9\">Defendants and Plaintiffs agree that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims pursuant to the Magnuson-Moss Warranty-Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act (\u201cMMA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2301-2312, <em>et seq., </em>is dependent upon their state-law warranty claims. <em>See Daugherty, </em>144 Cal.App.4th at 833, 51 Cal.Rptr.3d 118 (noting that MMA \u201cauthorizes a civil suit by a consumer to enforce the terms of an implied or express warranty [and] \u2018calls for the application of state written and implied warranty law, not the creation of additional federal law\u2019 \u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Thus, to the extent Plaintiffs have stated express and implied warranty claims, they have also stated claims under the MMA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-12\">B. <em>Requirement that Consumers Follow Dispute Resolution Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1244-13\">Defendants argue that the MMA claims must be dismissed to the extent they are asserted by Plaintiffs who failed to avail themselves of Toyota\u2019s informal dispute resolution procedures as required by 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2310(a). Toyota\u2019s Warranty Manuals detail its \u201cDispute Settlement Program.\u201d <em>(See, e.g., </em>Gilford Decl. Ex. B at 22 (noting that consumers \u201cmust use the Dispute Settlement Program before seeking remedies through a court action pursuant to the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act.\u201d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-14\">The MMA contains an explicit congressional policy statement encouraging \u201cwarrantors to establish procedures whereby consumer disputes are fairly and expeditiously settled through informal dispute settlement mechanisms.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2310(a)(1). Pursuant to this policy, a \u201cclass of consumers may not proceed in a class action ... unless the named plaintiffs ... initially resort to [the warrantor\u2019s informal dispute settlement mechanism].\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2310(a)(3)(C)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-15\">Plaintiffs contend that compliance with the informal dispute settlement procedure is excused because, in light of Defendants\u2019 response to incidents of SUA events, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1189\">*1189</page-number>would be futile. <em>(See </em>Pltfs.\u2019 Opp\u2019n Brief at 48.) One district court in the Ninth Circuit has recognized a futility exception to the pre-suit requirement of utilizing an informal dispute mechanism. <em>See Milicevic v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC, </em>256 F.Supp.2d 1168, 1179 (D.Nev.2003), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>402 F.3d 912 (9th Cir.2005). Another district court in the Ninth Circuit, although denying a motion to certify a class of plaintiffs asserting MMA claims based on the representatives\u2019 failure to avail themselves of a dispute settlement mechanism, nevertheless left open the possibility that, under the right circumstances, compliance with such a mechanism might be excused. <em>See Parkinson v. Hyundai Motor America, </em>258 F.R.D. 580, 593 (C.D.Cal.2008) (\u201cPlaintiffs do not allege any attempt to use the BBB Auto Line to resolve their MMA claims because, as they assert, such attempts are \u2018unnecessary and/or futile.\u2019 ... Without further elaboration by plaintiffs regarding the alleged futility ..., the Court concludes that plaintiffs\u2019 MMA claims are not certifiable.\u201d) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-5\">In the absence of additional federal case law to the contrary, which the parties have not cited and the Court\u2019s research has not revealed, the Court is inclined to follow the lead of the other district courts in this circuit. At the pleadings stage, the Court cannot say whether attempts to comply with the informal dispute settlement procedure put in place by Toyota are futile. Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations allow for such an inference. <em>(See e.g., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 236-243 (description of Defendants\u2019 response to claims of SUA events).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-6\">X. <em>Fraud by Concealment (Ninth Cause of Action)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1245-7\">A. <em>Heightened Pleading Requirement and Elements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1245-8\">As previously noted, to survive a motion to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), allegations of fraud must meet the heightened pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). <em>See supra </em>section V.A. As applied to Plaintiffs\u2019 claim for fraud by concealment, a fraud by omission or fraud by concealment claim \u201ccan succeed without the same level of specificity required by a normal fraud claim.\u201d <em>Baggett, </em>582 F.Supp.2d at 1267. This is because \u201c[Requiring a plaintiff to identify (or suffer dismissal) the precise time, place, and content of an event that (by definition) did not occur would effectively gut state laws prohibiting fraud-by-omission.\u201d <em>In re Whirlpool Corp. Front-Loading Washer Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>684 F.Supp.2d 942, 961 (N.D.Ohio 2009). Similarly, Rule 9(b)\u2019s requirement may also be relaxed as to matters within the opposing party\u2019s knowledge; for example, in cases of corporate fraud where plaintiffs lack personal knowledge of all underlying facts. <em>Moore v. Kayport Package Exp., Inc., </em>885 F.2d 531, 540 (9th Cir.1989). In such matters, allegations may be made on information and belief so long as they are accompanied by a statement of facts on which the belief is founded. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1245-10\">To state a claim for fraudulent concealment under California law, a plaintiff must allege: \u201c \u2018(1) a misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (2) knowledge of falsity (or scienter); (3) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce reliance; (4) justifiable reliance; and (5) resulting damage.\u2019 \u201d <em>Baggett v. Hewlett-Packard Co., </em>582 F.Supp.2d 1261, 1267 (C.D.Cal.2007) (quoting <em>Robinson Helicopter Co. v. Dana Corp., </em>34 Cal.4th 979, 990, 22 Cal.Rptr.3d 352, 102 P.3d 268 (2004)). If the alleged fraud is based upon a concealment, it is actionable only if the defendant had a duty to disclose the concealed fact. <em>Id. </em>at 1267. A plaintiff may demonstrate a duty to disclose in four circumstances: \u201c(1) when the defendant is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190\">*1190</page-number>in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiff; (2) when the defendant had exclusive knowledge of material facts not known to the plaintiff; (3) when the defendant actively conceals a material fact from the plaintiff; and (4) when the defendant makes partial representations but also suppresses some material fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1267-68 (citing <em>LiMandri, </em>52 Cal.App.4th at 336, 60 Cal.Rptr.2d 539). Information is material when, \u201chad the omitted information been disclosed, the reasonable consumer would have been aware of it and behaved differently.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1268 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-4\">B. <em>Pleading-with-Particularity Requirement of Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1246-5\">The crux of Toyota\u2019s argument that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are deficiently pled is that Plaintiffs fail to identify a common defect or malfunction in the ETCS that was supposedly concealed from consumers. (Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 20-21.) Toyota argues that listing potential defects that cause SUA is insufficient to meet the particularity requirements of Rule 9(b), and that Plaintiffs do not present any alleged representations or omissions to back up their fraud by concealment claim. <em>(Id. </em>at 22.) Toyota\u2019s supposed failures to disclose amount to nothing more than conclusory statements based on Plaintiffs\u2019 unsupported theory that the ETCS contains a mysterious defect. <em>(Id. </em>at 28.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-6\">In response, Plaintiffs allege that the common defect is SUA, which has resulted in thousands of crashes and at least 78 deaths, which may have been prevented but for a second defect, the lack of a fail safe, such as a brake-override system. (Pltfs.\u2019 Opp\u2019n Brief at 1.) The series of defects that can cause SUA, combined with the statistically significant increase in SUA events in cars with ETCS, present serious safety risks that were not disclosed to consumers. <em>(Id. </em>at 23.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-7\">The Court finds that Plaintiffs plead fraudulent concealment with the requisite particularity under Rule 9(b). Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations include specific facts showing Toyota\u2019s knowledge and concealment of the alleged defect, including: concealment of technical service bulletins (\u00b6 116), withholding knowledge of tens of thousands of consumer complaints potentially related to SUA (\u00b6 149), failure to report replication of non-driver-error SUA event to NHTSA (\u00b6 151), documenting SUA in \u201cField Technical Reports\u201d and a \u201cDealership Report\u201d that were not disclosed to consumers (\u00b6 152-54), claiming lack of diagnostic code to cover up alleged SUA defect (\u00b6 165), concealment of 60,000 \u201csurging\u201d complaints (\u00b6 170), internally recognizing but not disclosing \u201c[fjlaws in Toyota Regulatory and Defect Process\u201d (\u00b6 175), withholding \u201cTechnical Information\u201d bulletin and sticky accelerator information from U.S. distributors and consumers (\u00b6\u00b6 203-04), misstating that \u201cno defect exists\u201d and erroneously stating that NHTSA confirmed as much (\u00b6\u00b6 205-06), concealing the fact that \u201cWE HAVE A tendency for MECHANICAL failure in accelerator pedals ... The time to hide on this one is over. We need to come clean----\u201d (\u00b6 213, emphasis cited in MCC from underlying source), allegedly ignoring documents \u201ccontaining] preliminary fault analysis\u201d (\u00b6 222), and instructing quality control employees to cover up defects (\u00b6 235), among others.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-10\">These allegations sufficiently plead the \u201cwhat\u201d (concealment of an SUA defect (\u00b6 398)), the \u201cwhy\u201d (to induce customers to purchase Toyota cars at the prices sold (\u00b6 401)), and the \u201chow\u201d (instead of telling consumers about SUA problems, the problems were concealed so that Toyota\u2019s business would not be disrupted by NHTSA investigations and/or recalls and of negative publicity (\u00b6\u00b6 158-60, 169, 171)). <em>See, e.g., Baggett, </em>582 F.Supp.2d at 1267, <em>Marsikian v. Mercedes Benz USA, LLC, </em>Case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number>No. CV 08-04876 AHM (JTLx), 2009 U.S. Dist.

Dell, Inc., </em>706 F.Supp.2d 1122, 1133 (W.D.Wash.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-5\">Unlike the unsupported defect alleged in <em>Alienware, </em>cited by Toyota, Plaintiffs here include facts in support of their allegations. <em>See Oestreicher, </em>544 F.Supp.2d at 974. While the Court is mindful that allegations of fraud, without more, cannot be the basis for an alleged design defect claim, <em>id., </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 fraudulent concealment claim pleads particular facts in support of the defect allegations, and that is all that is required at this stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-6\">C. <em>Fraudulent Concealment</em></p>\n<p id=\"AA8d\">1. <em>Duty to Disclose</em></p>\n<p id=\"Alp\">The Court finds that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged a fraudulent concealment claim under California law. First, because Plaintiffs allege concealment, they must demonstrate that Toyota had a duty to disclose the concealed information. Plaintiffs do not allege that Toyota owed them a duty to disclose as a result of a fiduciary relationship. Rather, they argue that (a) Toyota had exclusive knowledge of material facts not known to Plaintiffs, (b) Toyota actively concealed material facts from Plaintiffs, and (c) Toyota made partial representations while suppressing some material facts. (Pltfs.\u2019 Opp\u2019n Brief at 26.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-7\">Toyota argues that Plaintiffs cannot establish that Toyota owed them a duty to disclose. (Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 28-29.) It contends that Plaintiffs do not allege facts to show that Toyota had exclusive knowledge of the alleged ETCS defect, or that it actively concealed such information to induce Plaintiffs to purchase its vehicles. <em>(Id. </em>at 29.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-10\">Taking each duty to disclose factor in turn, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged a duty to disclose.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A0X\">a. <em>Exclusive Knowledge of Material Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1247-11\">Whether non-disclosed information is material depends on the effect the information would have on a reasonable consumer. <em>Falk, </em>496 F.Supp.2d at 1095. Plaintiffs allege that had the SUA defect been disclosed, they would have acted differently. (\u00b6 403.) Alone, this allegation may be insufficient to establish materiality. <em>See Chamberlan v. Ford Motor Co., </em>369 F.Supp.2d 1138, 1145 (N.D.Cal.2005) (similar anecdotal evidence on its own insufficient to raise genuine issue on summary judgment). Plaintiffs also argue that reasonable people would find the concealed information regarding the SUA defect material. (\u00b6\u00b6 398, 400.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-12\">Given the fact that an average consumer would not expect an SUA defect, combined with the high costs and risks associated with potential serious accidents, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations are sufficient to demonstrate materiality. The Court agrees with the reasoning in <em>Falk </em>that \u201c[c]ommon experience supports Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that a potential car buyer would view as material a defeet[]\u201d that relates to control over the speed of the car. <em>Id. </em>at 1096 (discussing speedometer readout defect). Because the alleged SUA defect affects whether a potential car buyer can safely maintain control over the speed of the car, the alleged defect is material.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-13\">Plaintiffs further allege that Toyota had exclusive knowledge pertaining to the SUA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1192\">*1192</page-number>defect. Specifically, Toyota had superior and/or exclusive knowledge of: NHTSA\u2019s findings of a 400% increase in \u2018^Vehicle Speed\u201d complaints in Camry\u2019s with ETCS (\u00b6 122), 37,000 concealed consumer complaints (\u00b6\u00b6 124,149), secret Field Technical Reports and Dealership Report (\u00b6\u00b6 129, 152-54, 210), issues with the electronic throttle actuator assemblies shared only with dealers and later NHTSA (\u00b6 145), eliminated reference to ETCS/speed control problems (\u00b6\u00b6 158-59), concealed \u201csurging\u201d complaints (\u00b6 170), and the increasing number of consumer complaints post-recall, demonstrating the problem has not been fixed (\u00b6 219).</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-4\">Taking Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations as true, they support a claim of Toyota\u2019s exclusive knowledge. <em>See Falk, </em>496 F.Supp.2d at 1096 (sufficient allegations of exclusive knowledge where car manufacturer had exclusive access to aggregate dealership data, pre-release testing data, and numerous consumer complaints). The record of complaints made by Toyota customers show that Toyota was clearly aware of the alleged SUA problem.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> While Toyota shared some information regarding SUA with NHTSA and eventually with consumers, Toyota remained in a superior position of knowledge. While prospective customers could have been tipped off to the possibility of SUA by researching past complaints filed with NHTSA, many customers would not have performed such a search, nor would they be expected to. Thus, Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that Toyota knew significantly more about the alleged SUA defect than the limited information that was eventually shared with the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-6\">b. <em>Active Concealment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1248-7\">Plaintiffs sufficiently allege active concealment. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that starting in 2002, Toyota was on notice of an SUA defect, but hid this defect from regulators and consumers. (\u00b6 398; <em>see also </em>\u00b6\u00b6 131, 134, 149, 151, 160, 170, 186 (withholding information from NHTSA); \u00b6 137 (allegedly misstating that no evidence of propensity for SUA was found in ETCS vehicles).) Toyota actively concealed a substantial portion of consumer complaints regarding SUA and excluded relevant categories of incidents when investigations were underway. (\u00b6 398; <em>see also </em>\u00b6\u00b6 149, 170 (withholding consumer complaints).) Further, Toyota actively concealed the real reason for the recall and concealed the fact that floor mats were not the only culprit. (\u00b6 398; <em>see also </em>\u00b6 228 (70% of SUA events are not accounted for in the floor mat and sticky pedal recalls).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that Toyota repeatedly denied the existence of the alleged SUA defect (e.g., \u00b6\u00b6 236-41) are sufficient to demonstrate active concealment. <em>See Tietsworth, </em>720 F.Supp.2d at 1135-36 (active concealment sufficiently alleged where plaintiffs contacted defendant for service of defective machines and were told there was no defect and/or denied free service or replacement parts).</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-9\">While Toyota\u2019s recall in and of itself does not support a permissible inference that Toyota actively concealed the alleged SUA defect, <em>see Tietsworth, </em>2009 WL 3320486, at *5, the additional allegations that recall repairs were offered alongside Toyota covering up the true defect may lead to such an inference. <em>(See, e.g., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 201, 228, 235, 398 (covering up defect and/or other causes).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1193\">*1193</page-number>c. <em>Partial Representations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1249-5\">In support of their partial representations argument, Plaintiffs point to \u201cthe exact language Toyota used to describe vehicle safety to customers.\u201d (Pltfs.\u2019 Opp\u2019n Brief at 26.) Plaintiffs contend that the representations made therein are false because the vehicles have a propensity to accelerate suddenly and lack an adequate fail-safe mechanism. <em>(Id. </em>at 23.) Toyota argues that its alleged partial disclosures in the form of generalized assertions made to the public regarding safety do not give rise to a duty to disclose. (Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 30.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-6\">However, an examination of the statements Plaintiffs allege were made reveal that at least some of them may be misleading <em>(see, e.g., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 102-03 (discussing safety systems while not disclosing alleged SUA defect and lack of fail-safe mechanism; implying the recalls will \u201cmake[] things right\u201d)), and others can be proved or disproved during discovery <em>(see, e.g., </em>\u00b6242 (\u201cthere have been no confirmed or documented reports or findings of any type of computer malfunctions related to the brake/acceleration or electrical systems\u201d); \u00b6 244 (\u201cthe brakes will always override the throttle\u201d); \u00b6 245(4)(a) (Toyota has told the public it conducted extensive electronic defect testing when it allegedly did not).) The latter statements are enough to allege partial misrepresentations. <em>See, e.g., Anunziato, </em>402 F.Supp.2d at 1139 (\u201cWhile some of eMachines\u2019 representations constitute puffery, others do not.... [A]t least some actionable statements have been pled.\u201d); <em>Stickrath v. Globalstar, Inc., </em>527 F.Supp.2d 992, 998-99 (N.D.Cal.2007) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-9\">2. <em>Remaining Fraud Elements</em></p>\n<p id=\"AcZ\">The Court finds Plaintiffs sufficiently allege the remaining elements of a fraudulent concealment claim under California law. Plaintiffs plead that Toyota knew or should have known of the alleged SUA defect, as demonstrated in the many citations to the MCC above regarding Toyota\u2019s knowledge. Plaintiffs also plead that Toyota intended to defraud them in order to induce reliance on the part of consumers so they would buy Toyota vehicles. (\u00b6 401.) Plaintiffs allege justifiable reliance that the vehicles would be free from an SUA defect (\u00b6\u00b6398, 400, 403), and resulting damage (\u00b6 260), including under Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 3343 or Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 1692. (\u00b6 404.) <em>See Falk, </em>496 F.Supp.2d at 1099.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-10\">Thus, Toyota\u2019s motion to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 fraudulent concealment claim is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-11\">XI. <em>Unjust Enrichment (Tenth Cause of Action)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1249-12\">Plaintiffs have asserted a claim for unjust enrichment. (\u00b6\u00b6 406-10.) The Court agrees with Toyota that unjust enrichment is not an independent cause of action under California law. Plaintiffs have cited several cases where claims for unjust enrichment have proceeded past the pleading stage.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> (Opp\u2019n Brief at 50-51.) Nonethe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1194\">*1194</page-number>less, the Court is not persuaded that an independent cause of action for unjust enrichment is cognizable under California law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-4\">Courts consistently have held that unjust enrichment is not a proper cause of action under California law. \u201cThe phrase \u2018unjust enrichment\u2019 does not describe a theory of recovery, but an effect: the result of a failure to make restitution under circumstances where it is equitable to do so.\u201d <em>Melchior v. New Line Prod., Inc., </em>106 Cal.App.4th 779, 793, 131 Cal.Rptr.2d 347 (2003) (quoting <em>Lauriedale Assoc., Ltd. v. Wilson, </em>7 Cal.App.4th 1439, 1448, 9 Cal.Rptr.2d 774 (1992)). \u201cUnjust enrichment is a general principle, underlying various legal doctrines and remedies, rather than a remedy itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Dinosaur Dev., Inc. v. White, </em>216 Cal.App.3d 1310, 1315, 265 Cal.Rptr. 525 (1989) (quotation marks omitted)). Simply put, \u201cthere is no cause of action in California for unjust enrichment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, Plaintiffs\u2019 claim for unjust enrichment fails to state a claim for which relief may be granted.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1250-5\">Accordingly, the Court dismisses Plaintiffs\u2019 claim for unjust enrichment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-6\">XII. <em>Availability of Injunctive Relief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1250-7\">Toyota contends that Plaintiffs may not be awarded the injunctive relief they seek because the requested injunction would amount to a nationwide recall that is preempted by a federal statute, and because the relief sought is within the primary jurisdiction of an administrative agency. The Court rejects both theories.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-8\">A. <em>Preemption</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1250-9\">Plaintiffs have requested an \u201cinjunction ordering Toyota to implement an effective fail-safe mechanism on all vehicles with ETCS.\u201d (MCC at 153 (prayer for relief \u00b6 i).) Toyota argues that the requested injunction amounts to a court-ordered recall and, therefore, must be stricken because a nation-wide recall is preempted by the National Traffic Safety Act of 1966 (the \u201cSafety Act\u201d), 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 30101 <em>et seq. </em>(Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 51.) Several courts have decided whether claims requesting injunctive relief are preempted by the Safety Act; in doing so, these courts have reached contrary results. <em>Compare, e.g., In re Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc. Tires Prod. Liab. Litig., </em>153 F.Supp.2d 935, 948 (S.D.Ind.2001) (hereinafter, <em>\u201cBridge-stone </em>\u201d) (dismissing claim requesting relief in the form of a judicial recall as preempted by the Safety Act), <em>and Cox House Moving, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., </em>Case No. 7:06-1218-HMH, 2006 WL 2303182, at *9 (D.S.C. Aug. 8, 2006) (same), <em>with Chamberlan, </em>314 F.Supp.2d at 967 (denying motion to dismiss a claim seeking injunctive relief under the UCL on the grounds that the claim was not preempted by the Safety Act), <em>and Marsikian, </em>2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 117012, at *21 (same). The Court finds the reasoning of <em>Chamberlan </em>and <em>Marsikian </em>more compelling than that of <em>Bridgestone </em>and <em>Cox House Moving.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1250-15\">As a preliminary matter, the Court notes that Toyota\u2019s briefs do not clearly state the grounds for Toyota\u2019s motion on this issue. Toyota asserts that Plaintiffs\u2019 request for an injunction \u201cmust be stricken,\u201d (Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 51), and that the authorities it cites \u201crequir[e] dismissal of automobile recall claims.\u201d (Reply at 20.) The Court, therefore, is unclear as to whether Toyota is moving to strike the requested relief pursuant to Rule 12(f) or to dismiss a claim or claims underlying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1195\">*1195</page-number>requested relief pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). If Toyota is moving to dismiss claims underlying Plaintiffs\u2019 requested relief pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), Toyota has failed to state which of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims it seeks to dismiss on the grounds of preemption. In fact, other than a vague reference to \u201cautomobile recall claims,\u201d Toyota has not identified specific claims asserted by Plaintiffs that are preempted by the Safety Act. This omission, in conjunction with Toyota\u2019s statement that the requested relief \u201cmust be stricken,\u201d implies that Toyota is moving to strike Plaintiffs\u2019 request for injunctive relief under Rule 12(f). However, Rule 12(f) does not provide proper grounds to strike Plaintiffs\u2019 request for injunctive relief. In resolving the issue of first impression earlier this year, the Ninth Circuit held \u201cthat Rule 12(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure does not authorize a district court to strike a claim for damages on the ground that such damages are precluded as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Whittlestone, Inc. v. Handi-Craft Co., </em>618 F.3d 970, 971 (9th Cir.2010). The Ninth Circuit\u2019s reasoning in <em>Whittlestone </em>applies with equal force to claims for injunctive relief. <em>See East v. City of Richmond, </em>Case No. C 10-2392 SBA, 2010 WL 4580112, at *6 n. 3 (N.D.Cal. Nov. 3, 2010). Nonetheless, the Court will proceed with the preemption analysis because, even if Toyota argues that certain claims should be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) on preemption grounds, the Court finds that Toyota has failed to show that Plaintiffs\u2019 request for injunctive relief or any claims underlying Plaintiffs\u2019 requested relief are preempted by the Safety Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-7\">Federal preemption of State law may be express or implied. <em>Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>463 U.S. 85, 95, 103 S.Ct. 2890, 77 L.Ed.2d 490 (1983). The Safety Act does not include \u201cexplicit preemptive language.\u201d <em>Pac. Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. State Energy Res. Conservation &amp; Dev. Comm\u2019n, </em>461 U.S. 190, 203, 103 S.Ct. 1713, 75 L.Ed.2d 752 (1983). In fact, the Safety Act expressly provides that rights and remedies created by the Act are supplemental to rights and remedies provided by State law. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 30103(d). Thus, the Safety Act does not expressly preempt State law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-8\">Where the Court determines that Congress has not expressly preempted State law, the Court will consider whether Congress has impliedly preempted State law. There are two types of implied preemption: field preemption and conflict preemption. <em>Crosby v. Nat\u2019l Foreign Trade Council, </em>530 U.S. 363, 372, 120 S.Ct. 2288, 147 L.Ed.2d 352 (2000). Toyota does not argue that field preemption applies.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Rather, Toyota argues that conflict preemption is present. <em>(See </em>Mot. Brief at 53, Reply Brief at 19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-9\">Conflict preemption exists \u201cwhere state law conflicts with federal law, either [(1)] because it [i]s impossible to comply with both laws or [ (2) ] because state law stands as an obstacle to accomplishing the purposes of federal law.\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Meat Ass\u2019n v. Brown, </em>599 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1196\">*1196</page-number>F.3d 1093, 1097 (9th Cir.2010). The former is commonly referred to as impossibility, while the latter is commonly referred to as frustration-of-purpose. <em>See Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., </em>529 U.S. 861, 874, 120 S.Ct. 1913, 146 L.Ed.2d 914 (2000). Toyota argues that Plaintiffs\u2019 request for an injunction is preempted on frustration-of-purpose grounds, as a \u201cnationwide, court-ordered recall [which] would directly conflict with and frustrate the Safety Act.\u201d (Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 53) (quoting <em>Lilly v. Ford Motor Co., </em>Case No. 00 C 7372, 2002 WL 84603, at *5 (N.D.Ill. Jan. 22, 2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).) For the Court to find that Plaintiffs\u2019 requested relief is conflict-preempted, \u201c[t]here must be \u2018clear evidence\u2019 of such a conflict.\u201d <em>Chamberlan, </em>314 F.Supp.2d at 957 (quoting <em>Geier, </em>529 U.S. at 885, 120 S.Ct. 1913). \u201cSpeculative or hypothetical conflict is not sufficient: only State law that \u2018actually conflicts\u2019 with federal law is preempted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Cipollone v. Liggett Grp., Inc., </em>505 U.S. 504, 516, 112 S.Ct. 2608, 120 L.Ed.2d 407 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-4\">As a threshold matter, the Court must decide if the presumption against preemption applies to this case. \u201cThere is a presumption against implied preemption of State law in areas traditionally regulated by the States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 958 (citing <em>California v. ARC Am. Corp., </em>490 U.S. 93, 101, 109 S.Ct. 1661, 104 L.Ed.2d 86 (1989)). This presumption \u201cis not triggered when the State regulates in an area where there has been a history of significant federal presence.\u201d <em>United States v. Locke, </em>529 U.S. 89, 108, 120 S.Ct. 1135, 146 L.Ed.2d 69 (2000). Therefore, \u201cdetermining whether the presumption against preemption applies here turns on whether this area of law is a field which the States have traditionally occupied or, conversely, an area where there has been significant federal presence.\u201d <em>Bridgestone, </em>153 F.Supp.2d at 941.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-5\">The conflicting outcomes of <em>Bridgestone </em>and <em>Chamberlan </em>are attributable, in large part, to the contrary conclusions those courts drew on this issue. The courts reached contrary conclusions because they defined the area of law relevant to the inquiry differently. In <em>Bridgestone, </em>the court concluded that the presumption against preemption did not apply to a claim for injunctive relief in the form of a recall because \u201cstates have never assumed a significant role in <em>recalls </em>related to vehicle safety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 942 (emphasis in original). In <em>Chamberlan, </em>on the other hand, the court concluded that the relevant area of law was not that of recalls, but rather of motor vehicle safety. 314 F.Supp.2d at 958. Thus, the <em>Chamberlan </em>court found that the presumption against preemption was triggered because motor vehicle safety \u201cis an area of traditional State police power.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>City of Columbus v. Ours Garage &amp; Wrecker Serv., </em>536 U.S. 424, 439, 122 S.Ct. 2226, 153 L.Ed.2d 430 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-6\">This Court agrees with the <em>Chamberlan </em>court that the proper area of law to consider in determining whether Plaintiffs\u2019 requested relief falls within an area of law traditionally occupied by the States or one where there has been a significant federal presence is that of motor vehicle safety. A recall \u201cis a remedy rather than a substantive field of regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, recalls do not provide the relevant area of law. Rather, the regulatory field in question is more properly defined as that of motor vehicle safety. <em>See Marsikian, </em>2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 117012, at *22. Motor vehicle safety is an area of law traditionally regulated by the states. Even the <em>Bridgestone </em>court noted that \u201c[f]or certain, vehicle safety is not an area in which \u2018Congress has legislated ... from the earliest days of the Republic.\u2019 \u201d 153 F.Supp.2d at 943 (quoting <em>Locke, </em>529 U.S. at 108, 120 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1197\">*1197</page-number>S.Ct. 1135). \u201cIn fact, \u2018[i]n no field has ... deference to state regulation been greater than that of highway safety regulation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chamberlan, </em>314 F.Supp.2d at 958 (quoting <em>Raymond Motor Transp., Inc. v. Rice, </em>434 U.S. 429, 443, 98 S.Ct. 787, 54 L.Ed.2d 664 (1978)). Thus, because the Court concludes that motor vehicle safety, not recalls, is the area of law applicable to the presumption inquiry, the Court finds that the presumption against preemption applies in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-5\">In light of the presumption against preemption, the Court must determine whether an actual conflict exists between the relief sought by Plaintiffs and the Safety Act.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> \u201c[B]ecause a presumption against preemption applies in this case, Defendant bears the burden of showing that it was Congress\u2019 \u2018clear and manifest\u2019 intent to preempt State law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 962 (quoting <em>ARC Am. Corp., </em>490 U.S. at 101, 109 S.Ct. 1661).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Toyota has not met its burden of showing that it was Congress\u2019 clear and manifest intent for the Safety Act to preempt the relief Plaintiffs seek pursuant to their State law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-6\">\u201cAs a preliminary matter, in determining whether there is an actual conflict, it is not appropriate to \u2018split remedies.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kent v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., </em>200 F.Supp.2d 1208, 1217 (N.D.Cal.2002). In arguing that an actual conflict exists between the recall sought by Plaintiffs and the Safety Act, Toyota has failed to explain why the Court should treat Plaintiffs\u2019 request for a recall differently from its request for other forms of relief for the purpose of its conflict preemption analysis. The <em>Kent </em>Court explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1253-10\">ordinarily it is assumed that the full cause- of action under state law is either available or preempted. <em>[Int'l Paper v. Ouellette,] </em>479 U.S. [481,] 499 n. 19, 107 S.Ct. 805, 93 L.Ed.2d 883 [(1987)]. Remedies are split only when there is evidence of Congressional intent to treat remedies differently. The Court finds no indication in the language of the Safety Act that Congress intended that actions for injunctive relief should be treated differently from actions for damages. Indeed, if an injunction requiring a particular repair would \u2018interfere\u2019 with the federal regulatory scheme \u2014 so too would a damages award based on the failure to make such a repair. Therefore, the Court declines to treat Plaintiffs\u2019 request for injunctive relief differently from its request for damages in determining whether or not there is an actual conflict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1253-11\">200 F.Supp.2d at 1217.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Likewise, in this case, Toyotai has not explained why the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1198\">*1198</page-number>Court should treat Plaintiffs\u2019 request for \u201can injunction ordering Toyota to implement an effective fail-safe mechanism on all vehicles with ETCS\u201d differently from Plaintiffs\u2019 other requests for injunctive relief or from the other types of relief Plaintiffs seek. While NHTSA has been involved in an ongoing investigation into the SUA issues and, under the Safety Act, possesses discretion to administer-a recall where it determines that a motor vehicle contains a defect relating to safety, NHTSA\u2019s involvement and discretion do not indicate that Congress intended to split remedies for the purpose of determining whether an actual conflict exists. Toyota has not offered evidence that the language or legislative history of the Safety Act evince such an intent to split remedies. Thus, the Court sees no reason to treat Plaintiffs\u2019 request for a recall differently from its other requests for relief in determining whether an actual conflict exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-4\">Even if the Court were to consider Plaintiffs\u2019 request for a recall separately from Plaintiffs\u2019 other requests for relief for the purpose of its preemption analysis, the Court finds that Toyota has not demonstrated that an actual conflict exists. In support of its contention that Plaintiffs\u2019 requested relief is conflict-preempted, Toyota argues that \u201cthere is a very real and substantial possibility that ... the recall ... may frustrate, interfere and conflict with NHTSA\u2019s ongoing efforts to investigate and address the very same issues.\u201d (Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 53.) First, the Court notes that a \u201creal and substantial possibility\u201d of conflict is insufficient to warrant dismissal on preemption grounds. A state law is preempted only \u201cto the extent that it <em>actually conflicts </em>with federal law.\u201d <em>Pac. Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>461 U.S. at 204, 103 S.Ct. 1713 (emphasis added). Toyota counters that the \u201cconflict between NHTSA\u2019s recall power and Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed remedy is more real and present than that in the cases affirming preemption of proposed judicial recalls.\u201d (Reply at 20.) However, the Court disagrees with the reasoning underlying the preemption analysis in those cases. Second, \u201cto constitute an actual conflict, the state law at issue must conflict with the intent of Congress in a specific and concrete way.\u201d <em>Kent, </em>200 F.Supp.2d at 1217. Congress\u2019 primary intent in passing the Safety Act is articulated most clearly \u201cin the first section of the Act itself: \u2018the purpose of this chapter is to reduce traffic accidents and deaths and injuries to persons resulting from traffic accidents.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chrysler Corp. v. Tofany, </em>419 F.2d 499, 508 (2d Cir.1969). Toyota has not shown that a court-ordered recall would frustrate Congress\u2019 intent to \u201creduce traffic accidents and deaths and injuries to persons resulting from traffic accidents,\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> or that Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed remedy would actually conflict with NHTSA\u2019s ongoing investigation. Like the defendant in <em>Kent, </em>Toyota \u201c[a]t most ... has demonstrated that the relief sought by Plaintiffs <em>might </em>conflict with some future action of NHTSA as it investigates the alleged defect[s] at issue in this action.\u201d <em>Kent, </em>200 F.Supp.2d at 1217-18. Thus, Toyota has failed to show that Plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1199\">*1199</page-number>proposed remedy actually conflicts with the Safety Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-5\">As a final note, the Court is not persuaded by Toyota\u2019s contention that Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on <em>Chamberlan, Kent, </em>and <em>Marsikian </em>is misplaced. Toyota contends that these cases are inapposite because the injunctive relief sought by the plaintiffs in those cases did not necessarily amount to a nationwide recall.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> <em>(See </em>Reply at 18-19.) Specifically, Toyota argues that the <em>\u201cChamberlan </em>court explicitly held that <em>Bridgestone </em>[ ] and <em>Lilly </em>are distinguishable on their facts because the plaintiffs sought a court-initiated nationwide recall.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 19, emphasis omitted.) Although the <em>Chamberlan </em>court did state that <em>Bridgestone </em>and <em>Lilly </em>were distinguishable on their facts, this was not part of the court\u2019s holding. The <em>Chamberlan </em>court stated that \u201c[i]n addition to being distinguishable on [their] facts,\u201d <em>Bridge-stone </em>and <em>Lilly </em>were \u201cbased on reasoning this Court finds unpersuasive,\u201d as they \u201capplied too broadly the conflict preemption analysis.\u201d 314 F.Supp.2d at 965, 967. Moreover, the foregoing analysis applies with equal force to a nation-wide recall as to a state-wide recall, as the scope of a requested recall would not alter the court\u2019s analysis of the applicability of the presumption against preemption or of Toyota\u2019s failure to demonstrate an actual conflict between Plaintiffs\u2019 claims or requested relief and the Safety Act.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1255-7\">Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims and requests for relief are not preempted by the Safety Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-8\">B. <em>Primary Agency Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1255-9\">Toyota argues that even if the Court does not strike Plaintiffs\u2019 request for injunctive relief on preemption grounds, it should do so under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction. (Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 54.) Under this doctrine, \u201cCourts may find that an administrative agency has \u2018primary jurisdiction\u2019 over a judicially cognizable claim where \u2018enforcement of the claim requires the resolution of issues, which, under a regulatory scheme, have been placed within the special competence of an administrative body.\u2019 \u201d <em>Marsikian, </em>2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 117012, at *23-24 (quoting <em>United States v. W. Pac. R.R. Co., </em>352 U.S. 59, 63-64, 77 S.Ct. 161, 1 L.Ed.2d 126 (1956)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-10\">The Court declines to apply the primary jurisdiction doctrine and, therefore, will not strike Plaintiffs\u2019 request for injunctive relief or refer any issues underlying Plaintiffs\u2019 claims to NHTSA at this stage. As explained in the Court\u2019s preemption analysis, Toyota has not shown that an actual conflict exists between Plaintiffs\u2019 claims or requested relief and the NHTSA investigation. At this point, therefore, the interests of uniformity and promotion of \u201cproper relationships between the courts and ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>ministrative agencies\u201d do not require application of the primary jurisdiction doctrine. <em>Nader v. Allegheny Airlines, Inc., </em>426 U.S. 290, 303-04, 96 S.Ct. 1978, 48 L.Ed.2d 643 (1976). Furthermore, the claims that Plaintiffs assert in this case do not arise under the Safety Act or NHTSA regulations; rather, they are based on California statutes, the MMA, and general contract and tort principles.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 claims therefore are \u201cwithin the conventional competence of the courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 305, 96 S.Ct. 1978. Thus, \u201cthe Court does not find that exercise of the doctrine of primary jurisdiction is necessary at this stage of the case, either to ensure uniformity of regulation or because NHTSA is better-equipped than the Court to address the issues raised by Plaintiffs\u2019 claims.\u201d <em>Kent, </em>200 F.Supp.2d at 1218.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-4\">Because the Court finds neither preemption nor primary agency jurisdiction, the Court denies the motion to strike the prayer for relief that seeks an injunction requiring the implementation of an effective fail-safe mechanism on all vehicles with ETCS. <em>(See </em>MCC at 153, \u00b6 i.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-5\">\n<em>XIII.Availability of Restitution and/or Restitutionary Disgorgement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-6\">Toyota argues that the Court should strike the Plaintiffs\u2019 request for \u201cmoney Toyota acquired by unfair competition, including restitution and/or restitutionary disgorgement.\u201d (\u00b6\u00b6 329, 338; MCC at 152 (Prayer for Relief \u00b6 b).) Toyota concedes that restitution is an available remedy under the UCL and FAL. (Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 55.) Likewise, Toyota concedes that disgorgement is an available remedy under the UCL and FAL to the extent it constitutes restitution. <em>(Id. </em>at 56.) Nonetheless, Toyota argues that the Court should strike the Plaintiffs\u2019 request for restitutionary disgorgement because it is \u201cduplicative, ... immaterial, impertinent, and unduly prejudicial.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1256-9\">\u201cGiven the[] disfavored status [of motions to strike], courts often require a showing of prejudice by the moving party before granting the requested relief.\u201d <em>Mag Instrument, Inc. v. JS Prod., Inc., </em>595 F.Supp.2d 1102, 1106 (C.D.Cal.2008) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Although Toyota has made a conclusory statement that the request for restitutionary disgorgement is unduly prejudicial, Toyota has failed to make any showing or offer any argument in support of its contention that the requested relief prejudices Toyota. <em>(See </em>Mot. Brief at 56.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-10\">Accordingly, the Court denies the motion to strike Plaintiffs\u2019 request for \u201crestitutionary disgorgement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-11\">XIV. <em>Remainder of Motion to Strike</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1256-12\">To the extent that the Court\u2019s substantive rulings have not otherwise disposed of the particulars raised by the Motion to Strike, the Motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-13\">XV. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1256-14\">As set forth herein, the Court grants in part and denies in part the Motion to Dismiss and Motion to Strike (Docket Nos. 328, 329). Specifically, the Court makes the following rulings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number>(1) The Court dismisses without prejudice all the claims of those Plaintiffs who failed to allege facts establishing standing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1257-5\">(2) As to the fourth cause of action for breach of express warranty based on the written warranty, the Court grants the Motion to Dismiss and dismisses with prejudice this claim to the extent it is based upon design defects rather than defects in materials and workmanship. To the extent the claim is based on defects in materials and workmanship, the Court denies the Motion to Dismiss as to any plaintiff whose vehicle was taken during its warranty period for repair pursuant to the recalls, and any plaintiff who has alleged he or she sought repair during the vehicle\u2019s warranty period for SUA-related issues, and was informed either that the vehicle had been repaired or that nothing was wrong with the vehicle. However, based on the additional notice requirement for direct purchasers, and still to the extent that they are based on defects in materials and workmanship rather than on design defects, the claims of plaintiffs who fall into these categories (but who have also alleged that they purchased their vehicles directly from Defendants) are dismissed without prejudice. Finally, the claim of any plaintiff whose warranty period has expired and who failed to repair or respond to one or more of the recalls during the warranty period is dismissed with prejudice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1257-6\">(3) As to the fourth cause of action for breach of express warranty based on Toyota\u2019s advertising, the Motion to Dismiss is granted and the claims of all plaintiffs are dismissed without prejudice for failure to allege exposure to statements made by Toyota.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1257-7\">(4) As to the sixth cause of action for revocation, the Motion to Dismiss is denied as to the Plaintiffs who have alleged they purchased their vehicles directly from Toyota. The Motion to Dismiss is granted as to the claims asserted by all other Plaintiffs, which are dismissed without prejudice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1257-8\">(5) The Motion to Dismiss is granted in part as to the sixth cause of action. To the extent Plaintiffs have stated express and implied warranty claims, they have also stated claims under the MMA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1257-9\">(6) The Motion to Dismiss is granted as to the tenth cause of action for unjust enrichment, which is dismissed with prejudice as to all Plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1257-10\">To the extent the Motion to Dismiss is not expressly granted, it is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-11\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1211-26\">.

The Court notes that, in some instances, Plaintiffs have referred to specific documents in support of their factual allegations. These documents are not appended to the MCC and have not been filed with the Court. As a result, these documents have not been examined by the Court, and the Court expresses no opinion regarding whether they support the allegations made in the MCC.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1212-15\">.

As is evident in the subsequent subheadings, (see Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 10, 13), Toyota does not develop this alternative argument in its Motion \u2014 or, at a minimum, clearly differentiate it from its \"injury in fact\u201d arguments. Therefore, the Court does not address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1217-7\">. The Court recognizes that the injury-in-fact requirement can sometimes be satisfied by a credible threat of future harm. <em>See, e.g., Pisciotta v. Old Nat'l Bancorp, </em>499 F.3d 629, 634 (7th Cir.2007) (holding that \"the injury-in-fact requirement can be satisfied by a threat of future harm or by an act which harms the plaintiff only by increasing the risk of future harm that the plaintiff would have otherwise faced, absent the defendant's actions.\"); <em>Baur v. Veneman, </em>352 F.3d 625, 633 (2d Cir.2003) (stating that \"courts of appeals have generally recognized that threatened harm in the form of an increased risk of future injury may serve as injury-in-fact for Article III standing purposes.\u201d); <em>Cent.

Thus, it is at least conceivable that a credible threat of a manifested SUA defect might be sufficient, in and of itself, to confer standing \u2014 which would be consistent with Plaintiffs\u2019 \"ticking time bomb\u201d argument. (See Pltfs.\u2019 Opp'n at 9.) However, Plaintiffs do not pursue standing on this basis, and therefore the Court does not entertain the possibility further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1218-7\">. Plaintiffs also allege that the commercial Plaintiffs \u201coverpaid for the vehicles\u201d and \u201csuffered lost profits and other economic losses due to [their] inability to sell the Toyota vehicles.\u201d (\u00b6\u00b6 71-74.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1218-8\">.

Because the Court has concluded that at least some Plaintiffs have standing, the Court, throughout this Order, discusses whether those Plaintiffs have asserted claims upon which relief can be granted. <em>Cf.

Toyota also contends that Plaintiffs do not plead actual reliance to satisfy the standing requirements. (Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 17-19.) Because the Court grants in part Toyota's Motion on other grounds, the Court does not reach this issue. The Court notes that the AMCC makes significant changes to the named Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations with respect to actual reliance, which may moot Toyota's concerns. For these same reasons, the Court does not reach Toyota's argument that Plaintiffs lack standing under the CLRA because Plaintiffs cannot show actual causation and reliance. (Defs.' Mem. at 19-20.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1226-8\">. Plaintiffs argue merely in passing that their claims do not sound in fraud. They argue they have not alleged a fraudulent course of conduct because Toyota \"negligently designed, manufactured, sold and/or marketed the Defective Vehicles\u201d and \"Toyota should have monitored NHTSA\u2019s consumer safety database for indications of changing patterns in the complaints by model with ETCS.\u201d (Pltfs.\u2019 Opp'n Brief at 25, citing to \u00b6\u00b6 123, 245.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-9\">The Court acknowledges that fraud is not a necessary element of a UCL or a CLRA claim. <em>Vess v.

July 16, 2009) (finding that \"plaintiffs are not required to plead 'reliance' and 'materiality' with particularity because those elements are distinct from the common law fraud element of 'justifiable reliance.\u2019 \"). However, when a plaintiff alleges fraudulent conduct and relies on that conduct as the basis of a claim, the claim is \"grounded in fraud.\u201d <em>Vess, </em>317 F.3d at 1103-04. Plaintiffs allege that Toyota represented that its cars were safe when in fact they allegedly contain a defect known to Toyota that causes SUA. Therefore, fraud is an essential element of the claims at issue here, and Plaintiffs must plead under Rule 9(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1228-6\">. The Court notes that none of the Plaintiffs appear to allege that they relied on specific advertising by Toyota in purchasing or leasing their cars. Instead, Plaintiffs allege generally that \u201cin purchasing or leasing their vehicles, the Plaintiffs relied on the misrepresentations and/or omissions of Toyota with respect of the safety and reliability of the vehicles.\u201d (\u00b6 327.) In its brief, Toyota focuses on the lack of an alleged defect, and does not appear to argue that a 9(b) issue exists as to whether Plaintiffs relied on Toyota's representations. Allegations of representations from product labels and statements that, had consumers not been deceived by the labels, they would not have purchased the product, are sufficient to plead under Rule 9(b). <em>Von Koenig, </em>713 F.Supp.2d at 1077-78.

In that case, the court analyzed statements in the context of a fraudulent misrepresentation claim, and granted the motion to dismiss the FAL claim because no opposition was filed. <em>Cirulli, supra, </em>at *3, *5.

Although the Supreme Court did not dismiss the plaintiffs' claim for unjust enrichment, the issue presented to the court was purely jurisdictional: the viability of the plaintiffs' unjust enrichment claim was not at issue.

Rather, the proper inquiry is whether a conflict exists between a State law or a claim asserted thereunder and the Safety Act. Nonetheless, because Toyota's motion on this issue focuses on the request for injunctive relief contained in paragraph (i) of the Prayer for Relief of the MCC and because that request is grounded in other claims asserted in the MCC, the Court's analysis likewise addresses why the request for relief does not actually conflict with the Safety Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b1253-8\">. \"Were there no presumption against preemption in this case, Defendant would still need to demonstrate \u2018clear evidence of conflict\u2019 to support its theory that State law is preempted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Geier, </em>529 U.S. at 885, 120 S.Ct. 1913.) Even under such a standard, Toyota's failure to demonstrate an actual conflict between Plaintiffs\u2019 requested relief and the Safety Act would be fatal to its preemption argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b1253-13\">.In <em>Kent, </em>the Plaintiffs had requested \"that the Court create a fund available to remedy the park-to-reverse defect and to order Defendant to bear the cost of notice to Class Members.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1217, n. 3 (internal quotations omitted). Plaintiffs in that case did not seek a court-ordered recall. However, this distinction between <em>Kent </em>and the instant case does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1198\">*1198</page-number>not detract from the soundness of the <em>Kent </em>court\u2019s reasoning that Congress did not manifest an intent to split remedies when determining if conflict preemption applies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b1254-6\">. While Congress also intended to promote uniformity, uniformity is merely a secondary objective of the Safety Act. <em>See Tofany, </em>419 F.2d at 511; <em>Buzzard v. Roadrunner Trucking, Inc., </em>966 F.2d 777, 783-84 (3d Cir.1992); <em>Chamberlan, </em>314 F.Supp.2d at 962-63. Thus, even if Toyota were to argue that Plaintiffs\u2019 requested relief would undermine the uniformity Congress sought to promote in passing the Safety Act, \"some negative effect on uniformity\u201d is not sufficient to trigger preemption of State law under the Safety Act. <em>Buzzard, </em>966 F.2d at 783-84.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b1255-6\">. Toyota also points out that Plaintiffs have not cited \"a single case granting a nationwide court-ordered vehicle recall.\u201d (Reply at 20, emphasis omitted.) At this stage, however, the Court is presented with the question of whether the request for relief must be eliminated from Plaintiffs\u2019 MCC, not whether, in the event that Plaintiffs succeed on their claims, a nationwide court-ordered recall is an appropriate remedy. Thus, Toyota's argument that no court has ultimately ordered a nationwide vehicle recall does not persuade the Court that the reasoning in <em>Chamberlan, Kent, </em>and <em>Marsikian </em>is any less persuasive in determining whether conflict preemption requires the Court to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 claims or strike Plaintiffs\u2019 requested remedy at the pleading stage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b1255-12\">. If Toyota's distinction between state-wide and nation-wide recalls was correct, it would be difficult to see how a recall in California\u2014 where more than ten percent of the nation resides and likely more than ten percent of the nation's vehicles are maintained \u2014 would not also be disruptive of the Safety Act. <em>See Chamberlan, </em>314 F.Supp.2d at 964-65.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b1256-7\">. The Court notes that the classic primary jurisdiction situation is one in which the plaintiffs' claims are predicated on imposing civil liability under a regulatory statute. <em>See, e.g., W. Pac. R.R., </em>352 U.S. at 62-70, 77 S.Ct. 161 (giving \"first pass on the construction of the tariff in dispute\u201d and \"the reasonableness of the tariff as applied\u201d to the Interstate Commerce Commission). In such situations, the expertise of the regulatory body is particularly helpful in determining whether the regulatory statute itself provides proper grounds for a claim for civil liability. In this case, on the other hand, Plaintiffs' claims are not predicated on the Safety Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
