ZILLY, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1298-7\">THIS MATTER comes before the Court on defendants\u2019 joint motion, docket no. 125, and defendant Alexander &amp; Baldwin, Inc.\u2019s separate motion, docket no. 124, to dismiss the Second Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint, docket no. 119 (the \u201cAmended Complaint\u201d), pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). Having reviewed all papers filed in support of and in opposition to the motion,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Court now enters the following Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-11\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-12\">Plaintiffs initially made the assertions of anticompetitive activities now at issue in separate cases filed in different districts. A number of these cases were transferred to this Court by the Multidistrict Litigation (\u201cMDL\u201d) Panel, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407, and were consolidated for pretrial purposes with cases originally filed in this district. Pursuant to the agreement of the parties, plaintiffs were permitted to file a Consolidated Class Action Complaint (\u201cConsolidated Complaint\u201d). In August 2009, the Court granted defendants\u2019 joint motion to dismiss the Consolidated Complaint. Order No. 5 (docket no. 105). The dismissal was without prejudice and was based on two alternative grounds: (i) failure to adequately plead an antitrust claim under the standards set forth in <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007), and its progeny; and (ii) failure to allege an antitrust claim that is not barred by the filed rate doctrine, as articulated in <em>Keogh v. Chicago &amp; N.W. Ry. Co., </em>260 U.S. 156, 43 S.Ct. 47, 67 L.Ed. 183 (1922), and subsequent cases.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although the filed rate doctrine would pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1243\">*1243</page-number>elude plaintiffs\u2019 antitrust claim even if sufficiently pleaded under <em>Twombly, </em>plaintiffs were given leave to amend in light of their contention that certain types of cargo, namely \u201cbulk cargo\u201d and \u201cforest products,\u201d are statutorily excluded from tariff-filing requirements. <em>See </em>Order No. 5 at 22. After three extensions of time, spanning almost nine months, <em>see </em>Minute Order No. 8 (docket no. 118), plaintiffs filed the Amended Complaint now at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-4\">The Amended Complaint incorporates most of the allegations set forth in the earlier Consolidated Complaint. Like the Consolidated Complaint, the Amended Complaint identifies various plaintiffs as purchasers of shipping services between the continental United States and Hawah, Guam, or both,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and alleges that defendants,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> providers of such shipping services, violated the Sherman Act,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> by colluding to simultaneously increase fuel surcharges, by sharing vessel capacity, and by conspiring not to enter into extra-tariff rate agreements with customers. Amended Complaint at \u00b6 5. In addition, the Amended Complaint asserts that defendants violated the Sherman Act by \u201callocating customers.\u201d <em>Id., see also id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 80-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-11\">In the Amended Complaint, as in the earlier Consolidated Complaint, plaintiffs have artfully avoided directly alleging that the noncontiguous domestic trade is regulated in a manner rendering the filed rate doctrine applicable. <em>See </em>Order No. 5 at 20; <em>compare </em>Amended Complaint at \u00b6 100 (indicating that defendants are \u201cpermitted\u201d to file tariffs, citing 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 18101, which sets forth the transportation policies of the United States, but which contains no provision concerning the filing of tariffs). The Amended Complaint, however, refers indirectly in three ways to the statutory requirement that defendants file their rates with the Surface Transportation Board (\u201cSTB\u201d). First, the Amended Complaint pleads that six of the original 25 plaintiffs<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> shipped \u201cbulk cargo\u201d or \u201cfor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number>est products,\u201d which are exempt from tariff requirements. <em>See </em>Amended Complaint at \u00b6\u00b6 13, 15, 17, 18, 20, <em>&amp; </em>23; <em>see also </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13702(a)(1).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Second, the Amended Complaint alleges that defendant Matson Navigation Company, Inc. (\u201cMatson\u201d) has filed at least one tariff that does not comport with the applicable regulations, pursuant to which at least one plaintiff shipped products during the class period. Amended Complaint at \u00b6\u00b6 101\u2014 104. Third, the Amended Complaint asserts that defendants have colluded not to use extra-tariff written agreements with their customers, as permitted by 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14101(b).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Amended Complaint at \u00b6\u00b6 82-84. Thus, the Amended Complaint squarely places the filed rate doctrine at issue, and the Court will first address whether plaintiffs\u2019 antitrust claims, even if adequately pleaded, are precluded under <em>Keogh </em>and its progeny. Because the Court concludes that the filed rate doctrine forecloses plaintiffs\u2019 antitrust claims, the Court declines to further evaluate whether plaintiffs have satisfied the pleading standards of <em>Twombly.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1300-8\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-9\">A complaint can be lacking for one of two reasons: (i) absence of a cognizable legal theory, or (ii) insufficient facts under a cognizable legal claim. <em>Robertson v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>749 F.2d 530, 534 (9th Cir.1984). In moving under Rule 12(b)(6), defendants present both potential grounds for dismissal, but the Court addresses only the first contention.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In rul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>ing on defendants\u2019 motion, the Court must assume the truth of the allegations in the Amended Complaint and draw all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs\u2019 favor. <em>See, e.g., Usher v. City of Los Angeles, </em>828 F.2d 556, 561 (9th Cir.1987). The question for the Court is whether the \u201cnon-conclusory \u2018factual content,\u2019 and reasonable inferences from that content\u201d are \u201cplausibly suggestive of a claim entitling the plaintiff[s] to relief.\u201d <em>Moss v. U.S. Secret Serv., </em>572 F.3d 962, 969 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-4\">In their opposition to defendants\u2019 joint motion to dismiss, plaintiffs present five reasons for why the filed rate doctrine should not be applied in this case: (i) the STB does not engage in meaningful review of filed tariffs; (ii) rates falling within the \u201czone of reasonableness\u201d are not subject to review by the STB; (iii) antitrust remedies are available under the \u201csavings clause\u201d of the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995; (iv) at least one of Matson\u2019s filed tariffs is defective; and (v) certain cargo is exempt from tariff-filing requirements. These arguments essentially revisit, with some modifications and based on additional factual allegations, the contentions plaintiffs made before Order No. 5 was issued, and the Court finds them equally unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-5\">A. <em>Meaningful Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1301-6\">Plaintiffs repeat their earlier assertion that the STB does not engage in the level of tariff review that warrants application of the filed rate doctrine, citing the same cases previously distinguished by the Court. <em>See </em>Response at 13-14 (docket no. 128 at 19-20) (citing <em>Brown v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., </em>982 F.2d 386 (9th Cir.1992), and <em>Wileman Bros. &amp; Elliott Inc. v. Giannini, </em>909 F.2d 332 (9th Cir.1990)); <em>see also </em>Order No. 5 at 26 n.ll. For the reasons stated in Order No. 5, plaintiffs\u2019 argument lacks merit, and the Court reiterates its previous ruling that the filed rate doctrine controls. Moreover, since the issuance of Order No. 5 in August 2009, several cases have examined the contours of the filed rate doctrine, and they strongly support the Court\u2019s prior decision. <em>See In re Title Ins. Antitrust Cases, </em>702 F.Supp.2d 840, 852-55 (N.D.Ohio 2010); <em>Carlin v. Dairy Am., Inc., </em>690 F.Supp.2d 1128, 1136-37 (E.D.Cal.2010) (citing <em>In re Pa. Title Ins. Antitrust Litig., </em>648 F.Supp.2d 663, 674-75 (E.D.Pa.2009) (\u201cas long as the regulatory scheme requires the filing of rates with a government agency that has legal authority to review those rates, the filed rate doctrine applies regardless of the actual degree of agency review of those filed rates\u201d)); <em>In re N.J. Title Ins. Litig., </em>2009 WL 3233529 at *2 (D.N.J.) (\u201capplication of the filed rate doctrine does not depend upon meaningful agency review of filed rates\u201d (citing <em>Square D, </em>476 U.S. at 417 n. 19, 106 S.Ct. 1922)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-8\">Indeed, in <em>In re Title Ins., </em>after distinguishing both <em>Brown </em>and <em>Wileman, </em>the court criticized <em>Brown </em>as offering \u201cno meaningful discussion\u201d of the regulatory schemes at issue and being \u201cnearly devoid of analysis,\u201d and it characterized <em>Brown </em>as \u201can outlier case.\u201d 702 F.Supp.2d at 853-55; <em>see also </em>Order No. 5 at 26 n. 11 (citing <em>McCray v. Fidelity Nat\u2019l Title Ins. Co., </em>636 F.Supp.2d 322, 329 (D.Del.2009) (\u201cOther than the Ninth Circuit in <em>Broum, </em>no other court has taken such a narrow view of the applicability of the filed rate doctrine.\u201d)). The <em>In re Title Ins. </em>court went on to hold that a rate need not \u201cundergo a certain \u2018meaningful\u2019 level of scrutiny to fall within the gambit of the filed rate doctrine.\u201d 702 F.Supp.2d at 855. In reaching this decision, the court in <em>In re Title Ins. </em>observed that the filed rate doctrine is premised on two companion principles: \u201cfirst, that legislative bodies design agencies for the specific purpose of setting uniform rates, and second, that courts are not institutionally well suited to engage in retroactive rate setting.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 849 (quot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>ing <em>Wegoland Ltd. v. NYNEX Corp., </em>27 F.3d 17, 19 (2d Cir.1994)). It further concluded that, for the same reasons courts should avoid ascertaining whether rates are reasonable, courts are ill-equipped to make <em>\u201cex post </em>inquiries as to whether or not an agency\u2019s review of a particular rate was \u2018meaningful.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 855.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-4\">Similarly, in <em>Carlin, </em>the court held that the plaintiffs\u2019 various state law claims<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> were precluded by the filed rate doctrine. The <em>Carlin </em>court distinguished earlier cases in which the filed rate doctrine was deemed inapplicable, identifying as the \u201ccommon theme\u201d of those cases \u201cthe existence of some feature of the regulatory system itself that prevented] review of those rates.\u201d 690 F.Supp.2d at 1136. As an example, the <em>Carlin </em>court cited <em>Brown, </em>in which the regulatory regime did not provide for \u201caffirmative governmental approval.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>982 F.2d at 393. In contrast, in <em>Carlin, </em>pursuant to the broad powers granted under the legislative scheme, the United States Department of Agriculture (\u201cUSDA\u201d) issued Federal Milk Marketing Orders (\u201cFMMOs\u201d) that con-tamed mathematical methods for determining minimum prices for milk and milk products. 690 F.Supp.2d at 1130-31. After discovering the misreporting of certain wholesale prices,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the USDA disapproved of the minimum prices computed pursuant to FMMOs between April 2006 and April 2007, and issued corrected prices for this period that were about two cents per pound higher.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1138-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-9\">In concluding that the filed rate doctrine applied even though the USDA did not engage in antecedent review of minimum prices or the information on which they were based, the <em>Carlin </em>court was guided by the \u201canimating purposes\u201d of the filed rate doctrine, namely (i) to avoid discrimination in rates between ratepayers (nondiscrimination), and (ii) to preserve the exclusive role of agencies in approving rates (nonjusticiability). <em>Id. </em>at 1135 (quoting <em>Blaylock v. First Am. Title Ins. Co., </em>504 F.Supp.2d 1091, 1102 (W.D.Wash.2007)).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The <em>Carlin </em>court observed that the nondiscrimination and nonjusticiability concerns underlying the filed rate doctrine were consistent with the legislative goals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1247\">*1247</page-number>of achieving parity pay for dairy farmers, as well as reasonable prices for consumers, and with Congress\u2019s authority to allocate jurisdiction over commodity pricing away from the courts and with a federal agency. <em>Id. </em>at 1135.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-4\">In addition, the <em>Carlin </em>court rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that \u201cmeaningful review\u201d of rates did not occur because the USDA lacked authority to audit the data submitted by the defendants. <em>Id. </em>at 1137. The plaintiffs made no allegation that any of the defendants pricing inputs were outside the USDA\u2019s jurisdiction, <em>id. </em>at 1138 (distinguishing <em>Gallo, </em>503 F.3d at 1045-48 (discussed in Order No. 5 at 17-20)), and they offered no support for the proposition that an agency cannot conduct \u201cmeaningful review\u201d unless it has the authority to audit, <em>id. </em>at 1137. Finally, as the <em>Carlin </em>court recognized, the plaintiffs\u2019 monetary damages could be ascertained only by adjusting the rates indirectly set by the USDA via the governing FMMOs, which was \u201cprecisely what the filed rate doctrine forbids.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1136; <em>accord In re Title Ins., </em>702 F.Supp.2d at 851 (\u201cThe only way to quantify [the plaintiffs\u2019] harm would require this Court ... to make a determination of \u2018what the rate would have been.\u2019 This quantification is the very relief the filed rate doctrine <em>expressly forbids.\u201d </em>(emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-5\">Both <em>In re Title Ins. </em>and <em>Carlin </em>are consistent with the Court\u2019s earlier analysis of the filed rate doctrine. Although plaintiffs, in their Amended Complaint, allege that the STB does not actually review or approve cabotage rates, <em>see </em>Amended Complaint at \u00b6\u00b6 107, 108, &amp; 110, plaintiffs still do not, nor can they, assert that the STB lacks authority to review the fuel surcharges at issue. <em>See </em>Order No. 5 at n. 11; <em>see also </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 13701(c) &amp; 13702(b)(6). In addition, plaintiffs cite no authority that calls into question the Court\u2019s previous rejection of their \u201cno meaningful review\u201d theory or the reasoning of <em>In re Pa. Title Ins., </em>on which the Court relied, and plaintiffs fail to even discuss, let alone distinguish, <em>In re Title Ins. </em>or <em>Carlin. </em>The Court HOLDS that the STB\u2019s jurisdiction over noncontiguous domestic trade rates is itself sufficient to trigger the filed rate doctrine, even assuming that the STB does not engage in antecedent review or post-filing approval of tariffs, and that both the reasonableness of rates and the meaningfulness of rate review are beyond this Court\u2019s purview.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1303-8\">B. <em>Zone of Reasonableness</em></p>\n<p id=\"AzKl\">Plaintiffs present their \u201clack of meaningful review\u201d contention in yet another way. They assert that the filed rate doctrine should be disregarded because the STB has \u201cno legal authority\u201d to review the reasonableness of rates falling within a certain range of values, which are measured against the rates in effect during the previous year. This range is statutorily defined and is denominated as the \u201czone of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1248\">*1248</page-number>reasonableness.\u201d <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13701(d).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 argument proves too much. The Court is in no better position than the STB to countermand the methodology Congress has prescribed for assessing whether rate increases or decreases are reasonable. Plaintiffs cannot obtain via an antitrust claim a remedy that is allegedly precluded by statute, namely an adjustment to rates that are within the zone of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 position, however, is also inconsistent with a fair reading of the statutory language. In a provision separate from the one defining the zone of reasonableness, Congress has dictated that the STB <em>\u201cshall </em>prescribe the rate ... to be applied\u201d whenever \u201cnecessary to stop or prevent a violation of subsection (a),\u201d which requires that noncontiguous domestic water trade rates be reasonable. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13701(b) (emphasis added). To interpret the zone of reasonableness definition in the manner that plaintiffs suggest, <em>ie., </em>as precluding the STB from evaluating the reasonableness of the prior rate against which the proposed rate is being measured, would render \u00a7 13701(b) superfluous. <em>Cf. Greenwood v. CompuCredit Corp., </em>615 F.3d 1204, 1209 (9th Cir.2010) (courts \u201cmust, if possible, interpret a statute such that all its language is given effect, and none of it is rendered superfluous\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-5\">Plaintiffs offer no support for them proposition that Congress intended to <em>\u201cdeprive </em>\u201d the STB of the authority to set rates, <em>see </em>Response at 17 (docket no. 128 at 23) (emphasis in original), and they fail to explain how such nugatory purpose could be derived from the tenor of \u00a7 13701(b), which both grants power to the STB and compels its exercise. Instead, the section defining the zone of reasonableness must be construed as guiding the STB\u2019s analysis of proposed rates, but not as hindering in any way its ability to evaluate whether the prior rates against which prospective rates are measured were themselves reasonable. <em>See Guam v. Sear-Land Serv., Inc., </em>2007 WL 295310 at *10 (STB) (The zone of reasonableness or ZOR \u201cprovides a safe harbor for rate changes. Under the ZOR, a rate increase is deemed reasonable if the amount by which it exceeds the prior year\u2019s rate is within the ZOR. But the language and legislative history of the ZOR indicate that the provision was intended to apply only to \u2018base rates\u2019 that themselves are at reasonable levels. Thus, a party may challenge the base rate to which the ZOR is applied.\u201d), <em>reconsideration denied, </em>2007 WL 2457445 (STB). Given this interpretation of the statute, the zone of reasonableness provision offers no basis for ignoring the filed rate doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-8\">C. <em>Savings Clause</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1304-9\">In addition to repeating their \u201cmeaningful review\u201d theory (in two different ways), plaintiffs have recast their previously rejected contention that, in passing the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995, Pub.L. No. 104-88, 109 Stat. 803 (1995) (the \u201cICCTA\u201d), Congress nullified the filed rate doctrine. <em>See </em>Order No. 5 at 23-24. Plaintiffs now as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1249\">*1249</page-number>sert that the \u201csavings clause\u201d of the ICC-TA, which states that \u201cthe remedies provided under this part are in addition to remedies existing under another law or common law,\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13103, renders the filed rate doctrine obsolete. Plaintiffs\u2019 argument is flatly contradicted by the history of \u00a7 13103.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-4\">When the ICCTA was enacted in 1995, the \u201csavings clause\u201d was not some new provision from which a legislative intent to unravel the filed rate doctrine might be inferred. Instead, the \u201csavings clause\u201d predated the ICCTA by over one hundred years, having been incorporated into the Interstate Commerce Act (\u201cICA\u201d) by an amendment passed in 1889. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10103 (1994) (repealed 1995) (\u201cthe remedies provided under this subtitle are in addition to remedies existing under another law or at common law\u201d); S.Rep. No. 104-176 at 41, <em>as reprinted in </em>1995 WL 701522 (\u201cNew 49 U.S.C. 13103 ... would import the existing provisions of 49 U.S.C. 10103, so as to preserve the current relationship between those remedies provided for in the ICA and other remedies that may be available.\u201d); <em>see also </em>Act of Mar. 2, 1889, ch. 382, 25 Stat. 855, 862 (1889) (initially codified as 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 22, and subsequently amended and recodified as 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10103) (\u201cnothing in this act contained shall in any way abridge or alter the remedies now existing at common law or by statute, but the provisions of this act are in addition to such remedies\u201d). The \u201csavings clause\u201d existed when the Supreme Court decided both <em>Keogh </em>and <em>Square D, </em>and it therefore constitutes no ground for asserting that Congress, in crafting the ICCTA, meant to override these Supreme Court precedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on <em>Fulfillment Servs. Inc. v. United Parcel Sen., Inc., </em>528 F.3d 614 (9th Cir.2008), is similarly misleading. in <em>Fulfillment Servs., </em>the plaintiff alleged that the defendant, United Parcel Service (\u201cUPS\u201d), a motor carrier engaged in the interstate transportation of goods, violated a provision of the Motor Carrier Act, namely 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13703(f), which required it to participate in any \u201cpublication\u201d governing its rates or classifications. 528 F.3d at 617. In 1988, while UPS was still participating in the National Motor Freight Classification (\u201cNMFC\u201d), the type of publication referenced in \u00a7 13703(f), UPS introduced its \u201cHundredweight Service,\u201d pursuant to which shippers would receive lower rates if they sent multiple packages to the same location on the same day. <em>Id. </em>at 617. Under the NMFC, commodities are classified within a range of 50 to 500, according primarily to density, with the most dense items having the lowest numbers. For example, books might qualify as Class 50, while ping pong balls would be assigned to Class 500. UPS restricted its Hundredweight Service to goods falling within Classes 50 to 125. In October 2000, UPS ceased participating in the NMFC, but continued to refer to the NMFC in its Hundredweight Service tariffs until mid-2004. <em>Id. </em>For this reason, the plaintiff challenged the validity of UPS\u2019s tariffs and sought either disgorgement or a penalty similar to what the Interstate Commerce Commission could have imposed prior to the ICCTA.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 619, 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-8\">In <em>Fulfillment Servs., </em>the Ninth Circuit reiterated its previous rulings that the Motor Carrier Act authorizes private actions for violations of its provisions and attendant regulations. <em>Id. </em>at 620 (citing 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14704(a)(2) (\u201cA carrier ... is liable for damages sustained by a person as a result of an act or omission of that carrier ... in violation of this part.\u201d)). To state a claim under the Motor Carrier Act, however, a plaintiff is required to allege dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1250\">*1250</page-number>ages, which the plaintiff in <em>Fulfillment Servs. </em>failed to do, as disgorgement and penalties do not qualify as damages. <em>Id. </em>at 621-22. In an attempt to salvage its claim under \u00a7 14704(a)(2), the plaintiff pointed to the \u201csavings clause\u201d codified in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13103. The Ninth Circuit rejected the plaintiffs argument, observing that \u201cthe plain language of \u00a7 14704(a)(2) requires a plaintiff [to] allege damages, regardless of whether other remedies may also be available under \u00a7 13103.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 621. The Ninth Circuit further noted that \u00a7 13103 does not authorize equitable remedies (like disgorgement), and it explained that the \u201csavings clause\u201d did nothing more than preserve preexisting causes of action and remedies to the extent that they \u201cdo not conflict with the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 suggestion that the Ninth Circuit \u201cviews the savings clause ... as having considerable efficacy,\u201d Response at 22 (docket no. 128 at 28), simply ignores the very decision plaintiffs have cited. In <em>Fulfillment Servs., </em>the Ninth Circuit explicitly limited the \u201csavings clause,\u201d refusing to interpret it as creating any remedies or as expanding the remedies specified by statute. 528 F.3d at 622. Moreover, even if <em>Fulfillment Servs., </em>which did not involve either an antitrust claim or the filed rate doctrine, could be interpreted in the manner plaintiffs propose, <em>i.e., </em>as allowing antitrust remedies that are not inconsistent with the statutory scheme, the opinion would be of no avail to plaintiffs because the monetary damages they seek are in direct conflict with the legislative grant to the STB of jurisdiction over cabotage rates. Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201csavings clause\u201d argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-5\">D. <em>Defective Tariff</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1306-6\">In its previous Order, the Court rejected plaintiffs\u2019 suggestion that, before the filed rate doctrine can be employed, defendants must prove that they properly filed their rates. Order No. 5 at 21-22. The Court instead viewed plaintiffs as having the burden to at least allege that defendants did not maintain valid tariffs. Plaintiffs, however, did not plead such facts in their Consolidated Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-8\">In the Amended Complaint, plaintiffs identify only one tariff that is allegedly defective, namely Matson\u2019s Tariff No. 14-F (aka STB MATS 034), Rule 100 of which lists the NMFC as a \u201cgoverning publication\u201d even though Matson does not participate in the NMFC. Amended Complaint at \u00b6\u00b6 101 &amp; 102; <em>see Fulfillment Servs., </em>528 F.3d at 617 (describing the NMFC). In asserting that this deficiency in Tariff No. 14-F renders the filed rate doctrine inapplicable, plaintiffs cite no authority for the proposition that an imperfection in one tariff filed by one defendant can be imputed to other tariffs or other defendants. In addition, plaintiffs offer no support for the contention that this Court, as opposed to the STB, is the appropriate forum for determining the rate that should have been charged in the absence of the alleged defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-9\">Instead, plaintiffs again overstate the holding of <em>Sec. Servs., Inc. v. K Mart Corp., </em>511 U.S. 431, 114 S.Ct. 1702, 128 L.Ed.2d 433 (1994). <em>See </em>Order No. 5 at 21-22. As noted in Order No. 5, the <em>K Mart </em>case did not involve a carrier\u2019s reliance on an improperly filed rate to assert the <em>Keogh </em>doctrine as a shield or defense to an antitrust claim. <em>See id. </em>at 21. Rather, in <em>K Mart, </em>the plaintiff motor carrier attempted to invoke the filed rate doctrine as a sword. The plaintiff had, for approximately three years, transported goods for Kmart Corporation (\u201cKmart\u201d), pursuant to a contract executed in 1986. In 1989, the motor carrier filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition. 511 U.S. at 434, 114 S.Ct. 1702. As debtor-in-possession, the plaintiff billed Kmart for undercharges calculated as the difference between the contract rate and a higher tariff rate that was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1251\">*1251</page-number>allegedly on file with the Interstate Commerce Commission. Kmart refused to pay and the plaintiff instituted suit. The <em>K Mart </em>Court held that the motor carrier\u2019s filed tariff was void and that, as a result, the plaintiff could not collect the undercharges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-4\">As the Supreme Court noted in <em>K Mart, </em>this type of dispute is common. After Congress passed the Motor Carrier Act in 1980, many carriers responded to competitive pressures by ignoring their filed rates and negotiating lower prices with shippers. <em>Id. </em>at 437-38, 114 S.Ct. 1702. As some of these carriers went bankrupt, the trustees or debtors-in-possession attempted to recover for the previous undercharges. In response, the Interstate Commerce Commission adopted a policy that deemed unreasonable the practice of negotiating a rate, failing to publish it, billing it (sometimes repeatedly), and then demanding additional payment at a higher rate. The Supreme Court struck down this policy, reasoning that it permitted the very price discrimination that the filed rate scheme was designed to prevent. <em>See Maislin Indus., U.S., Inc. v. Primary Steel, Inc., </em>497 U.S. 116, 130, 110 S.Ct. 2759, 111 L.Ed.2d 94 (1990), <em>superseded in part by statute, </em>Negotiated Rates Act of 1993, Pub.L. No. 103-180, 107 Stat. 2044.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-5\">Referring to <em>Keogh, Square D, </em>and their progeny, the <em>Maislin </em>Court observed that a carrier\u2019s duties to file rates and then to charge only those rates have \u201calways been considered essential to preventing price discrimination and stabilizing rates.\u201d 497 U.S. at 126, 110 S.Ct. 2759. As a result, a rigid approach has developed, pursuant to which equitable defenses to the collection of a filed rate, including \u201c[i]gnorance or misquotation\u201d of the rate, are not recognized. <em>Id. </em>at 127, 110 S.Ct. 2759 (quoting <em>Louisville &amp; Nashville R.R. Co. v. Maxwell, </em>237 U.S. 94, 97, 35 S.Ct. 494, 59 L.Ed. 853 (1915)). In this manner, carriers are discouraged from intentionally making \u201cerrors\u201d or \u201cmistakes\u201d concerning rates as a method of offering rebates or discounts to favored shippers. <em>Id. </em>at 127-28, 110 S.Ct. 2759. The only exception to the rule that shippers must pay the filed rate is when the tariff is not enforceable because, for example, the regulatory agency has deemed it unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 128, 110 S.Ct. 2759. In <em>Maislin, </em>however, the filed rates were not themselves questioned; rather, the practice of negotiating a lower rate and then seeking to collect the higher tariff was challenged. <em>Id. </em>at 129, 110 S.Ct. 2759. The Supreme Court rejected this objection and held that strict adherence to the filed rate doctrine was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-10\">In contrast to <em>Maislin, </em>in <em>K Mart, </em>the shipper contested the enforceability of the carrier\u2019s tariff, albeit on the basis of a deficiency and not on any unreasonableness in the rates. Unlike in other cases, however, in which the shipper identified a mere \u201ctechnical defect\u201d in the tariff, in <em>K Mart, </em>the described blemish was not \u201cindependently remediable,\u201d but rather resulted in \u201can incomplete tariff insufficient to support a reliable calculation of charges.\u201d 511 U.S. at 442-43, 114 S.Ct. 1702. In the case now before the Court, the parties disagree as to whether Matson\u2019s reference to the NMFC, absent the requisite participation, renders Tariff No. 14-F void, as opposed to technically defective. Plaintiffs cite <em>Zurek Express, Inc. v. Intermetro Indus. Corp., </em>1995 WL 319931 (ICC), for the proposition that nonparticipation in the NMFC invalidates Tariff No. 14-F.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Defendants counter that the NMFC does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1252\">*1252</page-number>itself specify any rates; it merely classifies commodities based on density and other transportability characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-4\">With regard to defendants\u2019 invocation of the filed rate doctrine as a defense, whether nonparticipation in the NMFC constitutes a fatal flaw in Tariff No. 14-F is irrelevant. Unlike the shippers and carriers in <em>K Mart </em>and <em>Zurek Express, </em>in this case, plaintiffs have paid,' and defendants have received, the actually filed rates, which have not been declared unreasonable or otherwise invalid by the STB.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The claim at issue here is not one by defendants to recover undercharges, but rather by plaintiffs to obtain refunds,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1253\">*1253</page-number>the filed rate doctrine is not being interposed as a sword, but merely as a shield. Having charged the rates required by law, defendants are, consistent with <em>Keogh, Maislin, </em>and <em>K Mart, </em>insulated from this type of collateral attack on those rates. Any challenge to defendants\u2019 tariffs must be addressed to the entity having the necessary expertise, as well as the authority delegated by Congress, to consider such claim, namely the STB.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-4\">E. <em>Exempt Cargo</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1309-5\">Plaintiffs again raise their earlier argument that the cargo at issue is not subject to rate regulation. In Order No. 5, the Court did not address the merits of this contention because plaintiffs had not indicated what cargo had been shipped during the class period. Because the Amended Complaint alleges that six of the plaintiffs shipped \u201cbulk cargo\u201d or \u201cforest products,\u201d the Court must now consider whether, with regard to those particular plaintiffs, the filed rate doctrine still precludes the antitrust claims asserted in this litigation. The Court concludes that the filed rate doctrine also applies to the \u201cexempt\u201d cargo at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-9\">In presenting their exempt cargo theory, plaintiffs continue to confuse tariff-filing requirements with rate regulation. They are not the same. As the Ninth Circuit explicitly recognized in <em>Gallo, </em>an agency may regulate rates without mandating that rates be filed. <em>See </em>Order No. 5 at 18 (discussing <em>Gallo, </em>503 F.3d at 1039-43). Congress has long understood this axiom, as evidenced by the statutory provisions at issue and their evolution. In one section, Congress has mandated that rates for water carriage in noncontiguous domestic trade be reasonable, without regard to the type of cargo, and it has vested jurisdiction in the STB to regulate such rates and, if necessary, to prescribe applicable rates. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13701(a)(1)(B), (b), <em>&amp; </em>(c). In an entirely distinct section, Congress has required that rates for certain cargo<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> be contained in \u201ca tariff that is in effect,\u201d and it has delegated to the STB a different bundle of powers, namely the authority to declare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1254\">*1254</page-number>that a tariff specifies an unreasonable rate or violates a filing requirement and to invalidate such tariff. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13702(a)(1), (b)(6), <em>&amp; </em>(d). The separate treatment of rate regulation and rate filing indicates unequivocally that, contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 suggestion, Congress intended for the STB to <em>regulate </em>domestic cabotage rates, regardless of the type of cargo and irrespective of whether the rates are filed. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 104-176 at 43 (1995), <em>reprinted in </em>1995 WL 701522 (indicating that the ICCTA would \u201cretain <em>rate regulation </em>for only two categories of traffic,\u201d one of which is \u201cmovements in non-contiguous domestic trade,\u201d observing that \u201c[o]ther types of traffic ... are sufficiently competitive that those shippers can adequately protect their interests without such regulation\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-4\">The history of the current tariff-filing exceptions further supports this conclusion. The Shipping Act of 1916 contained no such specific cargo exclusions to the requirement that \u201cevery common carrier by water in interstate commerce shall establish, observe, and enforce just and reasonable rates, fares, charges, classification, and tariffs .... [and] shall file with the [United States Shipping Board] and keep open to public inspection ... the maximum rates, fares, and charges for or in connection with transportation between points on its own route.\u201d Shipping Act of 1916, ch. 451, \u00a7 18, 39 Stat. 728, 735 (codified as 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 817). In 1961, the \u201cbulk cargo\u201d exemption was first introduced in recognition of the differences between common carriage and contract carriage. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 87-860 (1961), <em>reprinted in </em>1961 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3108.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-5\">Common carriers \u201chold themselves out to serve the public in a nondiscriminatory manner and on a regularly scheduled, previously announced basis,\u201d usually moving a variety of materials (\u201cgeneral cargo\u201d) for numerous different shippers at the same time. <em>Id. </em>at 4. In contrast, contract carriers, often called \u201ctramps,\u201d generally transport bulk cargo, for example, \u201ccoal, ore, and fertilizer,\u201d in \u201cfull ship load lots for a shipper who hires the vessel for a single trip.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Unlike with tramps, which can arrange charters at very little expense, setting up and operating a regularly scheduled liner service \u201ccosts a great deal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, a common carrier vessel sails and incurs the expenses of a voyage whether full or three-quarters empty. <em>Id. </em>at 5. The same is not true for tramps. Based on these distinctions, and because bulk cargo shippers were being discriminated against by certain shipping conferences operating in the international water trade, Congress made dual-rate contracts <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> inapplicable to cargo \u201cloaded and carried in bulk without mark or count,\u201d and exempted such bulk cargo from the tariff-filing requirements applicable to common carriers engaged in foreign commerce. <em>Id. </em>at 11, 14, 18; <em>see </em>Act of Oct. 3, 1961, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 4, Pub. L. No. 87-346, 75 Stat. 762 (codified as 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 842 and 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 817(b)). Nothing about this legislation evinces a congressional intent to remove rates relating to bulk cargo from the purview of the responsible agency, which was then the Federal Maritime Commission. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 87-860 at 14 (describing the Commission as having a \u201cbroad rulemaking mandate\u201d). The amendment merely responded to concerns about the relative volatility of, and resulting need for transparency in, the ocean common carrier market.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-10\">The next cargo exception was lumber. In 1963, Congress expressed its intent to treat \u201crough, or unfinished, lumber which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>is usually carried either in full-cargo or substantial partial-cargo lots in the same manner as \u2018cargo loaded and carried in bulk without mark or count\u2019 notwithstanding the fact that such lumber cargoes are tallied.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 88-630 at 1 (1963), <em>reprinted in </em>1963 U.S.C.C.A.N. 826. The legislation responded to complaints by \u201clumber-producing interests\u201d in the Northwest, which were engaged in \u201cintense competition with Canadian lumber interests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because Canada did not have similar tariff-filing requirements, common carriers engaged in U.S. foreign commerce were unable to \u201cmeet the flexible ratemaking opportunities of the unregulated competitive carriers serving Canada.\u201d <em>Id.; see </em>Act of Aug. 22, 1963, Pub. L. 88-103, 77 Stat. 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-4\">Only two years later, Congress narrowed the lumber exemption to encompass only \u201csoftwood lumber.\u201d Act of Oct. 30, 1965, Pub. L. 89-303, 79 Stat. 1124. The Northwest industry exported predominately softwood lumber, while companies in other areas of the United States exported hardwood lumber. S.Rep. No. 89-873 (1965), <em>reprinted in </em>1965 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3834. The hardwood lumber exporters had found the tariff exemption detrimental to their business because the rates they could negotiate for transportation to European ports were unstable and high, and they preferred instead to have reliable rates and to know, via tariff filings, what their competitors were paying for shipping. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1311-5\">In 1984, the bulk cargo and softwood lumber exclusions were significantly modified, resulting in the language that is now part of \u00a7 13702(a)(1). <em>See </em>Shipping Act of 1984, \u00a7 8, Pub. L. No. 98-237, 98 Stat. 67, 74 (codified as 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1707). The new verbiage attempted to treat \u201cas equally and fairly as possible for transportation purposes\u201d virgin bulk cargoes (ores, wood-chips, woodpulp) and their recycled competitors (recycled metal scrap and waste paper). H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 98-600 at 12 (1984), <em>reprinted in </em>1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 283. Because the forest products, recycled metal scrap, and waste paper exemptions were conceived for the same purpose as the bulk cargo exception, the Court concludes that they likewise evidence a legislative understanding of the varying degrees of transparency needed in the common carrier and contract carrier markets, as opposed to some congressional effort to strip from the governing agency the authority to regulate the distinct markets.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-8\">To date, only one court has explicitly held that an exemption from tariff-filing requirements renders the filed rate doctrine inapplicable. <em>Iberia Credit Bureau, Inc. v. Cingular Wireless, </em>668 F.Supp.2d 831 (W.D.La.2009). Neither side has cited this case, and the Court concludes that it is distinguishable. In <em>Iberia, </em>the district court rejected the defendant\u2019s federal preemption argument because the plaintiff was not challenging the rate for cellular phone service, also called commercial mobile radio service (\u201cCMRS\u201d), but instead was contending that she was not advised of the defendant\u2019s billing practices and did not receive the number of \u201ctalking minutes\u201d contractually promised to her. <em>Id. </em>at 839-44. Thus, the posture of <em>Iberia, </em>in which the plaintiffs breach of contract claims did not implicate rates, distinguishes it from the case before the Court. Moreover, for the same reason that the plaintiffs breach of contract claims were not preempted, they would not have been precluded by the filed rate doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-9\">The district court in <em>Iberia, </em>however, went further and rejected the defendant\u2019s invocation of the filed rate doctrine because <em>inter alia </em>the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) had exempted CMRS providers from filing tariffs. <em>Id. </em>at 844^17. The FCC has waived<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> rate regu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number>lations for CMRS providers in recognition of the hardships to consumers that can result from strict application of the filed rate doctrine,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and based on its assessment that sufficient competition exists in the cellular industry to obviate any need for \u201cconventional regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 846 (citing Second Report &amp; Order, 9 FCC Rec. 1411, 1418, 1478 (1994)). The same cannot be said of the noncontiguous domestic water trade.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Unlike the FCC, the STB has made no pronouncements about tariffs being somehow outdated or anachronistic or about the filed rate doctrine no longer having relevance to the domestic shipping industry. Instead, with respect to the Hawaii and Guam ocean trade, the reasons that gave rise to the filed rate doctrine remain as compelling today as they were when <em>Keogh </em>was decided.</p>\n<p id=\"AgG\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-4\">For the foregoing reasons, defendants\u2019 joint motion to dismiss, docket no. 125, is GRANTED. Defendants\u2019 request for judicial notice, docket no. 133, is DENIED, and Alexander &amp; Baldwin, Inc.\u2019s separate motion to dismiss, docket no. 124, is STRICKEN as moot. Plaintiffs\u2019 request for discovery and leave to amend, docket no. 128, is DENIED because any amendment would be futile. <em>See In re Pa. Title Ins., </em>648 F.Supp.2d at 685 n. 17 (\u201cDue to the preclusive effect of the filed rate doctrine, plaintiffs\u2019 claim for damages fails as a matter of law. Therefore, no amendment can cure this problem and dismissal with prejudice is warranted.\u201d)Plaintiffs\u2019 antitrust claims are DISMISSED as not cognizable or justiciable in this Court, but without prejudice to plaintiffs\u2019 ability to raise them in some fashion before the Surface Transportation Board.

In an effort to cast doubt on the reasonableness of defendants' rates, plaintiffs have indicated in the Amended Complaint that, in 2005, the cost to ship a 40-foot container from the west coast of the United States to Japan was $4,250 (and to Hong Kong was $3,575), while the rate for the same size container to Hawaii was $10,373. Amended Complaint at \u00b6 42 n. 1. Notably, the Amended Complaint does not provide similar pricing data for shipping to Guam. This silence is telling in light of the new allegations in the Amended Complaint. In contrast to the Consolidated Complaint, the Amended Complaint avers that shipping between the continental United States and Guam is governed by substantively different rules than the ocean trade between the United States mainland and Hawaii. <em>Compare </em>Consolidated Complaint at \u00b6 65 (describing the distinctions as \"irrelevant for purposes of this action\u201d) <em>with </em>Amended Complaint at \u00b6\u00b6 38-42.

As a result, according to the Amended Complaint, the Hawaii ocean trade operates in \u201cturnaround\u201d mode, on routes exclusively to and from Honolulu, while Guam is serviced by ships traveling between the United States and Asia. Amended Complaint at HV41 &amp; 42. Hawaii trade vessels are generally almost full on the westbound trip from the mainland, but virtually empty on the return eastbound. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b641. Thus, although many factors affect pricing, the differences plaintiffs have identified between the Hawaii and Asia/Guam markets are consistent with the higher costs plaintiffs have quoted for shipping cargo to Hawaii, which must, unlike goods transported to Asia, cover the expenses of both legs of the journey.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1308-10\">. Because plaintiffs\u2019 claims implicate rates, <em>see </em>Order No. 5 at 24-27, with plaintiffs seeking in damages the difference between what they paid and what they calculate the rates should have been in the absence of the alleged antitrust behavior, this case is distinguishable from recent cases refusing to apply the filed rate doctrine. For example, in <em>Alston v. Countrywide Fin. Corp., </em>585 F.3d 753 (3d Cir.2009), the filed rate doctrine was not a basis for dismissal because the plaintiffs were challenging illegal kickbacks between their lender and their primary mortgage insurer, as opposed to the rate they paid for private mortgage insurance (\u201cPMI\u201d). Moreover, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 authorizes suit for violation of the provisions thereof and establishes an exact measure of damages (three times the price of PMI), thereby eliminating any need to parse or second guess the rates. <em>Id. </em>at 764. Likewise, in <em>Abels v. JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., </em>678 F.Supp.2d 1273 (S.D.Fla.2009), the filed rate doctrine did not support the defendant lender's motion to dismiss because the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1253\">*1253</page-number>were not complaining about the rate charged by the insurer that had been selected by the lender, but rather about the lender\u2019s choice of insurer, which was allegedly improper because the lender and insurer were affiliated companies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1309-7\">. Rates for the movement of household goods must be filed regardless of the mode of transportation or service. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13702(a)(2). Rates for transportation or service in noncontiguous domestic trade must be filed unless the goods at issue constitute \"bulk cargo, forest products, recycled metal scrap, waste paper, [or] paper waste.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13702(a)(1). The STB has issued regulations concerning the publication, posting, and filing of tariffs by water carriers in noncontiguous domestic trade. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1312.1-1312.16. Plaintiffs have cited to these regulations as \u201dconfirm[ing] that the [STB] does not regulate the rates for the excluded products.\u201d Response at 15 (docket no. 128 at 21). The section on which plaintiffs rely, however, does nothing more than define the purpose of the regulations: \"The provisions of this part address the requirements in 49 U.S.C. 13702 that carriers subject to the Board\u2019s jurisdiction ... and providing transportation or service for the movement of property (except bulk cargo, forest products, recycled metal scrap, waste paper, and paper waste) by or with a water carrier in noncontiguous domestic trade shall publish and file with the Board tariffs containing the rates for such transportation.\u201d 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1312.1. Notably missing from this statement is the \"movement of household goods,\u201d over which the STB unquestionably has jurisdiction. Indeed, tariff requirements for carriers of household goods are set forth in 49 C.F.R. Part 1310. Thus, contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 suggestion, \u00a7 1312.1 merely specifies the scope of the regulations in Part 1312, and it neither abdicates responsibility for regulating, nor acknowledges an absence of authority to regulate, rates for domestic water carriage of bulk cargo, forest products, or the like.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1310-6\">.
