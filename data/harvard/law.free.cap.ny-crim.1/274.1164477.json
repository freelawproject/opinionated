All other justices that hold courts not of record are regarded in the constitution as inferior to justices of the peace. Officers and courts of limited jurisdiction take nothing by implication.

The constitution, art. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 15, 18, art. 14, \u00a7 10, makes the justice of the peace referred to, a constitutional officer whose powers cannot be changed, and seems to relate to justices of the peace of towns. Art. 6, \u00a7 19, seems to provide only for courts in cities and it has always been held that justices of the peace of cities have been created under said latter provisions for \u201c inferior local courts of civil and criminal jurisdiction.\u201d Boston Silk, &amp;c.

Section IS of article 6 of the constitution as it was amended in 1869 was in force.when the charter was passed; that section of the constitution declared, viz. :</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">\u201c Justices of the peace and district court justices shall be elected in the different cities of the state in such manner <em>and with such powers </em>and for such terms respectively as shall be prescribed by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">It was clear then that when Kenyon was elected a justice of the sessions he was a \u201c justice of the peace,\u201d and he was eligible to the office of justice of the sessions. See. 15 of art. 6, constitution. He was a justice of the peace in the county of Oneida and, therefore, within the terms of section 40 of chapter 280 of the Laws of 1847, eligible to the office of justice of sessions. However, if there was a doubt in our minds in respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>to his eligibility to the office of justice of sessions, we should incline to the opinion that he was a justice of sessions <em>defacto, </em>and that his acts would be valid and binding upon third parties until questioned and declared invalid in a proceeding of <em>quo warranto </em>directly had for that purpose, and that the Oyer and Terminer of January, 1883, where the motion was made to -fix a new day for the execution of the sentence of the prisoner, had no power to set aside the conviction and judgment thereon, with the affirmance thereof by this court pronounced in October 1882.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">In People <em>v. </em>White, 24 <em>Wend. </em>526, Bnoxson, J., said: <em>\u201c </em>But this is a case where officers having apparent authority to do the act have rendered judgment between the people and the prisoner, and neither party can, in this collateral way, call in question the title of the judges. If there had been judgment of acquittal it would have precluded the people, and the-prisoner could not have been further prosecuted.\u201d Approved, 23 <em>N. Y. </em>296. See Morris <em>v. </em>People, 3 <em>Denio, </em>397; <em>In re </em>Wakker, 3 <em>Barb. </em>162; Cronin <em>v. </em>Gundy, 16 <em>Hun, </em>524. The affidavit used in the Oyer and Terminer when the order was made which we are considering stated that Maxfield, who was a justice of the peace of the town of Annsville at the time of his election, had not \u201c two years to serve as such justice of the peace in and for the said town of Annsville.\u201d That fact does not impeach or impair his right to act as a justice of sessions. In section 34 of chapter 470 of the Laws of 1849 it was provided, viz.:</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">\u201c That no justice shall be so designated unless he shall be entitled to serve as a justice of the peace <em>during </em>such year by virtue of the election under which he shall be acting as such justice at the time of such designation.\u201d This provision was an amendment of section 40 of chapter 280 of the Laws of 1847 which required a justice of the peace to be eligible, to have at least two years from the first day of January next after said election to serve. \u201c The later statute controls, and Maxfield was <em>de jure </em>a justice of sessions.\u201d Nelson <em>v. </em>People, 23 <em>N. Y. </em>293.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">There was no error in refusing to amend the record in respect to what took place in the Oyer and Terminer before the trial of the prisoner. The application came late. The record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>as made up had been presented to this court and acted upon, and our judgment, based upon that record, was conclusive upon the Oyer and Terminer, where the prisoner was taken in January, 1883, for the purpose of having a day named for its execution. Besides, there was no proof upon which the court could act which indicated that the judgment record was erroneous. The motion in regard to what transpired in regard to entering a special plea after a general plea of not guilty was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">These views lead us to conclude that no error was committed by the Oyer and Terminer held in January, 1883, in making the order directed by it and entered in Oneida county as of the term commencing January 29, 1883.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Fourth. It is now urged that the Oyer and Terminer sitting in January, 1883, held by a justice of this court, without any associate, erred in holding that it had power to sentence the prisoner without the two associate justices being present. On June 4, 1882, by chapter 360 of the laws of that year, section 23 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was amended so as to read, viz. : <em>\u201c </em>A court of Oyer and Terminer is held by a justice of the Supreme Court without an associate,\u201d .</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">After its passage there was no law which authorized justices of sessions to sit in the Oyer and Terminer. The prisoner\u2019s counsel calls our attention to section 962 of the Code of Criminal Procedure actions. That section declares that \u201c criminal actions\u201d and \u2022\u201c proceedings in criminal cases\u201d theretofore commenced must be conducted in the <em>same manner </em>as if this had not been passed. This provision does pot relate to the organization of the court. Fuller effect may be given to the words of section 962 by limiting them to \u201c the manner \u201d ip which proceedings or actions shall. be \u201c conducted \u2019\u25a0\u2019 after they are taken up by any court to which they shall be presented. Tlie organization of a court is one thing; its manner of conducting its proceedings or actions pending in it is quite another.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Giving full effect to section 23 as amended ip 1882 and to section 962 we hold that the Oyer and Terminer was rightly organized when a justice of this court sat alone, as section 23 prescribes he may without associates. Willett <em>v. </em>People, 27 <em>Hun, </em>470,</p>\n<p id=\"b307-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>The views we have expressed lead us to say no error was committed by the Oyer and Terminer of January, 1883.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">Had the district attorney moved to dismiss the appeal taken from the order we should have been inclined to grant the motion. There is no provision of the Code of Criminal Procedure authorizing such an appeal as the one now before us. Section 517 authorizes an appeal to this court \u201cfrom the judgment on a conviction after indictment, and upon the appeal any actual decision of the court in an intermediate order or proceeding forming a part of the judgment roll .... may be reviewed.\u201d This does not authorize an appeal in piecemeal, first from a judgment, and after it is affirmed, an appeal from any subsequent order by a subsequent and independent appeal. See Piper <em>v. </em>Van Buren, 27 <em>Hun, </em>384 ; <em>Code Criminal Procedure, </em>\u00a7 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">As such motion was not made, we have looked into the merits, and come to the conclusion that the order ought not to be reversed by us under the peculiar circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">We conclude to affirm the order, instead of dismissing the appeal upon our motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Order affirmed and papers ordered filed with the clerk of Oneida county.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">Smith, P. J., and Macombee, J., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
