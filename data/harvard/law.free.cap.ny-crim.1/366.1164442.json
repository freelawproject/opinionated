To have justified the acceptance of such a plea the indictment should have charged that the killing was committed while in the perpetration of or attempt to perpetrate, some crime or misdemeanor, other than the act which was itself the cause of death and for which the defendant was indicted. Dedieu <em>v. </em>People, 22 <em>K. Y. </em>180. Under the similar statute (L. 1876, ch. 333), making killing while in the commission of a felony murder in the first degree, it has been the uniform practice to set forth some separate and distinct felony disconnected from the act of violence causing the death. Cox <em>v. </em>People, 80 <em>N. Y. </em>500 ; Dolan <em>v. </em>People, 64 <em>N. Y. </em>485 ; McGloin <em>v. </em>People, 1 <em>N. </em>Y. <em>Crim. Rep. </em>105, 154. It was the intention of the Legislature that in both murder and manslaughter in the first degree the felony and misdemeanor should be some other offense than the one causing the death of the person killed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b391-10\"><em>John McKeon, </em>district attorney, <em>John Vincent, </em>assistant, for the people, respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b391-11\">Danforth, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABVr\">The indictment accused Thomas McDonnell of the crime of murder. He pleaded <em>\u201c </em>guilty of manslaughter in the first degree,\u201d and after sentence by the General Sessions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>and judgment thereon, appealed to the Supreme Court, where the judgment was affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">In this conclusion we find no error. The indictment charges the commission of the offense under circumstances constituting its highest degree. Upon trial he might have been convicted of a lower degree (2 <em>R. S. </em>702, \u00a7 27; Keefe <em>v. </em>People, 40 <em>N. Y. </em>348), and in that case could not again be tried nor convicted of a different degree thereof. 2 <em>R. 8. </em>702, \u00a7 28. The same result follows a plea of guilty. It was not necessary to aver in the indictment the facts or circumstances which, if proven, would constitute the lesser crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">These are matters of evidence for the benefit of the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">People <em>v. </em>Butler (3 <em>Park. </em>377), cited by the appellant, is not to the contrary, but recognizes the rule that an indictment under the common law form is sufficient notwithstanding the statute, and permits a conviction for the offense charged in any degree according to the evidence. Nor do the cases referred to by his counsel support his contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
