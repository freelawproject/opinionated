The jury were as much in session, as much taking evidence at this time as at any other during their sittings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-7\">The admissibility and competency of evidence is a question for the court. It was error for the court to submit to the jury the question of law, as to whether or no the coroner\u2019s court was a judicial tribunal in session at the time of the scene between Mrs. Wing and the prisoner, and whether the prisoner\u2019s conduct was admissible to charge him. It was not a mixed question of law or fact. Its admissibility was purely a question of law for the court. <em>Wharton's Law Ev. </em>\u00a7 391; 1 <em>Greenl.

Experiments were made before the coroner for the purpose of testing .the recollection of Mrs. Wing. The defendant and others were placed around the room'and witness was asked to pick out the person, she saw at her house that night, and she designated the defendant. The same persons were made to pass behind her, each repeating the words, as to asking for a dr.ink of water, which as she testified had been used at her house on the night of the murder, and she was asked to detect by the voice the one who had used the same language at her house on the night in question, and she recognized the defendant\u2019s voice as belonging to such person. The defendant did not deny, in answer to either test, that he was the person Mrs. Wing saw that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">These experiments were admitted as evidence upon the trials on the ground that the silence of the defendant was an admission of his guilt. The evidence was objected to and the objection overruled. It is claimed that the ruling of the court, in this respect, was erroneous. The same question was raised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>by the defendant\u2019s counsel on motion to strike out the evidence which was denied and an exception duly taken. Also by a request to the court to charge the jury to disregard it, which was refused and an exception taken. The question whether the defendant was bound to speak, and understood that he was at liberty to speak if he chose, was submitted to the jury by the court in his charge, and an exception taken thereto. The doctrine as to silence being taken as an implied admission of the truth of allegations spoken or uttered in the presence of a person, does not apply to silence at a judicial proceeding or hearing. And if the proceedings before the coroner were of a judicial character, the evidence was erroneously received. It is very apparent that the examination before the coroner partook of a judicial character and what there transpired must be considered as a part of the proceedings; the coroner was there, a jury had been etnpanneled and witnesses were examined whose testimony was returned as a portion of the coroner\u2019s proceedings. It is difficult to see upon what ground it can be claimed that the experiments which were made were not in connection with the proceedings before the coroner and a part thereof. The claim that they were informal and outside of the proceedings is not well founded, and it would be extremely difficult to draw the line between the other proceedings and these which are said to have been outside of them. We think the submission of the question to the jury, whether it was a judicial proceeding, was erroneous; the court should have held whether the proceedings before the coroner were judicial or otherwise, thus giving to the defendant\u2019s counsel the benefit of an exception.if he chose to take one. The evidence in regard to the coroner\u2019s proceedings was before the court; and it should have determined whether the facts referred to constituted a part of these proceedings, and it cannot, we think, be said that it was proper to leave the same to the jury for the reason that it could have done no harm. It is very evident these experiments were made with a view of sustaining the correctness of Mrs. Wing\u2019s testimony, and hence they constituted a part of the proceedings before the coroner. The evidence of Mrs. Wing was for the purpose of showing circumstances tending to prove that the defendant was in the vicinity at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>commission of the crime and his silence might be taken as assenting to that fact. The fact that he thus remained silent and did not deny that he was present at the time stated by Mrs. Wing might well have affected the minds of the jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Under the circumstances presented, the proceedings before the coroner were clearly of a judicial character and the defendant was not bound to speak,\u2014his silence could not be regarded as an evidence of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">There are other questions in the case, but inasmuch as they may not arise upon another trial, we do not deem it necessary to consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The judgment of-the General Term should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
