BRODY, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Direct and Indirect Purchasers of a steroid nasal spray containing the active ingredient fluticasone propionate (\u201cFP\u201d), along with Roxane Laboratories, Inc. (\u201cRoxane\u201d), a generic FP manufacturer, brought actions against Defendant SmithKline Beecham Corporation, doing business as GlaxoSmithKline PLC (\u201cGSK\u201d). GSK manufactures Flonase, the branded version of FP. The various Plaintiffs allege antitrust and state consumer violations that they claim arise from GSK delaying market entry of generic FP. In its defense, GSK asserts, among other things, that its conduct \u2014 particularly the filing of citizen petitions with the Federal Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) regarding issues related to Roxane\u2019s Abbreviated New Drug Application (\u201cANDA\u201d) \u2014 is protected from antitrust liability under the First Amendment and the <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine, and, additionally, is not the actual cause of generic delay into the market.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Under the <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine, a party that exercises its First Amendment right to \u201cpetition[] the government for redress generally is immune from antitrust liability.\u201d <em>Cheminor Drugs, Ltd. v. Ethyl Corp., </em>168 F.3d 119, 122 (3d Cir.1999) (citing <em>E. R.R. Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., </em>365 U.S. 127, 81 S.Ct. 523, 5 L.Ed.2d 464 (1961); <em>United Mine Workers of Am. v. Pennington, </em>381 U.S. 657, 85 S.Ct. 1585, 14 L.Ed.2d 626 (1965)). An exception to the <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine occurs when the conduct \u201cis a mere sham to cover what is actually nothing more than an attempt to interfere directly with the business relationships of a competitor....\u201d <em>Noerr, </em>365 U.S. at 144, 81 S.Ct. 523. The Supreme Court has established a two-pronged test to determine whether a party\u2019s conduct is a sham, therefore denying <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>immunity. <em>See Prof'l Real Estate Investors, Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Indus., Inc. (hereinafter \u201cPRE\u201d), </em>508 U.S. 49, 113 S.Ct. 1920, 123 L.Ed.2d 611 (1993). Under the first prong, known as the objective prong, plaintiffs must show that \u201ca reasonable petitioner could not realistically expect that the petition will succeed on its merits.\u201d <em>In re Flonase Antitrust Litig., </em>795 F.Supp.2d 300, 311 (E.D.Pa.2011) (citing <em>Cheminor, </em>168 F.3d at 122-23; <em>Bryant v. Military Dep\u2019t of Miss., </em>597 F.3d 678, 693 (5th Cir.2010)). If the challenged conduct is deemed objectively meritless, the trier of fact then considers the second prong, known as the subjective prong. The fact-finder must examine the defendant\u2019s \u201csubjective motivation\u201d to determine if the conduct \u201cconceals \u2018an attempt to interfere directly with the business ... of a competitor.\u2019 \u201d <em>PRE, </em>508 U.S. at 60-61, 113 S.Ct. 1920 (quoting <em>Noerr, </em>365 U.S. at 144, 81 S.Ct. 523).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">The parties in these three related actions have retained numerous experts to opine on issues relating to liability, including the <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine and causation, as well as damages. In 2010, the parties filed several <em>\u201cDaubert\u201d </em>motions to exclude the reports and testimony of certain expert witnesses. <em>See Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993). In June 2011, I denied without prejudice all those <em>Daubert </em>motions that did not relate to Indirect Purchaser Plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>tiffs\u2019 (\u201cIndirect Purchasers\u201d) then-pending motion for class certification. In early 2012, the parties re-filed their respective motions to exclude, but then subsequently withdrew the majority of the motions. In July 2012, I denied two motions to exclude parts of the testimony of Plaintiffs\u2019 expert Leslie Benet and GSK\u2019s expert Mary Pendergast,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> both of whom will opine on, among other topics, issues related to the objective prong of the <em>PRE </em>test and to causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Before me now is GSK\u2019s <em>Daubert </em>Motion to Exclude Expert Testimony of David A. Kessler, M.D., the former Commissioner of the FDA. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot., Sept. 14, 2012, Case No. 08-3149 ECF No. 456 (\u201cGSK Motion\u201d). Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs proffer Kessler to testify about FDA procedures with respect to citizen petitions; specifically to rebut testimony from Pendergast. Kessler discusses what is likely to move the FDA to change policies in accordance with a citizen petition; he then applies that analysis to conclude that GSK could not have reasonably expected its citizen petitions to succeed on the merits. In other words, Plaintiffs plan to use Kessler\u2019s opinion to rebut GSK\u2019s <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">II. Legal Standard for Expert Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">The party offering an expert must demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the expert\u2019s qualifications and opinions comply with Federal Rule of Evidence 702. <em>See Daubert </em>509 U.S. at 592-93, 113 S.Ct. 2786 (citation omitted). Rule 702 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-8\">A witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if: (a) the expert\u2019s scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data; (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">Fed.R.Evid. 702. Rule 702 has \u201ca liberal policy of admissibility.\u201d <em>Pineda v. Ford Motor Co., </em>520 F.3d 237, 243 (3d Cir.2008) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-12\">The Third Circuit has explained that to survive a <em>Daubert </em>challenge, an expert must satisfy three \u201crestrictions on expert testimony: qualification, reliability, and fit.\u201d <em>Schneider ex rel. Estate of Schneider v. Fried, </em>320 F.3d 396, 404 (3d Cir.2003) (citations omitted). The qualification inquiry examines whether a witness possesses specialized expertise. The Third Circuit \u201chas interpreted this requirement liberally, holding that a broad range of knowledge, skills, and training qualify an expert.\u201d <em>Id. (citing In re Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litig., </em>35 F.3d 717, 742 (3d Cir.1994)). For an expert\u2019s testimony to be reliable, it \u201cmust be based on [ ] methods and procedures ... rather than subjective belief or speculation.\u201d <em>In re TMI Litig., </em>193 F.3d 613, 670 (3d Cir.1999). \u201c[T]he admissibility inquiry thus focuses on principles and methodology, not on the conclusions generated by principles and methodology.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 665. Furthermore, an \u201cexpert\u2019s testimony must be accompanied by a sufficient factual foundation before it can be submitted to the jury.\u201d <em>Elcock v. Kmart Corp., </em>233 F.3d 734, 754 (3d Cir.2000) (citation omitted). Finally, Rule 702 requires that the expert testimony fit the issues in the case. Testimony \u201cfits\u201d a case when it is \u201crelevant for the purposes of the case and ... assist[s] the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Schneider, </em>320 F.3d at 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">At trial, Plaintiffs intend to introduce Kessler as an expert on FDA procedures with respect to citizen petitions. Kessler earned a medical degree from Harvard Medical School and a law degree from the University of Chicago Law School. <em>See </em>Expert Report of David A. Kessler- July 10, 2012 (\u201cKessler Report\u201d) \u00b6 1. He worked on food and drug issues for the Labor and Human Resource Committee in the United States Senate during the 1980s. Kessler Report \u00b6 2. In 1990, President George H.W. Bush appointed Kessler Commissioner of the FDA, a position he held until February 1997, serving under both Presidents Bush and Bill Clinton. <em>Id. </em>After he left the FDA, he became the Dean of Yale Medical School, where he taught drug regulation, among other topics. Kessler Hr\u2019g Tr. 27:2-12. \u2022 He also served as Dean of the medical school at the University of California, San Francisco, where he remains a tenured faculty member. Kessler Hr\u2019g Tr. 27:13-28:13. He has consulted for private firms about drug regulation, FDA procedures, and clinical trials. Kessler Hr\u2019g Tr. 28:17-29:3. He has written books about public health and has published dozens of articles about the regulation of drugs and other public health topics. <em>See </em>Kessler Report, Appendix A.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Plaintiffs proffer Kessler to describe how a citizen petitioner could influence the FDA to change its policies; to opine on whether GSK could have reasonably expected the FDA to accept the positions it advocated in its own petitions; and to respond to Pendergast\u2019s testimony regarding the use of the term \u201cregulatory merit\u201d at the FDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">A hearing was held on October 15, 2012. Kessler testified that the FDA is a data-driven organization and offered his opinion that a citizen petitioner can move the FDA to adopt new policies by presenting scientific and medical data that is \u201cclinically meaningful.\u201d Kessler explained that \u201cclinically meaningful\u201d data is more than just statistically significant data; it is data that relates to a drug\u2019s clinical safety and effectiveness. Hearing Tr. 38:3-18, October 15, 2012, (\u201cKessler Hr\u2019g\u201d). Applying this principle \u2014 that only clinically meaningful data would move the FDA to adopt positions advocated in a citizen petition \u2014 Kessler concluded that there was no reasonable possibility that the FDA would have granted GSK\u2019s requests to refrain from approving new FP generics until the Agency had finalized \u201cguidances\u201d on standards and policies.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 51:9-17. Kessler testified that, in forming his opinions, he reviewed GSK\u2019s citizen petitions and the FDA responses to them, additional FDA documents, congressional testimony relating to FDA\u2019s review of ANDAs between 2001 and 2005, and the Hatch-Waxman Act that set forth ANDA procedures. Kessler Hr\u2019g Tr. 89:4-92:16. GSK objects to Kessler\u2019s testimony on all three prongs of the <em>Dauberb </em>inquiry: qualification, reliability, and fit.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-10\">A. Qualifications</p>\n<p id=\"b682-11\">On the question of his qualifications, GSK argues that Kessler\u2019s determination whether GSK\u2019s petitions lacked clinically meaningful data reflect an opinion on the scientific merit of the petitions, which GSK argues he lacks the expertise to offer. <em>See </em>GSK Motion, at *8-12. GSK argues that Kessler never personally reviewed any ANDAs, and that he lacks first-hand experience conducting research in the area of bioequivalence. Without such expertise, GSK argues, Kessler is not qualified to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>offer opinions regarding the FDA\u2019s ANDA approval process.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">These arguments fall flat. As a former Commissioner of the FDA charged with overseeing the agency\u2019s response to all citizen petitions, Kessler is qualified to opine on what moves the FDA to adopt positions espoused in a citizen petition. Kessler testified that regulations surrounding ANDAs were \u201cfront burner at the Agency when I got there,\u201d and that the approval of generic drugs occupied \u201ca considerable amount of attention.\u201d Kessler Hr\u2019g 19:10-14. Indeed, Kessler signed the extensive FDA regulations implementing the Hatch-Waxman Act, which revised the procedures for the approval of generic drugs; these regulations specifically covered citizen petitions as well. <em>See </em>Abbreviated New Drug Application Regulations, 57 FR 17950 (April 28,1992) (codified at 21 C.F.R. pts. 2, 5, 10, 310, 314, 320, 433); <em>see also </em>Kessler Hr\u2019g 10:12-17. Kessler testified that while he did not write the Agency\u2019s responses to each individual ANDA, he \u201cinfluenced\u201d the responses by setting FDA policy. Kessler Hr\u2019g 23:8. He testified that he was more than a mere \u201cfigurehead\u201d at the Agency; he was substantively trained in the science and was actively involved in setting FDA policy. Kessler Hr\u2019g Tr. 23:15-18. He was particularly involved in the review of citizen petitions relating to the regulation of tobacco, personally signing the FDA\u2019s response that changed the Agency\u2019s treatment of tobacco and started the process of regulating cigarettes as a drug for the first time.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Kessler\u2019s lifelong experience in the field of food and drug regulation demonstrates that he is well-equipped to discuss the FDA\u2019s processes for responding to citizen petitions, and that he is qualified to opine on whether a sophisticated petitioner like GSK could have reasonably expected to succeed in changing FDA policy with its petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">B. Reliability</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">As to'reliability, GSK makes three main objections: (1) Kessler\u2019s opinions about the citizen petition review process at the FDA are based on neither independent analysis nor reliable methodology. Rather, GSK argues, Kessler merely parrots the FDA\u2019s responses to GSK\u2019s petitions. (2) Kessler\u2019s definition of \u201cregulatory merit\u201d is unreliable because Kessler himself admitted he was not familiar with the term. (3) Kessler\u2019s opinions on causation are unreliable because they are too generalized and outside the scope of GSK\u2019s specific petitions. <em>See </em>GSK Motion, at *13-22. Like GSK\u2019s arguments' regarding Kessler\u2019s qualifications, I find its arguments about the reliability of Kessler\u2019s opinions unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">On the basis of his personal experience at the FDA, along with his academic and advisory experience in the years after he left the Agency, Kessler intends to testify that the FDA is a scientifically-based, organization, and that only petitions that include \u201cclinically relevant\u201d data \u2014 meaning data that goes to a drug\u2019s efficacy or safety \u2014 would be likely to move the FDA to alter its policies. Kessler applies that analysis to GSK petitions,' which asked the Agency, among other things, to delay approving any ANDAs for generic FP until the agency had issued final guidance. Kessler opines that a sophisticated petitioner like GSK had no reasonable expectation of success because its petitions lacked the clinically relevant data that would persuade the FDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-10\">At the hearing, Kessler explained that final guidance on generic drugs is not required, and that there are guidances going back several decades that are still in draft form. Kessler Hr\u2019g 39:23-25. He testified that sufficiently relevant data could lead the FDA to \u201cstop the approval process the Agency is mandated to conduct under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>statute\u201d to await issuing final guidance on the standards for the generic drug. Kessler Hr\u2019g Tr. .40:9-41:6. However, halting the ANDA process requires \u201ca relatively high showing\u201d that would include \u201cprovid[ing] scientific or medical data, that shows therapeutically or clinically meaningful result[s].\u201d Kessler Hr\u2019g Tr. 40:21-41:2. \u201cI believe, again, if there\u2019s a scientific reason it\u2019s shown that has potential clinical importance to patients, then I think it\u2019s okay for the Agency to take a time out ... and go finalize a guidance and stop the approval process.\u201d Kessler Hr\u2019g Tr. 41:2-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Kessler concludes that GSK did not meet this \u201chigh showing\u201d in its petitions: \u201cGSK did not provide scientific or medical data that were therapeutically or clinically meaningful to support GSK\u2019s position.\u201d Kessler Report \u00b6 58; <em>see also </em>Kessler Hr\u2019g Tr. 51:11-17 (\u201cQ: [D]o you have an opinion as to whether GSK presented scientific and medical data that were therapeutically or clinically meaningful to support its petitions? A: I do. Q: And what is your opinion? A: They did not.\u201d). Importantly, Kessler is not offering an opinion whether GSK\u2019s data was \u201ccorrect,\u201d something that GSK insists Kessler is unqualified to do. Kessler Hr\u2019g Tr. 52:2-4. Rather, he concludes only that the data GSK presented was not <em>relevant </em>to the FDA \u2014 that GSK\u2019s petitions did not present information that spoke to the drug\u2019s safety or efficacy that might lead the FDA to change its policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Although Kessler\u2019s opinions comport with the FDA\u2019s own analysis, he is not merely \u201cparrotfing]\u201d back the FDA\u2019s conclusions. <em>See </em>GSK Motion at *2. His opinions satisfy Daubert\u2019s reliability prong because they are based on his own analysis of GSK\u2019s petitions and the Agency\u2019s responses,- founded on the principle that only clinically meaningful data moves the FDA to change is policies. In other words, Kessler is analyzing <em>how </em>the FDA made its determinations, to demonstrate that a reasonable petitioner could not have reasonably expected the FDA to grant its petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">Finally, GSK argues that Kessler\u2019s opinion about the definition of \u201cregulatory merit\u201d should be excluded as unreliable. In her expert report and during her <em>Daubert </em>hearing, GSK expert Mary Pendergast; a former FDA employee and expert in the field of pharmaceutical regulation, testified that GSK\u2019s petitions were \u201cappropriate\u201d and had \u201cregulatory merit.\u201d <em>See In re Flonase Antitrust Litig., </em>884 F.Supp.2d 184, 195-96 (E.D.Pa.2012). She explained that a petition with \u201cregulatory merit\u201d referred to a \u201cposition that the FDA could well have adopted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 196. A petition with regulatory merit, she testified, meant that \u201cit was quite possible, in fact more than possible, a qualitatively good idea for the FDA to accept that petition \u2014 accept that position when it was reviewing ANDAs.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">In his report, Kessler countered Pendergast\u2019s testimony: \u201cTo my knowledge, the term \u2018regulatory merit\u2019 is not used in FDA statutes or regulations. The absence of the term from FDA\u2019s statutory and regulatory framework means that it is not a concept that has any common or formal application at the agency.\u201d Kessler Report \u00b6 43. At the hearing, Kessler testified that he could find only one FDA document that had used the term. Kessler H\u2019rg Tr. 61:21-62:5. He testified that he interpreted Pendergast\u2019s use of the term \u201cregulatory merit\u201d to mean \u201csomething that would move the Agency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 64:1-2. He emphasized that he was not offering a competing definition of the term, only that the term itself does not have common or formal use at the FDA. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">In its motion, GSK argues that Kessler\u2019s opinion about \u201cregulatory merit\u201d should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>excluded because he has no familiarity with the term. GSK Motion at *21. But his lack of familiarity \u2014 his testimony that the term is <em>not </em>part of regular FDA parlance \u2014 is itself relevant information that rebuts Pendergast\u2019s testimony. More importantly, Pendergast used the term when describing what was likely to move the FDA to adopt a position in a citizen petition. Kessler\u2019s testimony is similarly focused: He presents his own opinion as to what moves the Agency. In his view, the touchstone is not \u201cregulatory merit,\u201d but \u201cclinically meaningful data.\u201d Kessler\u2019s statement that \u201cregulatory merit\u201d is not a term of art at the FDA is inextricably linked to his larger opinion about what <em>does </em>move the Agency to adopt citizen petitions, an opinion I have already determined that he is qualified to make, and one that is founded upon reliable principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">An examination of an expert\u2019s reliability focuses on the methodology behind his opinion. Kessler relied on his own direct experience at the FDA to formulate his opinions about what moves the Agency to act. For these reasons, Kessler\u2019s testimony satisfies the \u201creliability\u201d prong of <em>Daubert.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">C. Fit</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">On the question of \u201cfit,\u201d GSK argues that Kessler\u2019s opinions regarding how the FDA handles citizen petitions fail the fit requirement because they are detached from the specific issues of the ease, and encourage the jury to improperly rely on Kessler\u2019s impressive resume. <em>See </em>GSK Motion at *3.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">The question of fit examines how relevant the expert\u2019s testimony is to the issues at trial and how helpful it will be to the trier of fact. Despite GSK\u2019s objections, Kessler\u2019s testimony has a tight \u201cfit\u201d in this case. As explained above, GSK claims that its petitions are protected under the First Amendment and thus cannot form the basis of antitrust liability. To get around this immunity, Plaintiffs will have the burden of proving that the petitions were \u201cshams,\u201d which requires showing that they were both objectively and subjectively baseless. Kessler\u2019s testimony is directly relevant to the question of objective baselessness. By opining on what moves the FDA to adopt policies from a citizen petition, Kessler\u2019s testimony will assist the jury in determining whether GSK could reasonably expect to succeed in its petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">GSK also complains that Kessler improperly offers an opinion on causation when he described a \u201cculture at the Agency to respond in a detailed and exhaustive fashion to citizen petitions.\u201d Kessler Report \u00b6 69. Kessler explained that the FDA considered a response to a citizen petition \u201cto be a \u2018final agency action,\u2019 \u201d which required detailed responses, \u201cregardless of whether the issues and information raised by the petition changed or could realistically change agency policy.\u201d Kessler Report \u00b6 70. He stated that the process of responding to petitions about generic drug approvals was \u201ctime consuming,\u201d Kessler Report \u00b6 73, and that the responses \u201ctook time and resources from the generic drug approval process due to an environment that was particularly constrained and limited by resources.\u201d Kessler Report \u00b6 75. GSK claims that these opinions are \u201cgeneralized and superficial\u201d and thus both lack reliability and fail to meet the \u201cfit\u201d requirement. GSK Motion at *23. GSK asserts that Kessler is too unfamiliar with the petition review process to testify about whether it slows down the Agency\u2019s other work, and objects that there is no basis to apply Kessler\u2019s generalized opinions to GSK\u2019s petitions in particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-11\">GSK overstates the opinions Kessler is presenting. As he emphasized in his testimony, he does not intend to opine on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>whether GSK\u2019s petitions specifically caused Roxane\u2019s delayed entry into the market. Kessler Hr\u2019g Tr. 68:13-18. His testimony concerned general FDA procedures, which provides context for his opinions about the citizen petition review process. At the hearing, he provided further foundation for his opinions about how the FDA responds to citizen petitions. He pointed to the FDA commentary to the proposed regulation on citizen petitions, which explained that final agency actions require the FDA \u201cto create a comprehensive administrative record.\u201d Kessler Hr\u2019g Tr. 67:5-23 (citing 57 FR 17950). Because he is not offering an opinion on what actually caused the delay of Roxane\u2019s generic FP onto the market, I find that his general opinions on the process of responding to citizen petitions is well-founded, reliable, and admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">For these reasons, there can be no legitimate dispute that Kessler\u2019s testimony is directly relevant to the central questions at issue in this trial, and therefore satisfies Daubert\u2019s \u201cfit\u201d requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">\u201cThe Rules of Evidence embody a strong and undeniable preference for admitting any evidence which has the potential for assisting the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Kannankeril v. Terminix Inter., Inc., </em>128 F.3d 802, 806 (3d Cir.1997). Rule 702 extends this liberal policy to expert witnesses. Kessler\u2019s testimony will assist the jury in understanding federal regulations relating to ANDAs and how the FDA implemented those regulations to deal with ANDA-related citizen petitions. His testimony is directly related to the question of sham petitioning, and squarely rebuts expert testimony presented by GSK. He is a credible witness with an indisputably impressive background. Kessler\u2019s expert testimony satisfies Daubert\u2019s requirements and is admissible under Rule 702. I will therefore deny GSK\u2019s Motion to Exclude Expert Testimony of David A Kessler.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">\n<em>ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">AND NOW, this 31st day of October 2012, it is ORDERED that Defendants\u2019 Motion to Exclude Expert Testimony of David A. Kessler (Case No. 08-3149 ECF No. 456) is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b680-8\">.
