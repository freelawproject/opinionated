The only ground of the motion for new trial is based upon the statement that the evidence is not sufficient and the conviction is against the law. The evidence fully justifies this conviction, showing that appellant bet in a game of cards. We deem it unnecessary to collate the facts. Appellant introduced no evidence and the State proved that he bet while they were playing cards. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
