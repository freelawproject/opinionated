The evidence shows that appellant was found in possession of the prosecuting witness\u2019 mule. The mule was thoroughly identified as prosecuting witness\u2019 mule. He gave an explanation to the effect that he had bought or traded for the mule sometime before his possession was discovered. He took the mule to Uvalde County and traded the mule off for a horse. The court charged on circumstantial evidence, and properly presented the law applicable to the facts of this case, and the evidence supports the verdict. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-16\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
