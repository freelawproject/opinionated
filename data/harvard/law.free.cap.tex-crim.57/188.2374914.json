In the first place it is urged that the testimony' is not sufficient to show that the body found was that of the alleged deceased, Jerry Williams, and, second, that it was not shown that- his death occurred by, through or of the criminal agency or direction or act of appellant. Ho synopsis of the testimony can fairly present these questions so as' to make a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>precedent of value to the profession. We, therefore, set out the testimony in full. It is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b213-3\">\u201cJ. C. Florea, County Attorney of Fort Bend County, Texas, testified:</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">\u201cThat on Sunday morning, January 31, 1909, he received word that a barn and some out buildings were burned near Clodine, a small town in the northeast part of Fort Bend County, and that the remains of a human being had been found in the ruins. That he and the deputy sheriff, Elmo Ransom, went to the scene of the fire. Upon their arrival at the scene of the fire they found that a large barn and a lot of farming implements, and some small buildings were completely destroyed by fire Saturday night. The barn was a frame building consisting of two large eorneribs with a driveway between them, and shed room on either side for stock. The witness did not know whether the barn had mow room over the cribs or not. In the ruins about two feet from where the north door to one of the cribs had been they found the charred remains of a human being lying across the tines of a pitchfork and some old wire, face up and the stubs of the arms indicating that the hands had been folded across the breast. The legs and feet were burned off within a few inches of the knees. That the bowels were oozing out of an opening in the belly. That the flesh was burned off of the face, exposing a set of small even teeth. That the frontal bone was mashed in between the eyes, apparently by some blunt instrument, and from the back and top of the head the brains had oozed out through a busted place in the skull. The witness stated that he was certain that the body found in the burned ruins was the body of a negro man, that he reached this conclusion after a thorough examination of the body. That nowhere about the body could he tell the color of the human being, but the skull was that of a negro. That the remains looked to be those of a person of medium height, with a full chest. The body was burned crisp all over except two patches on the cheeks of the buttocks which rested on the ground. These two patches of flesh were covered with burned clothing and were parched brown. On the body extending from the throat down the chest there were four rows of buttons of different styles. One kind were small dish buttons, another pearl buttons larger than the former, another row of metal buttons with the word UTiagra\u2019 engraved thereon and also a locomotive, another row of large metal buttons like the buttons used on slickers. The witness stated he and the deputy sheriff gathered these buttons up, also a number of brass eyelets without hooks like those worn on laced boots or shoes, hob nails and brass screw brads like those used in fastening on boot soles, a barlow pocketknife and tin snuff box, and a metal piece off of the shank of a pipe. The iron frames of various kinds of farming implements were strewn over the ground near the body, also a heavy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>sledge hammer was found nearby. The witness stated that a short distance from the ruins stood a vacant tenant house, and from which trailed a mark to the ruins, as though something heavy had been drug on the ground. The witness stated he found no blood stains around the vacant building or on the ground about there.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-3\">\u201cThe State introduced dish buttons, pearl buttons, metal buttons with the word \u2018Magra\u2019 printed on them, and a locomotive epgraved thereon, and a large flat metal button like those used bn slickers, a tin snuff box, a metal piece off of the shank of a pipe and some hob nails and brass brads like those used in fastening on boot soles, and a barlow poeketknife, all of which the witness identified as being found on the dead body by him and Elmo Ransom.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">\u201cElmo Ransom, deputy sheriff, testified to practically the same facts as Mr. Florea, except that he could not tell whether the remains were those of a white man or a negro.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">\u201cS. J. Winston, sheriff of Fort Bend County, Texas, testified: That he went to the scene of the fire Monday morning and began inquiring as to the probable offender, if any one at all, and he was informed that the defendant, Ellis Southern, had been seen leaving the Washington house Sunday morning going in the direction of the Figure Four ranch carrying a. suit case. That he and Jerry Williams were the only persons missing from the neighborhood. That he went to the Figure Four ranch and found the defendant and Phoebe Williams. That he found that suit case with these clothes in it (pointing to a suit case and some clothing that had been introduced) in the defendant\u2019s room.

That the buildings were burned some time Saturday night, January 30, 1909, just what time during the night he did not know as he went to bed early Saturday night and did not wake up until late the next morning. That the barn which was completely destroyed by fire was a large frame building consisting of two large corn cribs with a driveway between them and a big hay mow overhead, and shed rooms for stock round the sides of the cribs in which had been stored a lot of farm implements, the iron frames of which were -scattered about in the ruins. That he found the charred remains of a human being in the ashes a few feet from where the north door to one of the cribs had been. The body was lying on its back across the tines of a pitchfork and some old wire. The feet and legs were burned off up to within a few inches of the knees. The bowels were oozing from an opening in the abdomen. The hands were burned off and from the position of the arms it looked as though the hands had been folded across the breast. That the flesh was burned off of the face leaving exposed a set of small-even teeth. The frontal bone was crushed in, apparently by some blunt instrument. And from the back and top of the head the brains had oozed out through a bursted place in the skull, which looked as though it had been, caused by the fire.

That he was present when the county attorney, J. C. Florea, and deputy sheriff, Elmo Eansom, made an investigation.

Witness left O\u2019Brien\u2019s about 3 o\u2019clock Saturday and did not return until Sunday evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">\u201cAlice McDonald testified: That she went over to Charles Washington\u2019s house on the O\u2019Brien\u2019s place about 5 o\u2019clock Saturday evening, January 30, 1909, to sit up with Sadie Washington \u25a0 who was very sick.

That he visited the scene of the fire the next day and saw the charred remains of a human being in the ruins, but he could not tell whether it was the body of a white man or a negro. That he had known Jerry Williams about a year. That he was a middle aged man of medium height and weighed about 150 pounds. That judging from the size and appearance of the body and from the teeth he \u2018thought\u2019 the body was that of Jerry Williams. That he knew the defendant who lived with Phoebe Williams at the Washington house.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">\u201cLee Osburn testified: That he knew Jerry Williams about a year. That he met him at the train when Jerry first came to Clodine and that Jerry went home with him and stayed all night. That the next day Jerry went to work for Mr. Madden. That Jerry frequently after that came to his house and visited with him. The witness stated that Jerry had a small set of even teeth. That he was about fifty years old and of medium height and heavy set. That he went to the scene of the fire about 10 o\u2019clock Sunday morning. That he saw the body in the ashes and it was charred beyond recognition, the flesh being burned from the face and the teeth showed plainly. The witness stated when he saw the teeth, \u201cI says, them shore\u2019s Uncle Jerry\u2019s teeth.\u201d He stated that the top of the head was mashed flat and the body burned to a crisp. That he did not remain at the ruins but a very short time. That he had not seen or heard of Jerry Williams since the fire. He did not know whether that was Jerry Williams\u2019 body he saw in the ruins, but he was \u201cshore them were Uncle Jerry\u2019s teeth.\u201d That witness stated that he did not know Jerry Williams was married until after the fire. The witness stated his hearing was defective, being partially deaf.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">\u201cJulia Williams, wife of Jerry Williams, testified: That she lived in Houston, Texas; that she was the wife of Jerry Williams; that she met Jerry Williams some months before at a church in Houston; that they were married December 27, A. D. 1908, and that Jerry and she lived together until January 1, 1909, when Jerry went to Clodine to go to work. That was the last she saw of him; that she did not know where he was; that he had written her two letters after going to Clodine; that he had promised her that he would come to Houston January the 30th or 31st, but he did not come. That Jerry had never failed to keep a promise with her before this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">\u201cEdgar Lindsey testified: That he was working in a blacksmith shop on the O\u2019Brien place Saturday, January 30, 1909. That he knew Jerry Williams and Ellis Southern. That a while before supper Saturday evening Jerry Williams went to his room and went to sleep; about six o\u2019clock Ellis came to the shop where he was at work and asked him if he knew where Uncle Jerry was, and he told Ellis that Jerry was in his room asleep. And Ellis said he did not want to wake him, and for the witness to tell Jerry that he had made the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>arrangements they had talked about and for him (Jerry) to meet him as he had agreed to. That he told Jerry at supper time what Ellis had told hini to tell. That Ellis did not stay for supper, but said he was going to mail a letter on the train going to Houston, which was due about 6:14 p. m. That evening after supper was the last time he had seen Jerry Williams. The witness stated that he was at the examining trial, but did not say anything about what Ellis had told him to tell Jerry until a short while before the regular trial of the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-3\">There was no testimony offered by the defendant. It may be that the evidence is sufficient to authorize the jury to find that the burned and disfigured body found was that of Jerry Williams, with whose murder appellant stands charged. If,, however, this fact could be conceded, the testimony falls far short of being of that degree of cogency and directness as to justify us in upholding a conviction consigning any man, black or white, to prison walls for his whole life. A reading of the testimony will demonstrate that there was no motive shown, and that the sum of the criminative evidence is the possession by appellant of some clothing said to have belonged to deceased, and the fact that they were together with other persons on the evening of the fire, which almost consumed the body of the dead man. While this might raise some suspicion-, it falls so far short of that high degree of proof which the law requires that we cannot hesitate in believing it insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
