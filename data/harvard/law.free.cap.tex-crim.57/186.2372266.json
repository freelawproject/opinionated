Conceding this was true, appellant was only convicted of a simple assault and fined $10, therefore, appellant cannot complain of same. The court properly charged on simple assault, and the jury properly found appellant guilty under the evidence as disclosed in the record. See McCutcheon v. State, 49 Texas Crim. Rep., 607, 16 Texas Ct. Rep., 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-17\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-18\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
