The last contention is that the verdict is contrary to the law and the evidence. There is no bill of exceptions in the record, nor ia the charge of the court complained of in the motion. It is manifest, under the well settled rules governing this tribunal, that the first two matters mentioned above cannot, in the absence of bill of exceptions evidencing all the facts there stated, be considered by us. The evidence in the case is far from satisfactory, though the prosecuting witness 'testifies to an assault by such means and force and under such circumstances as, if believed, to justify the jury in concluding that appellant was guilty. This verdict has received the sanction and approval of the learned trial court, and we feel that we ought not, as here presented, to interfere.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\">Finding no error in the proceedings of the court below, the judgment is hereby in all things affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
