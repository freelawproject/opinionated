B. Prewett ... did then and there unlawfully assemble and meet together with the intent and purpose to aid each other to repair to the vicinity of the residence of Mrs. Ann McVicker and there disturb the said Mrs. Ann McVicker, Mrs. Laura Shook and Mrs. W. L. Hudspeth, inmates thereof, by loud, unusual and unseemly noise; and they did then and there by such means disturb the said Mrs. Ann McVicker and the other inmates of such residence in the enjoyment of her and their right to peace, quiet, good order and freedom from disturbance.\u201d \u25a0 Appellant moves in arrest of judgment, alleging the insufficiency of the indictment, and especially pointing out the fact that it does not allege that Mrs. McVicker had or owned the residence; that the pleading is vague and inferential. We are of opinion that the motion should have been sustained. See Follis v. State, 37 Texas Crim. Rep., 535; Luter v. State, 33 Texas Crim. Rep., 69; Blackwell v. State, 30 Texas Crim. Rep., 673. It will be noticed from a reading of the indictment that it does fail to allege that Mrs. McVicker owned any residence or occupied a house as a residence, and it further fails t\u00f3 allege that they went to the\u2019 residence of Mrs. McVicker. Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>the -authorities cited we are of opinion that the motion should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The judgment is reversed and the prosecution is ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Brooks, Judge, absent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
