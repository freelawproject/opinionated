C. Couch, R W. Harryman and Lee Son, sureties, in a case appealed from the County Court of Brown County, Texas, and in the course of which forfeiture judgment nisi was taken at the July Term, 1908, of the County Court of Brown County, upon which judgment nisi a scire facias was issued to said parties, commanding them to show cause at the October Term, 1908, of said court, -why such judgment nisi should not be made final, and they failing to answer, the judgment Avas made final by default at the said October Term, 1908, of said court.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\">The first error assigned is that the court erred in rendering judgment by default against defendants J. C. Couch, Lee Son, and B. W. Harryman, because the officer\u2019s return is insufficient to support the judgment- by default, being as MIoavs, to wit: \u201cCame to hand 22d day of August, 1908, and executed on J. 0. Couch 22d day of August, 1908, in Brownwood, Texas. SerA'ed on B. W. Harryman September 2, 1908, in Brownwood, Texas; Lee Son 4th day of November, 1908, at 2:30 p. m., in Browmvood, Texas. (Signed) Frank Emison, Sheriff, by G. E. Kitchen, Deputy.\u201d Appellants contend that to support the judgment by default, the officer\u2019s return on the scire facias must show that each of the defendants were seiwed in person Avith a true copy of the Avrit, giving the date and place of such service. This contention is correct. Art. 480, White\u2019s Code of Criminal Procedure; Batt\u2019s Annotated Civil Statutes, art. 1225; Fulton v. State, 14 Texas Crim. App., 32; Rutherford et al. v.
