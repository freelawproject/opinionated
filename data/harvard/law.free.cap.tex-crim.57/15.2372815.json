The bill is qualified as follows: \u201cThat all of the causes were on the setting for said date; that reading from the top to the bottom of the column in which the setting appears the causes were in the following- order: 12084, 12083, 12082, and in this order they were called by the court and tried, except that cause 12082 ivas not tried.\u201d This cause was numbered on the County Court docket 12083. As thus explained by the court, we are of opinion there is no injury shown and deem it unnecessary to discuss the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-11\">There is what purports to be another bill of exceptions in the record reserved to the refusal of the court to grant a continuance, but it is not signed by the county judge or in any manner approved. It can not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-12\">There is another bill of exceptions which recites: \u201cWhile the witness Eb. Hanna was on the stand he was permitted by the court to' describe the building and the fixtures and the surroundings in the building, over objection of the defendant on the ground that it was immaterial, and irrelevant and hearsay.\u201d What the facts were, or how \u2022 they were injurious, can not be ascertained from this bill-. ..The recitals are .entirely too general and in every way fail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>to show how the description, fixtures and surroundings in the building could have been injurious. As presented the bill is too indefinite. No error is shown.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"APGU\">[Behearing denied October 13, 1909.]</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">We are of opinion that the evidence is fully sufficient to sustain a conviction and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
