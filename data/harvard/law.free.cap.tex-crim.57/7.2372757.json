We find an assignment of errors, but an assignment of errors has no place in this court. All errors in the charge must be reserved in a motion for a new trial. The assignment of errors is not'filed in the lower court. In the absence of motion for a new trial there is nothing in this record authorizing a review.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-23\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-24\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b32-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>on rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">October 13, 1909.</p>\n<author id=\"b32-6\">BROOKS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AxP\">This case was affirmed at the last term of this court, and now comes before us on motion for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Appellant contends there is a motion for a new trial in the record. There is an unsigned portion of what purports to be a motion for a new trial, though it does not appear to have been filed and is indexed as an assignment of errors. Unless a motion for new trial is filed it cannot be reviewed by us. The motion for rehearing is accordingly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">Overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
