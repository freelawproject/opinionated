The return as to the service and execution of the papers, notice, etc., is as follows: \u201cCame to hand 33d day of August, 1908, and executed on J. C. Couch 33d day of August, 1908, in Brownwood, Tex., and executed on C. H. Benney Sept. 1, 1908, in Brownwood, Tex.\u201d Signed by the sheriff by a deputy. Under all the authorities this service is not sufficient. Article 480 Code Criminal Procedure provides as follows: \u201cSureties shall be entitled to notice by service of citation, the length of time and in the manner required in civil actions, and the officer executing the citation shall return the same in the manner provided for the return of citations in civil actions.\u201d In proceedings upon forfeited bail bonds and recognizances the sureties are entitled to notice, by service of citation, for the length of time and in the manner required in civil actions.
