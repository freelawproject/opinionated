We find no plea of former conviction in this record. We find in the statement of facts that appellant made something like four different sales the day in question, but this would not authorize the court to charge on the issue complained of. There must be a proper plea, as required under many authorities of this court, before any such defense can be s\u00e9t up. We find but one bill of exceptions in the r\u00e9cord, which complains that the affidavit in this case upon which the information was filed, was taken before the justice of the peace <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>for precinct No. 1, .and delivered to the county attorney, and the county attorney filed an information on it.
