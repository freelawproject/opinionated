The evidence' is not very satisfactory and yet we are scarcely prepared to hold that it is insufficient. The main witness for the State was evidently hostile and reluctant to testify to the real facts. He does state, however, that in the fall of 1906 \u201cI-bought something to drink from him (appellant) in Big Sandy.\u201d He says further: \u201cI got a bottle from Roscoe Trinkle there in that room; I do not know how much I paid for it, I do not know whether I gave him the money or put it on the box or what. I do not remember paying Roscoe Trinkle anything for the bottle I got, but I do remember getting some money out of my pocket. I got the money out of my pocket, L suppose, to pay for it, but I do not remember paying him anything, but my best judgment is that the money went to pay for the bottle.\u201d As to what it was he bought he says: \u201cI suppose it was whisky in the bottle, but I have tasted better drinks called whisky than that was.\u201d Again,, he says: \u201cMy best judgment was that it was a kind of strong drink, maybe cider. My best judgment was that it was whisky, of course; I would not swear positively that it was whisky.\u201d Evidently when he uses the words \u201cbest judgment\u201d and \u201csuppose\u201d .it is to be understood in the sense of \u201cmy recollection,\u201d and as expressing a belief. In addition to the evidence of this witness, the State introduced proof of Internal Revenue License issued to appellant covering the period at which the sale was made. Most of the motion embraces objections to the local option election held in Upshur County. In the absence of a contest the Tegularity of such election is to be assumed, and it can not be raised as is 'here attempted. The evidence, as stated, is not very satisfactory, but under all the circumstances is, we believe, sufficient to sustain the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>None of the other matters raised are deemed to be of sufficient importance to require discussion. Finding no error in the judgment of the court below, it is ordered that the same be and it is hereby in all things affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b593-6\">on rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">January 12, 1910.</p>\n<author id=\"b593-8\">RAMSEY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A6J\">Appellant has filed in this case a vigorous and well considered motion for rehearing, in which the conclusion of the court, that the judgment of conviction is supported by the evidence, is vigorously attacked. The proof as contained in the record is indeed weak. We find, however, that on a careful examination of the record that we are not authorized to consider the statement of facts at all. It appears from the. record that the term of the County Court at which the conviction was had ended on the 5th day of December, 1908. The statement of facts was filed on January 4, 1909. The Act of the Thirtieth Legislature, page 59, does not apply to cases tried in the County Court. Nichols v. State, 55 Texas Crim. Rep., 211. In this state of the record we are not authorized to consider the statement of facts filed in the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">McCord, Judge, not sitting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
