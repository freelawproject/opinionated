' He sought this for the testimony of his wife. The only question involved in refusing the continuance is whether or not it should have been granted to secure his wife\u2019s testimony for the purpose of impeaching a State\u2019s witness. As a rule, continuances will not be granted to secure impeaching testimony. See White\u2019s Annotated Code of Criminal Procedure, p. 398, see. 612, for collated authorities. The witness whom appellant proposed to contradict was rather cogently impeached by her own sworn statements made before the justice of the peace as well as by the <em>testimony of </em>other witnesses, and also a written statement signed by her and testified by Bramlette and the two Wrights. The evidence proposed to be proved by the absent witness is the same as that above mentioned. As presented by this record, we are of opinion the court. did not err in refusing to grant the continuance in. the first instance, and, further, there was no error in refusing a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-14\">The charge in regard to self-defense is criticised because the jury were not expressly instructed that if there should be a \u201creasonable doubt\u201d on this theory they should give appellant the benefit of the doubt. The court gave a very full and fair charge on self-defense, the only criticism urged against it is the one stated. The court fully charged reasonable doubt and presumption of innocence, which, we think, under the circumstances of this case, is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-15\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"Ase-\">\n<em>Afjkmcd.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
