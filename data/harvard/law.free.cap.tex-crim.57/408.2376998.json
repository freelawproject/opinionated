County Attorney, if you say so, I will just put this man in jail and stop this trial, and he can stay there until he does remember how he testified in the City Court, what do you say ?\u201d The judge then further said to the witness: \u201cI want you to understand just what a delicate position you are in, for we can prove and will prove that you have heretofore testified that you bought this whisky from Thompson, so you had better tell it now and save trouble.\u201d The county judge then called the sheriff and told him to place witness in jail, but the county attorney suggested that they further examine the witness, etc.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b433-5\"><em>D.

The State laid a predicate to contradict him by showing his contradictory statements, amounting, in substance, to an admission of the sale in what is called a court of inquiry in the Corporation Court of the city of Abilene. This impeaching testimony could not be made the basis of a conviction. In this connection we desire to say further that the action of the court in the matter of conducting the examination in this case, we could not sanction and if there were no other matters raised on the appeal we would feel compelled to reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>For the reason that the conviction was wholly without evidence to support it, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
