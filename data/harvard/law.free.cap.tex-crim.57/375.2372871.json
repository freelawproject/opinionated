Appellant\u2019s first bill of exception shows the State witness J. M. Broyles testified as follows: \u201cThe window upstairs had been opened by the same party about twice before. I did not see him both times. It is my impression that it was the same party. I did not swear as a fact that the same party opened it twice, but I will swear that it is my impression that it was the same party.\u201d Thereby meaning and conveying to- the jury that the defendant, Dock Platinburg had burglarized the store of the said Broyles by going through the window upstairs on two different occasions. Appellant objected to this testimony, and moved the court to strike it out, and instruct the jury to disregard it. The bill is approved with this qualification: \u201cThe above statement of the testimony is correct, but I can\u2019t approve the. bill for the reason that the testimony was brought out by defendant on cross-examination, and if' any objection was ever made or \u25a0 motion to strike out, I have no recollection of it.\u201d This explanation disposes of appellant\u2019s bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">\u2022 2.- Appellant\u2019s second bill; of exceptions show that the witness, Charley; Dominy,- was -permitted.to testify, over appellant\u2019s objection, as follows:- - \u201cC.- - B.. -Burmingham \u25a0 subsequently turned- over some goods: to us. -Mr. - Farris-, also -turned over some-to-, us. Mr. Farris <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>is sheriff of Walker County. Mr. Burmingham was constable of precinct No. 5 at that time. I identified some of the goods. I identified a counterpane.\u201d Appellant objected because it was not permissible for the witness to state that he identified the goods, in that his action in identifying the goods was not evidence against this defendant, because made at a time when the defendant was not present, and were the acts of a stranger to the defendant, and said actions and declarations were incompetent and inadmissible for any purpose. The bill is approved with the explanation that these were the goods found in the private residence of defendant by the sheriff and constable after the burglary. With this statement from the court the evidence was admissible.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"ALeL\">[Behearing denied December <em>22, </em>1909. \u2014 Beporter.]</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">3. The third bill of exceptions shows the witness J. M. Broyles was permitted to testify, over appellant\u2019s objection, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">\u201cQ. Did anybody bring you any goods which you could identify ?\u201d To which the witness answered: \u201cYes, sir.\u201d This bill is approved with the explanation that the testimony had shown that the goods identified were found in defendant\u2019s house by officers and were turned over to the witness by the officers. The record shows the witness was the prosecutor. The testimony was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">4. Appellant in his motion for a new trial complains of the charge of the court on accomplice testimony, on the ground that same is not the law and inapplicable to the facts in this case. This charg\u00e9 has been repeatedly approved by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">5. The court charged also. on circumstantial evidence, and appellant objects to this on the ground that the charge is contrary to the law and inapplicable to the facts in this case. Concede it is not a case of circumstantial evidence, still it could not have injured appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">Various other objections are urged by appellant to the charge of the court, all of which we have carefully reviewed. We find no error in this record authorizing a reversal of the judgment and same is in all things affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
