Brown, Justice\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Appellant Nathan Ray Foreman challenges his conviction for aggravated robbery and aggravated kidnapping. Foreman argues in a single issue that the trial court should have granted his motion to suppress surveillance video evidence found on a computer hard drive pursuant to a\n   search warrant because the warrant's supporting affidavit did not establish probable cause. Having granted appellant's motion for reconsideration en banc, we conclude the affidavit was not sufficient to support a finding of probable cause. This court's panel plurality, concurring, and dissenting opinions filed August 10, 2017, are withdrawn, and our judgment of that date is vacated. We reverse the trial court's denial of appellant's motion to suppress and remand for a new trial consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 24, 2012, witnesses driving on the service road of Highway 290 observed complainants Moses Glekiah and Richard Merchant tumble from the rear of a van onto the road. Complainants were bound with zip ties and their mouths were taped shut with duct tape. Witnesses observed that complainants had been shot and were bleeding. One witness called 9-1-1. Police and paramedics arrived at the scene, and complainants were taken by ambulance to Ben Taub Hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Both complainants were injured. Merchant was more seriously injured. In addition to gunshot wounds and injuries from falling out of a moving vehicle, Merchant's abdomen had been burned with an iron. Due to Merchant's injuries, officers could not initially interview him. However, officers were able to interview Glekiah at the hospital. Glekiah initially told Officers Arnold and Hufstedler that he went to an auto shop to work on some cars when he was robbed by several black males.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Glekiah had an outstanding arrest warrant\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and was transferred to Houston Central Jail after his discharge from the hospital. After the transfer, Arnold and Hufstedler met with Glekiah at jail, and Arnold asked him to \"Take to us [sic] where this happened.\" Glekiah accompanied the officers and directed them to a custom auto shop at 2501 Central Parkway, Dreams Auto Customs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The officers researched the shop, looking for individuals tied to the business. They found Charese Foreman listed as the owner of Dreams Auto Customs on a filing with the county clerk's office. Marriage license records showed Charese was married to Nathan Foreman. Arnold and Hufstedler concluded Nathan and Charese Foreman were both owners of Dreams Auto Customs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Arnold subsequently obtained a search warrant for Dreams Auto Customs. Arnold was the affiant in the affidavit for the search warrant. In the affidavit for search warrant, Arnold described the facts as he understood them at that time: Glekiah and Merchant had agreed to meet someone at Dreams Auto Customs to conduct \"business.\" When the two men arrived, several suspects grabbed them, tied them up, beat them, poured gasoline on them, and threatened to set them on fire. The suspects stole cash and other items from the men. The suspects then forced the men into the back of a van at gunpoint and drove the van away from the auto shop. The men jumped out of the moving van because they believed they were going to be killed. As the men jumped, they were shot by the suspects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Arnold and Hufstedler executed the search warrant on January 8, 2013. At the shop, they found and seized three computer hard drives, zip ties, duct tape, a digital camera, a gas can, a computer skimmer, and an iron. They also swabbed for DNA. The computer hard drives were transferred to the police forensics lab, and forensic experts retrieved video surveillance\n   from one of the hard drives. The video surveillance captured a portion of the offenses and appellant's involvement in the offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In a pretrial motion to suppress, appellant objected to the seizure of the computer hard drives and/or video surveillance equipment. In support of the motion, appellant argued that the warrant did not list computers or computer hard drives as items to be seized. Appellant also argued that even if the computers were characterized as \"audio/video surveillance\" or \"video equipment\" (items that were listed in the warrant), the supporting affidavit was defective because it failed to set forth sufficient facts to establish probable cause that surveillance equipment was located at the auto shop. Initially, the trial court denied the motion with regard to the computer containing surveillance video but suppressed the other two computers. Appellant then moved for rehearing of the motion to suppress and filed a second motion to suppress. Appellant asked the trial court to suppress \"[a]ll computer hard drives and or audio / video surveillance video and or video equipment.\" On rehearing, the trial court ruled that none of the computers should be suppressed. Appellant moved to suppress a third time at trial. The trial court addressed the motion to suppress in a hearing outside the presence of the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In the hearing, the State indicated it did not intend to introduce contents of the two computers which did not contain surveillance video so only the computer containing surveillance video was at issue. Arnold testified that he became aware of surveillance equipment at Dreams Auto Customs before drafting his affidavit, when he initially visited the shop with Glekiah. He testified that he mentioned video surveillance equipment in his affidavit \"[b]ased on the cameras that we saw outside the business. If there's cameras, there's going to be a video surveillance system.... [T]he cameras outside told us that there was a system.\" Arnold reiterated, \"Based on what we saw at that location when we drove by, we could see the video surveillance cameras mounted on the exterior. We surmised that there must be surveillance system on the inside as well possibly. So we included that in the search warrant.\" Arnold also testified it was \"not unusual\" and \"probably expected\" that a business like a custom auto shop would have a surveillance equipment system. When asked, \"[I]s that something that you typically look for when investigating homicide cases?\" Arnold responded, \"Every time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The affidavit included \"audio/video surveillance video and/or video equipment\" in a list of items Arnold believed might be found at the auto shop:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   I, D. Arnold, a peace officer employed by Houston Police Department do solemnly swear that I have reason to believe and do believe that on the property of 2501-C #2 Central Parkway Houston, Harris County, Texas (Target Location), with the authority to search for and to seize any and all ITEMS CONSITUTING [sic] EVIDENCE CONSTITUTING AGGRAVATED ASSAULT AND ROBBERY that may be found therein including, but not limited to all DNA and items that may contain biological material; fingerprints; hair fiber(s); audio/video surveillance video and/or video equipment; instrumentalities of the crime including firearm(s) and ballistics evidence; gasoline container(s), lighter(s), tap, zip tie(s), van; fruits of the crime including wallet(s), suitcase, briefcase, money, documents establishing identity of Complainant(s) and/or Suspect(s)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   such as paper(s), license(s), cell phone(s).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The affidavit also described the location:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Said location of\n   <strong>\n    2501-C #2 Central Parkway Houston, Harris County, Texas\n   </strong>\n   is more particularly described as a single story building complex with a large sign facing Central Parkway that shows address 2501-C for all the businesses within the complex strip, this particular business [sic] is made of metal and brick with dark tinted glass windows and black painted aluminum; a sign attached to the front of the building over the door reads \"Dreams Auto Customs\"; the front door is dark tinted glass and faces parking lot; on the door is the suite number C#2; the back of the business has an aluminum looking, gray in color bay door that opens into the business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Arnold admitted, however, that there was no reference to surveillance equipment in the section of the affidavit which stated the facts upon which his belief was based. The affidavit did not reference the officers' observation of cameras outside the business. The affidavit did not reference the officers' experience with surveillance equipment in custom auto shops or homicide cases. The facts section stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   MY BELIEF IS BASED UPON THE FOLLOWING FACTS:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   D. Arnold (Affiant) was assigned to investigate Aggravated Assault and reviewed offense report #161435712D written by Officer A. Deleon. Affiant was dispatched to 10500 Northwest Freeway, Houston, Harris County, Texas. Affiant learned from Officer A. Deleon that Cindy Davis (Witness) reported that on December 24, 2012 she observed two men (Complainants) lying injured on the side of the roadway with their hands tied and mouths duct taped. Affiant learned from HPD Officer A. Deleon that Complainants had apparent gunshot wounds to their bodies and had been transported to Ben Taub Hospital for treatment. Affiant spoke to Diane Deyoung who witnessed Complainants coming out of a white van license plate AV5-0784 before the [sic] continued down the road without stopping. Affiant learned from hospital personnel that Moses Glekiah (Complainant Glekiah) was recovering from gunshot wounds and Richard Merchant (Complainant Merchant) was in critical condition for his gunshot injuries.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Affiant spoke with Moses Glekiah (Complainant Glekiah) and learned he and his friend Richard Merchant (Complainant Merchant) had agreed to engage in [sic] business transaction at 2501-C #2 Central Parkway Houston, Harris County, Texas with a male known as \"Jerry.\" When Complainants arrived on December 24, 2012 at the business that they describe as an autoshop, they are grabbed by several males and held against their will. Complainant Glekiah reported that Suspects also stole their cash money $400 that Complainants had in their possession, wallets, cell phone and a suitcase/briefcase container belonging to Complainant Merchant. Suspect 1 poured gasoline on Complainants and held lighter near Complainants threatening to set them on fire. Suspect 1 then called two other Suspects who put Complainants in truck at gunpoint. Complainant Glekiah says that he felt in fear for their lives. Complainants jumped out of the van because they believed they were going to be killed. As Complainant [sic] leaped out of the vehicle they were shot by Suspects.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Complainant Glekiah directed Affiant to autoshop where this Aggravated Assault and Robbery occurred at 2501-C\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   #2 Central Parkway Houston, Harris County, Texas. Affiant researched the location and found the owner to be Charese Foreman. Affiant review computer databases and discovered that Charese Foreman is married to Nathan Ray Foreman. Affiant reviewed criminal history of Nathan Ray Foreman and found that he had been charged with autotheft, possession of prohibited weapon and delivery of cocaine. Affiant showed Complainant Glekiah a known photograph of Nathan Ray Foreman along with five other photos of similar looking males. Complainant Glekiah positively identified Nathan Ray Foreman as Suspect 1 who participated in punching Complainants, told other suspects what to do, poured the gasoline on Complainants and contacted 2 suspects to drive Complainant away from business. Affiant knows that gasoline and lighter are deadly weapons that can kill a person.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Affiant believes that Complainants and Suspects DNA will be inside the Target Location along with property belonging to Complainant such as money, suitcase/briefcase, wallets, cell phone, identification cards. Also instrumentalities of the crime such as white van that transported Complainants, guns used to shoot Complainants, zip ties used to tie complainants may also be inside Target Location.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The trial court denied appellant's motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Trial resumed after the hearing, and the trial court admitted the surveillance video into evidence. The video was discussed by many witnesses and used to corroborate complainants' testimony. While there was independent evidence about complainants' rolling out of the van and the van being on fire,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the video was particularly significant in showing that appellant was involved in the robbery and the kidnapping. Other than complainants' testimony, the video was the only significant evidence showing appellant's involvement in the crimes, and evidence showed the credibility of complainants to be questionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Arnold testified that complainants had been running a black money scam\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   on appellant. Arnold testified Glekiah lied to him in his initial interview: \"[P]ortions of what he told us were not true.\" Arnold testified that Glekiah's second interview took place at jail because Glekiah was in custody for an outstanding warrant on an unrelated matter. Arnold testified that he ultimately believed Glekiah because \"the actual explanation of why they were here came out\" over time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Arnold also testified about the search warrant, the supporting affidavit, and the\n   search. With regard to the computer hard drive containing the surveillance video, Arnold testified that when he executed the search, he observed that the hard drive appeared to be connected to a flat screen TV showing surveillance, and he \"had reason to believe that was actually a surveillance system that was hopefully going to depict what video was collected in there.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Arnold testified that the video corroborated complainants' story about what had happened to them before the scene on the highway.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   When Hufstedler was on the stand, the State extensively played the video and elicited testimony about what it showed. The first person Hufstedler identified in the video was appellant. Hufstedler then repeatedly identified appellant in different parts of the video. In all, Hufstedler identified appellant in the video at least ten times. He testified that the video showed appellant walking in with duct tape in his hand. Hufstedler also testified that the video showed that one of the men at the body shop, Darren Franklin, had a gun, and later, was walking with an iron in his hand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hufstedler explained that some of what occurred happened off camera. He testified that the video showed the van being parked inside the body shop. Hufstedler testified that the video showed appellant open the doors to the van and lay out a sheet or a blanket before pushing the two tied-up complainants into the back of the van and closing its doors. Hufstedler testified that, after considering the video, he conducted multiple interviews and filed aggravated kidnapping and aggravated robbery charges on appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On cross-examination, defense counsel questioned Hufstedler about the absence of DNA and fingerprint evidence on the duct tape, zip ties, and other items that were seized from the auto shop. Defense counsel questioned Hufstedler about the identities of co-defendants, pointing out that there were a total of six co-defendants in the case. Hufstedler testified that complainants were initially reluctant to discuss all the facts with the police. Hufstedler acknowledged that complainants were trying to con appellant in a black money scam.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On re-direct, Hufstedler testified that the video showed appellant and a co-defendant loading bags complainants had brought to the shop into the rental car driven by complainants before another co-defendant drove the car out of the auto shop. Hufstedler testified the rental car was later discovered \"burned.\" Hufstedler testified that the video and the zip ties and tape recovered at the shop corroborated what complainants told him. Hufstedler also testified that complainants' injuries corroborated their stories.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   When Glekiah and Merchant testified, they admitted they had been running a\n   scam on appellant. Merchant admitted that he and Glekiah were using the scam to steal $100,000 from appellant. Merchant admitted that he had run the same scam on a previous occasion. Glekiah and Merchant admitted they were not entirely honest with the police during the investigation. Glekiah testified that he had previously pled guilty to pandering and was under indictment for another offense in Georgia. Merchant testified that he had previously been convicted of family-violence battery in Georgia. During their testimony about the events that took place in Dreams Auto Customs, the video was played both to corroborate their testimony and also to show what was missing from the video.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Recalled to the stand, Arnold testified on direct examination that the video showed appellant with a gun and that appellant was the one directing the other co-defendants to bring the van into the body shop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In the State's closing argument, the State emphasized the importance of the video. Although defense counsel had attempted to minimize the impact of the video by calling it a \"silent movie\" in its closing, the State disputed this characterization and repeatedly referenced the video as evidence of the alleged offenses. The State argued that the video corroborated the testimony given during trial:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   You know that the testimony that you heard from this stand makes sense for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is the fact that what Defense counsel describes as a silent movie exists. It's not just a silent movie, folks. That is surveillance video footage that documents a horrible, horrible crime that occurred here in your county back on Christmas Eve of 2012.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   That's not nothing. That is exactly the type of evidence that you-all told me during voir dire that you wanted because you said, \"Video, yeah, that would help me make my mind up. It would be great if you could see it.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Yeah, you might not be able to see everything on the video, but you see enough. You see the perpetration of a crime, and you see its horrific aftermath.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The State argued that the video evidenced the involvement of appellant in the alleged offenses:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   There should be no doubt in your mind after having seen that video that Nathan Ray Foreman, that man, was the one driving the boat that day. It was his orders. It was his-it was his initial contact with our complainants that got this ball rolling. It was his orders that people come out with guns. It was his orders that they be bound, that they be gagged. It was his orders that they be burned. It was his orders that they be tossed into the back of a van to go someplace unknown to be shot and executed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The State also argued that the video evidenced the \"exhibiting a deadly weapon\" element of aggravated robbery and aggravated kidnapping:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   As for the exhibiting a deadly weapon, you know that there were deadly weapons used as part of the aggravated robbery in two ways. You know that there were-that there was a gun and/or guns, as the testimony as come out, used initially right after Richard Merchant brought in that construction paper and chemicals.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   How do you know that there was a gun used? Well, first of all, you saw Darren Franklin walking in with a gun on video. So you know there was at least one gun. And testimony from Moses and Richard was that there were multiple guns there.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   And, again, the deadly weapon, we talked about this before in aggravated-when we were discussing the elements of the aggravated robbery, that some of you could believe the gun was used initially as they were binding and blindfolding Richard and, you know, while they had them down there on the ground. Some of you could believe that, and some of you could believe that the deadly weapon was actually used in the van.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The State argued that the video showed appellant's intent, using detailed references to the video in the form of a timeline:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Actions speak louder than words. We talked about this because you can infer somebody's intentions from your actions. The defendant has an absolute right not to testify. So that puts me in a place where how do I prove what his intent is?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   You have to look at the contextual evidence surrounding it. Some of it you know. You heard testimony from Moses Glekiah that the defendant yelled out, \"Guys come out,\" and people ran in with guns. So you can infer the defendant's intent from that. Absolutely. But you can also infer his intent by looking at his actions. The actions that he did over a four-hour period on December 24th of 2012.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   So I want to look at it in terms of a timeline. First of all, at 9:54 a.m. on the surveillance video, Nathan Foreman puts an object consistent with a firearm in the back of his belt. That right there is evidence that he was in possession of a firearm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   At 9:54, also, you see Darren Franklin on the surveillance video putting a gun into his waistband.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Folks, if they were just there for a friendly business deal, why are we putting weapons, why are we getting all weaponed up two hours before the incident actually occurs?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   At 11:25, Moses Glekiah and Richard Merchant arrived at Dreams Auto Customs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   At 11:30, Richard Merchant brings the money and the chemicals inside of the Dreams Auto Customs garage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   At 11:37, mere minutes after Richard Merchant has peacefully entered the location with his suitcase and the backpack full of the items used to scam the defendant, Darren Franklin and Jason Cunningham enter the garage with objects in their hands-you can see it on the video-that are consistent with firearms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   At 11:45, Nathan Ray Foreman retrieves duct tape and then walks off camera with it to a location that is consistent to where the complainants are being held and tortured.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   At noon, Nathan Ray Foreman is seen speaking on the phone, and then shortly thereafter Jason Washington, the Customs agent, enters in his uniform into the garage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   And you heard testimony that the agent then helped by looking at the GPS of the complainants and asking them where the money was. Folks, that's what this is really about. Nathan Ray Foreman knew he was being scammed. He figured it out. He saw that black money.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Don't you know that he saw that that [sic] money inside of that suitcase wasn't real money? Don't you know that he realized that he got scammed and he was pretty mad? He was really mad. He thought this was going to be a huge windfall for him. And when he realized that he was being scammed, he wasn't smart enough to pick up on the fact that the money didn't really ever exist.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   And that's what this is really about. These two men were bound and tortured and terrified and ultimately they were sent to their deaths because that man-... That man wanted money. That's what this is about.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   At 1:00 p.m. Darren Franklin retrieves an iron, an iron that was identified by Moses and Richard as the iron that was used to torture a screaming Richard Merchant. You heard testimony from Moses about how terrified he was during that moment, how it hurt him to see his friend being hurt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   At 1:05, Charles Campbell wipes down the complainants' car. If these men, including Nathan Foreman, thought that they were in the right, if they weren't doing something that was terrible and wrong and illegal, there would be no need for them to try and wipe down and tamper with the evidence like what you see on the camera at 1:05 p.m.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   And, finally, at 3:30 p.m., Nathan Ray Foreman places a blanket or tarp in the back of a van, a van where Moses Glekiah and Richard Merchant, without hope, believing that they were going to die that day, terrified, in pain, and alone, are loaded in.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   And if what you see Nathan Foreman doing on this video isn't aiding, assisting, encouraging and planning, I don't know what is. He is literally the person who was shutting the doors on the hope of our complaining witnesses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The State referenced the video again in its final plea to the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   And so I'm asking each and every one of you to do something, not because it's fun, but because it's right and each and every one of you know it's right. You've seen the video. You've heard the testimony. There's only one decision for you to make, and that's to find Nathan Ray Foreman guilty of aggravated robbery and aggravated kidnapping.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   At the conclusion of trial, the jury found appellant guilty of aggravated robbery and aggravated kidnapping. The trial court assessed 50-year sentences to run concurrently. When the trial judge announced appellant's sentence, she explained, \"What I saw on the videotape that was offered into evidence is disturbing, to say the least. Because of the severity of the injuries and because of what I witnessed on the videotape, I assess your punishment at 50 years in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice Institutional Division in each case to run concurrently.\" Appellant timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In appellant's sole issue, he argues the trial court \"erred in refusing to suppress the surveillance video evidence because the warrant affidavit failed to set forth facts sufficient to establish probable cause that surveillance video or surveillance equipment would be located at the place to be searched.\" Appellant argues that because the police officer's affidavit failed to establish probable cause, the officer's search for surveillance video or surveillance equipment violated the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, article I, section 9, of the Texas Constitution, and chapter 18 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   As a threshold matter, we address whether appellant had standing to challenge the lawfulness of the search. In order to challenge a search and seizure under the United States Constitution, the Texas Constitution or the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, a party must first establish standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <em>\n    Pham v.

This court has required specific facts to support an inference that those devices exist before we have allowed seizure or search of electronic devices pursuant to a warrant. This is demonstrated by our jurisprudence surrounding the searches of computers/cameras and cellphones.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Many of these cases address the second requirement of article 18.01(c), whether \"the specifically described property or items that are to be searched for or seized constitute evidence of that offense or evidence that a particular person committed that offense,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 18.01(c), rather than whether a particular item will be found in a particular location. However, both considerations require that the property or items at issue exist. In this case, appellant's issue centers around whether probable cause existed that the surveillance video or surveillance equipment was located at the auto shop, not whether probable cause existed that the surveillance video or surveillance\n   equipment constituted evidence of the charged offenses or evidence that appellant committed the offenses. Nonetheless, the magistrate inferred not only that the surveillance video and surveillance equipment was at a specific location (inside of the auto shop); it also inferred that the surveillance video and surveillance equipment existed. Therefore, to the extent cases addressing the second requirement of article 18.01(c) involve inferences regarding the existence of property or items subject to search, we find them persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Generally, to support a search warrant for a computer, we have held there must be some evidence that a computer was directly involved in the crime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6839533\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/473/850/#p856\">\n    473 S.W.3d 850\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 856-57 (Tex.

Nothing in the record suggests that the incriminating surveillance video was playing at the time the search warrant was executed.

The hard drive was taken to police forensics for inspection to determine whether it was associated with criminal activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The fact that the computer hard drive appeared to be connected to a surveillance screen in the shop where the offenses took place was not enough to formulate a probable cause determination. No other facts or circumstances linked the computer hard drive to the charged offenses. Trial testimony of the officers who executed the warrant, Arnold and Hufstedler, may have established that the officers believed the computer hard drive contained a surveillance system and surveillance video was stored on the computer hard drive. It did not establish they believed the video stored would probably evidence the offenses (which had taken place two weeks prior to the search).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   At the first hearing on appellant's motion to suppress, Hufstedler testified on direct that his \"assumption was that [the computer hard drive at issue] was attached to a surveillance system.... My assumption was that the [hard drive] was recording or at one time been used to record video in the location.\" At trial, Arnold testified that he had reason to believe the hard drive contained surveillance and he \"hope[d]\" the surveillance would constitute evidence: \"we had reason to believe that [particular hard drive] was actually a surveillance system that was hopefully going to depict what video was collected in there.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The fact that officers seized two other computer hard drives even though they could not tell what those hard drives were being used for further undermines a probable\n   cause determination. Appellant's counsel questioned Hufstedler about the seizure of the other two computers:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   Q. And then why did you seize 2 and 3?

Although the State presented other compelling evidence of the scene on the highway and of complainant's injuries, none of this evidence showed appellant's involvement in the aggravated robbery and aggravated kidnapping of complainants.

The complainants had agreed to meet a person named \"Jerry\" at the specifically-described custom auto shop to conduct business. When the complainants arrived, several suspects grabbed them, tied them up, beat them, poured gasoline on them, and threatened to set them on fire. After stealing cash and other items from them, the suspects then forced the complainants into the back of a van at gunpoint and drove\n   away from the auto shop. The complainants jumped out of the van as it was moving, and the suspects shot them and continued to drive without stopping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   A witness reported that she observed the complainants lying injured on the side of a road with their hands tied and mouths duct-taped.

The affiant also believed surveillance equipment \"may be found\" there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Here, the affidavit established a sufficient nexus between criminal activity, the things to be seized, and the place to be searched.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bonds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7093476\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/403/867/#p873\">\n    403 S.W.3d at 873-74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Even the name of the business, \"Dreams Auto Customs,\" supports the inference that expensive custom equipment would be there. From these facts, a magistrate reasonably could have inferred that a business owner interested in obscuring the view into his windows and providing secure access to the building within which such property is housed also would have a security system in place, including surveillance equipment, and such surveillance equipment probably recorded evidence of the criminal activity occurring there.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Walker v.

Had appellant challenged whether the affidavit was sufficient to establish probable cause that the surveillance equipment is evidence that appellant committed the charged offense, then those cases would be applicable. But that is not the element appellant expressly placed at issue in this appeal. Instead, the majority is attempting to replace one element with another that has no relevance to the issue presented. Stated differently, to explain how the affidavit is purportedly not sufficient to establish probable cause that the surveillance equipment is located at the place to be searched, the majority seeks to support its position by arguing that authority from this court requires that the affidavit be sufficient to specifically establish probable cause that the surveillance equipment is evidence that appellant committed the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   The majority recognizes that a magistrate may rely on matters of common knowledge in finding probable cause as the magistrate may interpret an affidavit in a non-technical and common-sense manner. Surveillance systems have permeated nearly every aspect of society. It is not necessary to run a Westlaw search for confirmation of the vast presence of surveillance systems. One need only enter any store, restaurant, parking garage, or any other commercial property and look over head to note visible surveillance cameras.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   The magistrate could have inferred that a custom auto shop would have costly equipment and expensive vehicles belonging to the shop's customers. With valuable property located on its premises, it is a reasonable inference that the auto shop would take measures necessary to protect its business from theft or vandalism. Such measures included dark tinted glass in its front door and windows and a bay door that opened directly into the premises, and the magistrate could have inferred that the shop would take other actions to secure the property with a security system, which would include surveillance equipment to record any criminal activity occurring on the premises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   Deferring to all reasonable inferences the magistrate could have made, I would uphold the finding of probable cause, and affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   <strong>\n    DISSENTING OPINION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   John Donovan, Justice\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   Appellant raises a single issue on appeal-the denial of his motions to suppress video surveillance. The video surveillance was found on the hard drive of a computer that was seized from Dreams Auto Customs Shop, the business wherein the two\n   complainants were assaulted and from which they were kidnapped.
