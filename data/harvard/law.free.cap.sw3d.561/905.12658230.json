He was sentenced to five years' imprisonment, and was ordered to participate in a 120-day institutional treatment program pursuant to \u00a7 559.115.3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the Department of Corrections reported to the circuit court that Barac had successfully completed the 120-day program, the court denied Barac release on probation.

The circuit court sentenced Barac to five years' imprisonment, but ordered that he participate in an institutional\n   120-day program pursuant to \u00a7 559.115.3. We affirmed Barac's conviction on direct appeal in\n   <em>\n    State v. Barac\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12657756\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/558/126/\">\n    558 S.W.3d 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. App. W.D. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Barac was delivered to the Department of Corrections on November 27, 2017, and placed in an institutional treatment program. On February 23, 2018, the Department's Board of Probation and Parole submitted a report to the circuit court concerning Barac's participation in the treatment program. The report indicated that Barac had \"demonstrated satisfactory institutional adjustment,\" and had \"incurred no conduct violations.\" The report stated that Barac had shown \"progress in treatment engagement and motivation for change,\" had shown \"acceptable initiative and motivation at this point in his recovery,\" and had \"met the requirements for program completion.\" The report stated that \"[t]his is the NOTICE OF STATUTORY DISCHARGE,\" and that, \"[u]nless otherwise ordered by the Court, [Barac] will receive a statutory discharge on his 120th day from incarceration\" on March 27, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On the same day that the Department's report was filed, the circuit court entered an order denying Barac release on probation. The order states that \"[t]he above named defendant/offender has completed the 120 day program pursuant to 559.115 RSMo,\" but that \"[t]he Court has determined it would be an abuse of discretion to release and orders the execution of the sentence of 5 years.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Neither the court's order, nor the docket, indicate that the circuit court held a hearing before rejecting the Department of Corrections' recommendation and denying Barac probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On November 1, 2018, Barac filed a Petition for Writ of Mandamus in this Court, contending that the circuit court lacked authority to deny him release on probation, because the court had failed to hold a hearing within 120 days of his delivery to the Department of Corrections. Respondent filed Suggestions in Opposition to Barac's writ petition on November 17, 2018. We now issue our permanent writ of mandamus, ordering Barac's release.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Section 559.115.3, as amended effective January 1, 2017, provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The court may recommend placement of an offender in a department of corrections one hundred twenty-day program under this subsection or order such placement under subsection 4 of section 559.036.

The department shall report on the offender's participation in the program and may provide recommendations for terms and conditions of an offender's probation. The court shall then have the power to grant probation or order the execution of the offender's sentence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Respondent argues that the Department of Corrections' report in this case did\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   find that Barac had successfully completed the institutional treatment program, because the report expressed concern that Barac had sometimes minimized or denied his alcohol-abuse problems during his treatment. According to Respondent, because the Department of Corrections did not report Barac's successful completion of the program, the court's obligation to conduct a hearing before denying probation was never triggered. We disagree. Whatever reservations the report may have expressed when describing Barac's participation in the treatment program, the report unambiguously stated that it constituted a \"NOTICE OF STATUTORY DISCHARGE.\" The Department reported that Barac had \"met the requirements for program completion,\" and was entitled to \"a statutory discharge\" on March 27, 2018, \"[u]nless otherwise ordered by the Court.\" This is plainly a report of successful program completion within the meaning of \u00a7 559.115.3. Indeed, the circuit court's own order denying Barac probation notes that he \"ha[d] completed the 120 day program pursuant to 559.115 RSMo,\" but that the circuit court was refusing to follow the Department of Corrections' recommendation that he be released.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Under \u00a7 559.115.3, following the Department of Corrections' report that Barac had successfully completed the requirements of his 120-day program, the circuit court was required to hold a hearing within 120 days of Barac's delivery to the Department of Corrections if the court intended to reject the Department's recommendation that he be released on probation. Because the court failed to hold a hearing before the 120th day, \"the time to order execution of the sentence expired, and [Barac] is required to be released on probation.\"\n   <em>\n    Mertens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8475060\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/198/616/\">\n    198 S.W.3d at 618\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We issue a permanent writ in mandamus directing the circuit court to rescind its February 23, 2018 order denying Barac release on probation.

Supp. 2012, and note 4 below.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    Rule 84.24 provides that, after the filing of suggestions in opposition to a writ petition, an appellate court will ordinarily issue a preliminary writ, and the case will then proceed with the filing of a formal answer to the petition, and briefing by the parties. Rule 84.24(i) provides, however, that \"[w]henever in the judgment of the court the procedure heretofore required would defeat the purpose of the writ, the court may dispense with such portions of the procedure as is necessary in the interest of justice.\" Because the relevant facts and legal issues have been adequately presented by Barac's petition and Respondent's suggestions in opposition, and because Barac is presently incarcerated without statutory authority, we have determined in the interest of justice to proceed directly to issuance of a permanent writ in mandamus.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    Section 559.115.3 was amended in 2013. The amendment eliminated the earlier requirement that the circuit court find that release on probation \"constitutes an abuse of discretion.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 559.115.3, RSMo Cum. Supp. 2012. Instead, under the current statute, the circuit court need only find \"that probation is inappropriate.\" The 2013 amendment also specifies that the circuit court is required to hold a hearing \"within ninety to one hundred twenty days from the date the offender was delivered to the department of corrections,\" rather than within 90-to-120 days \"of the offender's sentencing,\" as required by the prior law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Despite these statutory amendments, the requirement that a circuit court hold a hearing before rejecting a Department of Corrections probation recommendation remains unchanged, and therefore\n    <em>\n     Mertens\n    </em>\n    and other cases interpreting the pre-2013 statute remain controlling here.\n    <em>\n     Lovelace\n    </em>\n    , 421 S.W.3d at 557 n.2 ;\n    <em>\n     Kizer\n    </em>\n    , 421 S.W.3d at 559 n.2.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
