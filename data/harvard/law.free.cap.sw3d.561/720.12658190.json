CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 51.014(a)(8) (West Supp. 2018). Alan Copeland and Ruth Culley sued the City of Merkel for breach of contract based on the City's alleged breach of the parties' \"Treated Wastewater Effluent Purchase Contract.\" The City filed a plea to the jurisdiction and a motion for summary judgment based on the City's claim of governmental immunity. The trial court denied the motion for summary judgment and the plea to the jurisdiction. We reverse and render.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Background Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The City owns and operates a wastewater treatment facility. That facility produces treated wastewater or \"effluent\" that, according to the contract, is suitable for release into natural waterways or for irrigation use. In 2011, the City contracted with Tin Cup Country Club, L.P., to sell treated effluent to Tin Cup \"for the sole purpose of irrigating\" Tin Cup's golf course. According to the terms of the contract, the City agreed to sell its wastewater\n   to Tin Cup and to establish a \"delivery line\" from its wastewater treatment plant that would transfer the water to Tin Cup's \"acceptance point.\" Tin Cup, in exchange, agreed to accept 100% of the City's treated wastewater and to pay the City $1.50 per 100,000 gallons delivered. The term of the contract was for twenty-five years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Appellees purchased Tin Cup and became successors in interest to the contract. For the next couple of years, the City provided Appellees with approximately 16 million gallons of treated wastewater, and Appellees paid the City in accordance with the contract. But in 2014, the City halted its transfer of water to Appellees on the basis that the water did not meet the minimum standards of quality set by the State of Texas. The contract was subject to the wastewater quality standards set by the State of Texas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Appellees sued the City for breach of contract. According to Appellees, the lack of water for irrigation forced them to transform the golf course from an 18-hole course to a 9-hole course, and membership and profits declined as a result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The City filed a plea to the jurisdiction and a motion for summary judgment asserting that it was immune from suit and that the City had not waived immunity to be sued. The City specifically asserted that it had engaged in a governmental function when it entered into the contract with Tin Cup. Appellees responded and argued that immunity did not apply because the City's sale of wastewater to Tin Cup represented a proprietary, rather than a governmental, function. Alternatively, Appellees asserted that the City waived its immunity, pursuant to the Texas Local Government Contract Claims Act,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   by entering into the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In three issues on appeal, the City asserts that it is immune from suit because (1) the contract involved the City's performance of a governmental function, (2) the contract is not subject to the Contract Claims Act, and (3) Appellees have not sought the type of damages for which immunity is waived by the Contract Claims Act. The City contends that, because it is immune from suit, the trial court erred by denying the City's plea to the jurisdiction and motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"A plea to the jurisdiction is a dilatory plea, the purpose of which is to defeat a cause of action without regard to whether the claims asserted have merit.\"\n   <em>\n    Bland Indep.

CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. \u00a7 101.0215(a) (9), (11), (32). The City notes that, under the regulatory authority of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, it must dispose of its treated wastewater from its wastewater treatment facility and that, by selling the treated wastewater to Tin Cup, it was disposing of its treated wastewater. Recently, but prior to\n   <em>\n    Wasson II\n   </em>\n   , the Amarillo Court of Appeals stated that the \"disposition of treated effluent from a wastewater treatment plant pursuant to a TCEQ permit is a governmental function.\"\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

(holding that City of Lubbock's sale of hay to the public was a governmental function because it was \"closely related to\" TCEQ-permitted activities, specifically the disposal of treated effluent and growing crops).

In other words, disposal of the treated wastewater was essential to the City's operation of its wastewater treatment facility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wasson II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12657886\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/559/142/#p146\">\n    559 S.W.3d at 152-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204838309\">\n    2018 WL 4838309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7. The City was performing a key governmental service by operating its wastewater treatment facility and disposing of the treated waste. Moreover, if the sale or delivery of reclaimed water by a local governmental entity were considered by the legislature to be a proprietary action, there would have been no need for the legislature to include the following definition in the Contract Claims Act: \"Contract subject to this subchapter means ... a written contract, including a right of first refusal, regarding the sale or delivery of not less than 1,000 acre-feet of reclaimed water by a local governmental entity intended for industrial use.\" LOC. GOV'T \u00a7 271.151(2)(B). For the above reasons, we conclude that the City exercised a governmental function when it contracted to dispose of its treated wastewater/effluent by sale.

Accordingly, we apply the law in effect at the time the contract was executed in 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In 2011, the definition of a \"contract subject to this subchapter\" included only the language now found in Section 271.151(2)(A) : \"a written contract stating the essential terms of the agreement for providing goods or services to the local governmental entity that is properly executed on behalf of the local governmental entity.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Act of May 20, 2005, 79th Leg., R.S., ch. 604, \u00a7 2, sec. 271.151,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20Tex.%20Gen.%20Laws%201548\">\n    2005 Tex. Gen. Laws 1548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1548 (codified at LOC. GOV'T \u00a7 271.151 );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   LOC. GOV'T \u00a7 271.151(2)(A). The parties agree that the contract does not fall within subsection (A). Appellees note that \"[t]he Contract was not intended to provide a 'service' to the City or the general public; it was intended to provide a service to Tin Cup.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We agree with the parties that the contract is not an \"agreement for providing goods or services to\" the City as provided for in Section 271.151(2)(A). There were no \"services\" being provided to the City by Appellees, and to the extent that any benefits may have been conferred on the City, those benefits were indirect and attenuated.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Berkman v. City of Keene\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7324411\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/311/523/#p527\">\n    311 S.W.3d 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 527 (Tex. App.-Waco 2009, pet. denied) (filing of an annexation petition in exchange for city furnishing water and sewer services was an \"indirect\" or \"attenuated\" benefit). The contract at issue here is not \"subject to\" the Contract Claims Act. Accordingly, we sustain the City's second issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In its third issue, the City asserts that, to the extent that its contract with Appellees is subject to the Contract Claims Act, the waiver of immunity is limited to certain damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LOC. GOV'T \u00a7 271.153. Because the contract at issue here is not subject to the Contract Claims Act, we need not address the merits of the City's third issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    This Court's Ruling\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We reverse the orders of the trial court, and we render judgment dismissing Appellees' suit against the City of Merkel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Willson, J., not participating.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20271.151\">\n     Tex.
