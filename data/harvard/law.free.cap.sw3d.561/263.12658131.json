Our judgment remains unchanged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Today we consider whether Dickinson Independent School District (\"DISD\") is entitled to judgment for breach of contract damages against Texas Windstorm Insurance Association (\"TWIA\") based on an appraisal award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   DISD sued TWIA in connection with TWIA's handling of DISD's Hurricane Ike claims. DISD alleged breach of contract and related claims. During the proceedings, TWIA invoked the insurance policy's appraisal provisions, and the resulting appraisal award totaled $10.8 million in damages. DISD amended its petition to abandon all claims except breach of contract and, based on the appraisal award, filed traditional motions for partial summary judgment on the elements of causation and damages. TWIA opposed the motions because, among other things, DISD had not conclusively proven that the alleged damages reflected in the appraisal award, or any portion of them, were caused by covered perils. The trial court granted both motions in DISD's favor. The case proceeded to trial and the sole question put to the jury was whether TWIA breached the policy by failing to pay the appraisal award, which the jury answered affirmatively. The trial court signed a final judgment against TWIA for $9,602,542.82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   TWIA challenges the trial court's judgment in the following issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   \u2022 In its first issue, TWIA challenges the orders granting partial summary judgment on causation and damages because DISD did not conclusively prove (or TWIA raised genuine issues of material fact) that DISD's alleged damages were caused by a named peril or covered by the TWIA policy. Further, TWIA asserts that DISD did not meet its burden to prove coverage at trial through expert testimony. As a remedy, TWIA requests rendition of judgment as a matter of law or remand for new trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \u2022 In its second issue, TWIA contends that the trial court reversibly erred in excluding TWIA's trial evidence supporting its affirmative defenses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \u2022 In issue three, TWIA urges that the trial court erred in submitting DISD's jury question and in refusing to submit TWIA's proposed question and instructions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \u2022 Finally, in its fourth issue, TWIA contends that legally insufficient evidence supports the jury's finding that TWIA breached the policy by not paying the appraisal award or that TWIA's failure to pay the award proximately caused the damages reflected in the judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   For the reasons explained below, we sustain TWIA's first issue in part and hold that the trial court erred in granting DISD's motions for partial summary judgment on causation and damages because DISD's evidence, including the appraisal award, did not conclusively prove whether and how much alleged loss was caused by a covered peril and otherwise subject to coverage under the policy terms and conditions. Having sustained this portion of TWIA's first issue, we further conclude that remand for further proceedings, as opposed to rendition of judgment, is the appropriate remedy under the present circumstances. Given our resolution of TWIA's first issue, reaching TWIA's remaining issues is not necessary to final disposition of this appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. R. App. P. 47.1. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court's judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   TWIA issued a windstorm and hail commercial policy of insurance to DISD, the named insured. The relevant policy period\n   was from September 1, 2008 to September 1, 2009. As to each covered property, the policy provided for two potential forms of coverage depending on whether a limit of liability for a particular form of coverage was shown in the declarations. The two forms of coverage were identified in the policy as \"COVERAGE A (Building)\" or \"COVERAGE B (Business Personal Property).\" The policy provided in relevant part\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   AGREEMENT\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   We will provide the insurance described in this policy in return for the premium and compliance with all applicable provisions of this policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   ***\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   COVERED CAUSES OF LOSS\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   We insure for direct physical loss to the covered property caused by windstorm or hail unless the loss is excluded in the Exclusions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   EXCLUSIONS\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The following exclusions apply to loss to covered property:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   1.

The two appraisers will choose a competent and independent umpire. If they\n   cannot agree upon an umpire within 15 days, you or we may request that the choice be made by a judge of a district court of a judicial district where the loss occurred. The two appraisers will then determine the amount of loss, stating separately the actual cash value and loss to each item.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   If the appraisers fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire.

Three days later, DISD notified TWIA of windstorm damage to several of its buildings. TWIA acknowledged DISD's claim and hired an adjuster to manage the claim. TWIA's adjuster and DISD personnel inspected DISD's campuses and documented the damage found. TWIA's adjuster verified damages exceeding policy deductibles on numerous insured structures and sent the documentation to DISD personnel for review. In December 2009, TWIA paid DISD $220,232.85 for these damages. DISD subsequently signed a proof of loss, reflecting the cash value of the claim, as well as depreciation that TWIA would pay upon completion of repairs. TWIA paid DISD recoverable depreciation of $8,667.80 in March 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In September 2011, DISD contacted TWIA concerning a roof on one of DISD's buildings. DISD had replaced the roof and sought reimbursement of $1,550,645.75 as additional damages caused by Hurricane Ike. TWIA paid $999,577.19 for this supplemental claim in October 2011 (DISD's \"Roof Claim\"), though apparently no documentation was provided establishing a wind-created opening on the roof. This amount did not include general contractor overhead and profit amounts. In March 2012, DISD provided a new sworn proof of loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The following September, DISD filed the instant lawsuit against TWIA. DISD claimed that TWIA breached its contract, violated the Texas Insurance Code, breached its duties of good faith and fair dealing, and committed fraud. Prior to filing suit, DISD did not notify TWIA of any additional losses it contended were covered under the policy. TWIA asserted a general denial and several affirmative defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   DISD demanded that TWIA pay $311,623.04 for overhead and profit related to DISD's Roof Claim, $292,942.12 in statutory interest, and $225,000 for attorney's and expert fees, for a total of $829,566.16.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, TWIA invoked the policy's appraisal clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   DISD designated Mark Domangue as its appraiser, and TWIA selected Jonathan Held. The trial court appointed former judge Donnie Ray Burgess as umpire over TWIA's objection. Initial appraisal inspections occurred between October 1 and October 9, 2013. By that time, DISD already had repaired, replaced, or sold some of the damaged property for which it claimed further compensation was due under the policy. Domangue provided Held his initial damages estimates in early June 2014. Held reciprocated two months later and also sent Domangue a comparison detailing the differences in their initial estimates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Held and Domangue met to review estimates. They agreed to some items and changes, but were unable to agree on an overall damages estimate. They were to exchange revised estimates for final review before meeting with Burgess. Domangue did not provide Held with his revised appraisal, but instead informed Held that the revisions were not \"significant\" and would not change his overall summary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Burgess inspected DISD's buildings in March 2015. Neither Held nor Domangue were present when Burgess inspected the buildings. Burgess, Held, and Domangue met in early April 2015 to review the appraisers' estimates. At this meeting, Held discovered that Domangue's revised estimates increased DISD's claim by $6 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Ultimately, Burgess and Domangue signed an appraisal award that totaled $10,815,967.43 (the \"Appraisal Award\"). Held did not sign the Appraisal Award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   After the Appraisal Award was issued, DISD filed several motions for partial summary judgment, including a no-evidence motion regarding TWIA's affirmative defenses to the Award, a traditional motion on causation or alternatively to exclude evidence of causation, a traditional motion on the amount of DISD's damages, and a traditional motion on DISD's breach of contract claim. The trial court denied DISD's motions on TWIA's affirmative defenses and DISD's contract claim. The relevant motions for purposes of this appeal are DISD's motions on causation and property damages. In both motions, DISD argued that the Appraisal Award conclusively established certain elements of DISD's breach of contract claim, namely the amount of damages caused by wind from Hurricane Ike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   TWIA filed responses to both motions, arguing that the Appraisal Award did not conclusively establish, or address, whether the damages identified therein were caused by a covered peril. TWIA also provided,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , evidence that DISD's alleged damages were caused by events other than covered perils. The trial court granted DISD's motions on causation and property damages less than a week before trial began.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   At a pretrial hearing, DISD argued that the court's summary judgment orders on causation and damages foreclosed all of TWIA's affirmative defenses, as well as any argument or evidence by TWIA at trial that any portion of the damages listed in the Appraisal Award were not covered by the policy. TWIA responded that, regardless of the partial summary judgment orders, it was entitled to introduce evidence supporting its affirmative defenses and that DISD still had \"to prove coverage.\" The trial court ruled that the summary judgment order on damages \"forecloses all affirmative defenses regarding the amount of damages.\" Similarly, the trial court ruled that \"the issue of causation is foreclosed given that there is an appraisal and the previous decisions made regarding this case.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Trial commenced after the pretrial hearing. Because DISD had nonsuited its extra-contractual claims pretrial, the only remaining disputed issue for the jury to determine was whether TWIA breached its insurance contract. After a five-day trial,\n   the jury was asked to decide a single issue: \"Did Texas Windstorm Insurance Association fail to comply with the agreement entitled Texas Windstorm Insurance Association Policy Windstorm and Hail?\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The jury answered, \"Yes.\" Based on the jury's verdict, DISD moved to enter judgment; TWIA opposed entry on various grounds. The trial court signed a final judgment in which it ordered that DISD recover from TWIA a total of $9,602,542.82, comprised of the following amounts: $8,193,168.85 for the Appraisal Award less prior payments, deductibles, and sales tax; $159,373.97 in interest on the award; and $1,250,000.00 in attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   TWIA timely moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or for a new trial. In its motions, TWIA asserted, in pertinent part, that no legally sufficient evidence supported causation or coverage. Additionally, TWIA argued that, because DISD had \"de-designated\" its only causation expert before the trial court ruled on DISD's summary judgment motion, DISD had not proved, and could not prove, that the Appraisal Award reflected only damages covered by the insurance policy. TWIA also challenged the trial court's striking of its affirmative defenses. TWIA's post-trial motions were overruled by operation of law, and this appeal timely followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In its first issue, TWIA claims that the trial court erred in granting partial summary judgment on causation and damages. As part of this issue, TWIA argues that DISD did not conclusively establish how much of DISD's alleged damages, if any, were caused by wind and covered by the policy because the Appraisal Award by itself fails to prove these contested issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Scope of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Before addressing whether DISD met its summary judgment burden, we consider the scope of evidence properly included within the summary judgment record on appeal. DISD relied on identical evidence to support both of its motions for partial summary judgment: (a) a copy of the TWIA policy, (b) the Appraisal Award, (c) TWIA's live answer, and (d) TWIA's letter invoking the appraisal process. After TWIA responded to DISD's motions, DISD filed various replies and supplements, which attached additional evidence. All of DISD's evidence other than the evidence attached to its initial motions was filed within twenty-one days of the summary judgment hearing, which generally is not timely absent leave of court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c). TWIA contends that DISD did not secure leave to file any evidence late and that the only exhibits properly before the trial court at the time it granted partial summary judgment were those attached to DISD's initial motions, including the Appraisal Award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Rule 166a requires a party seeking summary judgment to file and serve the motion and any supporting affidavits or evidence at least twenty-one days before the hearing on the motion.

If a party intends to use discovery products that have not been filed with the trial court clerk, that party must file an appendix containing the evidence or a \"notice containing specific references to the discovery,\" along with a statement of intent to use the specified discovery, within the applicable time frames.

DISD filed a reply to TWIA's response on July 16, attaching new exhibits in support of its motion, including deposition excerpts from Umpire Burgess. DISD did not file a motion for leave to file this evidence late. On July 21, TWIA filed a motion for leave to file a sur-reply, in which it objected to, and moved to strike, both DISD's late-filed reply and new evidence.

At the July 29 hearing, the trial court denied TWIA leave to file a sur-reply to DISD's reply and overruled TWIA's objection to DISD's reply. The trial court did not mention DISD's supplemental reply. The court signed separate orders granting both of DISD's motions on August 7. Each order, respectively, states in full: \"After considering Plaintiff DISD's Motion for Summary Judgment on Causation, the Court hereby orders that the motion is GRANTED\"; and \"After considering Plaintiff DISD's Motion for Summary Judgment on Property Damage, the Court hereby orders that the motion is GRANTED.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Nothing in our record reflects that DISD sought or obtained leave to file the evidence attached to its summary judgment reply or supplemental reply.

In its original and amended answers, TWIA alleged that DISD's claimed damages were caused by\n   non-covered events or perils. Five years had passed between Hurricane Ike and the appraisal inspections; during that period further weather conditions and ordinary wear and tear impacted the post-Ike condition of the DISD properties. The summary judgment record contains evidence raising genuine issues of material fact about the cause of the damage to DISD's buildings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, TWIA attached deposition testimony from the adjusters who inspected DISD's buildings in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Ike. Both stated that they had not seen any wind damage to many of the buildings included within the Appraisal Award's scope. DISD's representative, Ryan Boone, acknowledged that DISD had no documentation of any wind-created openings that had caused the interior damage to DISD's buildings reflected in the Appraisal Award. Boone also acknowledged that warranty work had been completed on a portion of a roof at one of the buildings reflected in the award, yet the award reflected compensation for damages to interior rooms under the portion of the roof that had been repaired pursuant to a warranty. Boone agreed that any such damages were not caused by Hurricane Ike winds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   TWIA also argued that the Appraisal Award included items for which DISD did not provide notice as the policy required. From this evidence, a factfinder reasonably could infer that at least some of the damages referenced in the Appraisal Award were not caused by Hurricane Ike windstorm or wind-driven openings, but instead by subsequent events, including later weather conditions that occurred in the five years following the storm's landfall.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Under the specific facts of this case, causation is a liability question for the court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The only causation evidence before\n   the trial court on summary judgment was the Appraisal Award itself. Adhering to the authority discussed above, we agree with TWIA that DISD's reliance on the Appraisal Award is insufficient to conclusively prove causation and damages. Standing alone, the Appraisal Award simply does not provide sufficient evidence from which a court may determine as a matter of law which Appraisal Award damages, if any, were caused by a covered peril.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, considering the evidence in\n   the light most favorable to TWIA and\n   resolving any doubts in TWIA's favor as the non-movant,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    W.

DISD did not meet this burden by either of its motions for partial summary judgment. Also, DISD did not meet this burden at trial-DISD was not tasked with it-because the trial court ruled that the partial summary judgment orders on causation and damages conclusively established the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   For these reasons, we sustain, in part, TWIA's first issue to the extent that TWIA seeks a reversal of the summary judgment orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Remand is the appropriate remedy.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Having sustained TWIA's first issue in part, we must consider the appropriate remedy. TWIA seeks a rendition of a take nothing judgment or, alternatively, a remand. In support of its request for rendition, TWIA argues that DISD did not satisfy its burden at trial to segregate covered from non-covered losses and, in all events, DISD could not have met its burden regardless of the partial summary judgment rulings because it lacked a causation expert. Specifically, TWIA contends that DISD not only failed to offer expert testimony on causation but the trial court would have been required to exclude any causation expert witness by DISD because DISD did not properly designate a causation expert witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   For several reasons, however, we conclude that a remand for new trial, not rendition of judgment, is the appropriate remedy. First, the evidence developed at trial was dependent on the court's partial summary judgment orders, which this court now has reversed. The trial court's interpretation of the summary judgment orders essentially relieved DISD from any burden to present trial evidence on the causation issue, so the trial court never reached the issue of whether DISD would be permitted to present expert witness testimony on that issue. Had the trial court denied summary judgment, the evidence presented well may have been different and potentially would have addressed all elements of DISD's claim and TWIA's defenses. TWIA says that DISD could not present the required expert testimony due to the lack of a proper designation or other procedural reasons. While we agree with TWIA that expert testimony is required under the unique facts of this case,\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   we decline to rule on whether the\n   trial court should have admitted DISD's expert testimony had it been offered because the matter was never reached.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Angleton v.

Because we are remanding for new trial, TWIA's defenses remain open for determination, as we have stated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In its third issue TWIA asserts that the trial court erred in submitting question number one because in it the trial court failed to properly instruct the jury on the law, and the court should have submitted the question and instruction proposed by TWIA, which mirrored the instructions approved in\n   <em>\n    League City v.

But TWIA's points are grounded on the state of the trial evidence that flowed from erroneous partial summary judgment orders. Though we agree with TWIA that DISD did not present evidence showing that the Appraisal Award falls within the policy terms and conditions and is otherwise covered under the insuring agreement, DISD was expressly relieved from that burden by the trial court's pretrial rulings based on the trial court's interpretation of the summary judgment orders.

On appeal, the association has challenged the first finding by arguing that the appraisal panel determines the amount of loss but not the amount of loss caused by wind damage. But, the association has not challenged the second finding.

In the Causation Motion, the District asserted the following grounds:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   (1) Appraisal clauses in Texas property-insurance policies provide a method to resolve disputes regarding a covered claim, and, if invoked, these clauses bind the parties to have the extent or amount of loss determined by appraisal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   (2) The Award determined that the \" 'amount of loss' - what was caused by windstorm and the cost to repair or replace such loss\" - was $10,815,967.43.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   (3) The Award is binding and enforceable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   (4) Because the binding and enforceable Award determined the amount of loss, TWIA is precluded from challenging the amount of loss.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   (5) Because the binding and enforceable Award determined the causation issue, TWIA is precluded from challenging the cause of the amount of loss.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   (6) A strong public policy favors enforcement of appraisal clauses.

In each response, TWIA sought to avoid enforcement of the Award by alleging grounds for setting aside the Award and asserting that the summary-judgment evidence raised a fact issue as to each of these grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <em>\n    The District's No-Evidence Motion and TWIA's Response\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The District filed a no-evidence motion for summary judgment in which it asserted that the Award is valid and enforceable and the burden is on TWIA to show that the Award should be set aside. The District argued that the trial court may disregard the Award only if TWIA proves one of the following: (1) lack of authority; (2) fraud, accident, or mistake; or (3) lack of substantial compliance with the terms of the contract (collectively, the \"Three Grounds\"). The District asserted that there is no evidence of each of the Three Grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   In its response to the no-evidence motion, TWIA asserted that the trial court should deny the motion because (1) an adequate time for discovery had not passed; (2) almost none of the discovery TWIA needed to respond to the motion had been provided or taken place, and (3) the summary-judgment evidence submitted by TWIA raised a fact issue as to each of the Three Grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <em>\n    The Trial Court's Three Summary-Judgment Orders\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   The trial court signed an order granting the Causation Motion and an order granting the Damages Motion, giving the District\n   the relief sought in each motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, in its order granting the Causation Motion, the trial court ruled as a matter of law that TWIA was precluded from challenging the determinations in the Award that the amount of loss is $10,815,967.43 and that this loss was caused by wind damage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Likewise, in its order granting the Damages Motion, the trial court determined as a matter of law that TWIA was precluded from challenging the finding in the Award that the amount of loss or the amount of property damage is $10,815,967.43 and that this loss was caused by wind damage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   On the same date (August 7, 2015), the trial court also denied the District's no-evidence motion for summary judgment, without specifying the reasons for its denial. On appeal, TWIA asserts in a conclusory manner that the only logical interpretation of the trial court's denial of the no-evidence motion on the same day that the court granted the Causation Motion and the Damages Motion is that the trial court intended for TWIA to proceed to trial on its affirmative defenses to enforcement of the Award. According to TWIA, if the trial court did not intend TWIA to try these defenses to the jury, the trial court would have granted the no-evidence motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Though the trial court signed a separate order on each of the three motions, the court signed the orders on the same day, and this court should construe these orders together.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In doing so, this court should consider the orders as a whole toward the end of harmonizing and giving effect to all the trial court has written.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   For the trial court to have granted the relief in the Causation Motion and the Damages Motion, the trial court would have to have concluded as a matter of law that (1) TWIA was precluded from challenging the finding in the Award that the amount of loss is $10,815,967.43 and that this loss was caused by wind damage; (2) TWIA was precluded from challenging the finding in the Award that the amount of loss or the amount of property damage is $10,815,967.43 and that this loss was caused by wind damage; and (3) the summary-judgment evidence did not raise a genuine fact issue as to any of the Three Grounds that TWIA had asserted in its response.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the trial court to have denied the District's no-evidence motion, the trial court could have concluded that (1) an adequate time for discovery had not passed; (2) almost none of the discovery TWIA needed to respond to the motion\n   had been provided or taken place, or (3) the summary-judgment evidence submitted by TWIA raised a fact issue as to each of the Three Grounds. TWIA did not assert either of the first two grounds in opposition to either the Causation Motion or the Damages Motion, which were traditional summary-judgment motions. Denying the no-evidence motion on either of the first two grounds would not conflict with the trial court's granting of the other two motions. Denying the no-evidence motion on the third ground would conflict with the granting of the Causation Motion and the Damages Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   TWIA asserts that the trial court's denial of the no-evidence motion means that the trial court must have found a fact issue as to the Three Grounds and that the trial court did not conclude there was no fact issue on the Three Grounds when the court granted the other two motions. But, to grant the other two motions, the trial court had to enforce the Award as a matter of law, and the trial court could not do so if it found a fact issue as to any of the Three Grounds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, if we were to construe the orders as including an implicit finding of a fact issue as to the Three Grounds, to be tried to the jury, that construction would vitiate the trial court's granting of the Causation Motion and the Damages Motion, and we would fail to harmonize and give effect to all the trial court wrote in the orders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Instead, this court should construe the orders as granting the relief requested in the Causation Motion and the Damages Motion and as denying the District's no-evidence motion only on the first two grounds TWIA asserted in opposition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   In doing so, the court would construe these trial court orders as a whole toward the end of harmonizing and giving effect to all of the trial court's writings - the trial court's orders granting the Causation Motion and the Damages Motion and its order denying the no-evidence motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <em>\n    The Jury Trial and the Final Judgment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   After a five-day trial, the trial court asked the jury to decide a single issue: \"Did Texas Windstorm Insurance Association fail to comply with the agreement entitled Texas Windstorm Insurance Association Policy Windstorm and Hail?\" The jury answered, \"Yes.\" Based on the jury's verdict, the District moved for rendition of judgment; TWIA opposed the motion on various grounds. The trial court signed a final judgment ordering that the District recover from TWIA actual damages of $8,193,168.85, plus prejudgment interest and attorney's fees. In rendering the final judgment the trial court relied upon the Award as setting the amount of damages resulting from TWIA's alleged breach of contract, and the trial court deducted from the amount in the Award \"prior payments, deductibles, and sales tax.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   <em>\n    TWIA's Appellate Complaints\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   In its first appellate issue, TWIA asserts that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment that the Award set the amount of the District's damages caused by the covered peril of wind. TWIA argues that the Award itself did not set the amount of damages caused by wind and that TWIA's summary-judgment evidence\n   did not contain expert testimony or any other evidence conclusively proving this amount. TWIA asserts three other appellate issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 38.1(i) requires an appellant's brief to contain a clear and concise argument for the contentions made, with appropriate citations to authorities and to the record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Courts must construe briefs \"reasonably yet liberally.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Still, courts require the appellant to put forth some specific argument and analysis showing that the record and law support the appellant's contentions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   TWIA has not briefed any challenge to the part of the summary-judgment orders in which the trial court determined as a matter of law that TWIA was precluded from challenging the determination in the Award that (1) the amount of loss is $10,815,967.43 and (2) the amount of property damage is $10,815,967.43. TWIA does not mention anything about these trial-court rulings, nor does TWIA present argument in support of the proposition that the trial court erred in granting this relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   By failing to brief any argument as to how the trial court erred in granting this relief, TWIA has waived its ability to obtain a reversal of these parts of the summary-judgment orders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the proper course would be for this court to reverse only the part of the summary-judgment orders addressing causation rather than reversing these two orders in their entirety.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doing so would not prevent TWIA from seeking reconsideration of these parts of the trial court's orders on remand. Although TWIA has not briefed any challenge to these parts of the summary-judgment orders, TWIA's arguments under its first issue regarding the causation issue suffice to show reversible error in the trial court's final judgment. Thus, in reversing the trial court's final judgment and remanding for further proceedings, this court should not conclude that the trial court erred in granting the parts of the Causation Motion and the parts of the Damages Motion that TWIA has not challenged on appeal. Because the majority does so, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-151\">\n    Chief Justice Frost would grant in part Dickinson Independent School District's Motion for Rehearing.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-152\">\n    We do not opine on the merits or applicability of any policy exclusions or terms, whether or not quoted in this opinion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-153\">\n    DISD also notified TWIA that DISD was in the process of selling one of its insured buildings and asked TWIA to expedite inspection of that property while it was still under DISD's control.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-154\">\n    Subsequently, TWIA filed a formal bill of exceptions that included evidence related to numerous \"affirmative and factual defenses\" that the trial court had ruled inadmissible, including evidence that the Appraisal Award did not accurately or reliably reflect covered windstorm damage that DISD sustained from Hurricane Ike, that the Appraisal Award did not segregate between covered and uncovered damage, and that appraisals generally, and this one specifically, lack the preclusive effect claimed by DISD and found by the court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-155\">\n    TWIA objected to this question and submitted its proposed charge to the trial court, which was refused.

Clearly, the appraised buildings were in a different condition in the days following the hurricane than they were in October 2013, when the appraisal inspections occurred, or in March 2015, when Umpire Burgess inspected the properties. Indisputably, DISD's insured structures were subject to additional wear and tear, deterioration, ordinary repairs (whether due to Ike's winds or other factors), maintenance, intervening weather events, and other subsequent events during those five to seven years. Parsing out the damages caused by Hurricane Ike's winds from those due to a myriad of other factors involves techniques unfamiliar to the ordinary person.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    Thus, we agree with TWIA that, to prove causation under the facts of this case, DISD was required to present expert testimony.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-173\">\n    TWIA contends that DISD lacks a causation expert because DISD effectively withdrew Mark Domangue as an expert. However, according to our record, DISD also designated expert Michael D.
