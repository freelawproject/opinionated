Accordingly, this Court's preliminary writ of prohibition is now made permanent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Following a jury trial, the movant in the underlying case, Tyrone Skinner was convicted and sentenced accordingly.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Skinner appealed, and Jeanette Wolpink of the appellate division of the Missouri Public Defender System (\"MPDS\") was appointed to represent him. Wolpink represented Skinner throughout his direct appeal, and his convictions and sentences were affirmed.\n   <em>\n    State v. Skinner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6784103\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/494/591/\">\n    494 S.W.3d 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. App. 2016). After Skinner's appeal was resolved, but before his amended post-conviction motion was filed, Wolpink left the MPDS and was hired by the PAO.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   When Wolpink joined the PAO, a screening process was implemented to ensure Wolpink would not participate in any cases in which she was involved while employed by the MPDS (or any case related to such cases). Specifically, the prosecuting attorney directed all assistant prosecuting attorneys to review their current cases to determine whether Wolpink had been previously involved. Once the cases in which Wolpink had been previously involved had been identified, the deputy prosecuting attorney sent an office-wide e-mail indicating no one was to have contact with Wolpink regarding those cases. This list of cases was updated as the office became aware of additional cases in which Wolpink was involved, or as new cases were filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In February 2017, Skinner's new counsel filed an amended post-conviction motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   When Robert Sauls of the PAO entered his appearance, Skinner filed a motion to disqualify the entire PAO alleging Wolpink was \"privy to attorney/client confidences and matters of trial strategy\" because she represented him in his direct appeal. Notably, however, Skinner's motion did not claim that the PAO's screening process was insufficient or that anyone at the PAO failed to comply with the screening process with respect to Skinner's case. Relator filed a response acknowledging Wolpink had a conflict which prohibited her from participating in Skinner's case but arguing there was no basis for imputing her conflict to the entire PAO and, therefore, the motion to disqualify should be overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After considering the parties' arguments, Respondent sustained Skinner's motion, disqualified the entire PAO, and appointed the Missouri Attorney General's Office (\"AGO\") to act in its place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A few days later, Relator filed a motion to set aside Respondent's disqualification order, and a hearing was held. Sauls was the only witness called at this hearing. He testified the screening process in place at the PAO prevented Wolpink from having contact with any individual working on a case in which she was previously involved (or any case related to such cases), including Skinner's post-conviction proceeding. After confirming he was lead counsel for the state on Skinner's case, Sauls stated he had not had contact with Wolpink regarding Skinner's case, nor did he have knowledge of any confidential information Wolpink may have learned in her capacity as Skinner's direct appeal counsel. Sauls also confirmed that, going forward under the screening process, he would have no contact with Wolpink regarding Skinner's case. Nevertheless, Respondent issued an order overruling Relator's motion to set aside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Thereafter, Relator sought a writ of prohibition in the court of appeals, and her petition was subsequently denied. Relator then sought the same relief in this Court, and a preliminary writ was issued. On September 6, 2018, oral argument was held and this case was submitted. A few days later, Respondent filed a motion to dismiss, claiming the preliminary writ should be dismissed based on a \"change of a major material fact,\" i.e., Wolpink was no long employed by the PAO.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On October 3, 2018, Respondent vacated his order disqualifying Relator from the underlying case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"The writ of prohibition, an extraordinary remedy, is to be used with great caution and forbearance and only in cases of extreme necessity.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Because Respondent's order disqualifying the elected prosecuting attorney and her entire office presents one of the uniquely limited situations in which a party will suffer \"absolute irreparable harm\" if writ relief is not granted, this Court's preliminary writ is now made permanent.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9989164\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/804/750/#p752\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court will first address Respondent's motion to dismiss. Although Respondent does not expressly claim mootness, that is, in essence, the basis on which Respondent argues this case should be dismissed. \"A case is moot when the question presented for decision seeks a judgment upon some matter which, if the judgment was rendered, would not have any practical effect upon any then existing controversy.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Hawley v. Heagney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12385573\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/523/447/#p450\">\n    523 S.W.3d 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 450 (Mo. banc 2017) (citation omitted). There are, however, two narrow exceptions to the mootness doctrine: (1) when a case becomes moot\n   after submission and argument,\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Donnell v. Searcy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1325951\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mo/347/1052/\">\n    347 Mo. 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1325951\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mo/347/1052/\">\n    152 S.W.2d 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 10 (Mo. banc 1941) ; and (2) when the issue raised is one of general public interest and importance, recurring in nature, and will otherwise evade appellate review,\n   <em>\n    Gurley v. Mo. Bd. of Private Investigator Examiners\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316053\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/361/406/#p414\">\n    361 S.W.3d 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 414 (Mo. banc 2012). If either of these exceptions exist, an appellate court may choose to exercise its discretion to decide the case, notwithstanding that it has become moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   This case was rendered moot when Respondent vacated the disqualification order on October 3, 2018, because, after that date, a decision by this Court \"would not have any practical effect upon any ... existing controversy.\"\n   <em>\n    Hawley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12385573\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/523/447/#p450\">\n    523 S.W.3d at 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But Respondent did not vacate his order until after this case was argued and submitted on September 6, 2018, and, therefore, the first exception applies. As a result, this Court \"will exercise its right of unlimited discretion to complete its deliberation of the case and prepare an opinion and enter a final judgment on the merits.\"\n   <em>\n    Donnell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1325951\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mo/347/1052/\">\n    152 S.W.2d at 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Proceeding to the merits, in\n   <em>\n    Lemasters,\n   </em>\n   this Court set forth the framework to be applied when the disqualification of an entire prosecutor's office is sought. First, the court must determine whether a particular attorney in the office has a conflict prohibiting\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     that\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   attorney's participation in the underlying case.\n   <em>\n    Lemasters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6878972\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/456/416/\">\n    456 S.W.3d at 420\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Rules of Professional Conduct aid the court in determining whether such a conflict exists.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Rule 4-1.7 \"Conflict of Interest: Current Clients;\" Rule 4-1.8 \"Conflict of Interest: Prohibited Transactions;\" Rule 4-1.9 \"Duties to Former Clients;\" and Rule 4-1.18 \"Duties to Prospective Client.\" Second, if (and only if) such a conflict exists, the court then must determine whether that individual attorney's conflict is to be imputed to the entire office.\n   <em>\n    Lemasters,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6878972\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/456/416/\">\n    456 S.W.3d at 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A conflict can be imputed in one of two ways: either (1) by the Rules of Professional Conduct,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   or (2) by the appearance of impropriety test - i.e., whether \"a reasonable person with knowledge of the facts would find an appearance of impropriety and doubt the fairness of the trial\" to the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6878972\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/456/416/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6878972\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/456/416/\">\n    at 422-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As in\n   <em>\n    Lemasters\n   </em>\n   - and unlike in\n   <em>\n    Gardner\n   </em>\n   - there is no debate here regarding whether an individual attorney had a conflict of interest prohibiting that attorney's participation in the underlying case. Wolpink plainly had a conflict prohibiting her from participating in Skinner's case in any way.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6878972\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/456/416/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6878972\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/456/416/\">\n    at 420\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, it next must be determined whether Wolpink's conflict of interest should be imputed to the entire PAO. Because the parties correctly agree Wolpink's conflict is not imputed to the entire PAO under the Rules of Professional Conduct,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court will only address whether Wolpink's conflict nevertheless should be imputed under the appearance of impropriety test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Application of the appearance of impropriety test conclusively shows that Wolpink's conflict should not be imputed to the entire PAO. The uncontroverted evidence shows the PAO implemented a \"thorough and effective screening process\" as required by\n   <em>\n    Lemasters\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6878972\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/456/416/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6878972\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/456/416/\">\n    at 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Notably, neither Respondent nor Skinner took issue with the scope or implementation of the screening process, and nothing in the evidence suggests anyone in the office failed to comply. To the contrary, the evidence shows Sauls, counsel for the state in Skinner's case, and Wolpink worked on separate floors and never had a single conversation about Skinner or his case. Sauls also testified he had no knowledge of any confidential information Wolpink may have obtained during her previous representation of Skinner. As a result, \"there are no facts that - if known to a reasonable person - would create an appearance of impropriety and cast doubt on the fairness of his trial\" to Skinner.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6878972\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/456/416/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6878972\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/456/416/\">\n    at 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Despite this Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Lemasters\n   </em>\n   and its application here, Respondent sustained Skinner's motion to disqualify, finding, \"Wolpink owes a duty of ongoing loyalty to Movant, her former client, and that duty is inconsistent with the duties of her current office.\" Although Respondent correctly found Wolpink had an individual conflict (albeit for the wrong reason),\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   the order wholly failed to address whether her individual conflict should be imputed to the entire PAO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Respondent did, however, address whether Wolpink's conflict should be imputed during the hearing on Relator's motion to set aside. During that hearing, Respondent explained the decision to disqualify\n   the entire PAO \"was simply [out of] an abundance of caution.\" He explained he did not \"see that there [was] a risk worth taking.\" Respondent also made clear he was not \"accusing anybody of acting improperly,\" but, rather, he was concerned that it was \"impossible to know what could happen and even though these screening practices are set up, it's impossible to say that there can't be some way in which there isn't an[ ] inadvertent disclosure, innocent as it may be, that could [a]ffect the case.\" In light of\n   <em>\n    Lemasters\n   </em>\n   , however, such vague and unsubstantiated reasons are insufficient to support disqualification of the entire PAO.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Moreover, contravention of\n   <em>\n    Lemasters\n   </em>\n   is not the sole basis on which the Court makes its preliminary writ permanent. Here, the writ must be made permanent because - as in\n   <em>\n    Gardner\n   </em>\n   - Respondent's order disqualifying the entire PAO will cause Relator to suffer \"absolute irreparable harm\" absent intervention by this Court.\n   <em>\n    Douglas Toyota III, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9989164\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/804/750/#p752\">\n    804 S.W.2d at 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The harm caused by Respondent's order is two-fold. As an initial matter, Respondent's order prevented Relator from exercising her statutorily authorized duties as the elected prosecuting attorney of Jackson County. And, in our legal system, this is no small intrusion.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   The unparalleled authority of the American prosecutor has often been attributed to the fact that district attorneys in the United States are elected, county-level officials. Prosecutorial power, in this view, is an outgrowth of the peculiar emphasis the United States places on local, democratic control. The \"locally elected status\" of American prosecuting attorneys provides them with an \"independent source of power\" and is the reason they enjoy \"discretionary privilege unmatched in the world.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   David Alan Sklansky,\n   <em>\n    The Nature and Function of Prosecutorial Power\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=106%20J.%20Crim.%20L.%20%26%20Criminology%20473\">\n    106 J.

First, as explained below, the people of Jackson County will be harmed if the individual elected to serve as their prosecuting attorney is not allowed to fulfill her statutorily authorized duty of representing the interests of the public in this case.
