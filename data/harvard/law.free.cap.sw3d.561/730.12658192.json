WYNNE, Associate Justice\n   Dereck Pelletier appeals from an order of the Lee County Circuit Court denying his petition for writ of habeas corpus. He argues on appeal that the circuit court erred in denying the petition because his convictions on thirty counts of distributing, possessing, or viewing matter depicting sexually explicit conduct involving a child violate the prohibition against double jeopardy. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   On August 14, 2012, appellant, who lived in Texas, sent an email with an attachment containing thirty photographs depicting child pornography to an undercover police officer in Faulkner County, Arkansas.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   He was charged in the Faulkner County Circuit Court with thirty counts of distributing, possessing, or viewing matter depicting sexually explicit conduct involving a child, in violation of Arkansas Code Annotated section 5-27-602 (Repl. 2013). Appellant and the State subsequently negotiated a plea agreement under which appellant would plead guilty to all thirty counts of violating section 5-27-602. In exchange, he would be sentenced to ten years' imprisonment on six of the counts to be served consecutively, with the sentences on the remaining counts to run concurrently, for a total of sixty years' imprisonment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant pled guilty, and he was sentenced in accordance with the negotiated plea agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Appellant filed a petition for writ of error coram nobis in the Faulkner County Circuit Court in June 2014. In the petition, he alleged that he had been illegally sentenced because he had committed only one illegal act. The circuit court denied the petition. On appeal, this court held that appellant's claim was not cognizable in a petition for writ of error coram nobis.\n   <em>\n    Pelletier v.

Appellant then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas. A federal magistrate determined that appellant's habeas petition was untimely. The magistrate's findings were adopted by the federal district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Appellant then filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the Lee County Circuit Court on October 23, 2017. In the petition, he alleges that his convictions on twenty-nine of the thirty counts violate double jeopardy because he sent only one email with one attachment. In an order entered on January 8, 2018, the circuit court found that there was not probable cause to issue a writ based on the face of the pleadings. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A writ of habeas corpus is proper when a judgment of conviction is invalid on its face or when a circuit court lacks jurisdiction over the cause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Noble v.

We disagree. This court has recognized that some claims of double jeopardy are cognizable in a habeas proceeding, as detention for an illegal period of time is precisely what a writ of habeas corpus is designed to correct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Quezada v.

The Supreme Court of the United States has stated that \"the question under the Double Jeopardy Clause whether punishments are multiple is essentially one of legislative intent.\"\n   <em>\n    Ohio v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203132\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/493/#p499\">\n    467 U.S. 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 499,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203132\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/493/#p499\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203132\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/493/#p499\">\n    81 L.Ed.2d 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984).

On appeal, the defendant argued that, under double jeopardy, the twenty counts were required to be reduced to one. This court rejected his argument, holding that because the legislature used the word \"any\" prior to listing the items covered under the statute and the items listed were singular, each photograph that the defendant possessed could support an individual charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In his brief, appellant recognizes the holding in\n   <em>\n    Rea\n   </em>\n   , but argues that he was charged with distributing matter under section 5-27-602(a)(1), while the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Rea\n   </em>\n   was charged with possession under section 5-27-602(a)(2), and that there is a distinction with a difference between possessing matter and distributing matter. According to appellant, the distinction lies in the fact that in distributing the matter he sent one email and hit the send button one time, as opposed to possessing multiple photographs, as in\n   <em>\n    Rea.\n   </em>\n   The operative term \"any\" is contained in subsection (a)(1) just as it is in subsection (a)(2). The media in subsection (a)(1) are listed singularly, as they are in subsection (a)(2). Further, there is nothing in the\n   <em>\n    Rea\n   </em>\n   opinion to indicate that the analysis or result was predicated on possession as distinct from the prohibited activities in subsection (a)(1). Instead, the analysis focuses on language that is shared between the two subsections. Appellant focuses on the means of distribution when our decision in\n   <em>\n    Rea\n   </em>\n   sets out that the legislature intended the number of offenses to be based on the number of photographs, not the activity undertaken with the photographs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Accordingly, for double-jeopardy purposes, there is no distinction between possession under section 5-27-602(a)(2) and the prohibited activities listed in section 5-27-602(a)(1). Each photograph that is distributed in violation of section 5-27-602(a)(1) can support a separate charge. Appellant does not dispute that the email he sent contained thirty separate photographs depicting children engaging in sexually explicit conduct. We reject appellant's argument that\n   <em>\n    Rea\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable on the basis that appellant was convicted of a violation of section 5-27-602(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Appellant also argues that twenty-nine of the thirty charges violate double jeopardy because he sent a single computer file in a single email. Although \"computer file\" is included in the list of media in section 5-27-602(a)(1), the fact that the thirty photographs were attached to the email in a single file is not relevant in this case. Appellant does not dispute that the email contained thirty separate photographs depicting children engaged in sexually explicit conduct. Consistent with the above interpretation of the statute, it is the number of photographs distributed, not\n   the manner of distribution, that gives rise to the number of permissible charges under section 5-27-602(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Here, a conviction for each photograph sent by appellant does not violate double jeopardy, as the number of charges brought against appellant was authorized by the legislature. Accordingly, the circuit court did not err by denying appellant's petition for writ of habeas corpus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    There is no indication in the record that any of the images were duplicates.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Pursuant to Arkansas Code Annotated section 5-27-602(b)(1), a first offense is classified as a C felony.

Each photograph that is distributed in violation of section 5-27-602(a)(1) can support a separate charge. Appellant does not dispute that the email he sent contained thirty separate photographs depicting children engaging in sexually explicit conduct. We reject appellant's argument that\n    <em>\n     Rea\n    </em>\n    is distinguishable on the basis that appellant was convicted of a violation of section 5-27-602(a)(1).\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    The most important aspect of Pelletier's claim, which the majority fails to address in its analysis and only nominally acknowledges at the beginning of its opinion, is that Pelletier was living in Texas when he executed the single click of the \"send\" button on his computer, which sent a single e-mail with a single attached file containing thirty images of child pornography to a single undercover police officer in Faulkner County, Arkansas. There is one single\n    <em>\n     actus reus\n    </em>\n    at issue here. This fact is significant because Pelletier was charged\n    with thirty counts of violating\n    <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ark.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%205-27-602\">\n     Ark.

Here, the question was not whether any explicit material was \"possessed,\" but whether it was \"transferred\" within the meaning of the prohibited activities listed in\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ark.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%205-27-602\">\n     Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 5-27-602\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(1) (Repl. 2013), and the only act that could even potentially constitute such a \"transfer\" directed to the State of Arkansas was Pelletier's single click of the \"send\" button on August 14, 2012. Even though we are addressing\n    <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ark.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%205-27-602\">\n     Ark.

Proving that Pelletier engaged in thirty individual violations of\n    <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ark.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%205-27-602\">\n     Ark.
