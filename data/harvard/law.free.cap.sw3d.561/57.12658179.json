Hess, Presiding Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Natasha Jordan (\"Appellant\") appeals the judgment of the circuit court of St. Louis County dismissing her claims under the Missouri Human Rights Act (\"MHRA\") for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Appellant alleged nine counts against Bi-State Development Agency of the Missouri-Illinois Metropolitan District (\"Bi-State\") and Lawrence Brew (\"Brew\") (collectively \"Respondents\") relating to discrimination on the bases of sex, disability, race, and retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Respondents moved to dismiss for failing to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The trial court granted the motion. This appeal follows. Bi-State is an interstate compact between Missouri and Illinois. As such, it is not subject to any burden unilaterally imposed on it by either State's law. When the Appellant's claims accrued the MHRA and Illinois Human Rights Act (\"IHRA\") had different burdens of proof. The MHRA imposed a burden on Bi-State that the IHRA does not. We are therefore constrained to affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Appellant is an African-American female employed as a bus driver for Bi-State from 2006 until April 2016 when she filed her petition in the circuit court. The petition alleges that Brew was her supervisor at different points in time during her employment with Bi-State, that he sexually harassed\n   her while he was her supervisor, and that he retaliated against her after she rejected his advances. The petition alleges that Brew retaliated by issuing disciplinary points against her and that he later issued Appellant disciplinary points whenever she took medical leave. Additionally, she alleges that Brew and other Bi-State supervisors arranged a disciplinary meeting in retaliation for the charges of discrimination she filed with the Missouri Commission on Human Rights (\"MCHR\"). She asserts she was not provided a union representative and that Caucasian employees received union representation during disciplinary hearings. The MCHR issued Appellant a notice of a right to sue and she subsequently filed her petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Respondents moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. They asserted that Bi-State is the creation of an interstate compact between Missouri and Illinois and that the MHRA would impose an impermissible unilateral burden on Bi-State. They argued that when Appellant filed her claim, the burden of proof under the MHRA was the \"contributing factor\" standard, a less stringent standard of proof for employment discrimination claims than the IHRA. Appellant argued the MHRA and IHRA were \"complementary or parallel laws\" and the MHRA placed no impermissible burden upon Bi-State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The circuit court granted the motion to dismiss. It adopted Bi-State's position that the IHRA and MHRA's different standards of proof were dispositive. The circuit court explained that courts generally interpret the IHRA to be practically identical to federal Title VII discrimination claims. Title VII and the IHRA employ a \"motivating factor\" standard, which is more stringent than the \"contributing factor\" standard employed under the MHRA at the time of Appellant's filing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court concluded that Respondents were therefore not subject to suit because the MHRA impermissibly imposed a unilateral burden on Bi-State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We review the dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

She argues in Point I the trial court erred in dismissing her petition because the MHRA and IHRA are complementary or parallel laws. She argues in Point II she exhausted her administrative remedies prior to filing her petition.

However, we find\n   <em>\n    Redbird\n   </em>\n   instructive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The MHRA and IHRA are similar on a general level, as both address employment discrimination and retaliation claims. But, as the trial court noted, under the IHRA, an employee must prove discrimination was the \"motivating factor\" in the challenged employment decision(s). When Appellant filed her petition, the standard for MHRA claims was whether discrimination was a \"contributing factor\" in the challenged employment decision(s).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Supreme Court of Missouri and Eight Circuit Court of Appeals case law support the proposition that liability under the contributing factor standard increased employer liability compared to the motivating factor standard.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Daugherty v. City of Maryland Heights\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8981114\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/231/814/#p818\">\n    231 S.W.3d 814\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 818-19 (Mo. banc 2007) (\"Missouri's discrimination safeguards under the MHRA ... are not identical to the [motivating factor standard] and can offer greater discrimination protection.\");\n   <em>\n    Wierman v.

Furthermore, as the circuit court noted in its judgment, if there was no difference between the pre- and post-amendment MHRA, the 2017 amendment would have been pointless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Appellant argues any impermissible unilateral burden imposed by the MHRA was \"offset\" by the IHRA's broad protections for sexual discrimination. Appellant's arguments are not persuasive. When the Appellant underscores the differences between the MHRA and IHRA it weighs against a finding that the statutes are \"parallel.\" Additionally, Appellant provides no authority for the \"offset\" proposition. Further, the broadening of potential liability introduced by the contributing factor standard belies the notion that the MHRA and IHRA are \"complementary.\" The contributing factor standard increased the risk of an employer incurring liability for employment discrimination in Missouri. It increased the burden placed on employers. The increased burden on employers cannot be deemed \"complementary\" because the IHRA had fixed a higher burden of proof for the same type of claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At oral argument, Appellant asserted the differences between motivating factor and contributing factor are not meaningful in a jury trial. Appellant's assertion is untenable, particularly when viewed in the light of the Eight Circuit's holding in\n   <em>\n    Wierman\n   </em>\n   and our Supreme Court's statements in\n   <em>\n    Daugherty\n   </em>\n   . With differing burdens of proof the MHRA and IHRA are not identical for all intents and purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Furthermore, in\n   <em>\n    Redbird\n   </em>\n   , the \"courts of each state\" were in \"accord as to the construction of their respective acts.\"\n   <em>\n    Redbird\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10003826\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/806/695/\">\n    806 S.W.2d at 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That judicial accord is not present in this case. Before\n   <em>\n    Daugherty\n   </em>\n   the burden of proof in Missouri was motivating factor.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    MidstateOil Co. v.
