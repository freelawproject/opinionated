We have reviewed the briefs of the parties and the record on appeal and conclude the court's factual findings and conclusions of law are not clearly erroneous. Rule 24.035(k). An extended opinion would have no precedential value. We have, however, provided a memorandum setting forth the reasons for our decision to the parties for their use only. We affirm the judgment pursuant to Missouri Rule of Civil Procedure 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-13\">\n    All rule references are to Mo. R. Crim.
