The Commission on Human Rights refused to investigate Naugles' complaint that the Department was discriminating against him on the basis of his disability by failing to provide handicap-accessible facilities at the prison. Naugles then filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in the Circuit Court of Cole County, to force the Commission to investigate his complaint. The court denied the writ, finding that the Commission lacked statutory authority over Naugles' claim because prisons are not \"places of public accommodation\" within the meaning of the Missouri Human Rights Act, \u00a7 213.010\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Naugles appeals. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Naugles is presently in the custody of the Department of Corrections. On July 7,\n   2016, he was transferred to the Western Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Care Center in St. Joseph. Naugles is paraplegic, and has had both of his feet amputated while he has been incarcerated. He is wheelchair-bound. Naugles alleged that the Correctional Center lacks handicap-accessible facilities for dining, worship, recreation, and education, and that he has accordingly been confined to the hospital wing of the facility, where he does not have access to the full range of services offered to able-bodied inmates. Prior to being transferred to St. Joseph, Naugles alleged that he was able to exercise and participate in daily activities at other Department facilities. Naugles alleged that, at the time his petition was filed, he had not been outdoors for almost a year. Naugles claimed that he and his attorney had made multiple requests to be transferred to a handicap-accessible facility, but that Department officials ignored those requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On December 15, 2016, Naugles filed an official Intake Questionnaire with the Commission on Human Rights, complaining that the Department of Corrections was discriminating against him based on his disability. On January 11, 2017, his attorney received a letter from the Commission, stating that the Commission \"does not have jurisdiction over institutional situations or court issues.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Naugles filed a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus against the Commission and its Executive Director, Dr. Alisa Warren, seeking an order directing the respondents to investigate his complaints of disability-based discrimination. The circuit court issued preliminary orders in mandamus directing the respondents to answer the petition. Following respondents' filing of an answer, and briefing and argument by the parties on the merits of Naugles' petition, the circuit court entered its judgment denying Naugles relief. The court concluded that, as with private parties, the MHRA only provides a remedy for discrimination by State entities in employment, housing, or places of public accommodation. The court also concluded that \"[p]risons are not places of public accommodation under the MHRA because the private nature of the prisons counteracts their public character.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Naugles appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Jurisdiction and Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"When a circuit court 'issues a preliminary order and a permanent writ later is denied, the proper remedy is an appeal.' \"\n   <em>\n    Curtis v.

In addition, the Department of Corrections is importantly different from the food vendor in\n   <em>\n    J.B. Vending\n   </em>\n   .

The inmates in the Department's prisons are involuntarily confined in those facilities, based on a judicial determination of their guilt for criminal offenses in violation of Missouri law. The Department has been ordered to confine those individuals for a specified period of time as a form of punishment, and to rehabilitate the inmates so that they can safely reenter society. A prison's inmates are not members of the general public, or even members of a subset of the general public, who have voluntarily chosen to patronize the Department's facilities. Notably, the Department provides housing\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   to persons with whom it has this special relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In addition, the Department does not \"invite the trade of the public\" in any\n   meaningful sense. To the contrary, a Missouri statute expressly provides that, with limited exceptions, \"no person shall be permitted to enter a correctional center except by special permission of the chief administrative officer of the facility, the division director, the department director or under such regulations as they shall prescribe.\" \u00a7 217.265.1. While the existence of the Department's prisons may be publicly available information, the Department does not \"invite\" anyone to enter those facilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   If anything, prisons are properly viewed as\n   <em>\n    the antithesis\n   </em>\n   of a \"place of public accommodation.\" Prisons are designed to separate and isolate offenders from the public, for the protection of the public; they are not \"public facilit[ies]\" within the meaning of the MHRA. As the Supreme Court of the United States emphasized when holding that the government could constitutionally impose restrictions on prison visitors,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   [t]he very object of imprisonment is confinement. Many of the liberties and privileges enjoyed by other citizens must be surrendered by the prisoner. An inmate does not retain rights inconsistent with proper incarceration. And ... freedom of association is among the rights least compatible with incarceration.

The question in this case is not, however, whether the Department of Corrections is a \"public entity\" (which it plainly appears to be), but instead whether the Correctional Center in which Naugles is housed is a \"place of public accommodation.\" As we have explained above, the \"public accommodation\" question is not answered simply by the fact that the facility is operated by a State agency.\n   <em>\n    Yeskey\n   </em>\n   does not address the question we face here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Vermont\n   <em>\n    Department of Corrections\n   </em>\n   case is distinguishable for similar reasons.

Government is public.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 459 \u00b6 23. The Vermont Supreme Court's analysis is inapplicable to the MHRA. As explained above, our statute quite clearly does not extend the prohibition on public-accommodation discrimination to\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     all\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   facilities operated by State agencies; the question raised by Naugles cannot be resolved merely by observing that the Department of Corrections is a public entity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Department of Corrections' prison facilities are \"not in fact open to the public,\" \u00a7 213.065.3, and those facilities are therefore not subject to the MHRA's prohibition of discrimination in \"places of public accommodation.\" Naugles' first Point is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In his second Point, Naugles argues that, whether or not the Correctional Center is a \"place of public accommodation,\" the State is prohibited from discriminating against him on the basis of his disability by virtue of \u00a7 213.070.1(3). We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Section 213.070 provides in relevant part that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   1.

The first two sentences of \u00a7 213.111.1 provide:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   If, after one hundred eighty days from the filing of a complaint alleging an unlawful discriminatory practice pursuant to section 213.055, 213.065 or 213.070 to the extent that the alleged violation of section 213.070 relates to or involves a violation of section 213.055 or 213.065, or subdivision (3) of subsection 1 of section 213.070 as it relates to employment and public accommodations, the commission has not completed its administrative processing and the person aggrieved so requests in writing, the commission shall issue to the person claiming to be aggrieved a letter indicating his or her right to bring a civil action within ninety days of such notice against the respondent named in the complaint. If, after the filing of a complaint pursuant to sections 213.040, 213.045, 213.050 and 213.070, to the extent that the alleged violation of section 213.070 relates to or involves a violation of sections 213.040, 213.045 and 213.050, or subdivision (3) of subsection 1 of section 213.070 as it relates to housing, and the person aggrieved so requests in writing, the commission shall issue to the person claiming to be aggrieved a letter indicating his or her right to bring a civil action within ninety days of such notice against the respondent named in the complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The quoted language contemplates that right to sue letters will be issued with respect to alleged violations of \u00a7 213.070.1(3)\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   if the underlying complaints relate to violations of \u00a7 213.055 (employment), \u00a7 213.065 (public accommodations), or \u00a7\u00a7 213.040, 213.045, or 213.050 (housing). The statute does not contemplate issuance of a right to sue letter alleging a violation of \u00a7 213.070.1(3)\n   <em>\n    unless\n   </em>\n   the complaint relates to employment, housing, or public accommodations, and therefore a complaining party would not have the ability to file a circuit court lawsuit invoking\n   \u00a7 213.070.1(3) unless it relates to one of those three spheres of activity. Thus, \u00a7 213.111.1 provides additional confirmation that \u00a7 213.070.1(3) does not extend the anti-discrimination mandate for State agencies beyond employment, housing, and public accommodations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Naugles' second Point is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The judgment of the circuit court, which denied Naugles' petition for writ of mandamus, is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   All concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Statutory citations refer to the 2016 edition of the Revised Statutes of Missouri, updated by the 2017 Supplement.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    After discussing the substantive merits of Naugles' claim and concluding that \"[p]risons are not places of public accommodation under the MHRA,\" the circuit court's judgment concludes by stating that \"[t]his Court denies the Relator's\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Preliminary\n     </em>\n    </em>\n    Writ of Mandamus and finds in favor of the Respondents.\" (Emphasis added.)
