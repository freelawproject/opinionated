In response, the Providers assert counterclaims and third-party claims alleging that the state and its contractor mismanaged the payment-approval process and misled the Providers regarding the requirements that the Texas Medicaid Program (the Program) imposes. The state filed a plea to the jurisdiction against the counterclaims and a motion to dismiss the third-party claims. The trial court granted both. The Providers filed this interlocutory appeal. We conclude that sovereign immunity bars the Providers' counterclaims against the state and that we lack interlocutory jurisdiction to address the trial court's dismissal of the Providers' third-party claims. We affirm the court of appeals' judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The facts giving rise to this dispute depend on whom you ask. According to the state, the Providers voluntarily agreed to participate in the Program by providing\n   orthodontic treatments to qualifying children in exchange for payments from the state at reduced Medicaid rates.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201396\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to 1396w-5 (authorizing each state to administer its own Medicaid program); TEX.

During the events that spurred this litigation, Xerox administered the prior-authorization program under a contract with the state. The state alleges that the Providers routinely submitted prior-authorization and post-treatment-payment requests that misrepresented the severity or nature of the patients' conditions, sought payments for services that were never provided, falsely claimed that licensed employees had provided the services, and in some cases, accepted kickbacks. At the same time, the state alleges, Xerox failed to properly review the Providers' prior-authorization requests and instead simply rubber-stamped them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state thus maintains that the Providers and Xerox committed independent frauds in violation of the Act, ultimately costing the state \"and its taxpayers millions of dollars.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Providers tell a different story. They deny knowingly submitting false prior-authorization or payment requests. Instead, they claim their requests and services complied with the Program's requirements as the state and Xerox explained and enforced those requirements. According to the Providers, the state permitted and even intended Xerox to approve as many treatments as possible. This instruction, the Providers say, was part of the state's plan to fend off additional liabilities in a series of long-running federal lawsuits related to allegations that the Program \"did not satisfy the requirements of federal law.\"\n   <em>\n    Frew ex rel.

This, the Providers say, led them to believe that the information they were submitting complied with the Program's requirements and established that their patients qualified for orthodontic services. But when reports of the state's exploding expenditures began to emerge, the Providers allege the state blamed them in an effort to avoid responsibility for its own actions, enrich itself, and limit its liability to the federal government for having mismanaged the Program. As a result, the\n   Providers say they are not responsible for improper requests, if any, and are not liable for any overpayments. To the contrary, urge the Providers, the state and Xerox are liable for all losses, expenses, and attorney's fees that the Providers have incurred as a result of the state's and Xerox's \"scheme.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The state's first step was to initiate administrative actions against various dentists-including the Providers-alleging they fraudulently obtained payments from the Program. An avalanche of legal proceedings involving the state, Xerox, and the Providers ensued. Throughout these proceedings, the state has sought to pursue its claims against Xerox and the Providers separately, while Xerox and the Providers have attempted, unsuccessfully, to join all of the claims in one proceeding. After the administrative-law judges ruled against the state in its administrative actions, the state filed this lawsuit against the Providers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In this suit, the state alleges that the Providers committed fraud in violation of the Act by submitting false prior-authorization and payment requests, seeking payments for services never rendered, misrepresenting the qualifications of those who provided orthodontic services, and, in some cases, accepting illegal kickbacks. The state argued that the trial court could enjoin the Providers from committing fraud.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. HUM. RES. CODE \u00a7 36.051(a) (authorizing injunctive relief).

The state alleges that each of the Providers is \"jointly and severally liable for the damages which arose either directly or indirectly, as a result of each [of the Providers'] unlawful acts.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    The Providers filed an answer generally denying the state's allegations. They also asserted counterclaims against the state for conspiracy, breach of contract, and conversion. The Providers seek \"proportional recovery of actual and exemplary damages, interest, court costs, and attorney's fees against the State.\" They allege that the state has waived its sovereign immunity as to the Providers' \"connected, germane, and defensive counterclaims\" and that it \"is liable up to those amounts plead[ed].\" The Providers also asserted third-party claims against Xerox, seeking damages and contribution for common-law fraud, breach of contract, promissory estoppel, negligent hiring, negligent supervision, negligence, and gross negligence. They allege the state and Xerox were responsible for authorizing the Providers' services and conspired to rubber-stamp the Providers' authorization and payment requests. The Providers say this conspiracy led them to continue using the same standards to establish medical necessity, making the state and Xerox liable for any payments for services that were not medically necessary.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    The state filed a plea to the jurisdiction against the Providers' counterclaims, asserting that sovereign immunity bars the counterclaims and that the Providers lack\n    standing to assert any claims under the Act or for breach of the contract between the state and Xerox. The state also filed a motion to dismiss the Providers' third-party claims against Xerox, arguing that the Act does not permit a defendant to assert third-party claims and that sovereign immunity bars such claims against a state contractor acting within the scope of its contractual authority. The trial court granted both motions, expressly holding that \"the state is entitled to bring this action against [the Providers] to the exclusion of other parties.\" The Providers filed an interlocutory appeal, and Xerox filed a brief supporting the Providers' appeal. The court of appeals affirmed the trial court's order dismissing the Providers' counterclaims.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12181643\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/497/169/#p171\">\n     497 S.W.3d 169\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 171 (Tex.

Contrary to the Providers' argument, we have never held that the\n    <em>\n     Reata\n    </em>\n    rule\n    <em>\n     always\n    </em>\n    applies when the government seeks any transfer of funds. And contrary to the state's suggestion, nor have we ever held that\n    <em>\n     Reata\n    </em>\n    applies\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    to compensatory damages. We hold neither today. Instead, we hold that the\n    <em>\n     Reata\n    </em>\n    rule-under which the state, by participating in certain litigation, steps outside the sphere of protection that common-law immunity from suit provides-\n    <em>\n     never\n    </em>\n    applies when the state initiates litigation to enforce a substantive prohibition against unlawful conduct by imposing a monetary penalty. Sovereign immunity protects the state from counterclaims that seek to offset a penalty. Several strands in our jurisprudence support this rule.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    First, \"offsets\" are never \"germane to, connected with, and properly defensive to\" whether a monetary penalty is due.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Reata\n    </em>\n    , 197 S.W.3d at 377. Penalties are inherently one-sided. Citizens cannot claim a penalty against the state, but the state can and does frequently assess fines, penalties, and sanctions against its citizens. Accordingly, a citizen seeking to offset a penalty must assert some other, non-penal source of the state's liability-a tort, a contract, etc. But in that situation, \"one claim has no connection with the other, and the two claims are entirely independent of each other.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Humble Oil\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10218138,2308395\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/169/707/\">\n     169 S.W.2d at 710\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Indeed,\n    <em>\n     Humble Oil\n    </em>\n    holds that taxes from one month are not \"dependent upon[ or] connected with\" taxes from another.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10218138,2308395\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/169/707/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    The same is true for penalties. When the state seeks to sanction primary conduct, a properly defensive response is that the conduct never occurred, or that it occurred to some lesser degree than the state alleges-not that the state cannot collect the penalty because the state itself owes some other, non-penal sum.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    In their conspiracy and breach-of-contract counterclaims, the Providers contend, essentially, that they should not be liable for their fraud because the state let them get away with it. This argument has nothing to do with whether the Providers violated the Act. They may have strong arguments that they did not, though we express no opinion on that point. Even under\n    <em>\n     Albert\n    </em>\n    's description of\n    <em>\n     Reata\n    </em>\n    's connectedness prong-that a counterclaim is \"germane\" if it is \"relevant to\" or \"would at least inferentially rebut\" the state's claim-the Providers' counterclaims have not connection with whether they violated the Act.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Albert\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7317084\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/354/368/#p372\">\n     354 S.W.3d at 375-77\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (discussing\n    <em>\n     Reata\n    </em>\n    , 197 S.W.3d at 377 ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Similarly, the Providers' conversion counterclaim cannot meet\n    <em>\n     Reata\n    </em>\n    's requirements. The Providers argue that the state has converted funds by holding money that is earmarked for services \"for which [the Providers] should be paid.\" The problem with this argument is that whether the\n    Providers \"should be paid\" is already one of the central issues in this case. That is, the conversion counterclaim is unavailable under\n    <em>\n     Reata\n    </em>\n    because it could never meet\n    <em>\n     Reata\n    </em>\n    's other predicate-offset.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    197 S.W.3d at 378. A merits victory for the state would vindicate the state's current payment hold. The held payments would stay with the state, so they could not function as an offset for the Providers. By contrast, a merits victory for the Providers would earn them the held payments. But a win for the Providers would mean that the Providers owe no penalties and so have no judgment to offset. Nor can\n    <em>\n     Reata\n    </em>\n    answer whether the Providers\n    <em>\n     presently\n    </em>\n    deserve to possess the funds while this litigation unfolds. Offset is a requirement under\n    <em>\n     Reata\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    , and there will be nothing for the held funds to offset until this litigation concludes in the state's favor (if it does so conclude), at which point the temporary payment hold will no longer be relevant. The state's victory would eliminate the\n    <em>\n     Reata\n    </em>\n    hurdle, but it would also conclusively destroy the conversion counterclaim's basis. So regardless of whether the Providers seek a permanent determination that they \"should be paid\" or a temporary determination that they \"should possess the payments\" while this suit is ongoing,\n    <em>\n     Reata\n    </em>\n    does not help them.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Second, safeguarding the treasury is one of sovereign immunity's primary justifications in the modern era.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Tex.

Hampering these entities' collections by abrogating their sovereign immunity injures the public fisc just as surely as allowing private citizens to sue them directly for damages. For example, under the Providers' view of\n    <em>\n     Reata\n    </em>\n    , any driver could assert a \"selective enforcement\" counterclaim to any speeding ticket. The driver could argue, as the Providers do here, that he thought his conduct was permissible because it went unpunished for several years. The driver might even argue that the police department and, for example, a toll-road operator, conspired to trick the driver into speeding as part of a scheme to boost tolls. Of course, such arguments would not be relevant to whether the offensive conduct actually occurred. But they would, if sovereign immunity did not protect governmental entities from their assertion, dramatically reduce entities' ability to collect revenue.

The Providers argue that, although\n    <em>\n     Reata\n    </em>\n    happened to involve tort claims for compensatory damages, our holding was not limited to those types of claims seeking that type of monetary relief. The court of appeals thus created a \"distinction that\n    <em>\n     Reata\n    </em>\n    neither contemplates nor supports.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    I agree with the Providers.

Admittedly, a word search for the term\n    \"damages\" reveals that we used the word thirteen times throughout the opinion, but the majority of the references are not relevant to the issue before us.\n    <footnotemark>\n     16\n    </footnotemark>\n    As relevant to the Court's analysis, we referred to the City's claim for \"damages\" four times in\n    <em>\n     Reata\n    </em>\n    , noting that the City had sued for damages and reasoning that the City's decision \"to file suit for damages encompassed a decision to leave its sphere of immunity from suit for claims against it which are germane to, connected with and properly defensive to claims the City asserts\"; that sovereign immunity did not apply to the subcontractor's counterclaims \"made against the City which were connected to, germane to, and properly defensive to the matters on which the City based its claim for damages\"; and that \"the City's assertion of claims for damages against Reata means that the City does not have immunity from Reata's claims to the limited extent we have explained.\" 197 S.W.3d at 377. We referred once to \"monetary damages,\" reasoning that, \"if the governmental entity interjects itself into or chooses to engage in litigation to assert affirmative claims for monetary damages, the entity will presumably have made a decision to expend resources to pay litigation costs.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 375.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    But our discussion and our holding in\n    <em>\n     Reata\n    </em>\n    utilized much broader terms. Addressing not just the City's claims but the principles underlying our holding, we referred twice to claims for \"monetary relief.\" First, we reasoned that \"where the governmental entity has joined into the litigation process by asserting its own affirmative claims for monetary relief, we see no ill befalling the governmental entity or hampering of its governmental functions by allowing adverse parties to assert, as an offset, claims germane to, connected with, and properly defensive to those asserted by the governmental entity.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 376-77. Second, we held that because \"the City asserted affirmative claims for monetary relief against Reata, the City does not have immunity from Reata's claims germane to, connected to, and properly defensive to claims asserted by the City, to the extent any recovery on those claims will offset any recovery by the City from Reata.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 378.

And, most broadly, we referred three times simply to the government's \"recovery.\" We reasoned that our holding would not disrupt the government's fiscal planning if \"the opposing party's claims can operate only as an offset to reduce the government's recovery.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 375. We further held that\n    immunity would still preclude jurisdiction over any counterclaim \"for damages against the City in excess of damages sufficient to offset the City's recovery.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 377. Finally, we concluded that the City did not have immunity \"to the extent any recovery on [the counterclaims] will offset any recovery by the City from Reata.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 378.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    We have since characterized\n    <em>\n     Reata\n    </em>\n    's holding by using the broader terms, explaining that governmental entities \"do not have immunity from offsetting claims germane to, connected to, and properly defensive to\n    <em>\n     monetary claims\n    </em>\n    by the entities.\"\n    <em>\n     Albert\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7317084\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/354/368/#p372\">\n     354 S.W.3d at 376\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added).\n    <footnotemark>\n     17\n    </footnotemark>\n    And more recently, we described\n    <em>\n     Reata\n    </em>\n    as holding that \"when a governmental entity asserts claims for\n    <em>\n     monetary relief\n    </em>\n    , immunity does not protect the entity against the defendant's counterclaims for monetary relief that are 'germane to, connected with, and properly defensive to' the government's claims.\"\n    <em>\n     Borunda\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12655756\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/540/548/#p550\">\n     540 S.W.3d at 549-50\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added) (quoting\n    <em>\n     Reata\n    </em>\n    , 197 S.W.3d at 376-77 ).

In other words, this is an issue of first impression, and it may just be, as the State and the Court suggest, that we used the broader terms merely as convenient references to the compensatory-damage relief the government was seeking in those cases, rather than to limit the State's immunity when it seeks any form of monetary recovery.

And here, the State is undeniably seeking monetary relief.

Regardless, the Court adopts the State's view that\n    <em>\n     Reata\n    </em>\n    does not apply here because the State is acting in its sovereign \"law-enforcement\" capacity. According to the Court,\n    <em>\n     Reata\n    </em>\n    \"\n    <em>\n     never\n    </em>\n    applies when the state initiates litigation to enforce a substantive prohibition against unlawful conduct by imposing a monetary penalty.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at 507. Because \"[p]enalties serve a law-enforcement function,\" the Court asserts, allowing \"spurious counterclaims\" would \"severely undermine their effectiveness\" and \"would interfere with the state's ability to enforce its laws.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 509.\n    <footnotemark>\n     18\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    The Court's law-enforcement rationale is unfounded. First, the State highlights that, when it acts in a law-enforcement capacity, it necessarily is not acting as an \"ordinary litigant\" as\n    <em>\n     Reata\n    </em>\n    requires. But the State's argument mischaracterizes our description of the government as an \"ordinary litigant\" in\n    <em>\n     Reata\n    </em>\n    . We used the term in explaining that once the government \"asserts affirmative claims for monetary recovery, [it] must participate in the litigation process as an ordinary litigant, save for the limitation that [it] continues to have immunity from affirmative damage claims against it for monetary relief exceeding amounts necessary to offset [its] claims.\"\n    <em>\n     Reata\n    </em>\n    , 197 S.W.3d at 377. We did not hold that the\n    <em>\n     Reata\n    </em>\n    rule applies\n    <em>\n     only if\n    </em>\n    the government is participating in litigation as an \"ordinary litigant\"; rather, we held that\n    <em>\n     when\n    </em>\n    the\n    <em>\n     Reata\n    </em>\n    rule applies the government must\n    <em>\n     participate as\n    </em>\n    an \"ordinary litigant.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    This is consistent with the well-recognized principle that our procedural and evidentiary rules apply to the State as they would to any other litigant when it appears in court.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v.

These references to the State as an \"ordinary litigant\" do not address the sovereign-immunity question of whether the State may be required to appear in court. Nothing in\n    <em>\n     Reata\n    </em>\n    's text or reasoning limits its application to cases in which the State appears as an \"ordinary litigant,\" as opposed to \"enforcement actions.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Reata\n    </em>\n    , 197 S.W.3d at 376 (discussing\n    <em>\n     Kinnear v.

The Court gives little guidance on how to determine whether the State is acting in a \"law-enforcement\" capacity as opposed to an \"ordinary litigant,\" other than to state that the exception applies \"when the state seeks to impose a monetary penalty to enforce a substantive prohibition against unlawful conduct\" and that \"action is punitive rather than compensatory.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at 510. But the Court's new rule obfuscates over a century of our sovereign immunity jurisprudence. As previously noted, our precedent before and after\n    <em>\n     Reata\n    </em>\n    unequivocally involved \"substantive\" claims, both statutory and under the common law, and many involved the imposition of \"penalties.\"\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Anderson, Clayton &amp; Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10234996,2304255\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/62/107/\">\n     62 S.W.2d at 110\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"[T]he jurisdiction of the court cannot afterwards be defeated by the state upon a plea that the cross-petitioners were seeking an injunction against the enforcement of a penal statute.\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    When any governmental body brings suit, it necessarily acts under its sovereign authority to police and enforce the laws of the State.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Reata\n    </em>\n    , 197 S.W.3d at 384 (Brister, J., concurring) (\"[W]hen governments bring suit, they must do so through agents who ultimately derive their authority from the Legislature .... But when they file suit on an affirmative claim, they must be doing so with legislative authorization. If the rule were otherwise, it is not clear how a government could ever assert its own claims.\"). The Court's decision today throws what has been a well-settled doctrine into limbo because almost any action brought by a governmental body arguably constitutes a \"law-enforcement\" action.\n    <footnotemark>\n     19\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    I see no principled basis for adopting the State's position that the Medicaid Fraud Act enables it to bring a specialized law-enforcement action that justifies an exception to the\n    <em>\n     Reata\n    </em>\n    rule. By participating in the federal Medicaid program and enacting the Act and its enabling regulations, the Legislature has already established a balanced statutory scheme for protecting the public against fraud. Under federal law, a state must have a \"Medicaid fraud control unit,\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(42)(B)(ii)(IV)(cc), which investigates program violations and can refer matters for criminal prosecution or \"to an appropriate State agency\" for other action,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201007.11\">\n     42 C.F.R. \u00a7 1007.11\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(3) (2018).

Likewise, the State could (and did) bring an administrative action for sanctions for the same alleged violations. The State was certainly entitled to pursue this civil action in lieu of its nonsuited administrative claims,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Albert\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7317084\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/354/368/#p372\">\n     354 S.W.3d at 375\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"Under litigation rules applicable to ordinary litigants ... the City was entitled to nonsuit its [claims].\"), but \"preventing all offsetting claims\" by creating a law-enforcement exception here \"looks less like sovereign immunity than sovereign inequity,\"\n    <em>\n     Reata\n    </em>\n    , 197 S.W.3d at 383 (Brister, J., concurring).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    <strong>\n     D.

Here, the State claims that the Providers committed unlawful acts by submitting prior-authorization and post-treatment-payment requests and then accepting payments even though the services they provided did not qualify for reimbursement under the Medicaid program. The Providers' breach of contract and conspiracy counterclaims are based on their allegations that the State had an independent duty to determine whether the patient qualified for the services, that the State (through and in conspiracy with its contractor, Xerox) failed to fulfill that duty, and that the Providers reasonably relied on the State's decisions when providing the services. And the Providers' conversion counterclaim is based on the State's continued retention of Medicaid funds under a payment hold initiated on the same allegations, same facts, and same defendants as the State's failed administrative cases.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    Unlike the Court, I conclude that the counterclaims are relevant and defensive to the State's claims. On the merits, the State must show that the Providers acted \"knowingly\" in undertaking the unlawful acts defined in the statute.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    TEX. HUM. RES. CODE \u00a7 36.002. The Providers allege that the State and Xerox conspired to mislead the Providers into believing that their requests complied with the Program's requirements. As the Providers frame their complaint, \"the State now seeks to recoup the payments that it made to the [Providers] after the [Providers] provided the very services the State had deemed to be medically necessary.\" (Footnote omitted). Thus, contrary to the Court's conclusion, the Providers' allegations, if true, negate the State's assertion that they knew the services submitted for reimbursement were not medically necessary, which is a material element of each of the State's claims. These allegations are clearly connected and relevant to the parties' claims, and if the Providers are correct, their counterclaims will rebut the allegations on which the State's claims are based.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v.

Applying the appropriate standard of review at this early stage in the proceedings, I must conclude that the Providers have met their burden of alleging facts overcoming the State's assertion of immunity.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    <strong>\n     III. Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    When we explained the limited scope of the government's immunity against counterclaims in\n    <em>\n     Reata\n    </em>\n    , we relied on the policies that justify the doctrine in the first instance. Because the\n    <em>\n     Reata\n    </em>\n    rule permits only germane and properly defensive counterclaims and permits relief only in the form of an offset against the government's monetary recovery, we concluded that it \"would be fundamentally unfair to allow a governmental entity to assert affirmative claims against a party while claiming it had immunity as to the party's claims against it.\" 197 S.W.3d at 375-76. For the reasons explained, I reach the same conclusion\n    here and would hold that the State is not entitled to dismissal of the Providers' counterclaims. Because the Court holds otherwise, I must respectfully express my dissent.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"1\">\n    <p id=\"p-130\">\n     <em>\n      State v.
