She raises nine points of error on appeal, including allegations that the trial court erroneously applied the law and the trial court's judgment was not supported by substantial evidence. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, we have instead provided a memorandum of law to the parties. Finding no error, we affirm. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
