The Lewises contend that, while Mason was in possession of the property, he authorized Respondents Harley Akin, Robert Wooley, and Chris Hidy to remove timber from the property. The Lewises asserted a claim for statutory trespass against Akin, Wooley, and Hidy under \u00a7 537.340,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   seeking to recover treble damages for the trees the Respondents had taken. The circuit court granted the Respondents' motion to dismiss, on the basis that the Lewises could not pursue a statutory trespass claim because they were not in possession of the property at the time the timber was removed. The Lewises appeal. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Lewises filed this action in the Circuit Court of Johnson County. They asserted a claim for statutory trespass under \u00a7 537.340 against Respondents Akin, Wooley and Hidy, as well as a claim for statutory waste under \u00a7 537.420 against defendant Mason. This appeal involves only the dismissal of the Lewises' statutory trespass claim against Hidy, Akin, and Wooley.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In their Petition, the Lewises alleged that they owned a tract of real estate in Warrensburg, and that Mason possessed the property pursuant to a Contract for Deed from January 2014 to December 2016. The Contract for Deed was attached to the Petition and incorporated by reference. Under the Contract for Deed, Mason agreed to purchase the property for a total purchase price of $145,000, with a $5,000 down payment, and the remaining balance of $140,000 to be paid in equal monthly installments over a twenty-year period. The Contract for Deed provided that the Lewises would deliver a warranty deed for the property to Mason \"[u]pon total payment of the purchase price and any and all late charges, and other amounts due\" to the Lewises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Paragraph 5 of the Contract for Deed, entitled \"Maintenance of Improvements,\" provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-15\">\n   All improvements on the property, including, but not limited to, buildings, trees or other improvements now on the premises, or hereafter made or placed thereon, shall be a part of the security for the performance of this contract and shall not be removed therefrom. Purchaser shall not commit, or suffer any other person to commit, any waste or damage to said premises or the appurtenances and shall keep the premises and all improvements in as good condition as they are now.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Lewises' Petition alleged in Count I that, \"at Mason's invitation and without the [Lewises'] consent or knowledge,\" the Respondents \"entered onto the Property and cut down and removed a number of trees,\" which had a fair market value in excess of $70,000. Pursuant to \u00a7 537.340.1, the Lewises prayed for judgment against Respondents for three times the value of the timber removed from the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Lewises' Petition also asserted a claim in Count II against Mason, for statutory waste under \u00a7 537.420. Count II alleged that Mason \"committed waste on the Property by inviting Defendants Akin, Wooley and Hidy to enter onto the Property and cut down and remove timber growing on the Property.\" The Petition alleged that the Lewises' damages from the waste\n   committed by Mason exceeded $70,000, and that the Lewises were entitled to recover three times that amount under \u00a7 537.420.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Hidy and Wooley filed answers to the Petition. Hidy also filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, or to dismiss for lack of standing. Hidy's motion argued that the Lewises lacked standing to pursue a statutory trespass action because they were not in actual or constructive possession of the property at the time of the alleged trespass. The trial court granted Hidy's motion. The court concluded that Hidy's argument applied equally to the Lewises' claims against Respondents Akin and Wooley, and it accordingly dismissed the Lewises' claims against all three Respondents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Mason failed to respond or enter his appearance, and the Lewises obtained a default judgment on their statutory waste claim against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Following the circuit court's entry of a final judgment disposing of the Lewises' claims, they filed this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Hidy's dispositive motion, on which the circuit court granted relief to all three Respondents, sought judgment on the pleadings, and dismissal for failure to state a claim and for lack of standing. While he invoked multiple procedural mechanisms, Hidy essentially made a single legal argument: that the Lewises could not prosecute a claim for statutory trespass because they were not in actual or constructive possession of the property at the time the Respondents removed timber from it.

They argue that, even though they were not in actual or constructive possession of the Warrensburg property at the time the Respondents cut down trees on the property, they were injured by the Respondents' actions, and could therefore prosecute a claim for statutory trespass.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   It is well-established that, in order to pursue a claim for\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     common-law\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   trespass under Missouri law, a plaintiff must plead and prove that the he or she was in possession of the property on which the trespass occurred.

App. E.D. 2014) (\"the central issue of a trespass action is violation of possession\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Lewises' Petition affirmatively alleged that \"Defendant Joe Mason ... possessed the property from on or about January 27, 2014, until on or about December 1, 2016, under a\n   <em>\n    Contract for Deed\n   </em>\n   entered into with the Plaintiffs.\" The Contract for Deed, which was attached to the Lewises' Petition, expressly provided that \"Purchaser [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Mason] shall take possession of the property and all improvements thereon on\n   <strong>\n    March 1, 2014\n   </strong>\n   and shall continue in the peaceful enjoyment of the property so long as all payments due under the terms of this contract are timely made.\" Therefore, under the allegations of the Lewises' Petition, their statutory trespass claim would fail if they were required to establish that they possessed the property at the time the timber was removed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Lewises argue that, although possession is required in order to pursue a\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     common-law\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   trespass claim, it is not required for a\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     statutory\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   trespass claim prosecuted under \u00a7 537.340. Section 537.340.1 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-30\">\n   If any person shall cut down, injure or destroy or carry away any tree placed or growing for use, shade or ornament, or any timber, rails or wood standing, being or growing on the land of any other person, ... the person so offending shall pay\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     to the party injured\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   treble the value of the things so injured, broken, destroyed or carried away, with costs. Any person filing a claim for damages pursuant to this section need not prove negligence or intent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (Emphasis added.) The Lewises argue that, under the statute, they were only required to establish that they were \"the party injured\" by the Respondents' actions; according to them, possession is not a requirement to pursue a claim under \u00a7 537.340.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Section 537.340.1 does not expressly provide that a cause of action for statutory trespass can be asserted only by the person in possession of property. But the statute has been interpreted, for more than 150 years, to require that a plaintiff have possession of the affected property in order to state a claim for statutory trespass. This principle has been stated in multiple decisions of the Missouri Supreme Court, which were are bound to follow pursuant to Article V, \u00a7 2 of the Missouri Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Thus, in\n   <em>\n    Cochran v.

The trespass statute at the time, ch.

Indeed, in one of these cases, the Court acknowledged that, \"while the action for treble damages may be a separate and distinct cause of action from the common-law action of trespass or trover,\n    <em>\n     the line of demarcation is fine, and they all belong to the same general classification\n    </em>\n    [.]\"\n    <em>\n     Hunter Land &amp; Dev.
