HOWARD, JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Missouri State Highway Patrol (the State) appeals the judgment of the Adair County Circuit Court. In its three points on appeal, the State complains the trial court erred in excluding one of its exhibits and in issuing a Judgment for Expungement. The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In October 2017, B.K. filed a Petition for Expungement of Arrest Record under section 610.122, RSMo. He sought to expunge his record of arrest for passing a bad check pursuant to section 570.120, RSMo. The arrest stemmed from an $18 check from October 2009 when B.K. was 19 years old. B.K. worried that the arrest could hinder his work as a financial advisor or hurt his chances of obtaining a series 7 and series 66 license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   B.K. did not remember the specific date of the arrest. He was asked at trial why he did not know the date of his arrest:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Q. Okay. One of the questions -- and this was one of the things that we had talked about. The actual date of the arrest, we were not able to include that in the petition. Why was that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   A. I, you know, I -- I don't recall. I believe it was -- I mean, I didn't really\n   get arrested, really. I mean, technically I did. What happened is, one of the deputies had actually just called me and said, \"Hey, did you know you have this case?\" And I'm like, \"No. Absolutely not. Why would I -- why would I have that?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   And so I just drove to the sheriff's office right then and there and just, you know, paid my fine. And I thought everything was -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Q. Well, when you say you paid your fine, you mean you paid the check and a service fee?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   A. Yeah. Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Q. Okay. And you don't recall what that exact date was?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   A. No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Q. And when you contacted the sheriff's office, they couldn't tell you when that exact date was, could they?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   A. Not that I recall.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   B.K. included in his petition the date a felony stealing case was filed pertaining to the bad check (August 27, 2010) as well as the date it was dismissed after he paid full restitution and fees (September 17, 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Missouri State Highway Patrol filed an answer objecting to B.K.'s petition on the grounds that B.K. had prior and subsequent misdemeanor convictions. The State claimed B.K. had four convictions for minor traffic violations from 2008, 2012, and 2015. The State argued these prevented B.K. from meeting the requirements for expungement under section 610.122.2(1). The State also argued that B.K. failed to comply with the pleading requirements for expungement because his petition did not include the date of the arrest for which expungement was sought.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The matter proceeded to a bench trial. Attorneys for B.K., the Adair County Prosecuting Attorney, and the Missouri State Highway Patrol appeared at the bench trial. During the trial, the State attempted to prove B.K.'s traffic offenses through documents printed from the Fine Collection Center (FCC). B.K. objected to the admission of the documents, arguing a lack of foundation since they were not authenticated in any way. The trial court conditionally admitted the documents, asking for both parties to submit authorities on the issue after the trial ended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In its judgment, the trial court found the following: B.K. was arrested for the offense of passing a bad check and a charge was filed on August 27, 2010 in Adair County. The charge was dismissed by the State on September 17, 2010. The arrest was based on false information, and there is no probable cause to believe that B.K. committed the offense. No charges will be pursued as a result of the arrest. B.K. did not receive a suspended imposition of sentence for the offense for which the arrest was made or for any offense related to the arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The trial court further found in its judgment: The State offered certain exhibits in evidence for the purpose of establishing that B.K. had been convicted of one or more misdemeanor traffic offenses. Those exhibits were conditionally admitted by the court pending review of relevant legal authorities regarding their admissibility. The exhibits were deemed inadmissible and were \"stricken from the evidentiary record, along with all testimony regarding the same.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The court concluded: The evidence did not establish that B.K. has any prior or subsequent misdemeanor or felony convictions. There is not a civil action pending relating to the arrest or records sought to be expunged. B.K. \"is eligible to have such arrest records expunged and it would be in the best interest of justice that expungement be ordered.\" The court ordered all records of B.K.'s arrest expunged and destroyed or blacked out. It further ordered\n   all records and files in the court to be confidential.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The State now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Appellate review of the circuit court's decision following bench trial is governed by\n   <em>\n    Murphy v.

The State argues that the FCC is a statewide automated record-keeping system and that it contains records of court proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The State's argument fails, however, because the FCC is not a court. They are defined separately in Rule 38.05. Moreover, the statutory scheme governing the\n   FCC makes a distinction between courts and the FCC. Section 476.385.3 describes the FCC as a \"centralized bureau.\" Rule 38.01 differentiates between \"courts\" and the \"violation bureau established pursuant to section 476.385.\" The FCC is an administrative or ministerial agency. Thus, records of the FCC are not records of court proceedings under section 490.130.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v.

The State says that B.K. does not qualify for expungement under section 610.122 because he has prior and subsequent misdemeanor convictions. In the first point, we found that the trial court did nor err in excluding the evidence proffered by the State to prove B.K. had prior or subsequent misdemeanor convictions. Given that no evidence of such convictions was admitted at trial, the State's second point is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    Point III\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In its third point on appeal, the State claims the trial court erred in issuing a Judgment for Expungement. It says B.K. failed to satisfy the requirements of section 610.123 because he failed to provide the date of the arrest he wanted expunged. The entirety of its argument in support of this point is contained in a single paragraph wherein the only authority cited is section 610.123. The State argues in its brief that B.K. \"failed to offer any exhibits or testimony at the hearing providing the date of the arrest.\" Given our standard of review, we disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In the light most favorable to the trial court's judgment, the evidence at trial established that a deputy called B.K. and told him about the case filed against him. It was filed on August 27, 2010. B.K. went to the Sheriff's office where he was arrested. This was after the case was filed. While at the Sheriff's office, B.K. learned he could get the case dismissed by paying restitution. He did so. The case was dismissed on September 17, 2012. Thus, B.K. was arrested sometime in the 22 days the case was pending. During oral argument, the State conceded that this range of dates includes the precise date of the arrest.
