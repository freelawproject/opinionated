Accordingly, this Court's preliminary writ of prohibition is now made permanent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In the underlying case, the defendant, Wendell Davis, is charged as a prior offender with unlawful use of a weapon, unlawful possession of a weapon, stealing a\n   firearm, resisting arrest, and tampering with a motor vehicle. The probable cause statement filed with the complaint indicates Officer A.F. resorted to the use of deadly force to apprehend Davis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, Officer A.F. was both a witness and a victim to the unlawful use of a weapon charge and the resisting arrest charge. When a prosecution involves the use of force by a victim (including police officer victims, such as Officer A.F.), it is Relator's policy to conduct an independent investigation of the victim's use of force.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The goal of Relator's investigation is to determine whether the victim was justified in using force and whether criminal charges should be filed against the victim. Sometime prior to January 2018, in accordance with this policy, Relator initiated an investigation into Officer A.F's use of force against Davis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Prior to Davis's preliminary hearing, counsel for Officer A.F. filed a motion to disqualify the CAO.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the motion, Officer A.F. argued Relator's independent investigation created an appearance of impropriety that would prejudice Officer A.F. unfairly. Officer A.F. claimed an appearance of impropriety existed because, through Officer A.F.'s contacts with the CAO as a witness, the CAO might become privy to information that could be used against Officer A.F. in the criminal investigation of his conduct. In short, Officer A.F. asserted, when the CAO elects to independently investigate police shootings, it ought to be disqualified from simultaneously prosecuting the underlying criminal case. Both Relator and Davis filed a motion to strike Officer A.F.'s motion to disqualify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following a hearing on these motions, Respondent entered an order disqualifying the CAO from prosecuting Davis's case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Respondent first noted the court had the \"inherent authority to supervise and regulate the conduct of attorneys who appear before it,\" which, Respondent claimed, included \"the authority to disqualify counsel.\" On the merits, Respondent reasoned \"a potential conflict of interest may arise when, during the prosecution of a specific criminal defendant, the prosecutor has motives or interests other than according the defendant in a pending case procedural justice.\" Respondent found Relator had not \"engaged in any misconduct\" and, instead, concluded there was an \"appearance of impropriety\" because the CAO was \"actively prosecuting the defendant while simultaneously reviewing the conduct of the\n   very officer upon whom [it was] relying to effectuate such prosecution.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Relator sought a writ of prohibition in the court of appeals, and her petition was denied. Relator then sought the same relief in this Court, and a preliminary writ was issued.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Prior to oral argument in this case, Relator informed the Court the review of Officer A.F.'s conduct had been completed and Relator had no intention of bringing charges against Officer A.F. regarding his use of force against Davis. In response, Respondent confirmed Officer A.F. was aware the investigation had been completed and that he would not be charged criminally. A few days later, on September 6, 2018, oral argument was held and this case was submitted. It was not until September 18, 2018, however, that Respondent vacated his order disqualifying the CAO from Davis's prosecution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"The writ of prohibition, an extraordinary remedy, is to be used with great caution and forbearance and only in cases of extreme necessity.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

A conflict can be imputed in one of two ways: either (1) by the Rules of Professional Conduct, or (2) by the appearance of impropriety test - i.e., whether \"a reasonable person with knowledge of the facts would find an appearance of impropriety and doubt the fairness of the trial\" to the defendant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6878972\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/456/416/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6878972\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/456/416/\">\n    at 422-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Peters-Baker\n   </em>\n   , 561 S.W.3d. at 385 (footnotes omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Problematically, here - and unlike in\n   <em>\n    Lemasters\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Peters-Baker\n   </em>\n   - there is no finding (or even an allegation) that any particular attorney employed by the CAO had a conflict prohibiting that attorney's participation in Davis's case. In fact, Davis does not seek disqualification of Relator or the CAO. Respondent found Relator had not \"engaged in any misconduct\" and acted to disqualify the CAO only because a \"potential conflict of interest\" existed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Absent\n   the existence of an individual conflict, however, a court need not proceed to determine whether that conflict should be imputed to the entire CAO, either under the Rules of Professional Conduct or the appearance of impropriety test set forth in\n   <em>\n    Lemasters\n   </em>\n   and applied in\n   <em>\n    Peters-Baker\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Under the framework of\n   <em>\n    Lemasters\n   </em>\n   , Respondent should have ceased the analysis when he was unable to identify any individual attorney at the CAO with an actual conflict of interest. Instead, Respondent continued the analysis first by explaining \"the prosecuting attorney must avoid even the appearance of impropriety\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and then finding such an \"appearance of impropriety\" existed because the CAO was \"actively prosecuting the defendant while simultaneously reviewing the conduct of the very officer upon whom [it is] relying to effectuate such prosecution.\" The conduct Respondent identified, however, does not constitute an appearance of impropriety as that phrase is generally understood in this context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The phrase \"appearance of impropriety,\" as it is used in the disqualification context, was recently addressed by this Court in\n   <em>\n    Lemasters\n   </em>\n   .

When Officer A.F. activated his lights and siren, the driver of the truck drove off recklessly. The truck later came to a stop, and the two occupants ran off on foot. Officer A.F. pursued Davis, who eventually stopped running and hid behind a car. At that point, Officer A.F. drew his gun and ordered Davis to get on the ground. Davis did not comply. Instead, Davis patted his leg as though he was sliding something down the leg of his pants. Davis then retrieved a gun from the ankle area of his pants and pointed it at Officer A.F. In response, Officer A.F. fired a shot, which struck Davis in the back.
