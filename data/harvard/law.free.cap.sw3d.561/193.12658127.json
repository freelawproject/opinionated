Abshire alleged that on November 19, 2012, Abshire went to Christus with sharp pain in her chest and back, and she was admitted to the hospital by Dr. Fasullo. Abshire was then discharged home with pain medication and that the\n   medical history taken at Christus \"fail[ed] to note her long standing diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta [ ]\" (OI). According to Abshire, \"[o]steogenesis imperfecta predisposes the patient to fractures.\" Abshire returned to Christus on November 22, 2012, and she was admitted for chest pain and breathing difficulty, and then discharged home. Abshire contends that on November 30, 2012, Abshire returned to Christus where Dr. Marchand admitted her for worsening symptoms. According to Abshire, Abshire's medical records contain a note that she has a twenty-year history of treatment for OI but Abshire contends that her spine was not evaluated or stabilized during the November 30th hospital visit. According to the Original Petition, Abshire was transferred to HealthSouth on December 3, 2012, where she was \"started [ ] on a physical therapy program without recognizing the fragility of her condition.\" Abshire alleges that on December 6, 2012, Abshire was diagnosed with a compression fracture and underwent emergency surgery, but she emerged from surgery as a paraplegic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In her petition, Abshire made the following allegations as to Christus:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Specifically, the health care professionals at Christus Hospital St. Elizabeth Hospital who attended the patient failed to recognize the signs and symptoms of a spinal compression fracture resulting in a delay in treatment which caused Ms. Abshire's paraplegia. They also missed the history of osteogenesis imperfecta that predisposes one to fractures.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   With respect to her claims against Dr. Fasullo and Dr. Marchand, who are not parties to this appeal, Abshire pleaded the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Specifically Doctors Fasullo and Marchand failed to conduct a thorough medical history, examine the patient's medical records, evaluate the patient properly for her spinal symptoms, failed [to] recognize the implications of osteogenesis imperfecta, and failed to stabilize her spine.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As to her claim against HealthSouth, Abshire pleaded as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The health care professionals at Healthsouth Rehabilitation Hospital of Beaumont failed to evaluate the patient properly for her spinal symptoms, failed to consult the medical records and recognize the implications of osteogenesis imperfecta, failed to stabilize her spine and, started her on a physical therapy program without recognizing the fragility of her condition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   With respect to all defendants, Abshire made the following general allegations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants failed to exercise the requisite degree of skill and care ordinarily exercised by any careful, prudent physician, resident, intern, representative, employee or agent in the same or similar circumstances, and thereby was negligent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Each of the acts and/or omissions of the Defendants, as alleged herein, but not necessarily limited thereto, singularly or in combination with others, constituted negligence and proximately caused the resulting [ ] injuries and damages suffered by Plaintiff.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   As a result of these actions, singular or in combination, Plaintiff Sue Abshire suffered severe personal injuries and damages for which she now sues.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On February 25, 2015, HealthSouth filed an answer and denied the allegations. On February 28, 2015, Christus filed an answer\n   and also denied the allegations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Dr. Rushing's June Report\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On or about June 23, 2015, Abshire produced a report and curriculum vitae (CV) from Lige B. Rushing, M.D. (Dr. Rushing or Rushing). In the June Report, Dr. Rushing stated that he received his M.D. degree from Baylor University College of Medicine, and interned at Harris Hospital in Fort Worth, Texas. Rushing also has a Master of Science degree in medicine from the University of Minnesota, and he received \"specialty training in internal medicine and rheumatology\" at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. According to the June Report and CV, Dr. Rushing is board-certified in internal medicine, rheumatology, and geriatrics, and he continues to actively practice these specialties. Rushing is on the attending staff of the Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, Texas. Rushing's June Report included the following statement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   In the regular course of my medical practice I have [had] occasion to diagnose and treat patients with osteogenesis imperfect[a]. This is a rare genetic condition, however, during the course of my career I have provided primary medical care to two patients with this condition and based on my training as a rheumatologist, I am trained to recognize, diagnose, and treat patients with this condition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In summarizing the records of Abshire's treatment that he reviewed, Dr. Rushing stated in his June Report that, although Abshire was treated at Christus on November 19, 20, 22, 23, and 29 of 2012, her history of OI was noted in the records only on November 22 and 23. According to Rushing, Abshire presented at Christus on December 3, 2012, \"complaining of pain in her back and stated that she wished to go to a rehabilitation center because she could not walk at home and needed help.\" Rushing indicated in his June Report that Abshire was transferred to HealthSouth on December 3, 2012, where Dr. Smith evaluated her, and the following day Abshire \"complained of electrical voltage shooting down her shoulders, back, and legs\" when she was sitting or when she was moved, and she also reported loss of bowel and bladder control.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Rushing, Dr. Smith's \"plan was to have cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine non contrast MRI studies performed.\" Dr. Rushing stated that \"instead of stabilizing Ms. Abshire's fragile spine, it was recommended that she continue a 3 hour per day, 5+ day per week therapy program starting immediately.\" Rushing's June Report also noted Abshire's records reflect that on November 29, December 1, and December 2, she had a history of \"psychiatric disturbances[ ]\" and schizophrenia and that she received a diagnosis of schizophrenia at Christus on November 30 and on December 2. Dr. Rushing wrote that it appeared that Abshire had a psychiatric disorder \"which could be a somatization type disorder,\" but that acute neurologic injury should have also been considered as accounting for Abshire's symptoms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Dr. Rushing's June Report stated that Abshire was transferred back to Christus on December 5, 2012, where a physician \"medically cleared\" her and notified Dr.\n   Smith that Abshire would be returning to HealthSouth. Dr. Smith then ordered Abshire to be routed to Baptist Beaumont Hospital Emergency Room (Baptist Hospital). An MRI was performed at Baptist Hospital, Abshire was then transferred to Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston, and she was diagnosed with \"a Compression Fracture of T-5 with loss of motor function to lower extremities.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   According to Rushing's June Report, the standard of care required Christus to: (1) evaluate the cause of Abshire's pain, (2) examine her back for musculoskeletal problems, (3) consider her relevant prior medical history, (4) recognize signs and symptoms indicating a compromise of the musculoskeletal system in Abshire's neck, shoulders, and back, and (5) institute early stabilization of the spine prior to the establishment of paraplegia. The standard of care for HealthSouth required it to \"properly evaluate and assess Ms. Abshire before admission and prior to physical therapy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Dr. Rushing opined that Christus breached the applicable standard of care in the following ways: (1) failure to evaluate the cause of Abshire's chest, back, and neck pain, (2) failure to examine Abshire's back for musculoskeletal problems, (3) failure to consider Abshire's prior medical history and her \"longstanding\" diagnosis of OI, (4) failure to recognize the signs and symptoms indicating a compromise of the musculoskeletal system in the neck, shoulders, and back, and (5) failure to institute early stabilization of the spine prior to the development of paraplegia. Dr. Rushing addressed causation as to Christus as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   The harm/injury that resulted from the substandard care provided by the Defendant Christus ... was the exacerbation of an undiagnosed vertebral fracture that lead [sic] to a spinal cord injury resulting in paraplegia and bowel and bladder incontinence. Had Defendant Christus ... followed the Standard of Care for patients with OI, Ms. Abshire in medical probability would not have developed paraplegia and bowel and bladder incontinence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   According to Rushing, appropriate assessment would have detected the vertebral fracture and spinal cord injury and Christus's breach of the standard of care \"in medical probability caused the eventual loss of bladder and bowel function and paralysis in both legs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Dr. Rushing's June Report concluded that HealthSouth should have but did not properly evaluate and assess Abshire before admission and before beginning physical therapy, that HealthSouth's screener failed to properly assess Abshire, and that HealthSouth \"accepted a patient they never should have accepted.\" According to Rushing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   The harm/injury that resulted from the substandard care provided by the Defendant [HealthSouth] ... was the exacerbation of an undiagnosed vertebral fracture and spinal cord injury. Had Defendant [HealthSouth] ... followed the Standard of Care for patients with OI and a spinal cord injury, Ms. Abshire in medical probability would not have developed paraplegia and bowel and bladder incontinence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In his report, Dr. Rushing also included the following description of OI and certain symptoms of OI that he concluded Abshire had manifested:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is an inherited connective tissue disorder with many phenotypic presentations. It is often called \"brittle bone disease.\" Severely affected patients suffer multiple fractures with minimal or no trauma, and infants with the worst form of OI die in the perinatal period. Mild forms of OI\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   may manifest with only premature osteoporosis or severe postmenopausal bone mineral loss.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Osteogenesis imperfecta is a disease of the mesodermal tissues with abnormal or deficient collagen that has been shown in bone, skin, sclera, and dentin. The so-called diagnostic triad of blue sclera, dentinogenesis imperfecta, and generalized osteoporosis in a patient with multiple fractures or bowing of the long bones usually is used clinically. Osteogenesis imperfecta congenita is characterized at birth by multiple fractures, bowing of the long bones, short extremities, and generalized osteoporosis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   People with this condition have bones that fracture easily, loose joints and muscle weakness, blue sclera, tendency toward spinal curvature, and bone deformity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Ms. Abshire had the common signs and symptoms of Osteogenesis Imperfecta including bi-lateral ankle deformity which was most likely a result of the bowing of the long bones in her legs, and blue sclera.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   There is no cure for osteogenesis imperfecta. Treatment involves supportive therapy to decrease the number of fractures and disabilities, help with independent living and maintain overall health.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    HealthSouth's Objections to Dr. Rushing's June Report\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On July 14, 2015, HealthSouth filed objections to Dr. Rushing's June Report and a motion to dismiss. According to HealthSouth, Dr. Rushing's report was conclusory as to the standard of care and breach, it failed to articulate a standard of care for a rehabilitation hospital and its nonphysician healthcare providers (including admissions, physical therapists, and nurses), and it failed to articulate what HealthSouth's personnel should have done differently. HealthSouth argued that the report was conclusory as to causation, and that it did not adequately link the alleged deviations of the standard of care by HealthSouth to Abshire's injuries. Finally, HealthSouth argued that Dr. Rushing did not show he was qualified to address the standard of care for a rehabilitation hospital and its non-physician workers, to provide an opinion as to the causation of a spinal injury, or to opine as to how HealthSouth's alleged deviation from the applicable standard of care caused or exacerbated Abshire's spinal injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    Christus's Objections to Dr. Rushing's June Report\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On July 14, 2015, Christus filed objections to Dr. Rushing's June Report. Christus argued that the report \"fails to adequately establish the standard(s) of care applicable to Defendant, the manner in which Defendant breached any alleged standard(s) of care and/or the causal link between Defendant's alleged misconduct and the injuries of Ms. Abshire.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On September 9, 2015, Christus separately filed a motion to dismiss. Therein, Christus argued that (1) because only a physician may diagnose and treat, Christus cannot be liable for failures regarding diagnosis or treatment, (2) Dr. Rushing's report failed \"to state in factual terms what [Christus] did or failed to do that led to [Abshire's] injuries and\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   this conduct or failure to act resulted in the injuries[,]\" and (3) Dr. Rushing had not shown he was qualified to offer opinions in neurology, neurosurgery or spinal cord injuries, \"which is exactly what he offers in his report.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Response to the Objections to the June Report\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On October 12, 2015, Abshire filed a response to HealthSouth's objections and motion to dismiss. Therein, Abshire argued\n   that Rushing's report was adequate. Abshire argued that Dr. Rushing's opinion as to causation was not conclusory and that it was supported by facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   On October 12, 2015, Plaintiff also filed a response to Christus's objections and motion to dismiss. In her response to Christus, Abshire argued that Dr. Rushing had stated in his report that the hospital staff failed to note Abshire's history of OI, which was \"a clear indication of failure to properly document on the part of the hospital staff.\" Abshire also asserted that Rushing's report adequately addressed causation and explained that her complaints should have been investigated by means of CT or MRI imaging. Abshire maintained that Dr. Rushing was qualified to render a Chapter 74 expert report and that \"[n]ot one breach of the standard of care alleged by plaintiff implicates the specialties of neurology, neurosurgery, or spinal cord injury care.\" Abshire also noted that the objections Christus included in its motion to dismiss (filed on September 9) were untimely and, if the trial court found the report insufficient, Abshire should be granted a thirty-day extension to cure any deficiency.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    Trial Court's October 2015 Ruling Order\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   On October 16, 2015, the trial court held a hearing on the objections to Dr. Rushing's June Report, during which the parties reurged their arguments but presented no additional evidence. On October 26, 2015, the trial court issued a letter with its findings regarding Dr. Rushing's June Report. The court found that Dr. Rushing's report was a good faith effort to comply with Chapter 74 but that the June Report did not comply with the requirements of the statute in the following respects: (1) Dr. Rushing's report failed to identify the source of his knowledge concerning the standard of care for Christus, HealthSouth, and/or the nurses or other hospital personnel at Christus or HealthSouth; (2) Dr. Rushing's report failed to identify a specific standard of care as to each defendant; (3) Dr. Rushing's report failed to identify the specific methods by which Abshire's back would have been stabilized; (4) Dr. Rushing's report failed to identify the \"appropriate treatment\" that should have been undertaken and how it would have prevented Abshire's paraplegia ; and (5) Dr. Rushing's report failed to explain how the nurses' failure to chart Abshire's history was a proximate cause of Abshire's injuries. On November 5, 2015, the trial court signed an order sustaining HealthSouth's and Christus's objections to Dr. Rushing's June Report and granting Abshire a thirty-day extension to supplement her expert report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    Report by Nurse Aguirre\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Thereafter, Plaintiff produced a report by Nurse Erika Aguirre (Nurse Aguirre or Aguirre) dated November 19, 2015, in which Nurse Aguirre stated that she has a Bachelor's degree and Master's degree in Nursing, is a licensed advance practice nurse, is board-certified as a Clinical Nurse Specialist in Adult Health, and currently works as an adjunct nursing faculty member and clinical instructor. Nurse Aguirre stated that she addressed the standard of care and breach for the nursing staff at Christus. According to Aguirre, the standard of care for Christus required Christus \"to document a complete and accurate assessment\" including a health history, primary complaint, pain, \"diagnose deviations from the expected pattern of physiologic activity[,]\" and \"communicate\n   pertinent information to the physician and multidisciplinary team members.\" Nurse Aguirre stated in her report that the nursing staff at Christus breached the applicable standard of care by failing to document a complete and accurate assessment, health history, focused assessment, pain assessment, level of care or transfer, deviations from expected pattern of physiologic activity, communicate with physician and other staff, and by failing to do so timely. Aguirre further stated that Abshire \"was not evaluated and treated properly allowing a thoracic compression fracture to be missed thereby causing delay in necessary treatment and preventative care that ultimately led to the permanent paralysis in her lower extremities.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    Supplemental Reports by Dr. Rushing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Plaintiff also produced two supplemental reports by Dr. Rushing dated November 23, 2015-one regarding Christus, and the other one regarding HealthSouth. We summarize below the additional or modified allegations from the November 23, 2015 reports (the November Reports).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In his November Report as to Christus, Dr. Rushing stated that he supervised the nursing staff who were on call with him in the ER from 1966 until sometime in the 1980s, and as a result, he is \"very familiar with the nursing standard of care for evaluating, charting, and relating critical information to the ER physician.\" Rushing also stated that he was involved in setting policy for the ER staff at Presbyterian Hospital of Dallas. And Dr. Rushing's report stated that he is qualified to opine as to the standard of care for \"the nurses and/or Defendant Christus ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In his November Report as to HealthSouth, Dr. Rushing stated that as a board-certified physician in internal medicine, rheumatology, and geriatrics, he often oversees \"the rehabilitation of fragile patients with a multitude of injuries, including spinal injuries.\" Dr. Rushing stated that he is qualified to opine as to the standard of care for \"HealthSouth and its staff.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In his November Report as to Christus, Dr. Rushing stated that the standard of care for nurses \"is to document a complete and accurate assessment.\" According to Rushing, \"[d]uring multiple admissions the history of osteogenesis imperfecta was missed completely[,]\" and Abshire's back pain and related symptoms were \"minimalized in the documentation[ ]\" on other admissions. Dr. Rushing further stated that \"[t]he lack of properly assessing Ms. Abshire's medical history and physical conditions is a breach in the standard of care.\" According to Dr. Rushing, a lack of information results in delay of proper medical care and impedes physicians from ordering appropriate testing and prescribing proper treatment and preventative care, and\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   ... had the symptomology that Ms. Abshire was experiencing been appropriately linked to the osteogenesis imperfecta diagnosis then the proper course of care would have been to admit the patient to the hospital on absolute bed rest, order imaging studies such as a CT or MRI of her back, then treat the injury to the spine as required by its severity by such methods as bracing through spinal fusion. The goal would be to alleviate pressure on the spine such that the compression fracture does not progress and paraplegia does not occur.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Dr. Rushing also stated in his November Report as to Christus that \"[t]he standard of care requires nurses to advocate on behalf of the patient.\" However, Rushing did not opine as to how or in what manner the nursing staff should have \"advocated\" for Abshire, or how the failure to be an \"advocate\" for the patient caused or contributed to Abshire's injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   According to Dr. Rushing's November Report as to Christus, the harm suffered by Abshire as a result of \"substandard care\" by Christus was \"the exacerbation of an undiagnosed vertebral fracture that lead [sic] to a spinal cord injury resulting in paraplegia and bowel and bladder incontinence.\" Dr. Rushing stated that the hospital staff's failure to evaluate the cause of Abshire's chest, back, and neck pain \"allowed Ms. Abshire's compression fracture to go undetected until it became so sever[e] that she became paralyzed from the [waist] down[,]\" the hospital staff \"clearly ignored signs and symptoms of spinal injury[,]\" and the hospital staff's failure to investigate \"allowed the spinal injury to progress to the point of paraplegia.\" According to Dr. Rushing, the hospital staff's failure to consider Abshire's \"relevant medical history\" led to \"a delay in treatment of Ms. Abshire's compression fracture which in medical probability lead [sic] to paralysis.\" Dr. Rushing stated that the hospital staff failed to recognize signs and symptoms that indicated a compromise of the musculoskeletal system and that led to a delay in the diagnosis and treatment of the compression fracture, the \"[f]ailure to evaluate and detect the spinal cord injury in medical probability caused loss of bladder and bowel function and caused paralysis in both legs[ ]\", and the \"[f]ailure by the hospital staff to institute early stabilization of Ms. Abshire's spine ... [led] to exacerbation of the compression fracture and the development of paraplegia.\" Finally, Dr. Rushing concluded that the breaches of care constitute negligence that \"was, in reasonable medical probability, a proximate cause of the resultant paralysis suffered by Ms. Abshire.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In his November Report regarding HealthSouth, Dr. Rushing stated that the relevant standard of care required HealthSouth \"to properly evaluate and assess Ms. Abshire before admission.\" Dr. Rushing stated that HealthSouth \"accepted a patient they never should have accepted[,]\" that Abshire was enrolled in a physical therapy program despite being unable to support her own body weight, and that \"[n]o one explored the cause of her continued back pain or increasing loss of lower body function.\" Dr. Rushing included the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Had the proper testing been performed prior to admission to Healthsouth, the damage to Ms. Abshire's spine could have been minimalized. Instead, the patient was admitted to Healthsouth for a physical therapy program that would only exacerbate her spinal cord injury. Proper diagnostic testing would have revealed the injury and allowed not only a proper diagnosis to be made but a proper treatment plan, including stabilization of the patient's spine in order to prevent further damage, to be instituted. Proper stabilization and treatment of the fracture could have prevented further damage, and depending on the level of injury discovered, some of the damage may have been reversible. The failure of Healthsouth to properly assess the physical condition and needs of Ms. Abshire caused continued delay in the treatment of her spinal fracture and the continued worsening of her paralysis and other symptoms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   The harm/injury that resulted from the substandard care provided by [HealthSouth] was the exacerbation of an undiagnosed vertebral fracture and spinal cord injury. Had Defendant [HealthSouth] followed the Standard of Care for patients with OI and a spinal cord injury, Ms. Abshire in medical probability would not have developed paraplegia and bowel and bladder incontinence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Dr. Rushing also added the following statement regarding compression fractures to both of his November Reports: \"A compression fracture is a collapse of the vertebra. This weakening is commonly seen in patients with osteoporosis or osteogenesis imperfecta. In severe cases of osteoporosis, coughing or sneezing can ca[u]se compression fractures.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    Objections filed by Christus to the November Report\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   On December 7, 2015, Christus filed its objections to Abshire's supplemental expert reports and a motion to dismiss. Therein, Christus argued that the supplemental reports failed to meet the requirements of section 74.351 and they failed to cure the deficiencies previously noted by the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Regarding standard of care and breach, Christus argued that Rushing's supplemental report and Aguirre's report failed to identify what the nurses should have done differently. As to Rushing's supplemental report, Christus argued that Rushing did not describe what the standard of care for nurses is with respect to assessing and documenting back pain and related symptoms, and he failed to explain what nurses should look for and how they should describe their observations in a patient's record. According to Christus, Dr. Rushing's assertion that the nurses failed to note Abshire's history of OI is \"a\n   <em>\n    conclusion\n   </em>\n   about breach\" and is not a statement of what should have been done or about the standard of care. Christus argued that Dr. Rushing's opinion that the staff minimalized Abshire's back pain is unsupported and that \"[h]is report is utterly devoid of any fact that indicates that Plaintiff's pain was actually worse than reported\" by the nurses at Christus. As to Aguirre's report, Christus contended that Aguirre did not explain how the nurses should have known of Abshire's history of OI in order to include it in her chart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   As to causation, Christus argued that Dr. Rushing failed to show how anything the nurses did or did not do would have changed Abshire's outcome. Christus explained that, although Abshire's history of OI was not noted on November 19, it was noted on November 22 and again on November 23. According to Christus, \"[i]f the ER doctors allegedly did not properly treat Plaintiff's condition when they knew about it on November 22 or 23, Dr. Rushing does not explain how things would have been different if the nurses had noted Plaintiff's history of OI\" on other dates. Christus contended that Dr. Rushing's causation opinions implicate the diagnosis and treatment of illness, which only physicians may do, and therefore, such causation opinions \"are clearly directed at the ER physicians and not the nursing staff.\" Christus argued that Rushing's supplemental report did not refer to or incorporate by reference Aguirre's report, and because a nurse cannot give an opinion on causation, Rushing's supplemental report did not provide \"a causal link between any alleged breach in the standard of care identified by Nurse Aguirre to Plaintiff's injuries[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Christus filed a reply in support of its objections on January 6, 2016, arguing in relevant part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   Most of Dr. Rushing's causation discussion is focused on the ER physicians who treated Plaintiff at CHRISTUS St. Elizabeth, but as stated above, they are not employed by the hospital and the hospital is not liable for their conduct. Dr. Rushing's primary focus is on the alleged failure of the ER physicians to diagnose the cause of symptoms Plaintiff was experiencing and to properly treat those symptoms. This is the practice of medicine, something that a hospital and\n   nurses cannot do.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Occ. Code \u00a7 151.002(13) [ ]. A hospital cannot practice medicine and therefore cannot be held directly liable for any acts or omissions that constitute medical functions.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <em>\n    Objections filed by HealthSouth to the November Reports\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   HealthSouth filed its objections to the November Reports and a motion to dismiss on December 16, 2015. Therein, HealthSouth argued that Dr. Rushing failed to explain how his knowledge and experience in internal medicine, rheumatology, and geriatrics relates to the standard of care for non-physicians at a rehabilitation hospital, and Rushing failed to demonstrate any specific expertise in neurology, neurosurgery or spinal injury, and, therefore, his opinions \"do not rise above anything more than the guesswork of an untrained, unskilled advocate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   HealthSouth also alleged that Dr. Rushing's November Report was conclusory as to the standard of care, breach, and causation. According to HealthSouth, Dr. Rushing was required to identify a standard of care \"that could legally apply to a health care provider other than a physician[,]\" and nurses and therapists cannot make a medical diagnosis or prescribe treatment. HealthSouth further argued that Dr. Rushing's November Report conflated a physician's responsibilities with those of nurses and therapists. In addition, HealthSouth alleged that Dr. Rushing's November Report did not identify specific methods by which Abshire's back should have been stabilized, failed to identify appropriate treatment, and failed to identify specifically what HealthSouth's personnel should have done differently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   HealthSouth argued that Dr. Rushing's November Report was conclusory as to causation because it did not explain how information taken during the admission process at HealthSouth or after Abshire was admitted at HealthSouth caused or contributed to her \"\n   <em>\n    pre-existing\n   </em>\n   condition or even to Ms. Abshire's participation in physical therapy\n   <em>\n    as the doctors had already ordered and approved her transfer to HealthSouth for rehabilitation therapy\n   </em>\n   .\" HealthSouth further complained that Dr. Rushing's November Report did not explain how Abshire's outcome would have been different had HealthSouth's staff, technicians, or nurses identified the nature of Abshire's condition one or two days earlier and that the report failed \"to explain how the acts or omissions of HealthSouth's nurses and therapists contributed to a failure or delay in the testing being ordered, much less how the tests, if ordered, would have changed the outcome for this patient.\" HealthSouth argued that \"[f]undamentally, Dr. Rushing is complaining that the physicians who saw Ms. Abshire\n   <em>\n    prior to her transfer to HealthSouth\n   </em>\n   missed a diagnosis of a pre-existing degenerative condition.\" And HealthSouth also asserted that Rushing's opinion that physical therapy should not have been initiated until after Dr. Smith evaluated Abshire was at odds with his statement that Dr. Smith did evaluate Abshire and continued physical therapy after she evaluated Abshire. HealthSouth also noted that Nurse Aguirre's report did not address HealthSouth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Response to the Objections\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Abshire filed her response to Christus's objections on January 4, 2016, in which she argued \"[e]very incomplete assessment was a missed opportunity for this hospital to have prevented Ms. Abshire's paraplegia.\" Abshire argued that the following section from Dr. Rushing's November Report adequately addressed how the nurses at Christus caused Abshire's injury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   The nurses failed on multiple occasions to document a complete and accurate\n   assessment of the patient. During multiple admissions the history of osteogenesis imperfecta was missed completely. During other admissions the patient's back pain and related symptoms were minimalized in the documentation ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   The lack of properly assessing Ms. Abshire's medical history and physical conditions is a breach in the standard of care. Lack of information results in a delay in proper medical care and is an impediment for the managing doctor to be able to order appropriate testing, and prescribe proper treatment and preventative care. In Ms. Abshire's case, had the symptomology that Ms. Abshire was experiencing been appropriately linked to the osteogenesis imperfecta diagnosis then the proper course of care would have been to admit the patient to the hospital on absolute bed rest, order imaging studies such as a CT or MRI of her back, then treat the injury to the spine as required by its severity by such methods as bracing through spinal fusion. The goal would be to alleviate pressure on the spine such that the compression fracture does not progress and paraplegia does not occur.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Abshire also filed her response to HealthSouth's objections on January 4, 2016. Therein Abshire argued that Dr. Rushing's opinion in his initial report as to causation by HealthSouth was not found insufficient by the trial court and that \"Defendant is again improperly re-urging a defeated argument in an untimely manner.\" Abshire argued in the alternative that, if the trial court found the supplemental reports deficient, Abshire should be granted a thirty-day extension to cure any deficiency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In its reply filed on January 6, 2016, HealthSouth responded to the points raised by the Plaintiff. In addition to its previous arguments, HealthSouth argued that \"Plaintiff's final alleged deviation-beginning physical therapy on a patient with an unrecognized and undiagnosed compression fracture at T5-clearly presumes information not available to HealthSouth and applies an impermissible duty to make a medical diagnosis.\" HealthSouth argued that the order admitting Abshire for rehabilitation came from an emergency room physician and that \"[n]owhere does Dr. Rushing explain a standard of care which should lead HealthSouth to ignore physician's orders and refuse to admit Ms. Abshire.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <em>\n    Trial Court's February 2016 Ruling and Order\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   On January 7, 2016, the trial court held a hearing on the objections to Dr. Rushing's November Reports and to Nurse Aguirre's Report, during which the parties made arguments but presented no additional evidence. The trial court issued a letter on February 29, 2016, explaining the trial court's decision to overrule the objections and deny the motions to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In its letter, the trial court explained that it concluded that Dr. Rushing's qualifications were adequate because Rushing had supervised nurses for a fifteen-year period, had participated in setting medical policy at hospitals, and Rushing oversees rehabilitation efforts of his patients. The trial court wrote that Dr. Rushing had stated that the standard of care for the nurses at Christus was \"to accurately assess, document and communicate matters to the physician[ ]\" and Dr. Rushing cited \"numerous examples\" of a failure of the nursing staff to do so. The trial court wrote that Dr. Rushing had identified the standard of care for HealthSouth, which was to provide an \"accurate assessment/evaluation and documentation at both the screening and admission stages and a continuing duty to assess the patient and report to Dr. Smith[ ]\" and the \"duty to\n   discontinue physical therapy under the circumstances of this case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   As to causation, the trial court wrote that Rushing had explained that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   ... proper treatment would have included a timely neuromuscular examination, diagnostic studies and, once the condition was discovered, admission to the hospital to stabilize the spine through bed rest, bracing or spinal fusion, as well as avoiding sitting upright or walking. Further, in Dr. Rushing's opinion, any exacerbation of Ms. Abshire's condition by physical therapy would have been avoided.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   ... the lack of information [due to the nurses' failure to chart] delayed and/or impeded timely assessment/correlation of symptoms to the patient's condition by the physicians. This delayed ordering diagnostic studies which, in turn, thereby delayed diagnosis and stabilization of Ms. Abshire's spine.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   ... an expert's opinion that, had nurses communicated certain information to a physician/surgeon a different, specifically identified, course of treatment should have been pursued thereby avoiding injury is not considered speculation[ ].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   On March 21, 2016, the trial court entered an order overruling the objections filed by HealthSouth and Christus and denying the motions to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   HealthSouth and Christus timely filed their notices of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   We have jurisdiction over an interlocutory appeal of an order that denies all or part of the relief sought by a motion to dismiss under section 74.351(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2051.014\">\n    Tex.

We need not determine whether the trial court erred in its rulings as to Fasullo and Marchand because neither defendant is a party to this appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-157\">\n    The record reflects that Dr. Smith was not an employee of HealthSouth, and Abshire did not name Dr. Smith as a defendant in her petition.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-158\">\n    In her response to HealthSouth's objections in the trial court, Plaintiff also argued that HealthSouth had waived all objections by having served a request for written discovery. That issue is not before us on appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-159\">\n    The trial court also denied objections filed by Doctors Fasullo and Marchand, but as we have explained, the doctors are not parties to this appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-160\">\n    HealthSouth's arguments in its brief are organized around the issues of qualifications, standard of care and breach, and causation. In addition, HealthSouth enumerates the following \"issues,\" and for purposes of this appeal, we consider each of these points together:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n    1. Whether an expert's opinion complies with the expert report requirements when using inconsistent statements of facts and inaccurate and misleading discussions of medical records.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-162\">\n    2. Whether an expert's criticisms of a rehabilitation hospital with no physician employees may include diagnostic standards requiring the practice of medicine by the hospital in violation of Texas law.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-163\">\n    3. Whether an expert's criticism of a rehabilitation hospital with no physician employees for admitting a patient into a physical therapy program adequately addresses a standard of care and breach thereof, absent a description of a valid process to be followed by non-physicians for reaching a different diagnosis and altering the physicians' orders admitting the patient into the physical therapy program.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-164\">\n    4. Whether an expert's criticism that a rehabilitation hospital with no physician employees should have properly \"evaluated\" and \"assessed\" a patient states a standard of care and breach absent details regarding the method of evaluation or assessment which should have been conducted.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-165\">\n    5. Whether an expert in a case relating to a delay in diagnosis adequately addresses causation without demonstrating how a rehabilitation hospital with no physician employees caused or exacerbated a patient's pre-existing, undiagnosed medical condition by following prescribed treatment orders calling for physical therapy.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-166\">\n    6. Whether an expert's causation opinion must include a factual and medical basis for the conclusion that the patient's undiagnosed preexisting condition was exacerbated or caused by the caregiver's actions in following a prescribed healthcare treatment plan.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-167\">\n    7. Whether a physician that has no experience in working at or for a rehabilitation hospital adequately demonstrates the expertise to address the standard of care for admission staff, nurses, and therapists at a rehabilitation hospital.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    We note that, in his November Report, Dr. Rushing explained that the records he reviewed in developing his opinion included those of Christus, HealthSouth, Baptist Beaumont Hospital, Memorial Hermann-Houston, and Memorial Hermann-The Institute for Rehabilitation and Research. None of the parties claim that all the medical records considered were before the trial court nor included in the appellate record.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-169\">\n    Dr. Rushing's reports do not state that the physical therapists have a duty to act contrary to a physician's orders, and we are limited to the four corners of the expert's report in making our evaluation.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Am.
