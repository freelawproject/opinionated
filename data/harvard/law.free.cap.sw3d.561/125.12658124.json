We must determine if genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether the driver was acting as the company's employee and within the course and scope of his employment at the time of the accident, subjecting the company to vicarious liability for his alleged negligence. Although it does not dispute the existence of the employer-employee relationship, the employer asserts that it lacked control over the employee's conduct at the time of the accident, foreclosing vicarious liability as a matter of law. The trial court granted summary judgment for the employer, and the court of appeals affirmed. We hold that the employer was not entitled to summary judgment on the vicarious-liability claim. We therefore reverse the court of appeals' judgment and remand the case to the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Sandridge Energy, Inc., hired Amerimex Drilling I, Ltd., to drill oil-and-gas wells on the Longfellow Ranch in Pecos County. Amerimex provided mobile bunkhouses for its crews and typically located those bunkhouses at the drilling site. However, Sandridge did not allow bunkhouses on the ranch, requiring them to be moved approximately 30 miles away to Fort Stockton. The Sandridge-Amerimex contract accounted for this circumstance by mandating a bonus payment to the crew's driller to drive the crew to the site.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the contract provided that \"[Amerimex] shall invoice [Sandridge] for and pay each Driller to receive [sic] $50/day to drive crew out to well location.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Amerimex did not require its crews to stay at the bunkhouse or ride with the driller, although it appears undisputed that they typically did both. Further, Amerimex placed no restrictions on what route they\n   took between the bunkhouse and the drilling site or where they stopped along the way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Amerimex crews assigned to the Longfellow Ranch project worked twelve-hour shifts on a seven-days-on, seven-days-off schedule. J.C. Burchett was the driller on one of those crews and was paid the daily bonus to drive his crew between the bunkhouse and the ranch in his own truck. Burchett and his crew members-Steven Painter, Earl Wright, and Albert Carillo\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   -all lived significantly farther from the ranch than Fort Stockton, so they generally stayed at the bunkhouse. However, on one or two occasions, Burchett drove with the crew to Big Spring (where Burchett and at least one other crew member lived) after their shift instead of back to the bunkhouse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 28, 2007, Burchett was driving the crew from the ranch back to the bunkhouse after their shift ended.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   He struck another vehicle driven by Sarah Pena, resulting in a rollover that killed Wright and Carillo and injured Painter and Burchett. Burchett sought and received workers' compensation benefits following a contested case hearing before the Texas Department of Insurance Workers' Compensation Division. Amerimex argued in that hearing that Burchett was acting in the course and scope of his employment at the time of the accident, and the Division ultimately found Burchett's injury compensable because he was paid to transport the crew between the ranch and the bunkhouse, furthering Amerimex's business interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Painter and the deceased crew members' representatives and beneficiaries (collectively, Painter)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   did not seek workers' compensation benefits. However, Amerimex initiated proceedings at the Division to determine whether the injuries suffered by Painter, Wright, and Carillo were covered by its workers' compensation policy. A Division appeals panel concluded that Amerimex lacked standing to do so and that, in any event, the employees were not injured in the course and scope of their employment and thus did not sustain compensable injuries.\n   <em>\n    In re Tex.

The workers'-compensation proceedings are not at issue here, nor are they determinative of the issues presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Painter filed suit against Burchett, Amerimex, and Sandridge, alleging Amerimex and Sandridge are vicariously liable for Burchett's negligence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court granted summary judgment for Sandridge, and that judgment was severed and appealed. The court of appeals affirmed, holding that Sandridge lacked either contractual or actual control over the transportation of workers to the drilling site and that Burchett was not Sandridge's employee or borrowed servant at the time of the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Painter v.

We denied Painter's petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Meanwhile, Amerimex filed its own summary-judgment motion, primarily arguing the plaintiffs' claims are barred by the Workers' Compensation Act's exclusive-remedy provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.

CODE \u00a7 408.001(a) (\"Recovery of workers' compensation benefits is the exclusive remedy of an employee covered by workers' compensation insurance coverage or a legal beneficiary against the employer ... for the death of or a work-related injury sustained by the employee.\"). After that motion was denied, Amerimex filed a second summary-judgment motion, this time arguing Painter's vicarious-liability claim fails because no evidence shows Amerimex controlled the details of Burchett's work at the time of the accident (or, alternatively, the evidence conclusively demonstrates the absence of such control). The trial court granted this motion, severed the claims against Amerimex into a separate cause, and rendered a final take-nothing judgment in Amerimex's favor. Painter appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The court of appeals acknowledged the existence of a fact issue as to whether Burchett was in the course and scope of his employment for workers'-compensation purposes.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12374199\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/511/700/#p707\">\n    511 S.W.3d 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 707 (Tex. App.-El Paso 2015). However, the court concluded that, for vicarious liability to attach, \"Amerimex must undertake some control as with the route or the means of transport, which might correspondingly reflect on the risk of the accident itself.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12374199\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/511/700/#p707\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12374199\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/511/700/#p707\">\n    at 712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court held that no evidence showed \"Amerimex had or exercised any control over the manner of transportation-the type of vehicle used, the qualifications of the driver, the number of passengers, or any other issues which might implicate the kind of control that justifies shifting the risk of loss from one party to another.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12374199\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/511/700/#p707\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12374199\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/511/700/#p707\">\n    at 713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, a plaintiff must demonstrate such a right to control in order to satisfy the first element of a vicarious-liability claim against an employer for its employee's negligence: that the wrongdoer was an employee at the time of the negligent conduct. But when that relationship is undisputed, the employer essentially concedes the existence of the right to control that is necessary to give rise to the relationship. As a general matter, this right to control extends to all the employee's acts within the course and scope of his employment, i.e., actions \"within the scope of the employee's general authority in furtherance of the employer's business and for the accomplishment of the object for which the employee was hired.\"\n   <em>\n    Mayes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8367887\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/236/754/#p757\">\n    236 S.W.3d at 757\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Accordingly, we disagree with those courts of appeals that have tied the right-to-control analysis to the course-and-scope element of a vicarious-liability claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   That element hinges on an objective assessment of whether the employee was doing his job when he committed a tortious act.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8367887\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/236/754/#p757\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Laverie v.

Further, Painter presented evidence that one of Burchett's job duties\n   <em>\n    as a driller\n   </em>\n   on the Sandridge project was to drive his crew to and from the drilling site,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that he was paid a \"bonus\" for performing this task.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, Amerimex argues it cannot be vicariously liable for Burchett's negligence because it exercised no control over the details of his driving, such as prescribing a route or requiring a particular means of transportation. Amerimex thus contends that Burchett was an \"employee\" for vicarious-liability purposes while on duty at the drilling site, \"but not while he was driving away after his shift had ended and was no longer subject to Amerimex'[s] control.\" In other words, even in the face of an employer's concession that it had a sufficient overall right to control the details of the wrongdoer's work to give rise to an employer-employee relationship, Amerimex would have us reevaluate the worker's employment status for vicarious-liability purposes by isolating the task the worker was performing at the moment of the accident and conducting an independent evaluation of the employer's control with respect to that particular task. This position is inconsistent with the framework we have described.

Amerimex did not merely provide a travel allowance to its employees. It was contractually required to pay a specific crew member-the driller-a bonus for carrying out a specific task-driving the crew between the bunkhouse and the drilling site. Although Amerimex did not require its crew members to ride with the driller or even to stay at the bunkhouse, some evidence indicates it was Burchett's \"job\" to drive those who did, and Burchett testified that without the bonus he would have been forced to look for another job. Burchett was not merely making his own services available to Amerimex in driving between the bunkhouse and the ranch; he was ensuring the services of the rest of the crew were available as well. And more importantly, there is evidence that he was doing so as part of his assigned job duties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Amerimex notes that, in transporting the crew, Burchett was not required to travel directly between the bunkhouse and the ranch. He could stop for a meal, run a personal errand, or even, as happened on one or two occasions, travel all the way back to Big Spring rather than the bunkhouse. We agree that, if Burchett had been engaged in any of these activities at the time of the accident, the course-and-scope analysis would be affected.

Amerimex notes that the Sandridge-Amerimex contract requires payment of a driver bonus \"to drive crew\n    out to well location,\" but says nothing about driving home. Amerimex thus appears to imply that, at most, Burchett was acting within the scope of his employment while driving to, but not from, the ranch. For both evidentiary and common-sense reasons, we disagree.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    As an evidentiary matter, Burchett testified as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n    Q.

The fact that Burchett was not required to drive straight back to the bunkhouse is not dispositive; the key is that he could not simply leave the crew at the site. Again, to the extent Burchett could have chosen to conduct a personal errand while carrying out that responsibility, the law already ensures that Amerimex would not be liable for his actions in doing so.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    <strong>\n     D. Summary of Vicarious-Liability Holdings\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    In sum, we hold that proving an employer's vicarious liability for a worker's negligence involves a two-step process. The plaintiff must show that, at the time of the negligent conduct, the worker (1) was an employee and (2) was acting in the course and scope of his employment. The employment-status inquiry involved in step one depends on whether the employer has the overall right to control the progress, details, and methods of operations of the work, whether or not it chooses to exercise that right as to any particular task. Relatedly, as a general matter, we do not evaluate employee status on a task-by-task basis. By contrast, supervisory liability for damages caused by an independent contractor is premised on a right to control the specific task giving rise to the injury. If an employer has a sufficient right of control to give rise to the employer-employee relationship, step two of the analysis comes into play because that right extends to the employee's acts within the course and scope of his employment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    The course-and-scope inquiry under step two involves an objective analysis, hinging on whether the employee was performing the tasks generally assigned to him in furtherance of the employer's business. That is, the employee must be acting\n    with the employer's authority and for the employer's benefit. We confirm that the coming-and-going rule, under which an employee is generally not acting within the scope of his employment when traveling to and from work, applies in the vicarious-liability context. However, we also recognize an exception when such travel involves the performance of regular or specifically assigned duties for the benefit of the employer. And when a specifically assigned duty includes driving other workers to the workplace, it necessarily also includes ensuring they are not left stranded at the end of the workday.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    In this case, Amerimex does not dispute that it employed Burchett as a driller at the time of the incident, and we reject Amerimex's argument that, as a matter of law, Burchett ceased acting as its employee when he left the drilling site. Further, we conclude that a fact issue exists as to whether Burchett was acting in the course and scope of his employment when the accident occurred.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    <strong>\n     IV. Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    We hold that Amerimex is not entitled to summary judgment-on either no-evidence or traditional grounds-on Painter's vicarious-liability claim. Accordingly, we reverse the court of appeals' judgment and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    Justice Green filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Brown joined.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Justice Blacklock did not participate in the decision.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    In May 2016, we denied the petition for review in another vicarious liability case that arose out of the same facts and accident as this one and involved the same issues regarding control over the driller's after-hours transportation of crew members and the driller's employment status at the time of the accident.\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Painter v.

App.-El Paso 2015, pet. denied). Because we denied the petition, the court of appeals' decision in that case stands. There, the court held that Sandridge Energy, Inc., the oil and gas leaseholder who hired Amerimex Drilling I, Ltd., was entitled to summary judgment on the plaintiffs' vicarious liability claims because Sandridge had no contractual right to control the manner in which crew members were transported from the work site, and J.C. Burchett, the driller, maintained actual control over his transportation of crew members.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12374246\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/511/713/#p723\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12374246\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/511/713/#p723\">\n     at 724\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Therefore, Burchett was not Sandridge's employee, \"at least with respect to transporting the crew\"; rather, as to the transportation work, \"Burchett has all the makings of an independent contractor.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12374246\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/511/713/#p723\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    For the same reasons that Burchett was held not to be Sandridge's employee for purposes of transporting the crew in that case, I would hold that Burchett was not Amerimex's employee for purposes of transporting the crew in this case. Because the Court concludes that Amerimex is not entitled to summary judgment on the plaintiffs' vicarious liability claims, I dissent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    <strong>\n     I. Background\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Sandridge hired Amerimex to do the drilling on its lease. Their contract obligated Sandridge to pay Amerimex a daily rate during drilling and to pay three additional \"bonus\" amounts for specific payments to\n    Amerimex employees: (1) a \"bottom hole bonus\" for each worker who worked during a specific period with no lost time for safety, (2) a \"subsistance [sic] bonus\" of $50/day to each worker, and (3) a \"driver bonus\" of $50/day for each driller \"to drive crew out to well location.\" Amerimex would invoice Sandridge for those additional amounts, and the employees would receive the bonus payments along with their usual pay. Although the contract referred to Amerimex as an \"independent contractor,\" the court of appeals in the\n    <em>\n     Sandridge\n    </em>\n    case noted that it also provided \"several areas where Sandridge exerted specific control over the details of the work.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12374246\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/511/713/#p723\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12374246\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/511/713/#p723\">\n     at 721\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . That court concluded that \"the actual terms of the contract reflects the opposite\" of an independent contractor arrangement, at least as to certain aspects of the work.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12374246\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/511/713/#p723\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12374246\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/511/713/#p723\">\n     at 722\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    The record contains no indication of any contract or agreement regarding transportation between Amerimex and Burchett. However, it is undisputed that the contract between Amerimex and Sandridge-the only contract mentioning transportation of crew members-was silent as to the manner in which drillers would provide transportation to crew members. It is also undisputed that neither Sandridge nor Amerimex actually controlled the manner in which Burchett drove crew members to or from the job site.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    The accident happened after the crew's shift ended, when Burchett and the crew members were off the clock. Until their next shift began the next day, Amerimex had no control over them, and they were free to do as they wished. Amerimex had no transportation requirements for drillers or crew members and did not require that they stay at the bunkhouse that Amerimex made available. Rather, they were free to sleep wherever they wished, and they were free to travel to and from the job site however they wished.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    <strong>\n     II.

Amerimex then stated: \"The jury will have no choice but to answer 'no' because there is no evidence of control.\" Amerimex may not have used the words \"independent contractor\" in making this argument, but it clearly argued that no employer-employee relationship could exist at the time of the accident because Amerimex lacked a contractual right to control the transportation of crew members and Burchett alone controlled his transportation work.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"3\">\n    <p id=\"p-119\">\n     The Court purports to accept the possibility that a worker could be both an employee and an independent contractor.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     561 S.W.3d at 135 n.13.
