We must reverse and remand because the summary-judgment record does not establish a right to judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2000, Shirla opened an individual checking account (\"Account\") with First National Bank (\"Bank\") and named Jerry, her husband, as the pay-on-death (\"POD\") beneficiary. Two years later, Shirla established the Trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After Shirla died in 2015, Jerry claimed Account ownership by virtue of Shirla's POD designation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Shirla's son Michael Penney, as the Trust's successor trustee, countered that Shirla had transferred the Account to the Trust in 2002, thereby terminating the prior POD designation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Bank petitioned to interplead the funds. Jerry and the Trust each counterclaimed against Bank and cross-claimed against one another. The court ordered that the funds be paid into court, but refused to dismiss Bank from the case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Jerry and the Trust cross-moved for summary judgment on their competing claims to the Account. The court granted the Trust's motion and certified the judgment for appeal pursuant to Rule 74.01(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The parties' appellate arguments frame a narrow issue: Did the summary-judgment record establish that Shirla changed Account ownership \"from herself individually to the Trust\" as asserted by paragraph 7 of the Trust's Rule 74.04(c) statement of uncontroverted material facts (\"SUMF\")?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Principles of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Summary judgment's role under Missouri's fact-pleading scheme \"is to identify cases (1) in which there is no genuine dispute as to the facts and (2) the\n   facts as admitted show a legal right to judgment for the movant.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ITT\n    </em>\n    ,\n   </strong>\n   854 S.W.2d at 380.

Also, because Bank had loaned money to the Trust, one could not fairly say Bank's\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   reason to have Trust documents was that the Trust owned the Account, especially when Bank kept those documents in a binder under Shirla's name with no connection tying them specifically to the Account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As to Bank's president's statements that Shirla transferred the Account and that the Trust owned it, we cannot brand Jerry's dispute as \"merely argumentative, imaginary, or frivolous\" when Bank's president also testified that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \u2022 Shirla opened the Account by signature card; such accounts could not be modified without closing the account and opening another; and those things did not happen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \u2022 The account agreement had not been changed since the Account was opened in 2000.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \u2022 Bank's only signed Account document is the original signature card reflecting Shirla as the owner, and no signed document reflects Trust ownership of the Account.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Finally, Bank's president also testified, as to Bank's discovery statement that the Account was converted from an individual account to a trust account in 2002, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Q. Well, we've gone over that, and there really was no change in the account agreement; correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   A.

The record does not reflect that the court ruled on that motion. Because the proposed supplement did not come into the summary-judgment record as part of the initial motion, response, or by leave of court, it was not authorized by Rule 74.04(c) and we cannot consider it.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <strong>\n      Jones\n     </strong>\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12370537\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/508/159/#p162\">\n     508 S.W.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    163 n.9 ;\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Cross v.
