Finding that the trial court's judgment is supported by substantial evidence, is not against the weight of the evidence, and did not erroneously declare or apply the law, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   No jurisprudential purpose would be served by a written opinion. However, we have provided the parties a memorandum setting forth the reasons for our decision. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed under Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
