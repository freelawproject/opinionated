We reverse and remand with instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The child was born in May 2012 to the father and A.R.M., the mother.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parents never married. L.F. and the father testified that the father cared for the child when she was a newborn, and the father stated that he worked and provided for her as well. The father was incarcerated when the child was three months old on charges of assaulting a law-enforcement officer, driving while intoxicated, and leaving the scene of an accident in the summer of 2012. The father ultimately pleaded guilty, and remained imprisoned at the time of trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The child and an older sibling entered protective custody in April 2014 based on allegations of abuse and neglect against the mother. The Children's Division initially placed the child in foster care with non-relatives, and then in June 2014 placed her in foster care with K.F., the child's paternal great-uncle, and his then fiancee and now wife, L.F. The father and mother consented to K.F. and L.F. later assuming guardianship of the child, and the probate division of the Circuit Court of Jefferson County issued letters of guardianship to K.F. and L.F. in early November 2015. The juvenile division of the Circuit Court of Jefferson County terminated its jurisdiction in the underlying care and protection case after K.F. and L.F. became the child's legal guardians. In July 2016 in the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis, K.F. and L.F. petitioned to terminate the parental rights of the biological parents and to adopt the child. Neither parent sought termination of the guardianship. The Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis conducted a trial to address the termination of parental rights over the course of two days\n   in May and June 2017. The father testified that he consented to K.F. and L.F. as guardians for the child and wished for her to remain in their care until his release from prison because he knew the child would be in a safe and stable home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The father regularly wrote the child letters, sent her cards and drawings, and telephoned her. Twice the guardians took the child to visit the father, and twice the paternal grandmother took the child to visit. L.F. testified that the child knows who the father is, calls him \"Daddy [M.],\" and asks when he will call her. The father documented his completion of numerous courses in prison, including courses for substance-abuse treatment, first aid, parenting, communication, and anger management. He explained that he participated in programs in prison when and where available to help him connect with the child, specifically Project Angel Tree and Story Link.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court concluded that the father loves the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The father paid no child support. He testified that he has $8.50 per month to live on in prison, and \"make[s] sacrifices just to make phone time and call and talk to my daughter.\" Father stated that he expected to be released from prison in April 2018; that he was considering options for housing upon release; that he expected to return to his former landscaping job; and that he wanted to reintegrate into the child's life, and help her transition from living with K.F. and L.F. to living with him. The father testified that he inquired of the guardians about the child's health, well-being, and education, but received no information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The trial court made no finding regarding the father's credibility although it found the guardians \"less than forthcoming when questioned about [m]other's attempts to contact them.\" The court, while observing that they had no legal obligation to do so, also found \"that the guardians failed to provide a constant and regular schedule or method of visitation and contact between the natural parents and the child.\" Nonetheless, the trial court determined that the father willfully neglected the minor child, having noted that the father \"never provided any monetary support\" and \"lacks adequate housing in which to assume [the child's] custody any time in the near future.\" Further, \"[i]n reviewing the evidence submitted and considering the testimony elicited from the witnesses at trial,\" the court found \"that it is in the minor child's best interest that the parental rights of the natural parents be terminated so that the minor child can be adopted by her present caregivers, [K.F.] and [L.F.].\" The trial court did not elaborate further on its best-interest analysis.

We reverse the judgment terminating the father's parental rights, and remand with instructions for the trial court to deny the petition for adoption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Given our resolution of this case, the parties may seek appropriate orders from the Circuit Court of Jefferson County in the guardianship case concerning the father's visitation or custody or termination of the guardianship, as circumstances warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   SHERRI B. SULLIVAN, P.J. and JAMES M. DOWD, J., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    This case came to us on appeal only after the guardians adopted the child in December 2017. The trial court terminated the father's parental rights in its judgment of September 18, 2017. The father's trial counsel failed to notify the father of the court's judgment until late November 2017, well after the time for appeal of the termination of the father's parental rights expired, and trial counsel never sought to file a notice of appeal. The father filed,\n    <em>\n     pro se,\n    </em>\n    a motion for late notice of appeal in December 2017, which this Court granted because of the gravity of terminating the father's parental rights. The father then filed his notice of appeal\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    , and later obtained appointment of new counsel to pursue this appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    The mother has not appealed the termination of her parental rights.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Project Angel Trees provides Christinas gifts to children who have a parent in prison.
