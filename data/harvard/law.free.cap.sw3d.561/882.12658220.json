Crowell (\"the Crowells\") appeal from a Platte County Circuit Court judgment affirming a decision and order of the Missouri State Tax Commission (\"the Commission\"). The Commission had rejected the Crowells' claim that the 2015 assessment of their property by the Platte County Assessor (\"Assessor\") was discriminatory when compared to other similarly situated properties. Finding the Commission's decision was based on substantial evidence, and was not arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or unlawful, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2014, the Crowells bought residential property in Parkville, Missouri (\"the property\"). The property's assessment and sales history, in pertinent part, is as follows. The property was built in 1910. From 2001 to 2006, the property's appraised value was $48,832\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and its assessed value was $9,278.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sometime prior to 2007, the property was extensively repaired, renovated, and altered. In 2007, the property's appraised value was increased to $57,645 following a county-wide reassessment of all properties. In December of 2007, the property was sold for $234,000. In 2008, the property's appraised/assessed values increased to $230,660/$43,825. These valuations were applied to the property for tax assessment purposes from 2008 through 2014. The property's owners during that period did not protest the appraised/assessed values. In October 2014, the property was purchased by the Crowells for $230,000. The Crowells paid their pro-rata share of the 2014 property taxes at the time of closing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After purchasing the property, the Crowells researched its assessment and sales history. This review prompted the Crowells to contact Assessor and engage\n   in informal negotiations to have the appraised and assessed values of their property reduced. In May 2015, Assessor advised that he would reduce the appraised/assessed values on the property from $230,660/$43,825 to $210,660/$40,025.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Dissatisfied with the reduction, the Crowells continued their discussions with Assessor. Assessor suggested that the county appraiser visit the property. In July 2015, the county appraiser determined that no further reduction was warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Crowells appealed the assessed valuation of their property to the Platte County Board of Equalization (\"BOE\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the BOE hearing, the Crowells argued the 2008 assessment violated section 137.115.1\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. Assessor offered a copy of the July 2015 appraisal prepared by the county appraiser setting the property's value at $210,660. The BOE affirmed the $210,600 valuation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Crowells filed a Complaint for Review of Assessment with the Commission,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   which was a pre-printed form provided by the Commission. The form required the Crowells to check a box stating their grounds for appeal; they checked the box for \"discrimination.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   A hearing was conducted before a hearing officer at which the Crowells introduced-and the hearing officer received-the following exhibits:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-16\">Exhibit A Building Permits and Occupancy Permit Exhibit B Assessment History of Subject Property from 2001-2014 Exhibit C Building Permits on Adjacent Property Exhibit D Web-shot from Platte County Website Exhibit E Email from Respondent Cox to Complainant Edward Crowell Exhibit F Email from Complainants to Respondent Cox Exhibit G Letter from Respondent Cox to Complainants Exhibit H Record Card on Subject Property Exhibit I Sales and Assessment History of Subject Property and Others and Appraisal Report Exhibit J Summary of Various Properties Tax Per Square Feet</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Exhibit I included the July 2015 county appraiser's report of the Crowells' property, which contained information pertaining to five comparable properties. Mr. Crowell used that information to create a two-page summary that compared various aspects of the Crowells' property to the five other properties, including: \"sale date(s),\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"appr/assess change,\" \"2015 appr/assess amt.,\" \"sale amt.,\" and \"% appr/to sale.\" This two-page summary was also included in Exhibit I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Crowells argued that Exhibit I established their property was appraised at a higher ratio of its sale price than the five other comparable properties. The Crowells also noted that the five comparable properties were \"all recent sales,\" and, unlike the Crowells' property, \"none of them received an increase in assessed value based upon that sale.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Exhibit J included a four-page document created by Mr. Crowell titled \"Comparison of appraised value/assessment and corresponding property tax amount of neighboring properties to [the Crowells' property].\" This document compared the Crowells' property to 41 other properties. It included: \"sq. ft.,\" \"appraised value/assessment,\" \"tax amount,\" and \"tax amount per sq. ft.\" for each property. Attached to this summary were documents that \"came from the assessor's website,\" which Mr. Crowell stated were used in creating the summary. The Crowells argued that Exhibit J showed their property was assessed at a higher rate per square foot than the 41 comparison properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Mr. Crowell did not dispute during the hearing that the true market value of his property was $210,660\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and admitted that he had not obtained appraisals of the comparable properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Assessor testified that there were 42,000 parcels of property in Platte County. He stated that he assumed his duties as assessor on September 1, 2013, and that it was not his practice to simply carry forward a previous odd-numbered year's assessment. He stated \"if there's been any change, it's looked at,\" and \"[w]e look at what the value is two years later.\" Assessor testified that the decision to raise the appraised value of the Crowells' property in 2008 was not necessarily based on the sale price, as much as information obtained from a real estate listing that showed the home had been extensively renovated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The hearing officer affirmed the BOE's decision sustaining Assessor's assessment, finding that the Crowells failed to prove their discrimination claim \"because they failed to demonstrate that a statistically significant number of other residential properties within Platte County [were] being assessed at a lower ratio of market value than their property in 2015.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Crowells filed an application for review of the Decision and Order with the Commission.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Crowells raised two claims in their appeal: (1) the hearing officer erred in rejecting their argument that the 2008 assessment violated section 137.115.1 and was thus void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   ; and (2) the hearing officer erred in rejecting their argument that the assessed valuation of their property was the result of discrimination. They acknowledged that they \"did not dispute the true market value assigned by the Assessor and affirmed by the [BOE] of the subject property.\" In April 2016, the Commission issued its Decision\n   and Order Affirming Hearing Officer Decision upon Application for Review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Regarding the Crowells' first point, the Commission found that the Crowells did not have standing to challenge the 2008 assessment because they did not own the property until 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Regarding the second point, the Commission noted that a taxpayer must prove two elements to succeed on a discrimination claim: (1) the fair market value of the subject property on the tax day at issue; and (2) either an intentional plan of discrimination by the assessing officials resulting in an assessment of that property at a greater percentage of value than other property, generally, within the same class within the same taxing jurisdiction\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   that the level of an assessment is so grossly excessive as to be inconsistent with an honest exercise of judgment. The Crowells did not dispute that the fair market value of the property was $210,660, and thus the Commission found the first element \"was satisfied.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Commission next addressed \"the second element of the test-whether intentional discrimination occurred or whether the level of assessment was so grossly excessive as to be inconsistent with an honest exercise of judgment.\" The Commission observed that \"[t]he Missouri Supreme Court has held that the proper method in analyzing a claim of discrimination compares the median level of assessment for similarly-situated properties-in this appeal, residential properties located in Platte County as of January 1, 2015-to the actual level of assessment imposed on the property.\" The Commission found that the Crowells \"did not provide substantial evidence showing that other property in the same general class, residential, was actually undervalued.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In support of this conclusion, the Commission explained that the Crowells' \"documentation regarding other properties in Platte County did not establish the FMV of those properties as of January 1, 2015\" and the Crowells \"did not present the testimony of an expert in statistical analysis to explain their documentation or to establish that the number of properties documented was statistically significant.\" Consequently, the Crowells \"did not produce persuasive evidence from which the median assessment level of residential properties in Platte County on January 1, 2015, could even be determined\" and \"[w]ithout such evidence, no comparison between the median level of assessment and the actual level of assessment of the Property could be undertaken.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Commission concluded that there was \"competent and substantial evidence to establish a sufficient foundation for the Decision of the Senior Hearing Officer,\" and there was \"no basis to support a determination that the Senior Hearing Officer acted in an erroneous, arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable manner, or that he abused his discretion as the trier of fact and concluder of law in this appeal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Crowells filed a petition in the circuit court\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging that Assessor \"allowed an illegally imposed assessment or derivative thereof to be applied to [their] property\" and that the 2008 assessment\n   increase was based on the property's sale price whereas none other of the eleven properties sold in the Crowells' neighborhood between 2008 and 2015 received an assessment increase based on the sale price. The Crowells alleged this practice constituted \"disparate and discriminatory treatment,\" which violated the U.S. Constitution, the Missouri Constitution, and section 137.115.1. The Crowells sought \"a declaration of their rights and the duties of [Assessor].\" The Crowells also sought a \"Writ of Mandamus compelling [Assessor] to assess all real property in the County at [the] statutorily provided percentage of its true value in money.\" Assessor moved to dismiss, arguing the court could not provide the relief the Crowells sought. The trial court dismissed the Crowells' petition and they appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This Court reversed the trial court's dismissal, finding that although declaratory relief and mandamus were unavailable to the Crowells under sections 536.100 to 536.140, their petition had adequately stated a claim for judicial review because it alleged the Commission's decision violated constitutional provisions and was in excess of its statutory authority, two grounds for judicial review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crowell v.

First, they argue that the Commission erred in rejecting their argument that the 2008 assessment violated Missouri law and was thus void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   , \"irrespective of [the Crowells'] lack of standing to challenge the assessment at the time it was imposed.\" Second, the Crowells argue that the Commission's decision was \"contrary to law and unsupported by substantial evidence\" in that violations of the law were \"demonstrated, but overlooked\" and that the Commission erroneously concluded that the Crowells were required to prove intentional discrimination\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   that all other property in the same class was undervalued.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Challenge to the 2008 Assessment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Crowells appeal the Commission's finding that they lacked standing to challenge the legality of the 2008 assessment. The Commission applied the \"longstanding rule\" that \"individual taxpayer plaintiffs lack standing to challenge other taxpayers' property tax assessments, as they are not injured personally by others' assessment calculations.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

This is a correct statement of the law and the finding was supported by substantial evidence, as it was uncontroverted that the Crowells did not own the property until 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Crowells nevertheless argue that their \"lack of standing to challenge [Assessor's] actions in 2008 and the question of whether [the 2008 assessment] was illegal are clearly two separate and distinct issues.\" The Crowells argue that \"irrespective\" of their lack of standing, they could challenge the 2008 assessment because that assessment \"precipitated a chain of events which was directly and causally connected to the performance of the 2015 appraisal of the property, which in turn was the basis of the value as determined by the Board of Equalization for 2015.\" This argument fails, however, as a taxpayer lacks standing to challenge another taxpayer's assessment even if the assessment would result in a tax increase for the complaining taxpayer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Airport Tech Partners, LLP v.
