Witt, Judge\n  Community Treatment, Inc., Sue Curfman, Gene Bryan, and Judy Finnegan (collectively \"Community Treatment\") appeal the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cole County, Missouri, dismissing their First Amended Petition for Writ of Mandamus (\"Amended Petition\"). Community Treatment sought a writ mandating the Missouri Commission on Human Rights (the \"Commission\") withdraw a right-to-sue letter issued pursuant to section 213.111.1\n  <footnotemark>\n   1\n  </footnotemark>\n  to Danielle Brantley (\"Brantley\"), who sought to file suit against Community Treatment alleging Community Treatment discharged her in violation of the Missouri Human Rights Act (\"MHRA\")\n  <footnotemark>\n   2\n  </footnotemark>\n  and the reasons it provided for her termination were pretextual. Specifically, Community Treatment alleges the circuit court erred in granting the Commission's motion to dismiss both because the court improperly considered matters beyond the pleadings but also because it wrongfully concluded that the Amended Petition failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Because we have before us an incomplete record, we dismiss the appeal.\n </attorneys>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts are alleged in Community Treatment's First Amended Petition for Preliminary and Permanent Writs of Mandamus. Brantley was an employee of Community Treatment, Inc. from October 28, 2013, to February 11, 2016, at which time Community Treatment, Inc. terminated her employment. On August 19, 2016, Brantley filed a Charge of Discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") and the Commission alleging discrimination and retaliation on the part of Community Treatment, Inc., Sue Curfman and Gene Bryan, and later adding Judy Finnegan (\"Charge\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Charge was filed 190 days after Brantley's termination. The Commission corresponded with Brantley's attorney by email discussing the timeliness of Brantley's Charge. The Commission \"examined the charge and determined that it was untimely under Section 213.075, RSMo, because it was not filed within 180 days of Brantley's termination of employment.\" The Commission took no further action on the Charge and stopped its processing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Following a request by Brantley, on May 15, 2017, the Commission issued Brantley a right-to-sue letter indicating that the Commission had not made any determination as to its jurisdiction, but\n   was issuing the letter pursuant to Brantley's request. The Commission's statement in the right-to-sue letter, that it had not yet made any determination as to its jurisdiction, was incorrect because the Commission had already determined the Charge to be untimely filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 9, 2017, Community Treatment filed a petition for a preliminary writ and a writ of mandamus, which was later amended. Community Treatment sought a writ ordering the Commission to withdraw and vacate the right-to-sue letter and ordering the Commission to dismiss the underlying Charge for lack of jurisdiction. Brantley sought leave to intervene in the proceeding; the court granted her motion. On October 13, 2017, Community Treatment filed Suggestions in Support of its Amended Petition, including the filing of several exhibits. The Commission filed a motion to dismiss the Amended Petition on October 20, 2017 (\"Motion to Dismiss\"). Brantley filed her own motion to dismiss on October 23, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The court held a hearing on both motions on November 20, 2017 (\"Motion Hearing\"). Following the hearing, the court entered its judgment (\"Judgment\") dismissing the Amended Petition and quashing the preliminary writ on December 20, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"This Court reviews the grant of a motion to dismiss\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

The sole support for this contention was e-mail correspondence between the members of the investigative team at the Commission, an investigator with the EEOC, and Brantley's attorney. These e-mails were attached to Community Treatment's Suggestions in Support of its Amended Petition as Exhibits A and B. The over 100 pages of e-mails and their contents are uncontroverted, the parties instead disagree as to their ultimate legal effect. Community Treatment sees them as official notification of a formal finding by the Commission that they had made a determination that the Charge was untimely and stopped processing the Charge, thus ending Brantley's right to receive the right-to-sue letter. The Commission argues that the e-mails are insufficient to meet the statutory and regulatory requirements for completion of the administrative process and notification of that finding to a party and thus the Commission had no choice but to provide the right-to-sue letter to Brantley.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Section 213.111.1 states in relevant part that if \"the commission has not completed its administrative processing and the person aggrieved so requests in writing, the commission shall issue to the person claiming\n   to be aggrieved a letter indicating his or her right to bring a civil action within ninety days of such notice against the respondent named in the complaint.\" The regulations governing the closing of the administrative process state that when dismissal or administrative closure is deemed to be appropriate \"[t]he parties shall be notified by mail of the commission's dismissal or administrative closure and of complainant's right to appeal.\" 8 CSR 60-2.025(7)(C).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   This notification is necessary because \"[a]ny person aggrieved by dismissal of a complaint\" has only \"thirty (30) days after the mailing or delivery of the notice of dismissal\" to file an appeal. 8 CSR 60-2.025(7)(E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The emails cited by Community Treatment as a \"determination\" of untimeliness do not meet the regulatory requirements for the end of the administrative process or for providing a party notice of that determination. At best, they indicate that the Commission had identified a potential issue as to timeliness and corresponded with Brantley's attorney to better understand and evaluate the issue. While questions were raised, the emails do not make any final determination. Based on these documents, the last correspondence from any employee of the Commission to Brantley's attorney, prior to Brantley's request for a right-to-sue letter, contained a question seeking clarification of the EEOC's actions. Even viewing the correspondence in a light most favorable to Community Treatment, we find that to the extent a \"determination\" was made by anyone employed by the Commission, it is preliminary in nature. They were merely e-mails from an investigator employed by the Commission, there is no indication that the Commission itself considered or acted on the Charge in any fashion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Even if this did reflect that the Commission had made a final determination, the relevant inquiry is not the \"determination\" but whether the administrative process was complete. At the close of the administrative process the regulations require specific notice be mailed to the aggrieved party formally notifying such party of the determination and informing the aggrieved party that they have ninety days to initiate an appeal. The e-mails put forward by Community Treatment contain no such information which would serve as notification that the administrative process was complete. Therefore, even if this Court were to address the merits of the appeal, the lack of transcript requires us to presume that the case was properly converted to summary judgment and, when reviewed through the lens of review of summary judgment, we would conclude that the circuit court did not err in granting judgment in favor of the Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Community Treatment's second point on appeal alleges that the circuit court improperly dismissed the case because the Amended Petition did state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Either, this point suffers from the same lack of record as discussed above and we must dismiss, or the point is moot because the Judgment was ultimately a grant of summary judgment and thus a discussion of a motion to dismiss is irrelevant. We find that we cannot accurately review either point on appeal without first determining what type of motion was properly considered by the circuit court and that determination cannot be properly reviewed without a transcript of the hearing. Thus,\n   we have no choice but to dismiss the appeal for want of a complete record.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    All statutory references are to RSMo 2016, as currently updated through August 27, 2017.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Chapter 213 RSMo.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    \"When we consider whether a petition fails to state a claim, we accept all properly pleaded facts as true, giving the pleadings their broadest intendment.

Yet, in its Reply Brief, Community Treatment itself takes the position that such documents are irrelevant because they are not a part of the pleadings in the case, effectively conceding the point that all parties presented the court with evidence beyond the pleadings.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    This is not merely a theoretical point. Community Treatment states in its briefing that: \"Counsel for both the Commission and Brantley appeared at the same hearing and argued their motions--including extensive argument about matters outside the pleadings.\" This statement is made without citation to the record--because the transcript was not filed with this Court--and this Court has no ability to verify this statement or determine what matters outside the pleadings may have been considered by the court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    At oral argument it was Community Treatment's position that the Motion Hearing was held in the courtroom but off the record. The counsel for the Commission had no recollection as to whether the Motion Hearing was held on or off the record. This Court is hard pressed to understand how a hearing on a motion to dismiss could be held in the courtroom but somehow was \"off the record.\" Regardless, a transcript of that hearing is critical to this Court's analysis of the legal issues presented and the lack of a transcript prevents this Court from properly considering the issues raised by Community Treatment on appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    If the motion to dismiss was properly converted to a motion for summary judgment, this court can review the judgment \"if it is apparent that the parties and the court were informed of the issues, and there is no genuine factual dispute with respect to the evidence submitted to support the motion....\"\n    <em>\n     City of N.
