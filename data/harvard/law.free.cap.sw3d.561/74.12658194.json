The Initiative Petition proposes to amend various provisions of Article III of the Missouri Constitution, which addresses the legislative department, and add three new sections to Article III. Respondents and Cross-Appellants Paul Ritter and Daniel P. Mehan filed this lawsuit in the Circuit Court of Cole County pursuant to \u00a7 195.200,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   arguing that the Initiative Petition was invalid on multiple grounds, and that it should accordingly not appear on the ballot. Their lawsuit named Secretary of State John R. Ashcroft as the defendant. The proponents of the Initiative Petition,\n   Sean Soendker Nicholson and Clean Missouri, were permitted to intervene in the circuit court proceeding to defend the validity of the Petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The circuit court accepted two of Ritter and Mehan's challenges to the Initiative Petition. The court entered an injunction ordering the Secretary of State to rescind and withdraw his certification of the Initiative Petition, and instead issue a certificate finding the Initiative Petition to be insufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Nicholson and Clean Missouri appeal, arguing that the Initiative Petition is valid, and should appear on the November 2018 general election ballot. We reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Nicholson is a Missouri resident who serves as Deputy Treasurer of Clean Missouri. Clean Missouri is a campaign committee registered under chapter 130, RSMo; among its purposes is to support passage of the Initiative Petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On November 23, 2016, Nicholson submitted to the Secretary of State a sample sheet for what was later denominated Initiative Petition 2018-048. The Initiative Petition proposes to amend sections 2, 5, 7 and 19 of Article III of the Missouri Constitution, and to adopt three new sections to be known as sections 3, 20(c) and 20(d). A copy of the Petition is attached as an Appendix to this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Initiative Petition would:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 require legislators and employees of the General Assembly to wait two years after the conclusion of the legislative session in which they last worked, before they could serve as paid lobbyists (\u00a7 2);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 prohibit legislators and legislative employees from accepting gifts valued at more than $5.00 from paid lobbyists (\u00a7 2(a) );\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 prohibit candidates for the Senate from accepting campaign contributions of more than $2,500.00 in any one election cycle, and prohibit House candidates from accepting contributions of more than $2,000.00 (\u00a7 2(c) );\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 prohibit candidates from accepting contributions from any federal political action committee (\"PAC\"), unless the committee has filed the same financial disclosure reports as Missouri PACs (\u00a7 2(f) );\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 declare that legislative records are public records, and legislative proceedings are public meetings, subject to generally applicable public-access laws, including the \"Sunshine Law\" (\u00a7\u00a7 19(b) and (c) ); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 prohibit legislators and legislative candidates from engaging in political fundraising activities on State property (\u00a7 20(c) ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In addition, in new \u00a7 3, and in amendments to Article III, \u00a7 7, the Initiative Petition proposes to substantially modify the procedure for apportioning House and Senate Districts following a decennial census. (The reapportionment process for the House of Representatives currently appears in Article III, \u00a7 2.) The Petition proposes to establish a new position known as the \"non-partisan state demographer,\" to be selected through an application process overseen by the State Auditor, and with the participation of the majority and minority leaders of the Senate. The non-partisan state demographer is charged with preparing proposed legislative re-districting plans and maps following the decennial census. In preparing those redistricting proposals, the demographer is charged with giving the districts \"a total population as nearly equal as practicable to the ideal population for such districts,\" and with complying with the requirements\n   of the United States Constitution and federal laws, including the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The demographer is also directed that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Districts shall be designed in a manner that achieves both partisan fairness and, secondarily, competitiveness. Partisan fairness means that parties shall be able to translate their popular support into legislative representation with approximately equal efficiency. Competitiveness means that parties' legislative representation shall be substantially and similarly responsive to shifts in the electorate's preferences.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Petition also directs the demographer to consider geographic contiguity, the boundaries of existing political subdivisions, and the compactness of the proposed districts. These considerations, however, are expressly subordinated to consideration of equal population, compliance with federal law, and partisan fairness and competitiveness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Sections 3 and 7 of the Petition provide that, within six months following the release of the decennial census results, the non-partisan state demographer shall file with the Secretary of State \"a tentative plan of apportionment and map of the proposed districts, as well as all demographic and partisan data used in the creation of the plan and map.\" The Petition largely retains the procedure found in the current Missouri Constitution for the Governor to select House and Senate reapportionment commissions with legislator input. Under the Petition, the reapportionment commissions are charged with holding at least three public hearings concerning the demographer's proposed apportionment plan. The commissions may make modifications to the demographer's proposed plan and map, but only \"by a vote of at least seven-tenths of the commissioners.\" The Petition provides that, \"[i]f no changes are made or approved as provided for in this subsection, the tentative plan of apportionment and map of proposed districts shall become final.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On December 6, 2016, the Secretary of State approved the Initiative Petition as to form. On January 5, 2017, the Secretary certified the official ballot title for the Petition. The summary statement portion of the official ballot title, written by the Secretary of State, reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Shall the Missouri Constitution be amended to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 change process and criteria for redrawing legislative districts during reapportionment;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 change limits on campaign contributions that candidates for state legislature can accept from individuals or entities;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 establish a limit on gifts that state legislators, and their employees, can accept from paid lobbyists;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 prohibit state legislators, and their employees, from serving as paid lobbyists for a period of time;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 prohibit political fundraising by candidates for or members of the state legislature on State property; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \u2022 require legislative records and proceedings to be open to the public?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Clean Missouri gathered signatures on the Petition, and submitted those signatures to the Secretary of State on May 3, 2018. On August 2, 2018, the Secretary issued a certificate finding that 231,460 of the signatures submitted by Clean Missouri were valid. The Secretary found that the Initiative Petition complied with the requirements of the Missouri Constitution and chapter 116, RSMo, and directed that it be placed on the November 6, 2018 general election ballot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Ritter and Mehan filed substantially similar petitions in the Circuit Court of\n   Cole County, alleging that the Initiative Petition was invalid on multiple grounds, and that the Secretary of State's certification of the Petition was erroneous and should be enjoined. Ritter and Mehan made the following claims: (1) that the Petition contains more than one subject in violation of Article III, \u00a7 50 and Article XII, \u00a7 2(b) of the Missouri Constitution (Count I); (2) that the Petition amends multiple articles of the Missouri Constitution in violation of Article III, \u00a7 50 and Article XII, \u00a7 2(b) (Count II); (3) that the Petition failed to properly set forth the text of the proposed measure, and of the constitutional provisions being amended or repealed, in violation of Article III, \u00a7 50 and \u00a7 116.050 (Count III); and (4) that the Petition fails to identify all provisions of the Constitution that would be amended or repealed by the Petition's adoptions, in violation of Article III, \u00a7 50 and Article XII, \u00a7 2(b) (Count IV).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The two cases were consolidated for hearing, and submitted to the circuit court on stipulated facts. Although Ritter and Mehan's petitions named only the Secretary of State as a defendant, Nicholson and Clean Missouri were permitted to intervene in both cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On September 14, 2018, the circuit court entered its Final Judgment and Order. The circuit court found on Count I that the Initiative Petition improperly addressed more than a single subject, because \"the twenty or so substantive changes outlined in the Petition relate to at least two different and extremely broad purposes: (1) the organization of the General Assembly; and (2) ethics or campaign finance regulation aimed at avoiding misconduct by public officials in multiple branches and levels of government.\" The court found that, in this regard, the Initiative Petition \"is hauntingly similar to a petition the Missouri Supreme Court found to violate the single subject rule in\n   <em>\n    Missourians to Protect the Initiative Process\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    v. Blunt\n   </em>\n   ], 799 S.W.2d [824,] 830 [ (Mo. banc 1990) ].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The circuit court also found in Ritter and Mehan's favor on Count II, which alleged that the Petition violates Article III, \u00a7 50 and Article XII, \u00a7 2(b) of the Missouri Constitution because it amends or repeals provisions of more than one article of the Constitution. Although Nicholson and Clean Missouri argued that the Initiative Petition only regulates the legislature, and was confined to revising provisions of Article III of the Missouri Constitution, the circuit court concluded that the Petition addresses non-legislative matters currently addressed outside of Article III. Thus, the circuit court found that the Petition: would prohibit lobbying of the executive branch by \"private employees\" (namely, former legislators or legislative employees); would modify the campaign contribution limits enacted by initiative at the 2016 general election, which appear in Article VIII, \u00a7 23; would prohibit candidates for executive offices from accepting contributions from federal PACs in certain circumstances; would prohibit fundraising on state property for non-legislative races; would \"create a new executive office called the [non-partisan] state demographer\"; and would impose new duties on the State Auditor relating to the selection of the demographer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The circuit court rejected, however, Ritter and Mehan's claim that the Initiative\n   Petition violated Article III, \u00a7 50 and \u00a7 116.150 by failing to accurately set out the text of the proposed new or revised constitutional provisions, and the text of the existing constitutional provisions to be repealed. The court found that Ritter and Mehan's complaints about the text of the Initiative Petition implicated only the requirements of \u00a7 116.150, not the requirements of the Constitution, and that \"substantial compliance\" with the statutory requirements was all that was required. The court found that \"the errors identified by Plaintiffs are tantamount to scrivener's errors,\" which \"do not alter the meaning or purpose of the constitutional text and thus do not rise to a level of misleading voters.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Finally, the circuit court concluded that the Petition did not violate Article III, \u00a7 50, Article XII, \u00a7 2(b), or \u00a7 116.050, by failing to identify all provisions of the Constitution which would be repealed or amended by the Petition. The court concluded that the other provisions Ritter and Mehan argued were affected by the Petition were merely \"amend[ed] by implication,\" and were therefore not required to be mentioned in the Petition. The court observed that Ritter and Mehan's Count IV \"sets an impossible standard for the proponents to meet [ ] and is therefore denied.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Based on its finding that the Initiative Petition was defective in the respects alleged in Counts I and II of the Ritter and Mehan petitions, the circuit court entered an injunction ordering \"the Secretary of State to rescind and withdraw his certification of sufficiency of the Petition and issue a certificate of insufficiency for the Petition\"; the court's judgment also purports to enjoin \"all other officers from printing the measure on the ballot.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Nicholson and Clean Missouri filed their notices of appeal from the circuit court's judgment on the same day the judgment was entered, September 14, 2018. Ritter and Mehan thereafter filed cross-appeals to challenge the circuit court's rejection of the alternative arguments asserted in their Counts III and IV.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We entered a stay of the circuit court's judgment on September 18, 2018, and have heard and decided the appeal on a substantially expedited schedule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    Appellate Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In a letter dated September 19, 2018, Ritter's counsel argued that this appeal falls within the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the Missouri Supreme Court under Article V, \u00a7 3 of the Missouri Constitution. Counsel's letter noted that, in their briefing Nicholson and Clean Missouri argue that,\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     if\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   the Initiative Petition is invalid because it fails to comply with the technical requirements of \u00a7 116.050,\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     then\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 116.050 constitutes an unconstitutional\n   burden on their right to invoke the initiative process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The alternative constitutional argument asserted in Nicholson and Clean Missouri's cross-appeal response brief does not invoke the Supreme Court's exclusive appellate jurisdiction. In order to invoke the Supreme Court's exclusive jurisdiction based on a challenge to the validity of a state statute, the constitutional challenge must be \" 'real and substantial, not merely colorable.' \"\n   <em>\n    Kirk v.

They did not raise the issue in their trial briefs filed with the circuit court, either. From all that appears from the record on appeal, the issue was not raised in the circuit court in\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   fashion. In these circumstances, the constitutional claim was waived, it is accordingly not real and substantial, and it does not invoke the Supreme Court's exclusive appellate jurisdiction under Article V, \u00a7 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In their response to the letter from Ritter's counsel, Nicholson and Clean Missouri claim that they did not intend to assert a constitutional challenge to the validity of \u00a7 116.050. Instead, they assert that they merely intended to invoke the doctrine of \"constitutional avoidance\": that this Court should not interpret \u00a7 116.050 as Ritter and Mehan suggest in order to avoid a constitutional problem. If this is what Nicholson and Clean Missouri's appellate arguments intended, the result is the same: jurisdiction properly lies in this Court. To invoke the Supreme Court's exclusive jurisdiction, \" 'the constitutionality of the statute must be directly challenged. To say that a statute would be unconstitutional if construed in a certain manner does not meet the requirement.' \"\n   <em>\n    City of Slater v.

When courts are called upon to intervene in the initiative process, they must act with restraint, trepidation and a healthy suspicion of the partisan who would use the judiciary to prevent the initiative process from taking its course. Constitutional and statutory provisions relative to initiative are liberally construed to make effective the people's reservation of that power.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    Missourians to Protect the Initiative Process v.

None of the provisions of the Initiative Petition relate to the other subdivisions of Article III - which specify procedural rules for legislative proceedings; substantive limitations on legislative power; the State lottery; and the initiative and referendum mechanisms. As stated previously, all of the provisions in the Initiative Petition seek to regulate the manner in which legislators are elected and how they conduct themselves, to limit the influence of partisan or other special interests. Because all of the Petition's proposals properly fall within the matters addressed in the first subdivision of existing Article III, they address \"one subject and matters properly connected therewith\" as the phrase was interpreted in\n   <em>\n    Blunt\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In the\n   <em>\n    Blunt\n   </em>\n   case, the Missouri Supreme Court held that an initiative petition violated Article III, \u00a7 50 's \"single subject\" rule because the proposed constitutional revisions addressed two different subjects: \"1) a general reorganization of the legislative department including the number of members and session length of the General Assembly, article III matters, and 2) the general regulation of the conduct of public officials, [including executive branch officials,] an article VII matter.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11758840\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/799/824/#p827\">\n    799 S.W.2d at 832\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

From this description of the proposal, it is apparent that the\n   amendment would substantially reorganize the legislature and, at the same time, impose constitutional ethical restrictions on officers, officials, and employees of the legislative and executive departments.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11758840\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/799/824/#p827\">\n    799 S.W.2d at 831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The circuit court's judgment concluded that the Initiative Petition in this case was \"hauntingly similar\" to the petition at issue in the\n   <em>\n    Blunt\n   </em>\n   case, because \"the Petition combines a redesign of the process and standards for drawing General Assembly districts ... with a series of provisions meant to avoid misconduct by public officials in all three branches of state government, as well as county and local governments....\" The circuit court cited a number of respects in which it believed the Petition extended beyond the legislature. We conclude that the Petition does not regulate other branches of government in the manner the circuit court found.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The circuit court first held that the two-year waiting period before legislators or legislative employees could serve as paid lobbyists (\u00a7 2) extended beyond the proper scope of Article III, because \"it applies to any lobbying, including lobbying of the executive branch,\" and \"purports to block private employees ... from lobbying the executive branch.\" Contrary to the circuit court's characterization, \u00a7 2 proposes to regulate the conduct of present and former legislators and legislative-branch employees,\n   <em>\n    based on\n   </em>\n   their service in the legislative branch; it does not purport to regulate the conduct of \"private employees\" generally. Moreover, while \u00a7 2 may prevent legislators and legislative employees from lobbying the executive as well as legislative branches, the focus of the provision is on the conduct of legislative-branch officials, not on the governmental agencies to which their lobbying activity might be directed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Next, the circuit court cited \u00a7 2(c) of the Petition, which provides that \"[t]he General Assembly shall make no law authorizing unlimited campaign contributions to candidates for the General Assembly, nor any law that circumvents the contribution limits contained in this Constitution.\" The circuit court complained that the \"anti-circumvention\" provisions improperly \"applies to contributions to candidates for executive branch offices, candidates for judicial offices, political parties, and political party committees,\" and therefore extends beyond the purpose of regulating legislative matters. We are not persuaded. First, it is plain from the face of \u00a7 2(c) that it prohibits conduct\n   <em>\n    by the General Assembly\n   </em>\n   , the branch of government addressed in Article III. Further, \"the contribution limits\" to which the \"anti-circumvention\" provision applies appear to be the limits on \"campaign contributions to candidates for the General Assembly\" referenced in the first part of the sentence. Even if the \"anti-circumvention\" provision is interpreted to apply to contribution limits governing non-legislative elections, like the lobbying restrictions the primary focus of \u00a7 2(c) is plainly to prevent\n   <em>\n    the legislature\n   </em>\n   from facilitating the evasion of the contribution limits specified in the Constitution, not on the nature of the elections the legislature is restricted from regulating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   As a third example, the circuit court's judgment cites \u00a7 2(f) of the Petition, which provides that \"[n]o candidate shall accept contributions from any federal political action committee unless the committee has filed the same financial disclosure reports that would be required of a Missouri political action committee.\" The circuit court concluded that this provision imposes limitations on non-legislative candidates, since it is not expressly limited to candidates for legislative office. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Missouri Supreme Court has explained that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   The fundamental purpose of constitutional construction is to give effect to the intent of the voters who adopted the Amendment. Traditional rules of construction dictate looking at words in the context of both the particular provision in which they are located and the entire amendment in which the provision is located.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   Context determines meaning.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <em>\n    Keller v.

If adopted, \u00a7 2(f) will be inserted into Article III of the Missouri Constitution, and it appears in what would be a new \u00a7 2, which addresses legislators' receipt of gifts, post-legislative employment, and receipt of campaign contributions. In addition, the three sub-sections immediately preceding subsection (f) all relate to the campaign contributions received by candidates for legislative office.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   While \u00a7 2(f) may use the unqualified term \"candidate,\" the context in which that term appears clearly indicates that the provision addresses only candidates for legislative office; the provision does not improperly regulate candidates for other offices.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The circuit court also focused on the redistricting provisions included in the Initiative Petition, and observed that these provisions \"create a new executive office called the state demographer, and assign a new duty to another executive branch official, the State Auditor, to select all candidates for the office of state demographer.\" While \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 7 of the Petition may incidentally place responsibilities on the State Auditor, and create the position of non-partisan state demographer,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   the central purpose of those provisions is to specify the manner in which legislative districts are reapportioned following a decennial census. The reapportionment of legislative districts is plainly a legislative matter which has been addressed in the first subdivision of Article III since the adoption of the 1945 Constitution. Sections 3 and 7 are plainly connected with the central purpose of the Initiative Petition, to regulate the election and conduct of legislators and legislative employees to limit the influence of partisan or other special interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   It is significant in this regard that the existing reapportionment provisions contained in Article III already involve the executive and judicial branches in the redistricting process: the Governor appoints the members of the House and Senate\n   reapportionment commissions; and members of the judiciary serve on a reapportionment commission of last resort, in the event the commission appointed by the Governor is unable to come to a resolution. Given that the\n   <em>\n    existing\n   </em>\n   reapportionment process specified in Article III already involves officials from other branches of government, the fact that the Initiative Petition's proposed reapportionment process does likewise is not surprising, nor improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   As a final example of ways in which the Initiative Petition would purportedly regulate non-legislative officials and agencies, the circuit court cited \u00a7 20(c) of the Petition, which prohibits \"any member of or candidate for the general assembly\" from engaging in \"political fundraising activities\" \"in or on any premises, property or building owned, leased or controlled by the State of Missouri or any agency or division thereof.\" Section 20(c) explicitly provides that it applies to fundraising activities or events \"supporting or opposing any candidate, initiative petition, referendum petition, ballot measure, political party or political committee.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The circuit court held that, because \u00a7 20(c) applies to non-legislative political contests, \"[i]n most applications, this will be primarily a regulation of those other campaigns and the use of state property-not of the legislature.\" We disagree. As we explained with respect to the conduct restrictions in \u00a7 2 of the Initiative Petition, \u00a7 20(c) is primarily directed at legislators and candidates for legislative office. The purpose of the provision is to prevent those persons from engaging in specified political activity on public property. The\n   <em>\n    nature\n   </em>\n   of the political activity which is prohibited, and the\n   <em>\n    location\n   </em>\n   where legislators and legislative candidates are prohibited from engaging in that activity, are plainly secondary considerations. We also question the circuit court's conclusion that the political activities which \u00a7 20(c) would prohibit \"primarily\" relate to non-legislative races. We presume that, for most legislators and legislative candidates, their\n   <em>\n    primary\n   </em>\n   political activities involve their own legislative elections, even if they might also assist other political candidates and causes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   For all of these reasons, we reverse the circuit court's conclusion that the Initiative Petition violates the \"single subject\" restriction contained in Article III, \u00a7 50, and in Article XII, \u00a7 2(b), of the Missouri Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   In Count II of their petitions, Ritter and Mehan argued that the Initiative Petition improperly amends or revises more than one article of the Missouri Constitution, in violation of Article III, \u00a7 50, and Article XII, \u00a7 2(b) of the Constitution. The circuit court found that the Initiative Petition violates the \"single article\" principle for many of the same reasons the court concluded that the Petition violated the \"single subject\" requirement: because it regulates and imposes duties on non-legislative officials and activities; and because it directly conflicts with the campaign contribution limits stated in Article VIII, \u00a7 23.3(1)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Ritter and Mehan's arguments in support of their \"single article\" challenge are similar to the arguments they make in support of their \"single subject\" argument (discussed in \u00a7 1, above), and in support of their argument that the Petition improperly fails to notify voters of the provisions of other Articles with which the Petition's provisions directly conflict (discussed in \u00a7 IV, below). As we explain in connection with those other arguments: even though the provisions of the Initiative Petition may incidentally affect non-legislative officials\n   and activities, the provisions of \u00a7 2 of the Petition are not directed to regulating non-legislative officials, non-legislative elections, or non-legislative activities; the placement of certain additional duties on the State Auditor, and the creation of the position of non-partisan state demographer, are primarily related to the modification of the legislative redistricting process, and only incidentally place additional duties on non-legislative officials; the placement of additional duties on the State Auditor does not directly conflict with Article IV, \u00a7 13 of the Constitution, which specifies the Auditor's other duties; and the campaign contribution limits specified in \u00a7 2(c) of the Petition do not directly conflict with, or repeal, the uniform contribution limits for all State elections specified in Article VIII, \u00a7 23.3(1)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   On its face, the Initiative Petition does not amend any provisions of the Constitution other than those contained in Article III. For the reasons explained in greater detail in \u00a7\u00a7 I and IV of this opinion, we conclude that the Petition does not implicitly amend provisions of other Articles. But even if the Petition\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   amend constitutional provisions beyond Article III, it is well-established that \"[a] proposal may amend several articles in the constitution so long as all proposals are germane to a single purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Comm. for a Healthy Future, Inc. v.

Among other things, Ritter and Mehan complained that the Petition misquotes the text of current Article III, \u00a7 2 (addressing the reapportionment of legislative districts) which the Petition proposes to delete. The circuit court rejected this claim on the basis that \"[t]he requirement to bracket all deleted matter ... is not found in Missouri's Constitution,\" but is instead \"a statutory requirement which merely requires substantial compliance.\" The court found that \"the errors identified by Plaintiffs are tantamount to scrivener's errors\" which \"do not alter the meaning or purpose of the constitutional text and thus do not rise to a level of misleading voters.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Ritter and Mehan argue that the requirement to accurately state the current constitutional text slated for deletion derives both from Article III, \u00a7 50, and from \u00a7 116.050.2. As relevant here, Article III, \u00a7 50 provides that an initiative petition must contain \"the full text of the measure.\" Section 116.050.2 provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   The full and correct text of all initiative and referendum petition measures shall:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   (1) Contain all matter which is to be deleted included in its proper place enclosed\n   in brackets and all new matter shown underlined;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   (2) Include all sections of existing law or of the constitution which would be repealed by the measure; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   (3) Otherwise conform to the provisions of Article III, Section 28 and Article III, Section 50 of the Constitution and those of this chapter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Ritter and Mehan cite no authority which holds that the constitutional requirement that an initiative petition include \"the full text of the measure\" includes the requirement that all text proposed to be deleted be set forth in full. Notably, this requirement is made explicit in the implementing statute, which requires that the petition \"[c]ontain all matter which is to be deleted included in its proper place enclosed in brackets.\" \u00a7 116.050.2(1). We also note that Article III, \u00a7 50, which requires that an initiative petition contain \"the full text of the measure,\" contrasts with Article III, \u00a7 28, which specifies the required format for bills amending existing statutes. Article III, \u00a7 28 provides in relevant part that \"[n]o act shall be amended by providing that words be stricken out or inserted, but the words to be stricken out, or the words to be inserted, or the words to be stricken out and those inserted in lieu thereof, together with the act or section amended, shall be set forth in full as amended.\" Ritter and Mehan ask us, without supporting authority, to hold that Article III, \u00a7 50\n   <em>\n    implicitly\n   </em>\n   requires what Article III, \u00a7 28 and \u00a7 116.050.2(1) require expressly.

We consider the claim in Count III - that the Initiative Petition failed to accurately reproduce the existing constitutional language proposed to be deleted - as a claim solely under \u00a7 116.050.2(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Although in the circuit court Ritter and Mehan raised multiple formatting and typographical errors in the Petition in support of Count III, on appeal they focus on a single error: the misquotation of a single phrase of the existing constitutional text slated for deletion by the Initiative Petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   In connection with the reapportionment of House districts following a decennial census, the Initiative Petition proposes to delete the following five paragraphs which currently appear in Article III, \u00a7 2. The Petition accurately includes all five paragraphs in brackets, the formatting convention specified in \u00a7 116.050.2(1). We have put in bold-face and brackets the true constitutional text which the Petition erroneously omitted; we have used italics and underlining to indicate the text which mistakenly appears in the Petition.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   The commission shall reapportion the representatives by dividing the population of the state by the number one hundred sixty-three and shall establish each district so that the population of that district shall, as nearly as possible, equal that figure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   Each district shall be composed of contiguous territory as compact as may be.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   Not later than five months after the appointment of the commission\n   <strong>\n    [,]\n   </strong>\n   the commission shall\n   <strong>\n    [file with the secretary of state a]\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     receive the\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   tentative plan of apportionment and map of the proposed districts\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     ordered in subsection 4 of this section\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   and during the ensuing fifteen days shall hold such public hearings as may be necessary to hear objections or testimony of interested persons.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   Not later than six months after the appointment of the commission, the commission shall file with the secretary of state a final statement of the numbers and the boundaries of the districts together with a map of the districts, and no statement shall be valid unless approved by at least seven-tenths of the members.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   After the statement is filed members of the house of representatives shall be elected according to such districts until a reapportionment is made as herein provided, except that if the statement is not filed within six months of the time fixed for the appointment of the commission, it shall stand discharged and the house of representatives shall be apportioned by a commission of six members appointed from among the judges of the appellate courts of the state of Missouri by the state supreme court, a majority of whom shall sign and file its apportionment plan and map with the secretary of state within ninety days of the date of the discharge of the apportionment commission. Thereafter members of the house of representatives shall be elected according to such districts until a reapportionment is made as herein provided.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   In evaluating whether the errors illustrated above invalidate the Initiative Petition, we are mindful that statutory requirements must not be applied in an overly strict or technical manner. The Supreme Court has instructed that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   Statutes implementing the constitutionally created initiative process should not restrict or limit the electorate's power. Although the implementing statutes are required to be followed, failure to adhere to mere technical formalities should not deny the people the power to propose changes to our laws or amendments to our constitution. Substantial compliance with the implementing statutes is all that is required.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <em>\n    Comm. for a Healthy Future, Inc. v.

The main innovations proposed by the Initiative Petition for the redistricting process are to alter the substantive standards which guide the drawing of new districts, and to provide for a non-partisan official to create a reapportionment plan which the House and Senate reapportionment commissions can only modify by super-majority votes. The thrust of the Petition is not to alter the procedures under which the existing reapportionment commissions operate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The misquotations in the Petition relate only to how the existing House reapportionment commission publicizes its tentative reapportionment plans and maps prior to holding public hearings. The Petition accurately quotes the provisions laying out the timetable for the commission's work, requiring the commission to hold public hearings, specifying how the commission adopts a final reapportionment plan, and specifying the effect of the commission's adoption of that plan. Importantly, the Petition accurately reflects that substantial portions of the existing reapportionment process will be repealed, and accurately indicates the beginning and ending of the deleted matter. Given the nature of the amendments proposed by the Initiative, and the nature of the misquotation Ritter and Mehan have identified, we agree with the circuit court that the error does not present a risk of misleading voters as to the merits of the Initiative Petition. The circuit court correctly held that the Petition's\n   minor technical noncompliance with the requirements of \u00a7 116.050.2(1) provided no basis to declare the Petition invalid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Ritter and Mehan also argue that the circuit court erred in rejecting Count IV of their petitions, which argued that the Initiative Petition was defective because it failed to identify the existing provisions of the Constitution with which the provisions of the Petition were in direct conflict, and which would accordingly be repealed by the Petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Ritter and Mehan cite to both Article III, \u00a7 50 and \u00a7 116.050 to support their claim that the Initiative Petition was required to identify existing constitutional provisions with which the Initiative Petition was in \"direct conflict.\" The relevant text of Article III, \u00a7 50 provides that \"[e]very [initiative] petition ... shall contain ... the full text of the measure.\" Section 116.050.2(2) provides in relevant part that \"[t]he full and correct text of all initiative and referendum petition measures shall ... [i]nclude all sections of existing law or of the constitution which would be repealed by the measure....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The parties debate whether the requirement to set forth the constitutional provisions which an initiative would repeal is imposed by the Constitution, or instead solely by \u00a7 116.050; they also debate whether compliance with the requirement must be strict, or only substantial. It is unnecessary for us to resolve this issue, because whether the requirement to identify directly conflicting provisions of existing law is of constitutional or statutory origin, the Initiative Petition did not violate it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   In order for provisions proposed in an initiative petition to be in \"direct conflict\" with existing law, it is not enough that the provisions of existing law \"will be changed or affected by the amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    Buchanan v.

The latter provision sets a limits of $2,600.00 in per-cycle contributions in races \"[t]o elect an individual to the office of governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, state treasurer, state auditor, attorney general, office of state senator, office of state representative or any other state or judicial office.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The contribution limits established in \u00a7 2(c) of the Initiative Petition do not \"directly conflict\" with Article VIII, \u00a7 23.3(1)(a), for at least two reasons: first, \u00a7 2(c) merely imposes additional limitations on certain political contributions regulated by \u00a7 23.3(1)(a), and it is obviously possible for individuals to comply with the restrictions in both provisions; and second, \u00a7 2(c) will not wholly supplant the contribution limits specified in \u00a7 23.3(1)(a), which will remain effective with respect to all state-wide executive elections, as well as judicial elections. This is\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   a case where \u00a7 2(c) \"contains provisions so contrary to or irreconcilable with those of [\u00a7 23.3(1)(a) ] that only one of the two statutes can stand in force.\"\n   <em>\n    Knight\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6942807\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/282/9/\">\n    282 S.W.3d at 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The lack of a \"direct conflict\" in this case is illustrated by the Missouri Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Buchanan\n   </em>\n   , and by our decision in\n   <em>\n    Knight\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Buchanan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9958107\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/615/6/#p15\">\n    615 S.W.2d 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , involved the initiative petition which adopted the constitutional taxing and spending limitations known as the \"Hancock Amendment.\" Although the initiative petition listed twenty-eight existing sections of the Constitution which would be affected by its adoption, challengers of the amendment argued that the petition failed to mention many others. For example, \u00a7 16 of the initiative provided that \"[p]roperty taxes and other local taxes and state taxation and spending may not be increased above the limitations specified herein without direct voter approval as provided by this constitution.\" The petition's challengers argued that this provision would directly conflict with Article IV, Section 34 of the existing Constitution, which provided that \"the state auditor shall determine the rate of taxation ... necessary to raise the amount of money needed to pay the principal and interest maturing in the next succeeding year....\" Although the existing constitution gave the State Auditor the authority to determine an appropriate rate of taxation, and the amendment limited that authority by requiring voter approval where the Hancock Amendment's limitations would be exceeded, the Supreme Court found none of the Hancock Amendment's far-reaching provisions \"are in direct conflict with or are irreconcilably repugnant to the Constitution.\"\n   <em>\n    Buchanan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9958107\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/615/6/#p15\">\n    615 S.W.2d at 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Knight\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6942807\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/282/9/\">\n    282 S.W.3d 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , an initiative petition proposed to cap the number of excursion gambling boat licenses\n   which could be issued by the Missouri Gaming Commission at \"the number of licenses which have been approved for excursion gambling boats already built and those [currently] under construction.\" Challengers argued that the initiative petition was in direct conflict with \u00a7 313.812.1, RSMo 2000 (which provided that the Gaming Commission \"shall decide the number, location and type of excursion gambling boat[s] in a city or county\"); with \u00a7 313.805(2), RSMo 2000 (which gave the Commission the power \"[t]o license the operators of excursion gambling boats ... and adopt standards for licensing\"); and with \u00a7 313.004.5, RSMo 2000 (which transferred to the Commission \"all the authority [previously held by the state tourism commission] relating to the regulation of excursion gambling boats\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   We concluded that the conflict between the initiative petition, and the Gaming Commission's existing statutory authority, was not so direct as to require that \u00a7\u00a7 313.812.1, 313.805(2), and 313.004.5, be identified as provisions \"repealed\" by the initiative. We explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   Here, Proposition A's limitation on the number of licenses that may be issued is\n   <em>\n    a limitation on the statutory authority\n   </em>\n   of the Gaming Commission granted by sections 313.812.1, 313.805, and 313.004. It consequently\n   <em>\n    affects or modifies these provisions\n   </em>\n   of chapter 313. Proposition A is not, however, so irreconcilable with these provisions that it necessarily negates them. Consequently, they were not \"deleted\" or \"repealed,\" and section 116.050 did not require the petition to include these sections.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6942807\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/282/9/\">\n    282 S.W.3d at 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Knight\n   </em>\n   , the Gaming Commission had pre-existing authority to determine \"the number ... of excursion gambling boat[s] in a city or county,\" to issue licenses and adopt standards for licensing, and to exercise \"all the authority ... relating to the regulation of excursion gambling boats.\" If adopted, the initiative would sharply curtail the Commission's pre-existing regulatory and licensing authority, by capping the number of excursion gambling boat licenses at the number in existence on the date the initiative became effective. Although the initiative would impose a specific numerical limit on the Commission's previously unlimited authority to issue gambling boat licenses, we held that the initiative merely \"limit[ed],\" \"affect[ed]\" or \"modifie[d]\" the Commission's licensing authority, but did not repeal or negate it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   The same is true here. The contributions limits in the Initiative Petition do not repeal or negate the contribution limits specified in Article VIII, \u00a7 23.3(1)(a). Section 2(c) of the Initiative Petition merely \"modifies\" and \"limits\" the contribution limit specified in \u00a7 23.3(1)(a), with respect to only two of the categories of elections to which \u00a7 23.3(1)(a) applies. The limits in \u00a7 23.3(1)(a) continue to apply to all contested state elections. If the Petition passes, contributors to state legislative races will also have to comply with the limits in \u00a7 2(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Ritter and Mehan also argue that the \u00a7 3 of the Initiative Petition, which obligates the State Auditor to oversee the process by which the non-partisan state demographer is selected, is in \"direct conflict\" with Article IV, \u00a7 13, which specifies that \"[n]o duty shall be imposed on [the State Auditor] by law which is not related to the supervising and auditing of the receipt and expenditure of public funds.\" Section 3 of the Initiative Petition is not in conflict with this provision, however. The new constitutional provisions which the Initiative Petition proposes are not the type of \"laws\" to which Article IV, \u00a7 13 is referring; the prohibition on imposing new\n   duties on the State Auditor does not apply to provisions of the Constitution itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   It is well-established that the term \"law\" as used in the Constitution generally refers to a\n   <em>\n    statute.\n   </em>\n   Thus, in\n   <em>\n    Thompson v.

The proposition there under consideration amended article X, relating to taxation. Arguably, the proposal included six subjects: 1) a taxation lid on state government; 2) a spending lid on state government; 3) a directive that state government continue financial support of local government; 4) a tax lid on local government; 5) limits on local governments obtaining revenues based on assessments and property; and 6) a grant of original jurisdiction to the Supreme Court to hear taxpayer suits to enforce the provisions of the amendment. The proposal contained matters that had the effect of limiting the authority of the legislature and granted jurisdiction to the judiciary, subjects previously found in article III and article V, respectively. Nevertheless, the Court found a readily identifiable and reasonably narrow purpose that knitted all the diverse provisions together. The central purpose was to limit taxes and spending by state and local government.\n    <em>\n     Buchanan v.

But all of these issues fairly fall within the scope of the first subdivision of Article III of the current Constitution, and under\n    <em>\n     Blunt\n    </em>\n    , that is enough to render these matters \"one subject.\" Notably, Ritter and Mehan do not argue that the Petition is invalid simply because it simultaneously addresses both legislator ethics and the reapportionment of legislative districts. Instead, their \"one subject\" challenge focuses on the purported effect of the Initiative Petition on non-legislative officials and candidates, and on other articles of the Constitution.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-161\">\n    This includes \u00a7 2(e).

But \u00a7 23.7 specifies that it defines certain terms solely \"[a]s used in this section.\" Rather than looking to a definition of \"candidate\" which expressly does not apply, the more appropriate course is to look at the context in which the word appears in proposed \u00a7 2 of the Initiative Petition.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-163\">\n    It is not at all clear that the non-partisan state demographer is properly characterized as an executive-branch employee. That individual's sole function is to prepare tentative legislative reapportionment plans and maps, for consideration by the House and Senate reapportionment commissions appointed by the Governor. Given that the demographer's sole role is to assist in legislative redistricting, it is arguable that the demographer is more properly characterized as a legislative-branch official.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-164\">\n    We note that, in\n    <em>\n     Boeving v.

In\n    <em>\n     Boeving\n    </em>\n    , the Court stated:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-165\">\n    This Court has been unwilling in the past to construe the constitutional provisions reserving to the people the power to propose constitutional amendments to impose any requirement that a measure's proponents identify every provision of the existing constitution that the proposed amendment might conceivably alter or affect if and when the proposed amendment is approved by the voters and put into operation. Nor is this Court willing to construe article III, section 50, to prohibit voters from approving or rejecting a constitutional amendment proposed by initiative petition simply because the proposed amendment may (if and when it goes into operation) be construed to alter or affect the application of a preexisting constitutional provision. By its terms, article III, section 50 is concerned only with what a proposed constitutional amendment \"contains,\" not with what a proposed constitutional amendment will or might do if the voters approve it.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-166\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6774825\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/496/498/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6774825\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/496/498/\">\n     at 509\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (citations omitted). Whether or not a requirement to identify \"directly conflicting\" provisions of law exists under Article III, \u00a7 50 or not, the Initiative Petition still had to comply with the requirement of \u00a7 116.050.2(2) that it \"[i]nclude all sections of ... the constitution which would be repealed by the measure....\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-167\">\n    Ritter and Mehan also claim that \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 7 of the Initiative Petition, which eliminate any role for the judiciary in the legislative redistricting process, directly conflict with Article V, \u00a7 4.3 of the Constitution, which specifies the manner in which the Supreme Court shall select the \"fall-back\" judicial reapportionment commission. Ritter and Mehan did not assert this implied repeal argument in the circuit court, however, and we accordingly do not address it. We note, however, that although the Initiative Petition may not have expressly told voters that the Petition would make it unnecessary for the Supreme Court to appoint a judicial reapportionment commission using the procedures specified in Article V, \u00a7 4.3, the Petition clearly states that the Petition would eliminate any role for a judicial commission in the legislative redistricting process, as specified in current Article III, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 7. Voters who read the Initiative Petition would be well aware that no judicial reapportionment commission would ever be appointed if the Initiative Petition passes.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    The stay of the circuit court's judgment previously entered by this Court shall remain in effect until the issuance of this Court's mandate, or the issuance of a contrary order by the Supreme Court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
