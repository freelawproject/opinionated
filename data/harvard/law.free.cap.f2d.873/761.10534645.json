Sheppard\u2019s notice of appeal has been construed as a request for a certificate of probable cause. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 22(b). We GRANT certification, affirm in part, and vacate and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-23\">According to the allegations in his pleadings, Sheppard was released on parole in 1982. At that time, he was ordered to pay $43 per month in parole supervision fees. He complied in part with this requirement, paying a total of $1,386, before his parole was revoked, in part for failure fully to comply with the fee requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-24\">Sheppard filed this suit as a civil rights complaint under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. He sought a declaration that the statute authorizing payment of parole supervision fees was applied to him in violation of the ex post facto clause of the constitution. He also sought monetary damages. The district court dismissed the case without prejudice. It held that, to the extent Sheppard\u2019s allegations challenged his present confinement, they should be pursued in ha-beas corpus proceedings, with the concomitant exhaustion of state remedies. It further held that Sheppard's civil rights allegations were premature and must await adjudication of his habeas corpus claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>In <em>Murray v. Phelps, </em>No. 88-3302 (5th Cir. Feb. 3, 1989) 867 F.2d 1426 (table) (unpublished), a copy of which we append to this order, this Court remanded a civil rights suit to the district court for a determination whether Louisiana\u2019s parole supervision fees were applied to appellant Murray in violation of the ex post facto clause. In that case, we noted that Murray\u2019s present confinement was not due to a violation of that parole condition. <em>Murray, </em>slip p. 2 n. 1. Sheppard\u2019s case differs from Murray\u2019s in a critical way. Sheppard\u2019s parole was revoked, at least in part, for failure to pay the supervision fees. Although Sheppard does not seek release from prison, a determination that the fees were improper would necessarily undermine the validity of his parole revocation proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">In <em>Serio v. Members of Louisiana State Board of Pardons, </em>821 F.2d 1112, 1117-19 (5th Cir.1987), we reiterated that, where a prisoner\u2019s civil rights allegations impinge in part on the validity of his current confinement, he must initially seek relief through habeas corpus proceedings. The district court in this case correctly determined that Sheppard\u2019s allegations concerning the parole supervision fees must first be pursued under habeas corpus, with exhaustion of state remedies. The district court also correctly noted that, under <em>Serio, </em>Sheppard\u2019s civil rights allegations were premature. However, the district court did not make a determination that dismissal without prejudice would not adversely affect those civil rights claims. <em>See id. </em>at 1120-21. In view of Louisiana\u2019s one-year prescriptive period for civil rights claims, <em>see Freeze v. Griffith, </em>849 F.2d 172, 175 (5th Cir.1988), the current dismissal, even without prejudice, might preclude a later civil rights action.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal without prejudice of Sheppard\u2019s habeas corpus claims. We vacate and remand the dismissal of his civil rights claims for a determination whether they should be dismissed without prejudice or stayed pending exhaustion of habeas corpus remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">CERTIFICATE OF PROBABLE CAUSE GRANTED AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">APPENDIX I</p>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">In the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</p>\n<p id=\"b860-11\">Robert H. Murray, Plaintiff-Appellant, v. C. Paul Phelps, Secretary, Department of Corrections, et al., Defendants-Appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-14\">No. 88-3302</p>\n<p id=\"b860-15\">Summary Calendar</p>\n<p id=\"b860-16\">February 3, 1989</p>\n<p id=\"b860-17\">Appeal from the United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana (CA-88-129-A)</p>\n<p id=\"b860-18\">Before POLITZ, KING and SMITH, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-19\">PER CURIAM: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-21\">Plaintiff-Appellant Robert Murray (\u201cMurray\u201d) filed this \u00a7 1983 action, pro se, in the Federal District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana. Murray alleged that the imposition of \u201csupervision fees\u201d as a condition of his parole, pursuant to Louisiana Revised Statutes Annotated \u00a7 15:574.4(H)(15), violated the ex post facto clause of the Constitution. Plaintiff contends that application of that condition to his parole was a retroactive change in the punishment for his offense which was committed in 1976, five years before the imposition of supervision fees as a condition of parole was first authorized by Louisiana State Legislature.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>This case was referred to a United States Magistrate for a recommendation regarding the merits of plaintiff\u2019s claims. The magistrate recommended that the complaint be dismissed as frivolous. The district court adopted the report of the magistrate, dismissed plaintiff\u2019s complaint as frivolous, and denied leave to appeal in forma pauperis.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">We do not agree that plaintiff\u2019s claims are frivolous. Accordingly, plaintiff\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis is granted, the judgment of the district court is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">The magistrate\u2019s report characterizes the plaintiff\u2019s complaint as alleging only a wrongful deprivation of property and states that under the principles set forth in <em>Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527 [101 S.Ct. 1908, 68 L.Ed.2d 420] (1981), and <em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517 [104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393] (1984), there can be no violation of due process because plaintiff has an adequate remedy in state law. This rationale does not justify the dismissal of Murray\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">First, it is questionable whether plaintiff\u2019s complaint even alleges a deprivation of property without due process.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rather, the crux of plaintiff\u2019s complaint is that the Board of Paroles violated the ex post facto clause, U.S. Const, art. I, \u00a7 10, cl. 1, by applying a statute that authorized the imposition of supervision fees as a condition of parole to persons whose offenses were committed prior to the effective date of the Act. Neither the magistrate\u2019s report nor the district court\u2019s minute order addresses this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">Second, <em>Parratt </em>and <em>Hudson, </em>taken together, hold that where a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff alleges that he has been deprived of his property, without due process of law, by the negligent or intentional actions of a state officer that are <em>\u201crandom and unauthorized,\u201d </em>a tort cause of action in state law is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of due process. <em>Hudson, </em>468 U.S. at 533-35 [104 S.Ct. at 3203-05] (because a pre-deprivation hearing is not possible in such cases, a post-deprivation hearing is sufficient and state common law causes of action may meet this requirement); <em>see also Marshall v. Norwood, </em>741 F.2d 761 (5th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-12\">To the extent that plaintiff\u2019s complaint can be characterized as alleging a deprivation of property without due process, the state action here cannot be construed as \u201crandom and unauthorized.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s contention that the state officials misconstrued the Act to apply to him could be read to allege an intentional but \u201cunauthorized\u201d action within the meaning of <em>Hudson, </em>468 U.S. at 533 [104 S.Ct. at 3203]. This contention appears, however, to be erroneous. Plaintiff asserts that section 15:574.4(H)(15) applies by its plain terms only to offenses committed on or after the effective date of the Act \u2014 July 1, 1982. This provision, however, is contained in Act 762 which amended only subsection A of section 15:574.4, relating to parole eligibility. 1981 La.Sess. Law Serv. 762 (West). Act 294, not Act 762, amended subsection H which is at issue here. Act 294 does not contain a similar provision limiting the application of the Act to offenses committed on or after the effective date of the Act. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b861-13\">Thus, as the Legal Counsel of the Department of Corrections noted in response to Murray\u2019s inquiries, the Act applies to anyone who <em>received his parole </em>on or after the effective date of the Act. The imposition of supervision fees as a condition of plaintiff\u2019s parole was authorized by section 15:574.4. Therefore, <em>Parratt </em>and <em>Hudson </em>do not bar Murray\u2019s due process claim be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>cause any deprivation of property that plaintiff suffered was \u201ca result of [an] established state procedure.\u201d <em>Hudson, </em>468 U.S. at 532 [104 S.Ct. at 3203].</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">However, because the imposition of supervision fees <em>was </em>authorized, Murray could establish a violation of procedural due process only if he could show that the parole board failed to provide or follow adequate procedures in imposing the condition in his case. Murray, however, makes no such allegation. Rather, his complaint is more accurately read as challenging the constitutionality, under the ex post facto clause, of the statute that <em>authorized </em>the imposition of supervision fees as a condition of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">This issue was not addressed in the magistrate\u2019s report or by the district court. We do not think that the ex post facto clause claim is frivolous<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and remand this case to the district court for determination of that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">Specifically, the district court should determine whether the statutory authorization of conditions that may be imposed on parolees, like statutory conditions of parole <em>eligibility, </em>are a part of the punishment of a crime. <em>See Warden v. Marrero, </em>417 U.S. 653, 662-63 [94 S.Ct. 2532, 2537-38, 41 L.Ed.2d 383] (1974) (citing <em>Durant v. United States, </em>410 F.2d 687 [689], 691 (5th [1st] Cir.1969)). While we express no opinion as to the merits of plaintiffs claim, we note that this case may raise novel constitutional issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">In <em>Weaver v. Graham, </em>the Supreme Court stated that a statute may be considered retrospective \u201ceven if it alters punitive conditions outside the sentence itself.\u201d 450 U.S. 24, 32 [101 S.Ct. 960, 966, 67 L.Ed.2d 17] (1980) [1981]. A condition of parole could be construed as a punitive condition \u2014 that is, as a \u201clegal consequence\u201d attaching to the commission of a crime \u2014 in two different respects. First, a condition of parole <em>could </em>affect the length of sentence if the condition was so onerous that it was effectively impossible to meet.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Arguably, the condition at issue here could be saved from such an objection because the statute provides that the required payment will be determined with regard to the parolee\u2019s ability to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">Second, because the ex post facto clause does not apply only to sentence length, but to any <em>punishment, </em>a monetary payment\u2014 whether labeled as payment of supervision costs, as restitution, or as a fine \u2014 that flows from the commission of the underlying crime, rather than from some subsequent act of the parolee, <em>could </em>be construed as a part of the punishment of that crime because the payment is a condition of the parolee\u2019s continuing release from prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-11\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that a condition of parole is a \u201cpunitive condition,\u201d the retroactive imposition of new conditions could violate the ex post facto clause. Murray argues, for example, that when he was convicted of his offense in 1976, section 15:574.4(H) did not authorize the imposition of supervision fees as a condition of parole. Thus, while he would expect to be eligible for parole at the time provided by statute and would expect his parole to be subject to various conditions authorized by the statute, the possibility that he would be required to pay supervision fees as a condition of parole was not' a part of the punishment imposed on him in 1976. Arguably, then, application of the 1981 Act to persons receiving parole on or after July 1, 1982, \u201cchanges the legal consequences of acts completed before [the] effective date\u201d of the Act. <em>Miller v. Florida, </em>[482 U.S. 423] 107 S.Ct. 2446, 2453-54, 96 L.Ed.[2d] 351, 360 (1987); <em>Weaver, </em>450 U.S. at 31 [101 S.Ct. at 965].</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>While the conditions of parole are largely within the discretion of the parole board, this case could plausibly be distinguished from the federal parole guideline cases discussed in <em>Miller </em>[482 U.S. at 433-34], 107 S.Ct. at 2451, 96 L.Ed.[2d] at 362-63. Some courts held that the guidelines were not \u201claws\u201d within the meaning of the ex post facto clause. Here, we are clearly dealing with a specific legislative enactment rather than guidelines adopted by an agency. Second, and more importantly, some courts found that because the prior system of determining parole eligibility had been almost entirely discretionary, the adoption of \u201cprocedural guideposts\u201d for the exercise of that discretion was not necessarily detrimental to prisoners and therefore did not violate the ex post facto clause. <em>See Yamamoto v. United States Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>794 F.2d 1295 (8th Cir.1986). In this case, however, the legislature did not simply adopt guidelines to rationalize the parole board\u2019s exercise of discretion. Rather, they expressly authorized the imposition of a condition that had not previously existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Thus, it could be argued that this case more closely resembles <em>Weaver, </em>in which the Supreme Court held that Florida could not apply retroactively a statute which altered (and made more difficult) the conditions under which prisoners could earn credits towards early release for good conduct. 450 U.S. at 35-36 [101 S.Ct. at 967-68] (statute reduced automatic good-time credits while enhancing opportunities to earn credits at discretion of prison authorities).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">We have outlined some of the issues raised by Murray\u2019s complaint to provide some guidance to the district court on remand. We intimate no opinion regarding the merits of Murray\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">For the foregoing reasons, in forma pau-peris status is granted, the judgment of the district court is REVERSED and the case REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b860-6\"> Local Rule 47.5 provides: \"The publication of opinions that have no precedential value and merely decide particular cases on the basis of well-settled principles of law imposes needless expense on the public and burdens on the legal profession.\u201d Pursuant to that Rule, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b860-23\">. Plaintiffs complaint is properly captioned as an action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 rather than as a petition for habeas corpus because the revoca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>tion of his parole in 1987 was not based upon a violation of the condition of parole that he challenges here. Plaintiff does not allege that his present imprisonment is wrongful. Rather, he seeks reimbursement of the supervision fees that he paid between June of 1984 and March of 1987 and other damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b861-14\">. On appeal, plaintiff mentions procedural due process only in his \"Statement Regarding Oral Argument\u201d and not in the body of his brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b862-8\">. Although Murray's contention that the Act does not, by its terms, apply to offenses committed before July 1, 1982, is erroneous, the fact that the Act <em>does </em>apply to persons who committed their offenses before the effective date of the Act, raises a colorable constitutional claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b862-12\">. We note that few parole conditions other than required fees or payments would be susceptible to this analysis. Conditions regulating the parolee\u2019s <em>conduct </em>would probably be considered analogous to recidivist statutes which have not been found to violate the ex post facto clause. <em>See Gryger v. Burke, </em>334 U.S. 728, 732 [68 S.Ct. 1256, 1258, 92 L.Ed. 1683] (1948).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
