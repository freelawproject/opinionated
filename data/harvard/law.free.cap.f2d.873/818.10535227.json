The line of events bringing this case before us commenced in January of 1987, when Pascal J. Barone, III (the grievant-employee), was training a new employee at Container Products, Inc. (the Company). After a dispute<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> between a foreman and Barone concerning the type of work which Barone should be performing, Barone was discharged. The United Steelworkers of America and its Local 5651 (the Union), filed a grievance on Barone\u2019s behalf. The Company and the Union agreed to forego any preliminary steps and proceed directly to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-26\">The arbitrator, despite an implicit finding of just cause for dismissal, reinstated Bar-one and ordered other relief. The district court, finding that the arbitrator had exceeded his authority, vacated the portion of the award that fashioned a remedy and reimposed the discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-27\">I. ARBITRATOR\u2019S AWARD</p>\n<p id=\"b916-28\">The Company and the Union are parties to a Collective Bargaining Agreement which provides in pertinent part that \u201c[sjhould it be determined by the arbitrator that an employee has been suspended or discharged for proper cause therefor, the arbitrator shall not have jurisdiction to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>modify the degree of discipline imposed by the Company.\u201d Prior to arbitration, the parties stipulated that the issue before the arbitrator inquired into whether there was \u201cjust cause for the discharge of Pascal J. Barone, III? If not, what shall be the remedy?\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\">The arbitrator, without specifically determining the existence, <em>vel non, </em>of just or proper cause, ordered Barone reinstated without any backpay except for the crediting of seniority earned by him at the time of his discharge. The arbitrator additionally required that Barone be placed on probation for ninety work days from the date of reinstatement, and that he submit to a physical examination, at the Company\u2019s request and expense, for the purpose, <em>inter alia, </em>of revealing the use of controlled substances.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">Following the imposition of this order, the Company filed an action in federal district court seeking to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award insofar as it modified the discipline imposed by the Company. The Union counterclaimed for enforcement of the arbitrator\u2019s award. Both parties moved for summary judgment, which the district court granted in the Company\u2019s favor. The district court, reasoning that the arbitrator exceeded his authority because he modified the discipline imposed by the Company despite a finding that the Company had just or proper cause to discharge Barone, vacated the portion of the arbitrator\u2019s award fashioning a remedy, and reinstated the discharge. From this order, the Union appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">II. THE SCYLLA AND CHARYBDIS</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">It is well-settled that arbitration awards are peculiarly insulated from judicial review. \u201cBecause the parties have contracted to have disputes settled by an arbitrator chosen by them rather than by a judge, it is the arbitrator\u2019s view of the facts and of the meaning of the contract that they have agreed to accept.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Consequently, the Supreme Court long ago determined that so long \u201cas the arbitrator\u2019s award \u2018draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement,\u2019 and is not merely \u2018his own brand of industrial justice,\u2019 the award is legitimate.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Simply put, the courts have limited power to review the merits of an arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">At essence in the case <em>sub judice, </em>however, is not the merits of the award, but the jurisdiction of the arbitrator. The contract clearly states that the arbitrator has jurisdiction to alter the disciplinary action imposed by the Company <em>only </em>if the arbitrator first makes a determination that the Company did <em>not </em>have just cause to impose discipline on the employee. The issue submitted to the arbitrator reflects this situation: as a prerequisite for altering the remedy imposed, the arbitrator must determine that no just cause for the discharge existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-11\">The arbitrator did in fact alter the remedy; however, he made no clear finding as to the existence or nonexistence of just cause. Our problem, then, is whether we should infer from the result alone that the arbitrator found the prerequisites necessary for his assumption of jurisdiction. We conclude that such an approach is not warranted. Rather, an examination of the entire opinion entered by the arbitrator mandates our conclusion that the arbitrator implicitly found the existence of just cause for dismissal. Consequently, the arbitrator\u2019s alteration of the remedy imposed by the Company constituted an ultra vires act.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-12\">The Supreme Court, in United Paper-workers, has stressed that the amount of deference given to an arbitrator\u2019s determination is great.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-13\">[A]s long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority, that a court is convinced he committed serious error does not suffice to overturn his decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b917-14\">The Union would have us interpret this language to indicate that because the arbitrator\u2019s remedy can, arguably, be con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>strued as a finding of no just cause, the district court erred in holding that the arbitrator exceeded his authority. We, however, construe the Supreme Court\u2019s language as an admonition concerning the merits of the controversy rather than any jurisdictional prerequisites imposed by the arbitration agreement. We make this interpretation in light of the fact that vacation or modification of an arbitration award is clearly proper where the arbitrator has exceeded his authority.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In this case, the arbitrator has, in fact, exceeded his authority. We base this conclusion on the implicit finding of just cause for dismissal apparent from the arbitrator\u2019s order.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">Specifically, the arbitrator noted that \u201cthere was no reason for the Grievant to refuse to do the work.... The evidence is that good labor relations have existed in this plant and the Grievant\u2019s actions, words, gestures and attitude were destructive and disruptive to such good labor relations.\u201d Further, the arbitrator noted that \u201cevidence of cause for discharge ... has been presented by the Company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">Despite finding that just cause for the dismissal existed, the arbitrator imposed an alternative remedy based on the following rationale:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-6\">There is a school of thought among arbitrators that if cause is found for the discipline assessed, then that discipline may not be overturned although it may be modified. On the other hand, there is a school of thought among arbitrators that despite a showing of cause for the discipline assessed, it may well serve the interests of the parties and promote good labor relations by providing an alternative remedy.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">This language seems to indicate that the arbitrator was following a school of thought allowing either modification or revision of the remedy even in a situation where just cause had been determined. This is contrary to the contract entered into between the parties. Because just cause for dismissal was found to exist, the arbitrator had no jurisdiction to assess an alternative remedy or impose a modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-11\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b918-12\">The arbitrator in this case clearly exceeded his authority. Consequently, we affirm the district court\u2019s order vacating the remedy imposed by the arbitrator and reinstating the discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b916-18\">.

It should not be necessary for the reviewing court to sift through an ambiguous and unclear award to reach a determination of whether the jurisdictional prerequisite has been satisfied. The deference that is due an arbitration award can be said to conflict with a court\u2019s ability to vacate an award which was rendered beyond the scope of the arbitrator's power. The conflicting forces of deference to the arbitrator and respect for jurisdictional requirements are posed for conflict in a case such as this where, although we are confident that the arbitrator implicitly found just cause for dismissal, a clear and concise statement to that effect would have avoided the significant usurpation of this Court\u2019s time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"AW1\">.
