Mulligan, appellants, present two questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-6\">1. Whether the circuit court erred when it failed to apply the correct legal standard by failing to quash the non-party subpoena in this SLAPP suit where Matrixx [Initiatives, Inc., appellee] failed to show that it had filed an actionable case and that it had a legitimate need for the material sought.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-7\">2. Whether the circuit court erred when it refused to rule on Forensic Advisor\u2019s claim of the news media privilege.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">For the reasons that follow, although we agree with appellants that they are entitled to assert the \u201cnews media privilege,\u201d we also agree with the circuit court \u201cthat the deposition should go forward.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">Relevant Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">Appellant Forensic Advisors, Incorporated (\u201cFAI\u201d) is a Maryland corporation that publishes <em>The Eyeshade Report, </em>a newsletter about publicly traded companies, which is distributed to FAI\u2019s subscribers via the Internet. Appellant Timothy M. Mulligan, Esq. is the founder, president, and sole shareholder of FAI. Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. (\u201cMatrixx\u201d), a Delaware corporation, has its principal place of business in Arizona, and its stock is publicly traded on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the symbol MTXX. In the words of appellees\u2019 brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-11\">Through its subsidiary, Zicam, LLC, Matrixx produces and sells several different products under the Zicam brand, all of which are nasal applicants targeted at alleviating the symptoms and effects associated with the common cold, allergic reactions, and nasal congestion. Matrixx\u2019s stock is publicly traded ... and, as such its stock prices are negatively affected by false information and false statements published by individuals and made available to all stockhold<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>ers and potential investors through a variety of media, including the Internet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\">Over the past several years, Matrixx has been the target of a large number of negative, defamatory statements published on the Internet through message boards dedicated to stock discussions. During this time period, trading on the Matrixx stock has been unusual, characterized by relatively large-volume \u201cshort\u201d selling activity transactions which seek to capitalize on a decrease in stock price near the time that the market closes. Upon information and belief, these defamatory statements are made and coordinated by individuals engaged in illegal short-selling schemes, who are attempting to negatively affect Matrixx\u2019s stock price for their financial benefit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">In December of 2002, Matrixx filed a lawsuit in Maricopa County, Arizona.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellants are not parties to the Arizona lawsuit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> An August 2003 edition of <em>The Eyeshade Report </em>contained (in the words of appellants\u2019 brief) \u201ca detailed, 23 page report with 104 footnotes ... that expressed concerns regarding certain aspects of Matrixx\u2019s accounting and business operations.\u201d In the words of appellees\u2019 brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-7\">The [FAI] report contained a number of misleading statements regarding Matrixx\u2019s sales growth, business relations, gross profit margins, potential earnings, statutory compliance and other operational matters [and that] [s]ome of these statements bear a striking resemblance to the types of statements and information which formed the basis for Matrixx\u2019s lawsuit in Arizona.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>On October 28, 2003, Matrixx applied to the Arizona court for leave to take a foreign deposition. That application was granted, and the Arizona court issued a commission that \u201cauthorized [Maryland] to cause to be issued a subpoena duces tecum\u201d to appellants. On October 31, 2003, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County issued a subpoena to \u201cFORENSIC ADVISORS INC C/O STATUTORY AGENT, TIMOTHY M. MULLIGAN,\u201d which \u201ccommanded [that Mr. Mulligan] personally appear and ... produce [records and documents described in an attached subpoena duces tecum].\u201d According to appellants, they responded to this subpoena by producing \u201c383 pages of documents[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">On August 16, 2004, Matrixx petitioned the Arizona court for another commission to take a foreign deposition of Mr. Mulligan. That petition was granted, and the Arizona court issued a commission that \u201cauthorized [Maryland] to cause to be issued an amended subpoena duces tecum for the taking of the deposition of the following individual: Mr. Timothy M. Mulligan Forensic Advisors, Inc.\u201d On August 26, 2004, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County issued the following subpoena:</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">To: TIMOTHY M MULLIGAN FORENSIC ADVISORS INC 8101 CONNECTICUT AVENUE # N109 CHEVY CHASE MD 20815</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">You are commanded to personally appear and [X] produce the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">SEE ATTACHMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">At CAPITOL PROCESS SERVICES 9892 HOLLOW GLEN PLACE, SILVER SPRING,</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">MD 209100-1138</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">On Friday, the 22nd day of October, 2004 at 10:00 A.M.</p>\n<p id=\"AeN\">Attached to the subpoena was an AMENDED SUBPOENA DUCES TECUM that \u201ccommanded\u201d Mr. Mulligan to produce \u201cbooks, papers, documents, or tangible things\u201d described in the subpoena. The record shows that Mr. Mulligan was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>served with the subpoena duces tecum on September 13, 2004.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Thereafter, in a letter to Mr. Mulligan,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> appellees\u2019 counsel stated that Mr. Mulligan was \u201cserved with a Subpoena at [his] address ... on September 13, 2004 at 10:00 a.m.\u201d This letter also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-5\">Because you have been legally served with the Subpoena, you are required by law to appear for this deposition. If you do not appear, a warrant may be issued for your arrest. Please contact me regarding the deposition. We are willing to discuss with you when and where the deposition takes place, if you find this date inconvenient. But, in the absence of an agreement with us, we will expect you to appear for the deposition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">In a letter dated October 9, 2004, Mr. Mulligan responded to appellees\u2019 counsel, advising that he intended to file a protective order so that \u201cdiscovery may not be had,\u201d and asserted the following reasons why a protective order should issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjR\">1.) Neither Forensic Advisors, Inc. nor Timothy M. Mulligan were personally or properly served; 2.) The subpoena names two different entities, Timothy M. Mulligan and Forensic Advisors, Inc., without clarifying which of those two entities the plaintiff is attempting to subpoena; 3.) Neither Forensic Advisors, Inc., nor Timothy M. Mulligan ever communicated with Floyd Schneider in any manner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>prior to receipt of a subpoena from the plaintiff in this manner on November 4, 2003; 4.) If there were any communications with Floyd Schneider on or after November 4, 2003 regarding the plaintiff, it would be protected by the reporter\u2019s privilege; 5.) Neither Forensic Advisors, Inc., nor Timothy M. Mulligan has any information regarding the identities of individuals known on the Internet as \u201cveritasconari,\u201d \u201cgunnallennlies,\u201d or \u201cpainfullyblunt2004;\u201d 6.) The Sixth Amended Complaint in this action states that \u201cFloydtheoneandonly,\u201d \u201ccharlespOnzi,\u201d \u201cthetruthseekercom,\u201d are pseudonyms used by Floyd Schneider; 7.) Neither Forensic Advisors, Inc. nor Timothy M. Mulligan has ever communicated with anyone representing themselves as \u201cveritsconari,\u201d \u201cFloydtheoneandonly,\u201d \u201ccharlesOponzi,\u201d \u201cthetruthseeker,\u201d \u201cgunnallenlies,\u201d or \u201cpainfullyblunt2004;\u201d [8].) Information regarding the identity(ies) of any source(s) for Forensic Advisors, Inc. concerning the plaintiff is protected by the reporter\u2019s privilege; [9].) Information regarding the subscriber/distribution list of Forensic Advisors, Inc. is a protected trade secret; [10].) Neither Forensic Advisors, Inc. nor Timothy M. Mulligan has any information regarding the short sale positions of any third party and, even if it did, such information is not relevant in a defamation action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Mr. Mulligan\u2019s letter concluded with a request that he be provided in writing with whatever \u201cbasis [appellees] have as to why a Motion for Protective Order should not be filed[.]\u201d In a letter dated October 14, 2004, appellees\u2019 counsel addressed each of Mr. Mulligan\u2019s issues.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On November 1, 2004, in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (circuit court), appellants filed a motion entitled NON-PARTY DEPONENTS, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>FORENSIC ADVISORS, INC.\u2019S AND TIMOTHY M. MULLIGAN\u2019S, MOTION FOR A PROTECTIVE ORDER THAT A DEPOSITION NOT BE HAD AND TO QUASH A SUBPOENA DUCES TECUM. Thereafter, Mr. Mulligan filed an affidavit stating that (1) \u201ctwo customers have told me that they will drop their subscriptions if the fact that they are subscribers is revealed to anyone[,]\u201d (2) because some of FAI\u2019s customers are \u201csources\u201d of the information provided in <em>The Eyeshade Report, </em>disclosure of FAI\u2019s customer list would create a substantial likelihood that the customer/sources would no longer be willing to provide information, and (3) if he were compelled to reveal confidential and/or privileged information, he was \u201crelatively sure that [he] will lose what is an important source of income to [him].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">On January 18, 2005, the Honorable Eric M. Johnson held a hearing on appellants\u2019 Motion for Protective Order. During that hearing, Mr. Mulligan presented the following arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-6\">We would move for a protective order based on the fact that A) we were not served; B) the subpoena is defective because it names two different but related entities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-8\">[W]e also request a protective order based on the fact that we\u2019re entitled to the news media privilege, as well as the fact that our customer list is [confidential].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-10\">I believe ... that the underlying law suit is really a [meritless] SLAPP suit. It\u2019s an acronym that stands for Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation. And the Maryland legislature just recognized last fall, how burdensome and harassing these kinds of lawsuits can be when they passed Section 5-807 of the Court and Judicial [Proceedings] article. So, not only do I contend that Forensic Advisors is subject to the news media privilege, but the underlying lawsuit is [meritless]. And if an underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>lawsuit is [meritless], ... there is no ... right to conduct discovery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">The response of appellees\u2019 counsel included the following comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-5\">Your Honor, we simply want to take this gentleman\u2019s deposition. As the Court observed, there is a host of information in the public domain already, put there by Mr. Mulligan in his report that we\u2019re entitled to take his deposition on. What Mr. Mulligan would like the Court to do is to rule that he is not subject to discovery at all. In other words, a preclusive protective order that his deposition may not be taken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-6\">As we pointed out in our papers, there is a wealth of information that Mr. Mulligan put in his <em>[EyeShade </em>] report that is relevant to this Arizona litigation, which is still pending by the way, has not been dismissed.... We have an active litigation in Arizona. We have a commission to take the deposition of Mr. Mulligan. Maryland is a member to the compact providing for subpoena of witnesses and depositions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-7\">* * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-8\">He is subject to discovery, and this is a simple deposition. This is not an effort to harass him or his subscribers. My client has agreed to enter into a protective order if necessary. ... My client is not his competitor; [and does not] want to publish a financial report to his customers. But he is certainly subject to the normal processes of discovery. If there [are] particular issues regarding privilege that can and should be raised at a deposition, then they can and should be raised there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">After receiving evidence and argument, Judge Johnson delivered an on-the-record opinion that included the following findings and conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>[T]he questions that [appellants are] concerned about can be dealt with on a question-by-question basis. If it\u2019s not admissible or if it ought to be protected, certainly the [c]ourt can, the rule will provide [appellant] that protection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Appellants noted a timely appeal. \u201cIn situations where the aggrieved appellant, challenging a trial court discovery or similar order, is not a party to the underlying litigation in the trial court, ... Maryland law permits the aggrieved appellant to appeal the order because, analytically, it is a final judgment with respect to that appellant.\u201d <em>St. Joseph Medical Center, Inc. v. Cardiac Surgery Associates, P.A., et al., </em>392 Md. 75, 90, 896 A.2d 304 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">When it is necessary to obtain the testimony of a person who lives in Maryland, parties to litigation in a sister state have the very same rights as parties to litigation in a Maryland court. Md.Code Ann., Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud. Proc. \u00a7 9-401 (Lexis-Nexis 2006). Md. Rule 2-511 permits the use of a subpoena \u201cto compel a nonparty ... to attend, give testimony, and produce and permit inspection and copying of designated documents or other tangible things at a deposition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">Maryland Rule 2-403 provides the circuit court with authority to issue an order that will \u201cprotect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense\u201d of discovery.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The person seeking a protective order \u201chas the burden of making a particular and specific demonstration of fact, as distinguished from general, conclusory statements, revealing some injustice, prejudice, or consequential harm that will result if protection is denied.\u201d <em>Tanis v. Crocker, </em>110 Md.App. 559, 574, 678 A.2d 88 (1996). Even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>the court agrees that some protection is necessary, a protective order \u201cis not a blanket authorization for the court to prohibit disclosure of information whenever it deems it advisable to do so, but is rather a grant of power to impose conditions on discovery in order to prevent injury, harassment, or abuse of the court\u2019s processes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575, 678 A.2d 88</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\"> Appellants argue that this Court should order that the subpoenas be quashed by applying the holding of <em>Katz v. Batavia Marine, </em>984 F.2d 422 (Fed.Cir.1993). Under <em>Katz, </em>when the party who objects to discovery makes a <em>\u201cprima facia </em>showing that the information sought is burdensome and not relevant, the burden shifts to the party seeking the information to demonstrate that the requests are relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 424. According to appellants, this \u201cburden shifting analysis\u201d should also be applied to the issues of whether the information sought is \u201cconfidential,\u201d and/or entitled to \u201ctrade secret\u201d protection. Appellants\u2019 suggested approach is inconsistent with the proposition that Maryland\u2019s discovery rules</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-6\">are broad and comprehensive in scope, and were deliberately designed so to be.... If all of the parties have knowledge of all of the relevant, pertinent and non-privileged facts, or the knowledge of the existence or whereabouts of such facts, the parties should be able properly to prepare their claims and defenses, thereby advancing the sound and expeditious administration of justice. In order to accomplish the above purposes, the discovery rules are to be liberally construed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-7\"><em>Balto. Transit v. Mezzanotti, </em>227 Md. 8, 13, 174 A.2d 768 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">Moreover, even assuming that appellants have made a <em>prima facie </em>showing, they are simply not entitled to the over-broad relief that they requested from the circuit court. \u201cGiven the liberality with which discovery rules are to be construed in Maryland,\u201d <em>Tanis, </em>110 Md.App. at 575, 678 A.2d 88, appellants are not entitled to quash a subpoena on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>ground that the subpoena calls for the production of a few documents that are entitled to protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Appellants also argue that the subpoenas should be quashed because the \u201cunderlying lawsuit is a meritless SLAPP suit,\u201d and SLAPP suits are against Maryland public policy.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> According to appellants, the \u201ccircuit court\u2019s ruling circumvents the purpose of section 5-807 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings article.\u201d Arizona law, however, is applicable to appellees\u2019 lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Moreover, the Arizona lawsuit was filed on December 12, 2002. C.J. \u00a7 5-807, which took effect on October 1, 2004, expressly provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-7\">this Act shall be construed to apply only prospectively and may not be applied or interpreted to have any effect on or application to any cause of action arising before the effective date of this Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">Appellants also argue that (in the words of their brief) \u201cit is contrary to the public policy of Maryland to recognize libel judgments obtained in foreign jurisdictions whose laws regarding defamation do not comport with Maryland\u2019s.\u201d For this proposition, appellants rely on <em>Telnikoff v. Matusevitch, </em>347 Md. 561, 702 A.2d 230 (1997), which involved a judgment entered in England and the issue of comity. <em>Id. </em>at 574, 702 A.2d 230. The <em>Telnikoff </em>Court expressly stated that \u201c[t]he public policy exception, among other things, distinguishes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>recognition of foreign judgments from the recognition of judgments rendered by other jurisdictions within the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 577 n. 13, 702 A.2d 230. If there is a reason why a Maryland court would not be required to give \u201cfull faith and credit\u201d to a libel judgment entered in the Superior Court of Arizona for Maricopa County, appellants have yet to provide one.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Appellants now argue that the Complaint filed by Matrixx in the Arizona litigation is legally deficient and subject to dismissal on the ground that none of the three counts asserted states a claim upon which relief can be granted. This argument, however, was not presented to Judge Johnson, and we decline to exercise our discretion to consider it at this point in time.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Appellants argue that Judge Johnson erred when he refused to rule on the issue of whether the news media privilege could be asserted by Mr. Mulligan during his deposition.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although we are not persuaded that Judge Johnson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>erred or abused his discretion in concluding that the privilege issues should not be decided in a vacuum, for the guidance of the parties we shall address the issue of whether Mr. Mulligan is entitled to assert the news media privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Neither the Court of Appeals nor this Court has been asked to determine whether a financial newsletter is entitled to the protection of the news media privilege. In <em>Deltec v. Dun &amp; Bradstreet, </em>187 F.Supp. 788 (N.D.Ohio 1960), the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio held that, although a financial newsletter was a \u201cperiodical\u201d as that term was defined in Ohio\u2019s news media privilege statute, the newsletter was not entitled to assert the news media privilege. The basis for this holding, however, was that the Ohio statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>expressly limited the \u201csource of information\u201d privilege to persons \u201cengaged in the work of, or connected with, or employed by any newspaper or any press association.\u201d <em>Deltec </em>does not support the argument that financial newsletters are not part of the news media.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">We are persuaded that <em>The Eyeshade Report </em>satisfies the definition of \u201cnews media,\u201d as that term is defined in C.J. \u00a7 9-112(a)(9). This conclusion is consistent with <em>Summit Technology v. Healthcare Capital, </em>141 F.R.D. 381 (D.Mass.1992), which involved the question of whether a non-party deponent should be compelled to answer deposition questions regarding the sources of information he used to prepare a financial report that was the subject of a defamation action. In <em>Summit, </em>applying Massachusetts\u2019 common law principles, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts held that, \u201con the record presently before the Court,\u201d the appellant was not entitled to the identity of the deponent\u2019s sources. <em>Id. </em>at 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Proceedings on Remand</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">We affirm Judge Johnson\u2019s ruling that Mr. Mulligan\u2019s deposition \u201cgo forward,\u201d because it is clear that the subpoenas issued to appellants seek much more information than is subject to protection under the statute. As Judge Johnson stated, \u201cthe questions that [appellants are] concerned about can be dealt with on a question-by-question basis. If ... [someone\u2019s identity or some privileged information] ought to be protected, certainly the [e]ourt can ... provide [appellant] that protection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">Although this Court does not issue advisory opinions, and shall not direct that a yet-to-arise discovery dispute be resolved in a particular way, we are persuaded that it would be helpful to paraphrase what this Court stated in <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Hartley, </em>150 Md.App. 581, 603, 822 A.2d 537 (2003):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-9\">Our conclusion that [Mr. Mulligan is a] compellable [deponent] does not mean that the Shield Law will be inapplicable to every question that [he] might be asked at the [deposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>tion]. [Appellees\u2019] right to meaningful [discovery] is not a license to acquire information protected by [C.J.] \u00a7 9-112[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Appellants\u2019 discovery obligations shall be controlled by the applicable provisions of the Maryland Rules of Procedure and the Maryland Discovery Guidelines. During Mr. Mulligan\u2019s deposition, assertions of privilege shall be governed by Guideline 6, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-6\">Where a claim of privilege is asserted during a deposition and information is not provided on the basis of such assertion:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-7\">(a) The attorney asserting the privilege shall identify during the deposition the nature of the privilege (including work product) which is being claimed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-8\">(b) The following information shall be provided during the deposition at the time the privilege is asserted, if sought, unless divulgence of such information would cause disclosure of the allegedly privileged information:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-9\">(1) For oral communications:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-10\">(1) the name of the person making the communication and the names of the persons present while the communication was made and, where not apparent, the relationship of the persons present to the person making the communications;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-11\">(11) the date and place of the communication; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq1\">(in) the general subject matter of the communication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-12\">(2) For documents, to the extent the information is readily obtainable from the witness being deposed or otherwise;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-13\">(i) the type of document, e.g., letter or memorandum;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-14\">(ii) the general subject matter of the document;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-15\">(iii) the date of the document; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-16\">(iv) such other information as is sufficient to identify the document for a subpoena duces tecum, including, where appropriate, the author, addressee, and any other recipient of the document, and where not apparent, the relationship of the author, addressee, and any other recipient to each other;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>(3) Objection on the ground of privilege asserted during a deposition may be amplified by the objector subsequent to the deposition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-5\">(c) After a claim of privilege has been asserted, the attorney seeking disclosure should have reasonable latitude during the deposition to question the witness to establish other relevant information concerning the assertion of privilege, including (i) the applicability of the particular privilege being asserted, (ii) circumstances which may constitute an exception to the assertion of the privilege, (iii) circumstances which may result in the privilege having been waived, and (iv) circumstances which may overcome a claim of qualified privilege.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Implicit in Guideline 6, and particularly applicable to the case at bar, is the deponent\u2019s obligation to specify whether he or she is asserting an absolute privilege or a qualified privilege. During his deposition, Mr. Mulligan must specify whether he is asserting the absolute privilege for \u201csource\u201d identity, or the qualified privilege for information not disseminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">We recognize the likelihood that, before Mr. Mulligan\u2019s deposition has been completed, the parties will be requesting that the circuit court resolve the issue of whether Mr. Mulligan must answer a particular question. In order to conserve valuable judicial resources, we remind the parties that Maryland Rule 2-415(h) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-8\">Refusals to answer. When a deponent refuses to answer a question, the proponent of the question shall complete the examination to the extent practicable before filing a motion for an order compelling discovery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">We are confident that <em>all </em>of the lawyers participating in Mr. Mulligan\u2019s deposition will fulfill their roles as officers of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">ORDER DENYING MOTIONS TO QUASH AFFIRMED; CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; APPELLANTS TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b546-8\">. <em>Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v.
