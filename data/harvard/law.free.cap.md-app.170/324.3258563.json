Having been previously convicted of both driving while impaired and driving while his license was suspended, he was thereafter sentenced as a subsequent offender under \u00a7\u00a7 27-101(f)(1) and 27-101(h)(2) of the Transportation Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">On appeal, he presents two questions for review, which are set forth below largely as they appear in his brief:</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">1. Was [appellant] improperly sentenced as a subsequent offender?</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">2. Is the evidence insufficient to sustain the conviction for fleeing and eluding a police officer, and was [appellant] denied his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel because his trial attorney failed to preserve the sufficiency issue for appellate review?</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">For the reasons that follow, we hold that the evidence did not support appellant\u2019s conviction for eluding. Although his counsel failed to raise this issue below and thus preserve it for appellate review, we shall nonetheless reverse his conviction for that offense on the ground that, in faffing to do so, his attorney did not provide effective assistance of counsel for that offense. Notwithstanding our reversal of this conviction, we hold that appellant was properly sentenced as a subsequent offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The State\u2019s case began with the parties stipulating that, on the date of appellant\u2019s arrest, his license was suspended. A single witness, Officer James McGarvey of the Aberdeen Police Department, then testified for the State. He stated that, at about 7:00 p.m., on November 28, 2003, he was driving a marked patrol car on Rogers Street in Aberdeen when a gray Ford truck briefly swerved into his lane. After braking to avoid being struck by that vehicle, he moved into the truck\u2019s lane. When he was directly behind the truck, he turned on his lights and siren, radioed the truck\u2019s license plate number to the dispatcher, and followed the truck onto Route 40. After traveling for approximately a quarter of a mile, the truck pulled over.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Pulling up directly behind the truck, Officer McGarvey shined the spotlight of his patrol car on the back of the vehicle. As he got out of his patrol car, the officer observed appellant, who was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat, switch seats with the front seat passenger. After radioing for another officer, he walked over to the passenger\u2019s side of the truck and asked appellant, now ensconced in the front passenger seat, for his driver\u2019s license. Appellant responded by declaring that he \u201cwasn\u2019t driving,\u201d and, in so doing, orally emitted an \u201coverwhelming smell\u201d of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">The officer then opened the passenger side door of the truck and asked appellant to get out. When he did, the officer observed that appellant had \u201cpoor balance;\u201d \u201ccouldn\u2019t stand on his own;\u201d and \u201chad to put his hands up against the truck for support.\u201d The officer further noted that appellant\u2019s eyes were \u201cglassy and bloodshot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">Officer McGarvey then asked appellant to perform three field sobriety tests. He refused and again insisted that he had not been driving the truck. The officer placed appellant under arrest and transported him to the Aberdeen Police Department. Walking from the patrol car to the police station, appellant was \u201cunsteady,\u201d had \u201cvery poor balance,\u201d and, ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>cording to the officer, needed help walking up the steps. In the station, he refused to take a Breathalyzer test.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The State\u2019s case was followed by a defense motion to dismiss all of the charges against appellant. In making that motion, defense counsel offered no argument but simply stated, \u201cYour Honor, I would make a motion as to all the charges and I would submit.\u201d It was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Defense</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Appellant called one witness to testify, David Druyor, before testifying himself. Druyor stated that, on November 28, 2003, he had driven appellant, as he often did, to and from appellant\u2019s place of work. When they arrived at appellant\u2019s home, appellant took a shower and asked Druyor to take him to WalMart to buy a television set. But Druyor\u2019s car was too small to accommodate such a large item, so they took the truck that belonged to appellant\u2019s mother. Appellant drove, with Druyor in the passenger seat and appellant\u2019s small dog between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">While appellant was driving, the dog jumped on his arm, Druyor claimed, causing the truck to swerve towards Officer McGarvey\u2019s vehicle. When, in response, the officer turned on his emergency lights, appellant asked Druyor to switch seats with him. He agreed and, after appellant stopped the truck, they changed seats. Appellant had not consumed any alcohol, Druyor asserted, either before or after getting into the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">The defense concluded with appellant\u2019s testimony. He admitted that he was driving the truck at the time he was pulled over by Officer McGarvey. But, he claimed that his dog caused him to swerve his truck. When, a few seconds later, the officer turned on his emergency lights, appellant insisted that he pulled over as soon as it was safe to do so. After stopping, he and his passenger switched seats, appellant admitted. But he denied that he had any alcohol to drink that day or that his eyes were glassy or that he needed help walking. He refused to take a Breathalyzer test because he was, in his words, \u201cupset\u201d and \u201cmad\u201d at Officer McGarvey.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>At the close of all the evidence, defense counsel said, \u201cI would make the motion [for judgment] at this time.\u201d That motion was also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">SENTENCING HEARING</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">At sentencing, the prosecutor offered into evidence State\u2019s Exhibits 1 and 2, the \u201cSubsequent Offender Notices.\u201d The exhibits were received into evidence, without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The two exhibits recited that \u201cThe following offense(s) will</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">be relied on in requesting subsequent offender treatment.\u201d Together, they presented the following information:</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b353-34\">The circuit court thereafter sentenced appellant to a term of one year\u2019s imprisonment and fined him $500 as a subsequent offender for driving while impaired; to a term of two years\u2019 imprisonment and fined him $500 as a subsequent offender for driving while his license was suspended; and to a term of one year\u2019s imprisonment and fined him $500 for eluding a uniformed police officer. After suspending the fines for both driving while his license was suspended and eluding a uniformed police officer and then ordering that all terms of imprisonment were to run consecutively, the court suspended the term of one year\u2019s imprisonment for eluding and imposed a five-year term of probation to commence with appellant\u2019s release from incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-37\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b353-38\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-39\">Appellant contends that the court erred in sentencing him as a subsequent offender because the State, he claims, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>failed to prove the existence of the requisite prior convictions. The court, he argues, should not have relied on the Subsequent Offender Notices introduced by the State because they were not competent evidence of his prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Appellant was sentenced as a subsequent offender under \u00a7 27-101 of the Transportation Article of the Maryland Code, which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">\u00a7 27-101 Penalties for misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">(c) <em>[Penalties ] </em>\u2014 $500 <em>and 2 months. </em>\u2014 Any person who is convicted of a violation of any of the provisions of the following sections of this article is subject to a fine of not more than $500 or imprisonment for not more than 2 months or both:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">(23) Except as provided in subsections (f) and (q) of this section, \u00a7 21-902(b) (\u201cDriving while impaired by alcohol\u201d);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-9\">(f) <em>Same </em>\u2014 $500 <em>and 1 year; prior conviction of \u00a7 21-902(a) \u2014</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-10\">(1) A person is subject to a f\u00edne not exceeding $500 or imprisonment not exceeding 1 year or both, if the person is convicted of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-11\">(ii) A second or subsequent violation of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-12\">2.

State, </em>324 Md. 32, 37, 595 A.2d 463 (1991). Thus, in the instant case, the State had the burden of proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, the existence of appellant\u2019s prior convictions. <em>Beverly v. State, </em>349 Md. 106, 124, 707 A.2d 91 (1998). <em>See also Sutton v. State, </em>128 Md.App. 308, 327, 738 A.2d 286 (1999); <em>Ford v. State, </em>73 Md.App. 391, 400-03, 534 A.2d 992 (1988); <em>Sullivan v. State, </em>29 Md.App. 622, 631, 349 A.2d 663 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Relying on two cases, <em>Sullivan v. State, 29 </em>Md.App. 622, 349 A.2d 663 (1976) and <em>Ford v. State, </em>73 Md.App. 391, 534 A.2d 992 (1988), appellant claims that the State failed to meet its burden of proof. But that reliance is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">In <em>Sullivan, </em>the defendant was convicted of unlawfully carrying a handgun. During sentencing, the prosecutor told the court that the defendant\u2019s \u201crecord reveal[ed]\u201d that he was currently on probation for a handgun violation. 29 Md.App. at 625, 349 A.2d 663. The trial court then sentenced the defendant as a subsequent offender. <em>Id. </em>at 628, 349 A.2d 663. Vacating that sentence, this Court held that the State failed to establish that the defendant had been previously convicted of a handgun crime, having \u201coffered no evidence whatsoever on the matter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 631, 349 A.2d 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">In <em>Ford, </em>the defendant was also charged with unlawfully carrying a handgun. As in <em>Sullivan, </em>the prosecutor, at sentencing, offered nothing more than unsubstantiated allegations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>that the defendant had been previously convicted of offenses, which he claimed rendered the defendant a \u201csubsequent offender\u201d under former Article 27, \u00a7 36B. 73 MdApp. at 402, 534 A.2d 992. Certified copies of the prior convictions, which the prosecutor claimed to have, were never offered into evidence. <em>Id. </em>Vacating that sentence, too, we explained that, \u201c[i]n those cases where we have found evidence of a prior conviction beyond a reasonable doubt, the State ha[d] substantiated that fact with some documentation or overt admission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 404, 534 A.2d 992.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">But, in marked contrast to <em>Sullivan </em>and <em>Ford, </em>the prosecutor in the instant case provided the court with more than just his personal assurances that the accused had been previously convicted of the requisite prior offenses. As previously noted, he introduced confirming Subsequent Offender Notices, which were then admitted into evidence <em>without objection.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Lest any doubt remains as to the propriety of the circuit court\u2019s reliance on subsequent offender notices, <em>Sutton v. State, </em>128 Md.App. 308, 738 A.2d 286 (1999), provides a dispositive analogue. In <em>Sutton, </em>Andre Sutton was convicted of possession of cocaine base and possession of cocaine base with the intent to distribute it. Seeking to have Sutton sentenced as a subsequent offender under former Article 27, \u00a7 286(c)(1), the State brought to the attention of the trial court a \u201cpresentence investigation report\u201d that listed Sutton\u2019s prior convictions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After considering that report without objection, the trial court sentenced Sutton as a subsequent offender. <em>Id. </em>at 327-28, 738 A.2d 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Challenging that sentence on appeal, Sutton claimed that the State, by failing to introduce certified copies of his convictions, had not met its burden of proving their existence beyond a reasonable doubt. Finding no error, we stated that \u201cthe unchallenged presentence investigation report was sufficient in itself to sustain the State\u2019s burden of proving [Sut<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>ton\u2019s] prior conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 330, 738 A.2d 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">As in <em>Sutton, </em>here, the trial court considered documentation other than certified copies of appellant\u2019s prior convictions. And, as in <em>Sutton, </em>at no time did appellant<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or his counsel object to that consideration or suggest to the court that the information in the Subsequent Offender Notices was erroneous. Hence, the State satisfied its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt appellant\u2019s prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Appellant contends that the evidence did not support his conviction for eluding because the factual predicates of that conviction \u2014 switching seats with his passenger \u2014 did not constitute eluding under \u00a7 21-904(d). That being so, he maintains that his counsel\u2019s failure to raise this issue below and thereby preserve it for appeal constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">In addressing appellant\u2019s ineffective assistance claim, the first question is whether we may address this issue on direct appeal. In that regard, we note that generally a post-conviction proceeding is the \u201cmost appropriate\u201d way to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, <em>Mosley v. State, </em>378 Md. 548, 558-59, 836 A.2d 678 (2003), because \u201cordinarily, the trial record does not illuminate the basis for the challenged acts or omissions of counsel.\u201d <em>In re Parris W., </em>363 Md. 717, 726, 770 A.2d 202 (2001). But, we may nonetheless do so, \u201cwhere the critical facts are not in dispute and the record is sufficiently developed to permit a fair evaluation of the claim, there is no need for a collateral fact-finding proceeding, and review on direct appeal may be appropriate and desirable.\u201d <em>Id.; see Mosley, </em>378 Md. at 566, 836 A.2d 678; <em>Lettley v. State, </em>358 Md. 26, 32, 746 A.2d 392 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>The \u201ccritical facts are not in dispute\u201d here: Appellant changed seats with his front seat passenger after complying with a request by a police officer to stop his vehicle. And, since this issue was fully aired at trial, \u201cthe record is sufficiently developed to permit a fair evaluation of [appellant\u2019s] claim.\u201d Hence, we conclude that \u201cthere is no need for a collateral fact-finding proceeding, and review [of appellant\u2019s claim]\u201d by this Court would \u201cbe appropriate and desirable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Appellant was convicted of eluding a uniformed police officer_under former \u00a7 21-904, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">(a) <em>\u201cVisual or audible signal\u201d </em>defined. \u2014 In this section \u201cvisual or audible signal\u201d includes a signal by hand, voice, emergency light or siren.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-7\">(b) <em>Failing to stop vehicle. </em>\u2014 If a police officer gives a visual or audible signal to stop and the police officer is in uniform, prominently displaying the police officer\u2019s badge or other insignia of office, a driver of a vehicle may not attempt to elude the police officer by willfully failing to stop the driver\u2019s vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-8\">(c) <em>Fleeing on foot. </em>\u2014 If a police officer gives a visual or audible signal to stop and the police officer is in uniform, prominently displaying the police officer\u2019s badge or other insignia of office, a driver may not attempt to elude the police officer by fleeing on foot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-9\">(d) <em>Attempting to elude police by other means. </em>\u2014 If a police officer gives a visual or audible signal to stop and the police officer is in uniform, prominently displaying the police officer\u2019s badge or other insignia of office, a driver may not attempt to elude the police officer by any other means.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-10\">(e) <em>Attempting to elude police in official police vehicles. </em>\u2014 If a police officer gives a visual or audible signal to stop and the police officer, whether or not in uniform, is in a vehicle appropriately marked as an official police vehicle, a driver of a vehicle may not attempt to elude the police officer by willfully failing to stop the driver\u2019s vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-11\">(f) <em>Fleeing on foot. </em>\u2014 If a police officer gives a visual or audible signal to stop and the police officer, whether or not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>in uniform, is in a vehicle appropriately marked as an official police vehicle, a driver of a vehicle may not attempt to elude the police officer by fleeing on foot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-5\">(g) <em>Attempting to elude by other means. </em>\u2014 If a police officer gives a visual or audible signal to stop and the police officer, whether or not in uniform, is in a vehicle appropriately marked as an official police vehicle, a driver of a vehicle may not attempt to elude the police officer by any other means.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0n\">Md.Code (1977, 2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 21-904 of the Transportation Article.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Appellant was charged under subsection (d) of \u00a7 21-904: attempting \u201cto elude uniformed police by means other than failing to stop and fleeing on foot.\u201d The elusion occurred, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>according to the State, when appellant switched seats with David Druyor, his passenger. Arguing to the jury that it should convict appellant of that offense, the State asserted: \u201cWell, his attempt to elude the police officer we know here, ladies and gentlemen, was his changing of the seats. Trying to get this witness back here in the driver\u2019s seat would be the attempt to elude the police officer.\u201d As that was the factual predicate for the \u201celuding\u201d conviction, we must now determine whether appellant\u2019s act of switching seats with his passenger, after he had already stopped his vehicle, constituted \u201celuding\u201d a police officer under \u00a7 21-904.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">\u201cThe \u2018cardinal rule\u2019 of statutory interpretation, \u2018is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mona Elec.

State\u2019s Attorney, </em>274 Md. 158, 167, 334 A.2d 107 (1975)).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Expanding on that definition, the Court of Appeals observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-7\">\u201c[t]he doctrine of ejusdem generis applies when the following conditions exist: (1) the statute contains an enumeration by specific words; (2) the members of the enumeration suggest a class; (3) the class is not exhausted by the enumeration; (4) a general reference supplementing the enumeration, usually following it; and (5) there is not clearly manifested an intent that the general term be given a broader meaning than the doctrine requires. It is generally held that the rule of ejusdem generis is merely a rule of construction and is only applicable where legislative intent or language expressing that intent is unclear.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-8\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting 2A <em>Sutherland Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 47.18, at 200 (5th ed.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">Moreover, <em>ejusdem generis </em>is to be applied \u201c \u2018more strictly in the construction of penal statutes ... since penal statutes shall be narrowly construed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 191, 634 A.2d 53 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>(quoting <em>Giant of Md., </em>274 Md. at 167-68, 334 A.2d 107). In other words, a statute, particularly one of a penal nature, will not be \u201cextend[ed] ... to cases not plainly within the language used.\u201d <em>State v. Fleming, </em>173 Md. 192, 196, 195 A. 392 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">In construing the phrase \u201celud[ing] the police officer by any other means\u201d \u201cto include only those things or persons of the same class or general nature as those specifically mentioned,\u201d the elusion must occur, as in the case of eluding by \u201cwillfully failing to stop the driver\u2019s vehicle\u201d and eluding by \u201cfleeing on foot,\u201d in response to a police officer\u2019s signal to stop. That did not occur here. In fact, appellant complied with the officer\u2019s request to stop by pulling over and stopping. And he thereafter made no effort to leave the scene in disregard of the officer\u2019s order. His action was not to flee or conceal his person or otherwise avoid contact with the officer, but only to mislead the officer into believing he was not the driver. Although he may have been attempting to evade arrest, he was not attempting to evade the police officer. And that distinction is critical. Section 21-904 prohibits eluding a \u201cpolice officer,\u201d not eluding \u201carrest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Were we to rule otherwise, as the State requests, and find that the action taken by appellant in switching seats constitutes \u201celuding\u201d a police officer, we would, in effect, be expanding \u00a7 21-904 so that its general form, unlike the specific forms set forth in the statute, covered any action taken to conceal evidence or mislead investigating officers. The statute then arguably would encompass actions to conceal evidence or alter appearance upon being stopped by police, such as hiding an open container of alcohol under a car seat, or even using a breath mint to conceal the odor of alcohol. Therefore, we hold that appellant\u2019s act of switching seats with his passenger did not constitute \u201celuding\u201d a police officer under \u00a7 21-904.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Our view of \u201celuding\u201d is apparently shared by other states. After an extensive examination of hundreds of \u201celuding\u201d cases, we were unable to find a single reported case in any state in which a defendant\u2019s conviction for \u201celuding\u201d was based on conduct similar to appellant\u2019s conduct. Instead, the cases we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>reviewed all involved an attempt to flee or avoid contact with a pursuing police officer. <em>See, e.g., Spence v. State, </em>263 Ga.App. 25, 587 S.E.2d 183 (2003) (following signal by officer\u2019s to stop, defendant ran stop sign and made left turn before stopping); <em>Brackins v. State, 249 </em>Ga.App. 788, 549 S.E.2d 775 (2001) (after officer activated lights and siren, defendant \u201csped away,\u201d drove on the wrong side of the road, drove through a yard and fence, and hit a tree); <em>State v. Miller, </em>131 Idaho 288, 955 P.2d 603 (1997) (officer turned on siren and flashing lights and defendant drove away, running a stop sign); <em>People v. Brown, </em>362 Ill.App.3d 374, 298 Ill.Dec. 273, 839 N.E.2d 596 (2005), <em>appeal denied, </em>218 Ill.2d 545, 303 Ill.Dec. 4, 850 N.E.2d 809 (2006) (officers pursued defendant driving at 70 to 80 miles per hour in a 35 miles per hour zone); <em>People v. Grayer, </em>252 Mich.App. 349, 651 N.W.2d 818 (2002) (following officer\u2019s activation of overhead lights and siren, defendant accelerated and made a sharp turn onto his property before stopping); <em>State v. Bunch, </em>180 N.J. 534, 853 A.2d 238 (2004) (officers pursued defendant who drove in excess of the speed limit, turned without signaling, failed to stop for stop signs, drove on the wrong side of the road, and drove the wrong way down a one-way street before crashing into a parked car); <em>State v. Pollack, </em>462 N.W.2d 119 (N.D., 1990) (while being escorted to a police car, defendant \u201cbroke away\u201d from the officer\u2019s grasp and ran away); <em>State v. Erdman, 422 </em>N.W.2d 808 (N.D., 1988) (officers pursued defendant in fourteen mile \u201chigh speed\u201d chase).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The next question is whether the failure of appellant\u2019s counsel to point out that switching seats does not satisfy the legal definition of \u201celuding\u201d a police officer and thereby failing to preserve this issue for appellate review constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees the right to effective assistance of counsel at a criminal trial. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 686, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). To prevail on a claim that such assistance was not accorded, the claimant must satisfy a two-pronged test: He must demonstrate that (1) his trial counsel\u2019s performance was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>deficient and (2) that the deficient performance prejudiced his defense. <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">As for the first prong \u2014 deficient performance of counsel \u2014 appellant must show \u201cthat his counsel\u2019s acts or omissions were the result of unreasonable professional judgment and that counsel\u2019s performance, given all the circumstances, fell below an objective standard of reasonableness considering prevailing professional norms.\u201d <em>Oken v. State, </em>343 Md. 256, 283, 681 A.2d 30 (1996) (citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052). To do so, he must \u201covercome the presumption that the challenged action might, under the circumstances, be considered sound trial strategy.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">There is no dispute that appellant\u2019s counsel failed to preserve the claim that the evidence did not support a conviction for eluding a uniformed police officer by failing to raise that issue. <em>Johnson v. State, </em>90 Md.App. 638, 649, 602 A.2d 255 (1992) (citing <em>Brooks v. State, </em>68 Md.App. 604, 611, 515 A.2d 225 (1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>308 Md. 382, 519 A.2d 1283 (1987))(\u201ca motion which merely asserts that evidence is insufficient to support a conviction, without specifying the deficiency, does not comply with Rule 4-324, and thus does not preserve the issue of sufficiency for appellate review\u201d); <em>see also Parker v. State, </em>72 Md.App. 610, 615, 531 A.2d 1313 (1987) (\u201c[Mjoving for judgment of acquittal on the grounds of insufficiency of the evidence, without argument, does not preserve the issue for appellate review.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">At the end of the State\u2019s case, appellant\u2019s counsel simply stated, without elaboration, \u2018Your Honor, I would make a motion as to all the charges and I would submit.\u201d Nor did he seek to remedy his error, at the conclusion of his defense, when the court directly asked, \u201cDid you make your final motion yesterday?\u201d His only response was: \u201cI would make the [same] motion at this time.\u201d Because switching seats did not constitute \u201celuding\u201d a uniformed police officer by any other means, appellant\u2019s counsel should have moved with particularity for a judgment of acquittal on that charge. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>not doing so, his actions \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d and fail the first <em>Strickland </em>prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">The State contends, however, that appellant\u2019s counsel may-have decided not to raise the issue of insufficient evidence because, even though \u201c[t\u2019jhere was sufficient evidence adduced at trial to support appellant\u2019s conviction for \u2018fleeing and eluding\u2019 under a \u2018failing to stop vehicle\u2019 theory,\u201d appellant\u2019s counsel had \u201csuccessfully persuaded\u201d the circuit court to give an \u201cother means\u201d jury instruction and not a \u201cfailing to stop vehicle\u201d jury instruction. Having done so, appellant\u2019s counsel was in \u201cno position,\u201d the State asserts, to then argue that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction on an \u201cother means\u201d theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">But the State\u2019s argument fails to take into consideration that appellant was charged with an \u201cattempt by driver to elude uniformed police by means other than failing to stop and fleeing on foot,\u201d not \u201cfailing to stop\u201d his vehicle. <em>State v. Boozer, </em>304 Md. 98, 113, 497 A.2d 1129 (1985). Consequently, the State has failed to proffer a \u201csound trial strategy\u201d that would explain why appellant\u2019s counsel did not argue that there was insufficient evidence to convict appellant of eluding by \u201cany other means.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">As for the second <em>Strickland </em>prong \u2014 the prejudice generated by counsel\u2019s deficient performance \u2014 appellant must establish that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. A \u201creasonable probability\u201d is one \u201csufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">As we have previously noted, switching seats does not constitute \u201celuding by any other means.\u201d Thus, there was \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d That is, in this appeal we would have <em>directly </em>reviewed and reversed the sufficiency of the evidence of appellant\u2019s conviction for eluding a uniformed officer. Therefore, we hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>that appellant\u2019s trial counsel failed to provide effective assistance as to that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">JUDGMENT OF CONVICTION FOR ELUDING A UNIFORMED POLICE OFFICER REVERSED; ALL OTHER JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID ONE-HALF BY APPELLANT AND ONE-HALF BY HARFORD COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b356-7\">.
