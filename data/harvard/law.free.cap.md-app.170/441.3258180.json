In this current appeal and cross-appeal we are asked to determine whether, on remand, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County properly awarded attorney\u2019s fees to Friolo, in accordance with the direction of the Court of Appeals in <em>Friolo v. Frankel, </em>373 Md. 501, 819 A.2d 354 <em>(2003)(\u201cFriolo I </em>\u201d). Moreover, we take up an issue of apparent first impression: whether counsel is entitled to be awarded fees for post-judgment litigation in which the only complaint is counsel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>dissatisfaction with the fee originally awarded by the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Frankel challenges the circuit court\u2019s fee award and presents several issues for our review, which we have distilled into:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\">Whether the circuit court\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fee award complies with the lodestar analysis set forth in <em>Friolo I.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Friolo\u2019s cross-appeal presents one issue for our review which, as slightly rephrased, is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-7\">Whether the circuit court abused its discretion by failing to award Friolo attorneys\u2019 fees for post-trial, appellate, and post-remand services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">For the reasons that follow, we shall vacate the circuit court\u2019s award and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">To provide perspective for our discussion, we recount briefly the facts giving rise to the original litigation between the parties.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">Friolo was employed by Frankel in February, 1998, as a medical biller, responsible for both billing and collection. Her employment was terminated by Frankel on April 4, 1999, based upon allegations that she had treated patients rudely. In her complaint, Friolo averred that she accepted an offer made by Frankel to all employees, of a five percent ownership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>interest in the practice if the practice was worth one million dollars by the end of 1999. The goal was to develop and expand the practice, make it more profitable, and sell it by the end of 2004. Friolo alleged that she also was to have received a percentage of the sales price.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">When she filed suit following her discharge, Friolo alleged that she worked considerable overtime hours without overtime compensation. She also claimed an agreement by which she was to receive, but did not receive, on a monthly basis, a percentage of collections. Friolo filed a ten-count complaint, sounding in: (1) breach of contract; (2) breach of an implied contract; (3) unjust enrichment; (4) fraudulent inducement; (5) violation of the Maryland Wage Payment and Collection Law, Lab. &amp; Empl. (\u201cLE\u201d) \u00a7\u00a7 3-503 and 3-505; and (6) violation of the Maryland Wage and Hour Law, LE \u00a7\u00a7 3-415 and 3-420. Counts 7 through 10 were brought on behalf of Friolo\u2019s husband, Victor Salazar, who alleged that he, too, worked for Frankel and was promised benefits similar to those promised to Friolo. Lastly, their complaint sought punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Ultimately, all of Salazar\u2019s claims were dismissed for lack of sufficient evidence. In the end, the only claims submitted to the jury were counts (1), (5), and (6). Friolo had claimed bonuses in the amount of $26,415, of which she had been paid $19,574, leaving an unpaid balance of $6,841. She also claimed entitlement to $5,237 in overtime pay. The jury returned a verdict in Friolo\u2019s favor in the amount of $11,778, representing $6,841 in bonuses and $4,937 in overtime pay. Frankel satisfied the $11,778.85 money judgment, but not the post-judgment interest, on or about October 28, 2002.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Friolo sought attorneys\u2019 fees under LE \u00a7\u00a7 3 \u2014 427(d) and 3-507.1(b) which provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-8\">\u00a7 3-427. Action against employer</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>(d) If a court determines that an employee is entitled to recovery in an action under this section, the court may allow against the employer reasonable counsel fees and other costs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-5\">\u00a7 3-507.1. Recovery of unpaid wages</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-6\">(b) If, in an action under subsection (a) of this section, a court finds that an employer withheld the wage of an employee in violation of this subtitle and not as a result of a bona fide dispute, the court may award the employee an amount not exceeding 3 times the wage, and reasonable counsel fees and other costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">On July 18, 2001, Friolo filed her first request for fees and costs, $55,012.50 in attorneys\u2019 fees, which were calculated according to the lodestar approach and reflected a 10% deduction to account for the fact that not all of Friolo\u2019s claims were successful. Frankel opposed this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">In a supplemental filing, on July 31, 2001, Friolo\u2019s counsel raised the requested amount of fees to $57,059.55. Later, on November 7, 2001, Friolo filed a second supplement to her motion for attorneys\u2019 fees, requesting $69,637.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">After hearing argument, and having considered memoranda filed by both parties, the circuit court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-10\">concluded first that attorney fee awards need to be \u201cappropriate and fair,\u201d even when \u201cpunitive.\u201d It then noted that, under the lodestar analysis, two of the factors the court must consider are the novelty and difficulty of the litigation, but it made no finding with respect to either factor. It observed that the jury had returned a verdict of $11,778, which the court said was not inappropriate, and then stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-11\">\u201cWhat the Court is going to do by way of award is considering the [lodestar] language and the record in this matter, I deem it appropriate to \u2014 this case is interesting in looking at the computations awarding 40 percent of the judgment plus the $1,500 in court costs so that comes out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>to $4,712.00 plus $l,500.00-$6,212.00 is the counsel fees and costs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-5\"><em>Friolo I, supra, </em>873 Md. at 510-11, 819 A.2d 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The circuit court\u2019s February 28, 2002 order granted Friolo\u2019s motion and directed Frankel to pay to Friolo or her counsel $4,711.00, for statutory attorneys\u2019 fees, plus $1,552.00 in costs. The court based the attorneys\u2019 fee on 40 percent of the amount of judgment. On March 26, 2002, Friolo appealed to this Court, \u201ccomplaining, in essence, that the trial court erred in failing to calculate the fees in accordance with the lodestar approach, despite what she regarded] as her \u2018high degree of success before the court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 511, 819 A.2d 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">On October 15, 2002, the Court of Appeals granted certiorari before any proceedings in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">\n<em>Proceedings Before the Court of Appeals</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">In its opinion filed on March 17, 2003, the Court of Appeals held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-10\">in actions under fee-shifting statutes, including the two at issue here \u2014 Maryland Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3-427 and 3-507.1 of the Labor and Employment Article (LE) \u2014 the lodestar approach is ordinarily the appropriate one to use in determining a reasonable counsel fee. We stress, however, that the approach we approve is broader than simply hours spent times hourly rate but also includes careful consideration of appropriate adjustments to that product, which, in almost all instances, will be case-specific. <em>Under that approach, it is necessarily incumbent upon the trial judge to give a clear explanation of the factors he or she employed in arriving at the end result.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 504-05, 819 A.2d 354 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">The Court concluded that the circuit court did not provide a clear justification for how it arrived at its determination of attorneys\u2019 fees, and remanded for \u201ca further proceeding and a better explanation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 505, 819 A.2d 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>\n<em>Proceedings on Remand</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">On remand to the circuit court, Friolo filed yet a third supplemental petition for attorneys\u2019 fees, on June 26, 2003, this time seeking a total of $127,810 in fees, to account for additional fees generated by the appeal. Frankel renewed his opposition to Friolo\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">A hearing, consisting only of argument on the already developed record, was held on Friolo\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, as well as the supplemental filings, on July 15, 2003. After taking the matter under advisement, the circuit court, on October 21, 2003, issued an opinion and order awarding attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount of $65,348.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">On October 23, 2003, Frankel filed a motion to alter or amend the fee award and a motion to stay enforcement of the judgment. Six days later Friolo moved to alter or amend the fee award judgment on the grounds that the court improperly denied fees for appellate and post-appellate services. The circuit court denied all outstanding post-trial motions on December 22, 2003. On March 18, 2005, judgment was entered in favor of Friolo in the amount of $65,348.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">Frankel and Friolo noted their timely appeals to this Court on April 5, 2005, and April 12, 2005, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">STANDARD of REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">The decision whether to allow attorneys\u2019 fees is discretionary and such \u201cdiscretion is to be exercised liberally in favor of allowing a fee.\u201d <em>Friolo I, supra, </em>373 Md. at 512, 819 A.2d 354. Where a trial court awards attorneys\u2019 fees under a fee-shifting statute, the lodestar approach must be utilized. <em>Id. </em>The setting of attorneys\u2019 fees under the lodestar approach is largely discretionary. <em>Id. </em>If, however, \u201cthe record does not support a conclusion that the trial court <em>actually used </em>that approach, there would be an error of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Upon finding that an error of law has occurred, we must remand to the trial court \u201cfor a further proceeding, in which the court can apply the lodestar approach and determine a reasonable fee.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>\n<em>Whether the circuit court\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fee award complies with the lodestar analysis set forth in Friolo I.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">In <em>Friolo I </em>the Court of Appeals adopted the lodestar approach for determining reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees under Maryland\u2019s fee-shifting statutes. <em>See Garcia v. Foulger Pratt Dev., Inc., </em>155 Md.App. 634, 672-73, 845 A.2d 16 (2003). The Court stressed, however, that this approach \u201cis broader than simply hours spent times hourly rate but also includes <em>careful consideration of appropriate adjustments </em>to that product, which, in almost all instances, will be case-specific.\u201d <em>Friolo I, supra, </em>373 Md. at 505, 819 A.2d 354 (emphasis added). Due to the case-specific nature of this approach, the Court emphasized that \u201cit is necessarily incumbent upon the trial judge to give a <em>clear explanation of the factors </em>he or she employed in arriving at the end result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Such findings are imperative \u201cso that the parties and any reviewing appellate court can follow the reasoning and test the validity of the findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 529, 819 A.2d 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Following remand to the circuit court, Friolo supplemented her petition for attorneys\u2019 fees, seeking an additional $58,172.50 to account for the work done on the first appeal. This amount, together with the $69,637.50 for trial work sought in Friolo\u2019s second supplement, brought the total request for attorneys\u2019 fees to $127,810.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">After hearing the arguments of counsel on Friolo\u2019s total request, and taking the matter under advisement, the circuit court issued its opinion and order. The opinion\u2019s \u201cdiscussion\u201d section provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-8\">Using the lodestar system, this court determined a judgment of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. The lodestar system calculates a fee by determining the number of hours expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate. This calculation provides an objective basis on which to make an \u201cinitial estimate\u201d of the value of the attorney\u2019s services. Hours that are excessive, unnecessary and redundant are excluded from calculation. The trial court may, in its discretion, eliminate specific hours or simply reduce the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>award to account for the limited success of particular parts of litigation as there is no precise rule or formula for making those determinations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The accompanying order stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-6\">ORDERED, that [Friolo\u2019s] Motion is GRANTED. [Frankel] shall forthwith pay to [Friolo] and her counsel attorneys\u2019 fees in the lodestar amount of $65,348, which was calculated by multiplying [Friolo\u2019s] counsel\u2019s reasonable hourly rate of ($295 per hour and $200 per hour) by the reasonable number of hours [Friolo\u2019s] counsel expended in connection <em>with this matter </em>(194.4 hours at an hourly rate of $295; 35 hours at an hourly rate of $200)[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>], This calculation takes into consideration the reasonable hours expended, the complexity of the litigation, the success rate of the different parts of the litigation and the uniqueness of the issues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">It is clear that the circuit court used the basic lodestar calculation \u2014 multiplying Friolo\u2019s counsel\u2019s reasonable hourly rate by the reasonable number of hours expended in connection with this case. Additionally, the court\u2019s order indicates that the attorneys\u2019 fees determination took into consideration \u201cthe reasonable hours expended, the complexity of the litigation, the success rate of the different parts of the litigation and the uniqueness of the issues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">There is, however, a noticeable absence of any clear explanation of the factors utilized by the court in awarding $65,348, as opposed to the amount requested, or any other amount. Nor is there any explanation of the substantial increase in the award of fees and costs by more than $59,000. It is also unclear whether the fee awarded included both trial and post-trial work and, if so, how the fees were apportioned. Thus, based on the circuit court\u2019s order it is difficult, if not impossible, to \u201cfollow the reasoning and test the validity of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>[court\u2019s] findings.\u201d <em>Friolo I, supra, </em>373 Md. at 529, 819 A.2d 354; <em>see also Stevenson v. Branch Banking &amp; Trust Corp., </em>159 Md.App. 620, 666, 861 A.2d 735 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">While the court indicates that it did consider several factors in making its award, without a clear <em>explanation </em>of those factors applied to the determination of the fee, the record does not support the conclusion that the circuit court <em>actually used </em>the lodestar approach as articulated by the Court of Appeals in <em>Friolo I, supra, </em>373 Md. at 505, 819 A.2d 354. Thus, we find that the court erred, as a matter of law, in its award of attorneys\u2019 fees. We shall remand this case to the circuit court for further proceedings, in which the court must apply the lodestar analysis <em>and </em>provide a clear explanation of the factors employed in arriving at its award. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Only with such an explanation will the parties, and an appellate court, be able to follow the court\u2019s reasoning, test the validity of the findings, and be assured that the court properly exercised its considerable discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">We think it significant to reiterate the words of the Court of Appeals in its conclusion to <em>Friolo I:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-8\">Parroting what we said in <em>Admiral Mortgage, Inc. [v. Cooper, </em>357 Md. 533, 745 A.2d 1026 (2000)] ... in directing ... remand, \u201cwe do not suggest that the amount of the fee awarded ... in this case was inappropriate.\u201d In addition to the other considerations that are part of the overall lodestar analysis, the court will need to consider that, with respect to the bonuses, awardable for fee-shifting purposes only under \u00a7 3-507.1, the jury made no predicate finding of a lack of a bona fide dispute. <em>It will also need to determine whether the unsuccessful claims </em>\u2014 for <em>fraud, for a 5% interest in the practice, Salazar\u2019s claims </em>\u2014 were <em>truly related to the successful ones and, if not, to disallow all time expended on those claims. </em>In considering the reasonableness of the hourly rates charged by counsel, the court is not bound to any \u201cmatrix\u201d adopted by out-of-State courts or agencies but must be guided by the nature of this case and the relevant issues it presented and by the rates or other fee arrange<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>ments common in the community for similar kinds of cases.... Finally, the court should consider and give appropriate weight to any fee agreement that may have been made between Friolo and counsels<footnotemark>[5]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 529, 819 A.2d 354 (citation omitted).

Fee-shifting statutes were instead meant \u201c \u2018to enable private parties to obtain legal help in seeking redress for injuries resulting from the actual or threatened violation of specific federal laws,\u2019 and, if plaintiffs are able to engage a lawyer \u2018based on the statutory assurance that he will be paid a \u201creasonable fee,\u201d the purpose behind the fee-shifting statute has been satisfied.\u2019 \u201d <em>Friolo I, supra, </em>373 Md. at 526, 819 A.2d 354 (quoting <em>Delaware Valley, supra, </em>478 U.S. at 565, 106 S.Ct. 3088).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Friolo cites <em>Pak v. Hoang, </em>378 Md. 315, 835 A.2d 1185 (2003), for the proposition that, under Maryland law, a prevailing party may be entitled to an award of \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees\u201d for post-judgment and appellate advocacy. However, such an award for post-judgment efforts is limited to efforts <em>directly related </em>to securing the specific relief afforded to the prevailing party. <em>Id. </em>at 336, 835 A.2d 1185.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">In <em>Pak, </em>tenants of a towmhouse filed counterclaims alleging that their landlord had breached the lease and had not returned their security deposit in violation of Md.Code Ann., Real Prop. \u00a7 8-203 (2003 Repl.Vol.).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 318, 835 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>1185.

They filed post-judgment discovery motions, to which there was no response. <em>Id. </em>The tenants then filed a motion to compel answers to interrogatories and a request for production of documents in aid of execution, which was granted by the circuit court. <em>Id. </em>In response to the landlord\u2019s failure to comply with the court\u2019s order, the tenants filed a petition for civil contempt and for appropriate relief. <em>Id. </em>Approximately two months later, the circuit court entered another order directing the landlord to fully and completely respond to the interrogatories and request for documents. <em>Id. </em>After the landlord failed to appear at a compliance review hearing, the circuit court issued a writ of body attachment for the landlord\u2019s arrest. <em>Id. </em>The landlord was arrested and released on her own recognizance. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Following a hearing on the tenants\u2019 civil contempt petition, the circuit court found the landlord in civil contempt and sanctioned her with 30 days of incarceration subject to a purge provision. <em>Id. </em>The tenants then filed a motion for supplemental award of attorney\u2019s fees to account for their post-judgment work. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">One business day before a scheduled compliance hearing, the landlord paid the original judgment and all interest then due by delivering a check to the tenants\u2019 counsel. <em>Id. </em>At the compliance hearing, the court noted that the supplemental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>attorney\u2019s fees motion was outstanding and set a final hearing on that motion. <em>Id. </em>The circuit court denied the tenants\u2019 motion for a supplemental award of attorney\u2019s fees and a final order was issued. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The Court of Appeals determined that the \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees\u201d provision contained in \u00a7 8 \u2014 203(e)(4) of the Real Property Article, a remedial statute akin to LE \u00a7\u00a7 3-427 and 3-507.1, <em>see Friolo I, supra, </em>373 Md. at 577, 819 A.2d 1030, \u201cincludes fees for post-judgment motions <em>necessitated </em>by the landlord\u2019s refusal to satisfy the judgment.\u201d <em>Pak, supra, </em>378 Md. at 329, 835 A.2d 1185. Thus, under Maryland law, \u201cthe Circuit Court has the authority to award attorney\u2019s fees earned in <em>enforcing </em>a judgment rendered under that statute and has the authority to award attorney\u2019s fees in respect to appeals <em>defending </em>any such judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 321, 835 A.2d 1185 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Unlike <em>Pak, </em>in the case <em>sub judice </em>Frankel satisfied the underlying judgment without the need for Friolo to engage in any post-judgment enforcement process. With the exception of the standard motion for new trial, the bulk of Friolo\u2019s counsel\u2019s post-trial work and <em>all </em>of their appellate work was performed, not in an effort to enforce or defend the underlying judgment, but to obtain an increased attorneys\u2019 fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Friolo also relies on a comment by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in <em>Scarborough v. Office of Personnel Mgmt., </em>723 F.2d 801, 818 n. 51 (11th Cir.1984):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGq\">When a lower court or administrative agency <em>erroneously denies </em>a fee award under a fee-authorizing statute and that decision is corrected on appeal, the prevailing party\u2019s fee award includes services performed in the appellate court,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AD8\">(emphasis added). Thus, under this approach, attorneys\u2019 fees incurred at the appellate level in order to <em>reverse an outright denial </em>of a fee petition would constitute \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d <em>Scarborough, </em>therefore, is inapposite, for there was never a denial of a fee (or costs of suit) to Friolo.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">As recounted, <em>supra, </em>the circuit court did not deny Friolo\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees, but instead awarded $4,711 on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>$11,778.85 judgment following trial, and $65,348 on remand from the Court of Appeals. We do not construe the Court of Appeals\u2019 remand as a denial of a reasonable fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Finally, we are unpersuaded by Friolo\u2019s argument that the \u201cpublic policy does not forbid, preclude or discourage an award of fees on fees.\u201d She has not, in furtherance of that proposition, directed us to any Maryland case that has sanctioned the so-called \u201cfees upon fees\u201d approach; that is, the generation of additional fees in litigating counsel\u2019s dissatisfaction with fees awarded by the trial court. The goal of fee-shifting statutes, as we have addressed, <em>supra, </em>is not to compensate attorneys at their usual rate, but to enable a plaintiff to obtain representation and to prevent defendants from avoiding responsibility for their actions. <em>Friolo I., supra, </em>373 Md. at 526, 819 A.2d 354 (quoting <em>Delaware Valley, supra, </em>478 U.S. at 565,106 S.Ct. 3088). To allow a appellant\u2019s counsel to challenge the amount of an attorneys\u2019 fee award and to be awarded additional fees for that effort would, on these facts, shift the focus away from the plaintiff and to the attorneys\u2019 poeketbook.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">In summary, what is before us \u2014 and what was before the circuit court \u2014 is a garden variety wage and hour claim for unpaid overtime dressed up to appear to be something that it is not. It is a case that might well have fallen within the jurisdiction of the District Court and been prosecuted to success in substantially less time and at substantially less cost. The quality of Friolo\u2019s (and Salazar\u2019s) claims of fraud, breach of contract, and unjust enrichment were, upon presentation of their evidence, seen to be what they were \u2014 efforts to gild the lily and to elevate an overtime wage claim to something more substantial. The suggestion that counsel is entitled to fees in excess of $125,000 in obtaining a judgment of less than $12,000, where the client has been made whole, and where the additional fees have been generated <em>only </em>by counsel\u2019s contin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>ued litigation of its dissatisfaction with the fee awarded by the circuit court, is untenable. It is, in a word, outrageous.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">We hold, therefore, that <em>Fri\u00f3lo </em>is not entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees for appellate and post-judgment services that are unrelated to (1) protecting the underlying judgment, (2) securing the specific relief afforded <em>by the trial court, </em>or (3) overturning a grossly disproportionate award, or an outright denial of attorneys\u2019 fees. As such, on remand, the circuit court must determine whether Friolo\u2019s counsel are entitled to fees, other than trial-related fees, generated for any of the above-enumerated purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">AWARD OF ATTORNEYS\u2019 FEES VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS ASSESSED TO APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b466-12\">.

The circuit court must also be mindful of the impact of Rule 1.5 of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct. As the Court of Appeals noted in <em>Friolo I, supra, </em>373 Md. at 529, 819 A.2d 354, the rule, which requires that an attorneys' fee be reasonable, \"is not inherently in conflict with fee-shifting statutes,\u201d because \"[t]here are situations in which the two can be in harmony and where appropriate adjustments to a lodestar approach can produce a fee that would be reasonable under both the rule and the statute.\u201d It is the circuit court\u2019s obligation, therefore, to ensure that the attorneys' fee award is reasonable under Rule 1.5 and LE \u00a7\u00a7 3-427 and 3-507.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b475-7\">.
